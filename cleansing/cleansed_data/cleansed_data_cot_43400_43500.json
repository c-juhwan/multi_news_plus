What's an airline to do? well, it's poised to cut about 25 % of its staff, the wall street journal reports. It also looks ready to get rid of some of its routes, including unprofitable journeys to some areas of china and flights to frankfurt. A name change could also be on the table, mashable notes. The possible changes are driven by state investor khazanah nasional bhd, which owns some 70 % of the carrier's parent company and is hoping to take the airline private, the journal notes. \" only through a complete overhaul of the company can we deliver a genuinely strong and sustainable national carrier, \" says prime minister najib razak. \" piecemeal changes will not work. \"",

The latest information follows the appearance of possible wounds on zimmerman's head in enhanced scenes of a video taken at a police station the night of the killing. Abc had reported earlier that there were no signs of injury.

Bodhi, operating under the online name menswear dog, boasts roughly 150,000 followers on instagram and 224,000 on tumblr, and 91,000 likes on facebook.

But they're going to have to shuffle their goods and services yet again, now that etsy — which went public in april — has quietly banned the sale of these items, reports the daily dot. It used to be that such items were allowed so long as they were tangible goods and did not promise efficacy. But now that's not even enough, according to the new guidelines: \" any metaphysical service that promises or suggests it will effect a physical change ( e.g., weight loss ) or other outcome ( e.g., love, revenge ) is not allowed, even if it delivers a tangible item. \" the pagan and wiccan community is claiming cultural and even religious bias, pointing to the continued sale of more-traditional prayer items such as rosaries and crosses on etsy. \" i give the example of the seller who just this week was told to change the title of her listing from ' archangel protection spell kit'to ' archangel protection prayer kit ' by an etsy rep, \" one vendor says. \" a spell and a prayer are basically the same thing, putting an intention out into the universe. \" etsy, meanwhile, responds that it simply wishes to clarify that it's not in the business of selling services, and wants to \" protect our community from business practices that prey upon vulnerable and desperate shoppers — such as those seeking a treatment for cancer or infertility. \" amazon, meanwhile, is more than happy to take the new merchants, reports quartz.

The new york times reports he's a cultural bigwig in sweden and married to one of the academy's members. But his academy connection runs deeper than that and involves funding, and so a newspaper's november expose on arnault and the 18 women who had accused him of sexual harassment and assault hit hard. The newspaper alleged incidents took place at academy-owned and -funded properties over two decades and accused arnault of leaking info on the prize winner on seven occasions. The academy cut him off and investigated via an outside law firm, but that didn't calm the internal consternation of what the local describes as a historically \" discreet \" organization: three members quit last week as an act of protest after the board voted not to boot arnault's wife, katarina frostenson, reports the bbc; she resigned thursday, the same day danius was ousted.

        "summary": "In 1954, a gas-producing plant closed near the congaree river in columbia, sc. But its presence lingers, in the form of roughly 40,000 tons of \" taffy-like \" black tar that need to be removed from the river. The state reports on a most unusual side effect of damming the river to do so: the possible recovery of confederate munitions seized and then dumped by gen. William t. Sherman's union army a century and a half ago. The state includes a list of what union troops logged as having captured from their confederate counterparts in taking the city on feb. 17, 1865: 1.2 million ball cartridges, 100,000 percussion caps, 4,000 bayonet scabbards, 3,100 sabers, 1,100 knapsacks, and more. Whatever they didn't bring with them as they marched toward north carolina they dumped in the congaree to keep it out of confederate hands. The energy company scana corp. Will facilitate the congaree cleanup, which involves exposing about 15 acres of riverbed and removing a tar cap that's, on average, 2 feet thick — along with any civil war artifacts, which a separate state article notes would belong to the state. While the company's director of environmental services says \" we don't have any direct knowledge of ordnance, \" the state points out he also didn't deny the findings of a september draft report scana commissioned that involved the use of sonar and metal detectors. That report identified 218 sites as \" exhibiting signature characteristics that could be associated with ordnance. \" though items have been documented as being salvaged in the 1930s, 1970s, and 1980s, the state's underwater archaeologist isn't expecting a mass cache to surface this time around. \" i ' m sure there will be some interesting items. I don't anticipate huge volumes, \" he says. ( an \" underwater pompeii \" was recently discovered off greece. )",

        "summary": "Steven spielberg signed on to the post in march. Just nine months later, the film chronicling the washington post's publishing of the pentagon papers in 1971 is hitting theaters at what some critics argue is the perfect time. It has a solid 85 % \" fresh \" rating from critics at rotten tomatoes, vs. 69 % from audiences. Samples: \" the post is the rare hollywood movie made not to fulfill marketing imperatives but because the filmmakers felt the subject matter had real and immediate relevance to the crisis both society and print journalism find themselves in right now, \" writes kenneth turan at the los angeles times. \" it's a risky venture that succeeds across the board, \" he adds, applauding meryl streep for the \" remarkable \" way she conveys the essence of post owner katharine graham. Stephanie zacharek says streep is \" terrific \" in \" a superhero movie for real grownups. \" it's \" a reflection of all we stand to lose if news reporting and the outlets that support it should vanish, especially in the face of a president who strives daily to crush it, \" yet \" the movie is so fleet and entertaining that you never feel you're being lectured to. \" at time, zacharek also commends visuals fitting of the 1970s. Owen gleiberman at variety thinks the visuals supply only \" some fetishistic museum-piece re-creation of the ' 70s. \" and though the film's \" warning \" about restrictions on the press \" has rarely needed to be heard as much as it does today, \" he finds it \" declares more than it reverberates. \" still, the post is a \" potently watchable \" and \" highly entertaining \" movie that benefits from the \" contentious camaraderie \" of graham and editor ben bradlee, played by tom hanks. Watching streep and hanks interact is a \" joy, \" but the post is \" meat and potatoes spielberg in the best possible way, \" writes lindsey bahr at the ap. The director \" infuses every scene with tension and life \" so he's \" able to make even a copy machine seem thrilling, \" she writes. Bahr also gives kudos to screenwriters liz hannah and josh singer for an \" always interesting \" script that \" delves into fascinating topics including the casual sexism of the time. \"",

The confirmation comes via an obituary published by isis'dabiq magazine. The obituary provides details about jihadi john — real name mohammed emwazi — as well as a photo of him without his trademark balaclava. Among the claims the article makes about emwazi is that he \" pretended to be unintelligent to trick mi5 officers, \" according to the telegraph. The article states he pretended to be dumb when stopped by authorities while attempting to travel from britain to kuwait. Later it claims he was able to travel to syria to join isis \" right under the nose of the much-overrated mi5 british intelligence agency. \" emwazi first came to international attention in august 2014 in an isis execution video, the bbc reports. He would go on to appear in multiple execution videos and was given the nickname jihadi john. Emwazi moved to britain at age 6, became a citizen, and would go on to get a degree in computer programming. According to the telegraph, the dabiq article appears to praise him for his part in the beheading videos. \" his harshness towards the kafir ( non-believers ) was manifested through deeds that enraged all the nations, religions, and factions of kafir, the entire world bearing witness to this, \" the article states. It also praises him for his \" mercy, kindness, and generosity towards the believers, \" exemplified by the time he gave a concubine to another man as a gift.",

In a facebook post accompanying a video that has since gone viral, the worland volunteer fire department explains it was called to \" an unknown type of fire \" on friday and was met with stunning blue and orange flames. But though beautiful, the blaze covering a 10,000-square-foot area resembling \" a ufo crash site \" was also highly dangerous, per the ap: a sulfur mound left over from a former sulfur plant had been ignited by the exhaust of a motorcycle, sending sulfur dioxide into the air. While water is usually a firefighter's primary line of defense, water combined with sulfur dioxide creates sulfurous acid. Fortunately, \" the fire was burning in a ' bowl ' -shaped area, allowing all runoff to be collected in the fire area. A minimal amount of water was used to cool the surface of the sulfur and reduce the temperature below the molten stage, \" the department says. A crust then formed on the surface of the sulfur, extinguishing the fire, reports the verge. Firefighters, equipped with special breathing equipment, had the blaze under control in just 20 minutes.

            "On july 7th, fire chief chris kocher at the worland, wyoming volunteer fire department received a phone call alerting him of a \"blue glow \" in a rural area off highway 20 north. As soon as he arrived onsite and looked at the blazing area through binoculars, \"i saw we had a sulfur fire, \" kocher tells the verge. The fire looked like a carpet of sparkling blue blaze. In a video posted by the fire department on facebook — which has been viewed almost 2 million times — you can see flames moving quickly across the surface, sometimes raising up into the air. It's mesmerizingly beautiful — and also really dangerous. If you breathe the smoke, it can harm your lungs and even kill you. Like a carpet of sparkling blue blaze when sulfur burns, it produces sulfur dioxide, a harmful gas that forms sulfurous acid when it comes in contact with water, including the moisture in your lungs. Sulfurous acid is related to acid rain, which can kill trees and fish. To keep safe, the firefighters at the scene were wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus, which is why in the video you can hear a darth vader-ish breathing noise ( as the washington post points out ). Putting down a sulfur fire isn't the same as dealing with a regular fire: in fact, the crew used only a small amount of water from the fire truck plus firefighting foam. That way, the temperature of the sulfur could be cooled down below 309 degrees fahrenheit — when it's in a molten stage — so that a crust formed at the surface. \"and then the fire's out, \" kocher says. The whole thing took about 20 minutes. Accidentally ignited by the exhaust of a motorcycle the sulfur mound is leftover from the texas gulf sulfur plant, which operated north of worland",
            "Worland, wyo. ( ap ) — if you ever wondered what a burning pile of sulfur looks like, the answer is like a ufo crash site or maybe a scene on another planet. Firefighters in worland, wyoming, say it wasn't a ufo but the hot exhaust of an off-road motorcycle that ignited an old pile of sulfur friday night. As seen in this video, the sulfur burned with bizarre effects: a blue carpet of flame topped by twisting orange columns of fire. The fire gave off sulfur dioxide gas and firefighters wore breathing equipment to stay safe. It happened at the former site of a sulfur plant. Worland volunteer fire department chief chris kocher says nobody was hurt or cited for causing the fire. Kocher says crews got the fire under control within 20 minutes."

            "On july 7th, fire chief chris kocher at the worland, wyoming volunteer fire department received a phone call alerting him of a \"blue glow \" in a rural area off highway 20 north. As soon as he arrived onsite and looked at the blazing area through binoculars, \"i saw we had a sulfur fire, \" kocher tells the verge. The fire looked like a carpet of sparkling blue blaze. In a video posted by the fire department on facebook — which has been viewed almost 2 million times — you can see flames moving quickly across the surface, sometimes raising up into the air. It's mesmerizingly beautiful — and also really dangerous. If you breathe the smoke, it can harm your lungs and even kill you. Like a carpet of sparkling blue blaze when sulfur burns, it produces sulfur dioxide, a harmful gas that forms sulfurous acid when it comes in contact with water, including the moisture in your lungs. Sulfurous acid is related to acid rain, which can kill trees and fish. To keep safe, the firefighters at the scene were wearing a self-contained breathing apparatus, which is why in the video you can hear a darth vader-ish breathing noise ( as the washington post points out ). Putting down a sulfur fire isn't the same as dealing with a regular fire: in fact, the crew used only a small amount of water from the fire truck plus firefighting foam. That way, the temperature of the sulfur could be cooled down below 309 degrees fahrenheit — when it's in a molten stage — so that a crust formed at the surface. \"and then the fire's out, \" kocher says. The whole thing took about 20 minutes. Accidentally ignited by the exhaust of a motorcycle the sulfur mound is leftover from the texas gulf sulfur plant, which operated north of worland",
            "Worland, wyo. ( ap ) — if you ever wondered what a burning pile of sulfur looks like, the answer is like a ufo crash site or maybe a scene on another planet. Firefighters in worland, wyoming, say it wasn't a ufo but the hot exhaust of an off-road motorcycle that ignited an old pile of sulfur friday night. As seen in this video, the sulfur burned with bizarre effects: a blue carpet of flame topped by twisting orange columns of fire. The fire gave off sulfur dioxide gas and firefighters wore breathing equipment to stay safe. It happened at the former site of a sulfur plant. Worland volunteer fire department chief chris kocher says nobody was hurt or cited for causing the fire. Kocher says crews got the fire under control within 20 minutes."

        "summary": "\" information is illegally given out by ' intelligence ' like candy, \" tweeted president trump wednesday. A new report from the wall street journal alleges some of that candy is being withheld from the president himself. Some of what's allegedly being kept from trump by us intelligence officials are the means by which intelligence was gathered. That's not entirely new: past presidents have been kept in the dark about sources and methods. The new flavor here, per the unnamed current and former officials the journal spoke with, is that those instances weren't \" motivated by a concern about a president's trustworthiness or discretion \" as they allegedly are now. Though there was friction between trump and the intelligence community before he took office, it's the president's warm regards for vladimir putin and the nature of his team's interactions with russia that have caused the misgivings, the sources say. The fear: that information could be \" leaked or compromised. \" the report was quickly rebutted by both sides, with a rep for the office of director of national intelligence plainly calling it \" not true. \" how others are responding: the conservative gateway pundit writes \" the intelligence community works for president trump. President trump does not work for the intelligence community. If the intelligence community is hiding sensitive information from president trump then they need to be released from their positions immediately and an investigation needs to take place. \" on the left, mother jones has this from its own kevin drum: \" ' inside'reporting about the intelligence community is notoriously unreliable... But just the fact that stuff like this is getting a respectful public hearing is damning all by itself. \"",

The carcass of one of the endangered porpoises, whose spanish name translates to \" little cow, \" was discovered floating near the baja california shoreline sunday in the latest blow to a rapidly diminishing population, nbc los angeles reports. The vaquita was found by the farley mowat ship, part of the sea shepherd group's conservation campaign for the marine creature. Mexican officials were called to pull the dead animal from the gulf of california, and it's now frozen and awaiting a necropsy to figure out what caused its demise. Just last week, a newborn vaquita was found washed up on a beach in northern mexico, per phys.org. While finding two of any type of animal dead within a week may not seem significant, it is when there are so few left in existence: the world wildlife fund — which calls the \" critically endangered \" vaquita the \" world's most rare marine mammal \" — points to a 2017 survey that says about 30 are left, about half the number in 2016. The vaquita often die when they get caught up and drown in fishing nets meant for the totoaba, a highly coveted fish in china that shares the same exclusive living space in the gulf of california. Rep. Tom gloria is spearheading efforts in the golden state to save the vaquita, recently introducing a bill to criminalize possessing or selling fish trapped in those waters using the special gill nets.

Halloween is the one time of year largely free from judgment. Women can go as a sexy [ insert object or occupation ]. Men can dress in drag. Couples can indulge in the saccharine sweetness of matching costumes. But then there are the people who choose to spend halloween as someone of a different race. They use blackface, brown face, yellow face or red face to bring just the right amount of authenticity to their look. Actress julianne hough stepped out in blackface over the weekend. She was attending a halloween party as crazy eyes from \"orange is the new black. \" that's fine. The show is hot this year and crazy eyes is a popular character. Hough wore the prison oranges, had her hair done up in what charitably could be considered bantu knots and wore a name tag that said \"crazy eyes. \" that should have been enough — the necessary cues were there. Hough took her costume one step further, though, dousing herself in bronzer to darken her skin so she might better resemble uzo aduba, the actress who plays crazy eyes. The blackface did nothing of the sort. It never does. Instead"

The times characterizes the rules as \" far broader than expected \": even movie popcorn, vending machine snacks, and restaurant beer will be included. The goal is to cut down on the us obesity problem, though studies have offered mixed results as to whether that effect will actually take hold. Obamacare required such labeling; the fda's 2011 proposal exempted movie theaters and didn't include booze. These final rules are meeting with mixed reaction. \" i ' m amazed. It never occurred to me that alcohol would make it in, \" says a nutritionist. ( alcoholic drinks listed in a menu or on a menu board are those affected. ) but a conservative policy researcher calls it \" a shocking power grab that ignored the plain language of the law, \" which he says was only meant for businesses like restaurants. Indeed, grocery and convenience store chains like whole foods and 7-eleven, which must follow the rules for single-serving prepared meals, are likely to fight the move, politico reports. Lawmakers who introduced legislation last year to limit the rule to chain restaurants are also expected to put up a fight.

But now a group out of the uk is reporting in the journal nature that, after looking at several years of lab-controlled procreation of the tribolium flour beetle, they've found that sexual selection — the process by which males compete for females — helps species become fitter and more resilient to disease. \" competition among males for reproduction provides a really important benefit, because it improves the genetic health of populations, \" the lead researcher at the university of east anglia says in a press release. \" sexual selection achieves this by acting as a filter to remove harmful genetic mutations, helping populations to flourish. \" such a question can be tested on this particular beetle ( a pest in many a flour bag ) because aside from their genes, the males don't help raise offspring, reports nbc news. In the lab, the scientists controlled the beetle's environments such that the only difference between populations was the strength of sexual selection, which ranged from intense — with 90 males competing for 10 females — to no sexual selection at all, where females were limited to one monogamous partner and thus males didn't have to compete. Seven years ( and 50 generations ) later, the beetles that resulted from the strongest sexual selection were in the best health and were the least likely to go extinct when inbred, reuters reports.

So how much has been used and what will happen to the rest? some $ 47.1 million has thus far been spent or budgeted, but all of the money has been generally earmarked. All spending and grants to date can be viewed here, but it's a pretty scientific read. ( for instance, $ 2.5 million is going to a university of massachusetts researcher for the \" development of aav-mediated sod1 gene silencing therapy in als. \" ) more: to frame things in layman's terms: the largest chunk — 67 %, or $ 77 million — will go to research geared toward identifying treatments or a cure. The muscle-wasting disease tends to kill patients within 5 years of diagnosis, and there's currently only one life-extending drug on the market, cnn reports. The second biggest amount, $ 23 million, will go to \" patient and community services \" to help those living with the disease. One example: the restocking and expansion of equipment loan closets with items like hoyer lifts and transport wheelchairs. The remaining $ 15 million will go to education ( $ 10 million ), fundraising ( $ 3 million ), and processing fees \" for credit card transactions and web overage charges due to increased volume of daily web visitors during the 2014 als ice bucket challenge. \" the \" 2014 \" in the previous sentence is somewhat noteworthy: the association would like there to be a 2015, 2016, and so on. The chronicle of philanthropy reported earlier this month that the association intends to relaunch the challenge in august.

The team, which also worked with the harvard school of public health, found that the 1,257 25- to 42-year-old women with moderate-to-severe pms they studied had a 40 % higher risk of hypertension over the next 20 years compared to 2,463 control women without significant premenstrual symptoms. Live science points out that those with high blood pressure have an elevated risk of heart disease and stroke. The researchers noted that the pms-high blood pressure relationship was most pronounced among women younger than 40, reports live science, though \" one important limitation is that the average age of these patients was 27 years, \" an outside researcher tells healthday. \" it would be helpful to see if this association persisted in younger women as well. \" nearly three years ago, the same university of massachusetts team found that iron may offer some protection against pms, which the mayo clinic notes can be marked by a range of symptoms, including anxiety, depression, insomnia, headache, fatigue, acne, and diarrhea.

        "summary": "The world may not have had a king kong as hollywood imagined him to be, but the next best thing was a creature called gigantopithecus that roamed 100,000 years ago. The largest ape known to man stood some 9 feet tall and weighed half a ton, gorging on fruit in what used to be semi-tropical forests of southeast asia, explains afp. As it turns out, the giant ape's demise had nothing to do with unrequited love and everything to do with its diet in a changing world, according to a new study. When the forests began turning into grasslands, gigantopithecus ran out of food, say researchers. Other apes were able to adapt by adding grass, leaves, and roots to their diet, but for reasons that remain unclear, gigantopithecus didn't make the switch. \"when during the pleistocene, more and more forested area turned into savannah landscapes, there was simply an insufficient food supply, \" says researcher herve bocherens of germany's tübingen university. \" gigantopithecus probably did not have the same ecological flexibility and possibly lacked the physiological ability to resist stress and food shortage. \" fossil records for the ape are skimpy: a post at laboratory equipment notes that it wasn't identified until 1935, and then drew quick comparisons to king kong because the movie had come out just two years prior. In the new study, researchers analyzed carbon isotopes in teeth and jaw bone fossils to conclude that the ape was a strict vegetarian that probably even shied away from bamboo.

It will be jeb bush, john kasich, and donald trump's turn on thursday night. Some highlights from cnn, the los angeles times, and the greenville news: ben carson weighed in on the antonin scalia debate, saying that if he were in president obama's shoes, he would probably nominate a supreme court replacement. \" i probably would take the opportunity to nominate someone, \" he said. \" doesn't necessarily mean that person will be acted on or confirmed. \" the retired neurosurgeon, who quipped that he has probably taken more 2am phone calls than any other candidate, also addressed the issue of a \" backdoor \" that would let the fbi access the iphone of one of the san bernardino shooters. He said that there may be good reason for \" people not to trust the government, but we're gonna have to get over that, because today we're faced with incredible threats. \" the guardian reports that donald trump, appearing at a town hall event on msnbc, took a harder line, saying it is \" disgraceful \" that apple isn't helping and the company should be forced to assist investigators. Asked whether he had experienced racism, marco rubio recalled being 7 years old during the mariel boatlift in 1980 and hearing his cuban-american parents taunted with shouts of \" why don't you go back on your boat? \" when the conversation turned to music, he said his favorite genre was electronic dance music, though when cooper asked if he had ever been to a rave, he denied it, saying, \" it's a republican primary, anderson! \" like rubio, ted cruz said he was angered by reports that obama is going to visit cuba. He attacked both rubio and trump for claiming he had lied, saying they did so to deflect attention from their own records. \" marco followed the same strategy as donald. He just screamed ' liar, liar, liar, ' \" cruz said. \" truth matters. \" in a lighter moment, he sang a few bars of \" i just called to say i love you \" and \" my darling heidi-tine, \" which he said he sings to his wife when he calls.",

            "( cnn ) marco rubio showed why he spooks democrats, while ted cruz tried to put a scare into donald trump during cnn's town hall wednesday night. The first three candidates to participate in the two-night event moderated by anderson cooper showcased their different styles of conservatism. Ben carson quoted scripture to show how faith guides his politics. Rubio, the senator from florida, told stories about the values he learned as a child. And cruz, the senator from texas, argued he's the most rock-ribbed of them all, saying he has defended conservative values throughout his private and public career.

The hunter, who has not been identified, was on a 21-day hunt that also included leopards, lions, buffalo, and rhinoceros, according to the telegraph. The chairman of zimbabwe's hunters and guides association tells the telegraph that the elephant had not been seen in the country before and it was bigger than any of the other five or six \" giant tuskers \" shot over the last year. He says the client didn't realize just how big the elephant was until it was shot, and he suggests that authorities start collaring unique elephants if they don't want hunters to shoot them.

The group's first 7-inch ep was polly wog stew, and berry left the band shortly after its release; his departure was followed by schellenbach's, and adam \" ad-rock \" horowitz came in to replace the two of them, per billboard. Berry's dad tells the ap that as the band started hitting the big time, his son simply \" wasn't up for that rigor, \" which prompted his decision to leave.

Other bands berry played in after his beastie days included even worse and big fat love. Berry's family says it's planning an autumn celebration of his life for the public.

            "Outsourcing has been a reality in the american workplace for years now, but we haven't heard of an employee outsourcing his entire job — until now. According to the bbc, a software engineer was apparently outsourcing his entire job to china by paying a fifth of his six-figure salary to a local firm in shenyang who handled his job for him. The employee reportedly did this through a \" fairly standard \" vpn connection that was set up to allow employees to work from home. The man actually mailed his rsa security token to china so that workers there could log in to his account, and on the surface it seemed as if he was performing a normal day's work.

Log analysis can reveal a lot of security mistakes and fails, but a lot of security sins, too.take for example the incident recently shared by verizon's risk team: called in by a critical infrastructure company to investigate what seemed to be a breach of its networks by the hands of chinese-based hackers, they ended up discovering a complex scam perpetrated by one of the company's most respected employees. \" we received a request from a us-based company asking for our help in understanding some anomalous activity that they were witnessing in their vpn logs. This organization had been slowly moving toward a more telecommuting oriented workforce, and they had therefore started to allow their developers to work from home on certain days. In order to accomplish this, they'd set up a fairly standard vpn concentrator approximately two years prior to our receiving their call, \" explains verizon's andrew valentine.the company started monitoring logs being generated at the vpn concentrator, and discovered an open and active vpn connection from shenyang, china, to one of their employees ' workstation. What's more, they discovered evidence of the same vpn connection being established almost every day for months before.fearing that some unknown malware was used to route traffic from a trusted internal connection to china and back - this being the only way they"

According to us news, the affected heater-cooler devices are responsible for regulating a patient's blood and organ temperature during surgery. There are around 2,000 of the devices in the us, and they're used in an estimated 60 % of the 250,000 bypass procedures carried out here each year, per the cdc. At least 28 infections have been traced back to the devices in the last year, with cases in pennsylvania, iowa, and michigan, according to the post. While the risk of this specific infection is low, especially compared to general rates of surgical infection, the cdc and fda are attempting to inform hospitals whose patients might have been affected. The post reports that in some cases years have elapsed before a patient was diagnosed with the infection, which can be fatal.

His visage was revealed at the two-week-long cambridge science festival this month, as were details about who he was: in short, a 13th-century working-class man who died in middle age, had apparently lived a life of indigence, and whose face was reconstructed by scientists based on his teeth and bones, per a cambridge press release. Context 958's skeleton, analyzed as part of the university's \" after the plague \" project, was discovered along with about 400 others between 2010 and 2012 in a medieval-era graveyard underneath one of the college's schools. The bodies, which date from the 1200s to the 1400s, came from the hospital of st. John the evangelist, which used to exist across from the cemetery. Context 958, who was found buried face-down in his burial spot, is believed to have been a few ticks older than 40 and boasted a \" robust skeleton with a lot of wear and tear, \" which means he likely had a physically challenging job, says cambridge professor john robb. However, unlike others who lived in poverty, context 958 appears to have chowed down on meat and fish, suggesting that he worked in a specialized niche that gave him access to this ample food supply. What makes the discovery of his body and others in the same demographic notable, robb says, is that it gives researchers a chance to study how the poor lived in england more than 700 years ago. \" the less money and property you had, the less likely anybody was to ever write down anything about you, \" he notes.

        "summary": "A traffic stop in new jersey over easter weekend was pretty routine — a car with tinted front windows, obstructed tags, and expired registration was impounded — until the ethics chair of the port authority of new york and new jersey turned up. Caren turner, the mother of one of the car's passengers, resigned last week, just a few days before tenafly police released a dashcam video showing the 60-year-old cursing at police officers, flashing her port authority badge, and describing herself as a \" friend of the mayor \" on the side of a highway on march 31, per npr. Turner had arrived to pick up her daughter but became enraged when officers said they weren't legally required to tell her what led to the traffic stop because those involved were adults. A police report notes turner \" was attempting to misappropriately use her professional position to gain authority, \" reports nj.com. At one point, turner called an officer \" an ass \" who had a \" smug-ass look \" on his face, per npr. When told she was free to leave, turner continued, \" you may shut the f --- up and not tell me when i may take my kid and her friends who are phd students from mit and yale. I will be talking to the chief of police and i will be speaking to the mayor, \" reports ars technica, describing the officers as \" exercising remarkable restraint. \" the port authority says turner resigned friday after learning about an investigation into possible ethics violations. \" the video speaks for itself. The conduct was indefensible, \" the agency adds, per npr. In a statement wednesday, turner said \" at no point did i violate the port authority's code of ethics or ask for special treatment for anyone involved. \" she did apologize for \" my tone toward the police officers and use of off-color language, \" per nj.com.",

        "summary": "President trump said he'd be \" very angry \" if senators fail to repeal obamacare as promised, and gop leaders have just taken a step in their quest to quell that anger. The second draft of the better care reconciliation act was released on thursday with revisions aimed at getting 50 of the senate's 52 gop votes. The congressional budget office should score the bill early next week, and next week should also see a vote. The hill's take: \" overall, [ mitch ] mcconnell appears to have shifted the revised bill toward the conservatives, without giving the moderates much of what they want. \" the ap sees \" only modest departures \" from the original. Indeed, medicaid cuts are mostly unchanged, to the likely displeasure of moderates. This means the funding that 31 states have used to expand medicaid under obamacare ends in 2024, and further cuts follow the next year. Five things that were changed: ted cruz's amendment appears, sort of. He, along with sen. Mike lee, proposed allowing insurers to offer bare-bones plans as long as those insurers also sell at least one policy that conforms to obamacare requirements. What's included is based on their version, though the ap notes it appears in brackets, meaning the language hasn't been finalized. The \" stability fund \" grows from $ 112 billion to $ 182 billion. This is the money states could dole out to help tamp down premiums and other costs. Opioids get more funding, to the tune of $ 45 billion, up from the $ 2 billion in version one. Two obamacare taxes on the wealthy are back. Currently, families earning more than $ 250,000 a year see a 3.8 % increase in their investment income tax and a 0.9 % bump in their payroll tax. The taxes had been removed in version one. Premiums could be paid for using money from pre-tax health savings accounts, an approach conservatives favor.",

In the worst-hit region, eight people were killed in a stampede as thousands of survivors stormed a government rice warehouse, the ap reports.

At such speeds the weightless research laboratory was visible for only about a third of a second before returning to the dark skies. Dylan captured the moment in byron bay, new south wales, the eastern-most point of australia, where the absence of larger towns offers low levels of light pollution. The image was taken on 30 june 2015 at 19: 54 local time with the space station flying 400 km above the pacific ocean. A conventional camera was placed behind a 2300 mm / f10 telescope and dylan took as many pictures as possible during the station's brief passage and hoped for the best. Five images of the moon taken before and after the station passed by were processed using freely available astrophotography tools to improve sharpness, a process called stacking. Lastly, the colours were enhanced to bring out the moon's colourful surface geology. This is the first picture of the station dylan has published, commenting, \"i take many types of pictures but the international space station is a wonderful target and one i've wanted to capture for a long time. \" spotting the orbital complex yourself is easier than you might think.

I got one this week and this was adjusted by 15 seconds by the time of the \"occultation \". If you think that it might be a case of sitting there with your camera and a clock, with one hand on the shutter release, you'd be absolutely correct! the iss only passed over the moon for 0.33 seconds as it shoots by quite quickly. Knowing the second it would pass i fired a \"burst \" mode of exposures then crossed my fingers and hoped it would show up in review – and it did! the setup was my canon 70d attached to the rear cell of my celestron 9.25″ telescope ( 2350mm / f10 ). The shutter speed was a quick 1/1650th of a second and iso 800 in order to freeze the iss in motion. I took about a second of further exposures on either side of the pass to stack the lunar surface detail using autostakkert2, and the increased the saturation in post to create this colour enhanced version of",
            "This image of the moon was taken by amateur photographer dylan o'donnell as the international space station passed by at 28 800 km/h. At such speeds the weightless research laboratory was visible for only about a third of a second before returning to the dark skies. Dylan captured the moment in byron bay, new south wales, the eastern-most point of australia, where the absence of larger towns offers low levels of light pollution. The image was taken on 30 june 2015 at 19: 54 local time with the space station flying 400 km above the pacific ocean. A conventional camera was placed behind a 2300 mm / f10 telescope and dylan took as many pictures as possible during the station's brief passage and hoped for the best. Five images of the moon taken before and after the station passed by were processed using freely available astrophotography tools to improve sharpness, a process called stacking. Lastly, the colours were enhanced to bring out the moon's colourful surface geology. This is the first picture of the station dylan has published, commenting, \"i take many types of pictures but the international space station is a wonderful target and one i've wanted to capture for a long time. \" spotting the orbital complex yourself is easier than you might think. It can be seen and photographed without special equipment as"

        "summary": "For years, scientists have known glacial lakes can rapidly empty themselves of billions of gallons of water — in at least one case, faster than the speed at which water flows over niagara falls. Now, they finally know how it's done. Researchers had guessed that the weight of the water caused cracks to form in the lake's icy bottoms that let water drain thousands of feet to the ice sheet's bed, but that didn't explain why some lakes cracked and others didn't. To solve the mystery, researchers arranged 16 gps units around greenland's supraglacial north lake and recorded ice movements over three summers, in 2011 to 2013, per a press release. They found that tension comes from below: movements during three lake drainages showed ice was \" jacked up \" six to 12 hours before a lake bottom cracked, lead author laura stevens tells livescience. What's happening: meltwater drains through vertical channels to the ice sheet's base, where it accumulates between the bedrock and ice sheet, causing a bulge. The bulge floats the ice sheet, placing tension on the lake bottom. Then, snap, a crack forms. \" in some ways, ice behaves like silly putty — if you push up on it slowly, it will stretch; if you do it with enough force, it will crack, \" stevens says. But volume does come into play. \" you need both conditions — tension to initiate the crack and the large volume of water to amplify it — for hydrofractures to form, \" stevens says. In the case of north lake, a hydrofracture drained 11 billion gallons of water in 90 minutes. That draining water lubricates the base of the ice sheet, allowing the sheet to move faster toward the ocean, where it \" discharges \" ice, spurring sea-level rise, per nature world news. Stevens says the research \" will help us predict more accurately how supraglacial lakes will affect ice sheet flow and sea level rise as the region warms in the future. \" ( read about what lies under the greenland ice sheet. )",

Researchers surveyed more than 70,000 danish participants over a five-year period and found that men who reported drinking 14 drinks a week and women who reported drinking nine per week were at the lowest risk ( 41 % lower for men than those who did not drink, 58 % lower for women ), cnbc reports. \" our findings suggest that alcohol drinking frequency is associated with the risk of diabetes and that consumption of alcohol over three to four weekdays is associated with the lowest risks of diabetes, \" a researcher says. The lead author adds, \" for the same total weekly amount of alcohol, spreading it out on more days is better than drinking it all together. \" overall, drinking three to four days a week was linked to a 27 % lower risk of diabetes ( men ) or 32 % lower risk ( women ) than drinking less than one day a week, livescience reports. A caveat: while wine was found to be the best choice ( the researchers hypothesize this could be because the polyphenol compounds in red wine could help with blood sugar management ), followed by beer ( for men only ), clear spirits including gin and vodka were found to be linked with an increased risk of developing diabetes for women. Of course, outside health experts are warning people to be careful and not take this study as an excuse to over-indulge. And time notes that while other studies have found a link between moderate drinking and a reduced risk, heavy drinking is known to increase diabetes risk.",

        "summary": "Most people think constrictors like boas and anacondas squeeze the air out of their prey with their muscular coils. And most people are wrong, according to a new study that offers an entirely different theory. Dickinson college researcher scott boback explains that colleague dave hardy first noticed two decades ago that the speed at which prey die in the clutches of a boa is far too quick to be from suffocation — a painful, drawn-out process, per a release. He supposed an animal's death was caused by circulatory or cardiac arrest, says boback, but there were no studies to back him up. Twenty years later, boback says his study in the journal of experimental biology proves hardy was right: boas cut off prey's blood flow to the heart, brain, and other vital organs by closing blood vessels and sending pressure in the arteries plummeting. The animals pass out in seconds and die relatively quickly, researchers say. It wasn't pleasant work coming to that conclusion. Researchers anesthetized 24 rats, put ecg electrodes and vascular catheters into their bodies to monitor heart rate and blood pressure, then watched as they were squeezed by nine boa constrictors, reports smithsonian. After six seconds, a rat's blood circulation dropped by half. \" i remember being in the room and the students were looking at the data in disbelief that it happened that fast, \" says boback. The oxygen supply was eliminated within the next minute as the rat's heartbeat began to falter. After six minutes, more than 90 % of the rats had died, likely from irreparable heart damage as their veins were crushed, though they were probably unconscious from the first seconds, boback says. \" the heart literally doesn't have enough strength to push against the pressure, \" he tells national geographic. Boback adds snakes ' quick crushing skills probably evolved to protect them from prey with sharp teeth and claws. ( snakes once had ankles. )",

The two men, part of the 341st missile wing at malmstrom air force base in montana, have had their security clearances suspended pending an investigation, nbc news and reuters report. The timing of the news was hilariously bad — it came just moments before chuck hagel was set to deliver a speech to another air force icbm unit intended to boost morale in the face of the rampant problems that have plagued america's nuclear force. Hagel's aides told him about the news, the ap reports, but hagel left it out of his speech. \" you are doing something of great importance, \" he said. \" there is no room for error — none. \" but there have been a lot of errors recently; the ap used the drug case as an opportunity to run down some of the recent snafus: in april, 19 members of one crew were deemed unfit for duty and given weeks of remedial training. In august the 341st wing — the same one now involved in the drug scandal — failed a safety inspection. Nuclear guards have twice been caught sleeping with the blast door to their control center open.

Indeed, klein points out in his column that obama is not actually proposing we end the bloodshed. \" chemical weapons account for less than 1 % \" of the more than 100,000 casualties in syria. \" it's borderline perverse to use descriptions of pain, suffering, and death to justify an intervention that would leave the cause of more than 99 % of these deaths untouched. \" among other unresolved critiques, david a. Graham points out these in the atlantic: \" if assad can't hurt americans, why is it a national-security concern? if american attacks will be so limited, will they even really make much difference, either to stop the slaughter or as a future deterrent? and if it's so important to prevent gas attacks that ' brazenly violate international law, ' why is obama so willing to conduct a punitive strike that seems to violate international law? \" many congress members of both stripes were similarly unconvinced, the los angeles times reports, including john mccain and lindsey graham, who said in a statement that obama failed to \" lay out a clearer plan to test the seriousness of the russian and syrian proposal to transfer the assad regime's chemical",

Researchers traveled to the north pacific gyre ( better known as the great pacific garbage patch ) with a question: are marine invertebrates eating plastic trash, too? livescience explains that the knowledge on the subject was fairly limited, with lab studies indicating the answer is \" yes, \" but field research having revealed only three backbone-less species known to consume it. And so researchers gathered 385 barnacles and zeroed in on their gastrointestinal tracts... And found something there. \" microplastics, \" which livescience defines as small pieces winnowed down by the elements to sizes of less than 0.2 inches. Such particles were present in 33.5 % of the barnacles'tracts; 44 % of those had more than three particles there. So what does this mean? \" the implications... Remain uncertain, \" write the study authors. They found no evidence of stomach or intestinal blockage, but the possibility exists that the particles could have an effect on barnacles ' nutrition.

        "summary": "The week got off to a rough start for president trump, but the potential of a smoother finish does exist. The house is expected to vote thursday on the gop's obamacare replacement, and trump met with party members tuesday morning in an effort to bolster support. The meeting follows what politico describes as an \" expansive series of changes \" to the bill made monday night in hopes of doing that very same thing. What you need to know about the amendment, which reportedly came at trump's behest: reuters explains the stakes: 216 gop votes are needed, which means the party can suffer only about 20 defections. There are two major camps of concerned gop parties: centrists who worry an obamacare repeal will hurt their constituents, and fierce conservatives who think the replacement isn't aggressive enough. An $ 85 billion bone was thrown to moderates, reports politico, which explains that per the amendment, that amount would be earmarked as tax credits for those ages 50 to 64, whose premiums would soar under the american health care act. For context, it gives this scenario from the congressional budget office: a 64-year-old making $ 26,500 would see what he pays explode from $ 1,700 to $ 14,600. But there's a twist, observes matthew yglesias at vox: the amendment doesn't define those tax credits, instead shifting that task to the senate. His take: \" this is a very unusual way to legislate and reflects house republicans'desperation to push through basically anything as soon as possible and pass the buck to the senate. \" also at vox, ezra klein bullets the other substantial changes: the amendment bumps up the repeal of some obamacare taxes in a concession to those who want to erase the affordable care act asap; prevents the rollover of used tax credit money into a health savings account, ostensibly because anti-abortion activists feared the money could then fund abortions; and gives more wiggle-room around how states handle medicaid. Klein's take: the \" tweaks \" are designed to win over conservatives, but don't really address the bill's \" flaws. \" more here. Axios expects \" drama \" between now and thursday night, in part because of what the amendment doesn't address. More here. As for what's next, the washington post gives context to trump's tuesday meetings: they indicate \" gop leaders and the president consider larger-scale talks with key blocs of house members to be essentially complete. The effort now turns toward persuading individual members to vote for the package. \" the ap reports on the message trump presented: pass it or",

        "summary": "Comets are basically like cats, a senior researcher at johns hopkins university tells the christian science monitor: \" they're very interesting, and they do what they want. \" that may explain that even though scientists didn't think comet c/2014 q2 ( also known as comet lovejoy ) would prove to be visible to the human eye when it was discovered back in august, it now will be to viewers in non-light-polluted areas, thanks to the unpredictability of comet brightness. Peak viewing times will be in mid-january, the monitor notes, with the comet appearing to the right of the bottom half of orion's bow on jan. 7 — the day the comet will come closest to earth at 44 million miles. There won't be an encore performance in our lifetime, either: the comet isn't scheduled to loop around this way for another 8,000 years. The comet was discovered over the summer by australian astronomer terry lovejoy, who employed nothing more than a simple backyard telescope with an 8-inch mirror, national geographic reports. The comet, a \" long-period \" object believed to be on an extended journey through the skies, likely originated from the oort cloud, a mass of orbiting ice and dust artifacts from the beginning of the solar system. Scientists weren't expecting a strong light show, but comets are notoriously touch and go, with a variety of factors affecting their ultimate brightness, including how much ice they hold, their temperature, and how close they streak past the earth. Because the comet will be ascending higher into the sky each night, skywatchers should be able to see it through the end of january, depending on location. ( last year, the hubble space telescope spotted a comet-like object with six tails. )",

Cops surrounded myers, 64, in an abandoned building yesterday afternoon, and had traded fire with him. This morning, police entered the building and myers shot a police dog. Police returned fire, killing him. Cnn adds that cops still have no motive; witnesses say myers entered a barbershop yesterday and said, \" do you remember me? \" before opening fire. He is also thought to have blown up his own home. \" this is truly an inexplicable situation; there was no apparent, rational motive to the best of our knowledge, \" said gov. Andrew cuomo earlier; he was on the scene in herkimer county. Meanwhile, the names of the four people killed in the shooting spree have emerged: harry montgomery, 68, and michael rancier, 57, were reportedly killed in the barbershop after myers spoke with people there; and worker thomas stefka and corrections department worker michael renshaw were killed at an auto shop. Myers was a former customer at the barbershop but hadn't been there in years, according to the sister of the owner, who was wounded. Just before shooting, \" he says, ' hi john, do you remember me?

The study was small ( 12 subjects who were blind before age 3 ) and needs to be replicated, but researchers say the differences caught by mri highlight how flexible the human brain is as it compensates for the absence of visual feedback. \" even in the case of being profoundly blind, the brain rewires itself... So that it can interact with the environment in a more effective manner, \" the senior author says in a news release. Follow-up research could look at people whose visual impairment at a young age was the result of brain damage to parts of the brain involved in visual processing instead of damage to the eye. Another research avenue: people blinded later in life instead of at or near birth. Gizmodo flags a 2013 study showing that sighted people who are blindfolded can learn to pick out sounds they first hadn't heard after just 90 minutes of training. Gizmodo allows the same process may not be at play, \" but it's another... Hint that our senses may be [ more ] malleable than we realize. \" ( bill cosby's attorneys say he is now legally blind. )",

Some related developments: \" jackie, \" the student who claimed to have been gang-raped at a frat party, is expected to testify as a live witness during the two-week trial, reports the charlottesville daily progress. ( the magazine retracted the article after jackie's claims began unraveling and police found no evidence it happened. ) former uva dean of students nicole eramo is suing for $ 8 million because she says writer sabrina erdely portrayed her as uncaring toward students and willing to sweep allegations under the rug. \" to win the case, eramo's lawyers will have to prove that erdely knew what she was writing about eramo was false or inaccurate but chose to print it anyway, \" notes new york magazine. The judge will allow witnesses to discuss a federal report that previously faulted uva for its investigation of sex assault cases, as well as interviews given by eramo defending the school's policy. See buzzfeed. The national organization for women hates that jackie must testify. \" it is exactly this kind of victim blaming and shaming that fosters rape culture, re-victimizes those brave enough to have come forward, and silences countless other victims, \" it says in a letter, per usa today. This isn't the only lawsuit rolling stone faces over the story; a second, from the accused frat, seeks $ 25 million. But legal experts don't think the magazine is headed toward a gawker-like fate even if it loses them. See the new york times. For reporter erdely, this has been her \" worst nightmare. \"",

Puerto rico's financial oversight board filed a debt restructuring petition in federal court wednesday, the day after several creditors sued over bond defaults, reports reuters. The island territory has been mired in economic crisis for a decade and has seen its population shrink by a tenth over that time as residents move to the mainland us. The new york times reports that the filing includes $ 74 billion in debt and $ 49 billion in pension obligations. Npr describes the process puerto rico has entered as a \" bankruptcy-like process \" tailor-made for the island, with the same underlying principles as chapter 9 protections. It's not clear how much holders of puerto rico government bonds will receive, the washington post reports, but a group representing senior bondholders described the filing as a necessary step forward. \" the move enables puerto rico to freeze numerous lawsuits, maintain essential services for its residents, and rely on a court-driven restructuring process to objectively determine respective creditors ' rights, \" the group said.

Bankruptcy may not immediately change the day-to-day lives of puerto rico's people, 45 percent of whom live in poverty, but it may lead to future cuts in pensions and worker benefits, and possibly a reduction in health and education services.

Sure, it's only in a lab; woolly mammoths haven't wandered the planet for about 4,000 years. But the effort at harvard has brought the return of the animal a tiny bit closer, the magazine notes. Researchers were able to splice mammoth genes — specifically, those coding for aspects of their hair, ears, and fat — into the dna of asian elephants. The genes came from a mammoth preserved in arctic permafrost, rt reports. \" we now have functioning elephant cells with mammoth dna in them, \" geneticist george church told the sunday times, per rt. But it's a baby step, because \" just making a dna change isn't that meaningful, \" church says. The next step is getting the cells to become specific tissues; after that, the goal would be combined mammoth-elephant embryos to be placed in artificial wombs — though developing the wombs themselves is still pie in the sky. Why do all this? one idea is to engineer hybrid elephants that can survive in colder climates, thus helping them avoid the dangers of humans and other threats. Church's work offers hope for the idea of \" de-extinction \" by genetic splicing, but that's just one method under investigation: as nbc news reported last year, other teams have been working on simply getting usable woolly mammoth dna from existing remains. We may owe it to the animals to bring them back, as the possible cause of their extinction. ( there's also a chance dogs could be responsible. )",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / updated columbus, ohio — for years, scientists have been looking for ways to bring the long-extinct woolly mammoth back to life — and although the exercise sounds like a science-fiction movie plot of \" jurassic park \" proportions, there's progress to report. The result almost certainly won't be a resurrection of the tusked behemoth exactly as it was thousands of years ago. It's more likely to be a genetically modified elephant that's adapted to the mammoth's traditionally chilly pleistocene habitat. \" if we can make one, the second one will be easier, \" harvard geneticist george church, who's spearheading a project to engineer a cold-resistant elephant, told nbc news. Church discussed the de-extinction effort this week during the sciencewriters2014 conference in columbus. Building a more mammoth-like elephant involves blending ancient mammoth dna and modern-day elephant cells, but there are at least two approaches to the task: one research team has been trying to recover intact dna from a 28,000-year-old mammoth carcass recovered from siberian permafrost. The remains appear to have been preserved well enough to retain liquid blood, but so far, the blood samples have been too degraded to provide useful genetic material, russian scientists say.",
            "Scientists at harvard university are one step closer to bringing woolly mammoths back to life, after successfully inserting some sequences of mammoth dna into an elephant genome. The study is yet to be published, though, as there is still work to do. No recreation of the ice age would be complete without large, shaggy woolly mammoths stomping across the frozen tundra. That is what george church, a professor of genetics at harvard university and his team ultimately hope to achieve once more. Taking a preserved arctic permafrost specimen of a woolly mammoth, scientists analyzed mammoth dna before reproducing exact copies of fourteen mammoth genes. \"we prioritized genes associated with cold resistance including hairiness, ear size, subcutaneous fat and, especially, hemoglobin, \" church told the sunday times. The woolly mammoth was one of the last in the line of the species that emerged in the early pliocene age some 2.5 million years ago but almost completely died 10,000 years ago. Some mammoths, however, continued to survive on wrangel island in the arctic ocean, between the chukchi sea and east siberian sea, until around 3,300 years ago. These were the specimens which researchers used for the dna analysis. The scientists inserted mammoth genes into the cells of its closest living relative, the asian elephant.

        "summary": "Edward snowden's revelations about the nsa and its surveillance tactics may have riled people up, but the agency apparently took its cue from two other government departments: the dea and the doj. For almost 10 years before 9/11 took place, the agencies secretly kept records of billions of international phone calls placed by americans, a usa today investigation has uncovered. Current and ex-officials involved in the clandestine program spoke to the newspaper ( mostly anonymously ) and say that when the surveillance was in full swing, it was collecting data for calls to more than 100 countries ( one official placed the number at 116, out of 195 countries the us recognizes worldwide as independent states ). The purpose of the data collection, per usa today: to flesh out us distribution networks for international drug cartels. The initiative took root in the ' 80s when the dea wasn't making headway using undercover agents and other methods to bust up colombian drug cartels, the newspaper reports. The call database reportedly didn't include callers ' names or even the content of the calls — instead, it noted the date and time that international numbers were called, which it then attempted to cross-link back to data from other intelligence databases. Ag eric holder is said to have halted the program in 2013 after \" it was made abundantly clear... They couldn't defend both [ the dea and nsa ] programs, \" a justice department official tells the paper; the database was also allegedly \" purged \" by the dea. A doj spokesman says the department \" is no longer collecting bulk telephony metadata from us service providers \"; a dea spokesman declined comment.

Wednesday was the sixth day in a row the cryptocurrency hit a record high, increasing its value 15 %, according to reuters. But later wednesday, the value of a bitcoin plummeted to as low as $ 9,300, the ap reports. Regardless, that's still a massive increase over the $ 1,000 value of a bitcoin at the start of the year. And the ceo of cryptocompare tells business insider the passing of $ 10,000 was a \" seminal moment \" for bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is now worth more than $ 330 billion total. The recent meteoric rise of bitcoin has brought increasing warnings of a bubble set to burst. \" even if you believe in bitcoin, the velocity of the move is a sign that it is parabolic, \" cnbc's jim cramer says. \" and parabolic moves don't last. \" it appears few people are actually using bitcoin as currency, instead stockpiling it in hopes of increasing their capital. \"what's happening right now has nothing to do with bitcoin's functionality as a currency — this is pure mania that's taken hold, \" research fellow garrick hileman tells reuters. Hileman says \" people need to be very careful \" about the coming burst. But it appears few are heeding his message. One provider signed up more than 300,000 new bitcoin users over the thanksgiving holiday. And one analyst predicts the bubble is going to get a lot bigger still — say $ 40,000 by the end of 2018.",

        "summary": "An australian sheep farmer has discovered a beast far bigger than he's ever handled — along with new clues as to how dinosaurs ended up down under. Paleontologists, together with dinosaur enthusiast/sheep farmer david elliot, say they've uncovered a new monster of a dinosaur belonging to the titanosaur subgroup of sauropods — long-necked herbivores like brontosaurus — which may have migrated to australia from south america. Experts previously thought nearly all dinosaurs reached australia through asia, reports the guardian. But one of the most complete sauropod skeletons ever found in australia — pieced together after elliot found a toe bone on his queensland property about a decade ago — says otherwise. Elliot found fossils from another known sauropod species as well; it and the savannasaurus elliottorum allowed paleontologists to complete an evolutionary analysis that suggests australia's sauropods descended from dinosaurs in south america and must've crossed antarctica during a warm spell 105 million to 100 million years ago, per national geographic. As for the defining characteristics of the 20-foot-tall, 50-foot-long savannasaurus, which roamed some 95 million years ago: stephen poropat, lead author of the report on the find in scientific reports, describes the 20-ton beast as \" a long-necked, long-legged hippo \" with wide hips, some unusually \" paper-thin \" bones in its pelvis, and a huge belly.

The scottish government, which will hold a referendum on independence from britain in september, said passing the same-sex marriage bill was an important step for equal rights and paved the way for same-sex wedding ceremonies later this year. The move was opposed by the scottish catholic church and the presbyterian church of scotland but the law will not compel religious institutions to hold ceremonies on their premises. The approval, in a vote of 105 to 18 in scotland's devolved parliament, follows similar legislation passed by the british parliament last year that allows same-sex marriage in england and wales, with the first weddings to take place from march 29.

        "summary": "Elon musk might be somewhat skittish at the prospect of artificial intelligence ( or at least at its more nefarious potential ), but that hasn't curbed his latest goal: merging human brains with computers by the time we reach the next presidential inauguration, reuters reports. In what techcrunch calls \" the most science fictional of all three of his ventures, \" the tesla and spacex ceo discussed his new company neuralink with tim urban of the wait but why blog, who comments on the \" mind-bending bigness \" of the firm's mission. That mission — which techcrunch notes may irk some investors, as musk has confirmed he ' ll spread himself a little thinner and take the ceo helm for neuralink, too — is to get a technology to market in four years'time that would create a high-bandwidth link between machines and severely injured human brains ( injuries caused by strokes or cancer lesions, for example ). Techcrunch explains that musk's literal brainchild would streamline communications between people by allowing for \" uncompressed \" signals to pass back and forth, rather than the current way we \" compress \" our thoughts into language, which the recipient then must \" decompress. \" you ' ll need a large cup of coffee and a block of free time to get through urban's lengthy post about musk's \" wizard hat, \" but urban implores people to \" wipe your brain clean of what it thinks it knows about itself and its future \" and \" jump into the vortex \" with him. \" i knew the future would be nuts but this is a whole other level, \" urban tweeted thursday while promoting his story.",
