Secretary of state rex tillerson is in south korea, where he said friday that the era of \" strategic patience \" is over and pre-emptive military action is definitely an \" option on the table, \" the bbc reports. Tillerson, speaking after a visit to the dmz that divides north and south, said that while military conflict isn't what the us wants, american forces will deliver an \" appropriate response \" if they or their south korean allies are threatened, reports the ap, which notes that previous administrations have rarely raised the option of military action \" so explicitly. \" \" if they elevate the threat of their weapons program to a level that we believe requires action, then that option's on the table, \" tillerson said, calling for china, the next country on his asia trip, to fully implement sanctions against pyongyang. A day earlier, after meeting with japan's leaders, tillerson said 20 years of diplomacy had failed and it was time to try a \" new approach \" to stop north korea's nuclear program, the washington post reports. Soon afterward, pyongyang's embassy in beijing held a press conference, vowing to continue the nuclear program and warning that \" peace and stability \" was being threatened by the us and seoul.",

Investigators narrowed the case down to four suspects — including a british doctor's brother and an ex-gang member who went to syria — but uk rapper abdel-majed abdel bary has topped the list, the new york post reports ( the independent and telegraph also say he's under investigation ). Bary, 24, is the son of a militant from egypt who's now facing charges in new york city for allegedly bombing us embassies abroad 16 years ago. More on bary: former hostages have identified him as one of the british captors dubbed \" the beatles \" ( bary is suspected of being \" john, \" while the other two are known as \" george \" and \" ringo \" ). Really a budding rapper, bary released a few videos and left his london family for syria after studying with radical islamic preacher anjem choudary. ( see one of bary's music videos here. ) he recently posted a photo of himself on twitter wearing a black balaclava and holding a severed head ( the post ran the pic, partly blurred out ). How are intelligence officials trying to find their man? apparently by matching skin tone, height, and voice tone — although experts tell cnn that matching voices is no easy task. Meanwhile, a mass will be held for foley today in his hometown of rochester, nh, the ap reports. ( another us journalist was freed after being kidnapped in turkey. )",

But with multiple serious issues to deal with, there may not be many more opportunities to joke during trump's two-day visit to israel and palestinian territories. A roundup of coverage: nbc looks at five issues expected to loom over the visit. They are trump's sharing of israeli intelligence, his controversial visit to the western wall, uncertainty over the proposed move of the us embassy to jerusalem, an israeli-palestinian peace deal, and plans to build a new coalition including the us, israel, and sunni arab states. The bbc looks at trump's chances of brokering a peace agreement that he has called the \" ultimate deal. \" preparations for trump's visit have caused even more bickering among members of netanyahu's ruling coalition than usual, the new york times reports. The pm reportedly had to order members of his cabinet to attend trump's airport welcome after learning that most of them planned to skip it. The ap notes that trump's journey on monday may have been the first-ever direct flight between israel and saudi arabia. Reuters reports that the day before trump's arrival, the israeli government granted some economic concessions that it says \" will ease daily civilian life in the palestinian authority \" after trump \" asked to see some confidence-building steps. \" the jerusalem post reports that the trump visit is making history in at least three ways, one of which is his visit to the western wall, which other american presidents have avoided because they didn't want to send a message about israeli sovereignty over the disputed territory. Haaretz reports that trump spoke on the airport tarmac after arriving in israel. \" on my first trip overseas as president, i have come to this sacred and ancient land to reaffirm the unbreakable bond between us and israel, \" he said.",

A whole foods rep notes that an employee saw a man pouring what appeared to be some sort of liquid onto the open food items on april 24, which led the store to dump all items at the salad bar and hot serving stations and sanitize all stations, equipment, and utensils before opening them to the public again with fresh food. \" we do not know what the substance was, \" fbi spokeswoman jill washburn says. \" the only thing that he was seen sprinkling the substance on was food. \" initial tests haven't turned up any harmful substance, but washburn still won't definitively say that it was innocuous. Cbs detroit notes no injuries or illnesses have been reported as a result of the incident.

Nbc news reports that security was tight at the springfield marriott as she testified, with reporters kept from getting near the conference room. Black curtains shielded the area in question from view, and security manned all entrances. Joseph cammarata, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told reporters that she was \" reserved \" and her testimony lasted just 2.5 hours, with exchanges between the rival teams of lawyers taking up the rest of the time. The plaintiffs all accuse bill cosby of sexually assaulting them. Lawyers for camille cosby — who defended her husband of 52 years after dozens of women came forward with accusations — invoked spousal privilege more than a dozen times, cammarata says. The lawyer didn't discuss her testimony, but he said she was clearly in a position to know a lot about cosby, the ap reports. \" she's his wife, \" he said. \" she has the ability to live with him, be with him \" and \" understand who he associates with. \" she will return for the second part of the deposition on march 14.

        "summary": "As earlier reported, a pair of retired air force psychologists who had never interrogated anybody before were paid $ 81 million to devise the cia's \" enhanced interrogation \" program and, much to martin seligman's displeasure, they devised their techniques by drawing on seligman's \" learned helplessness \" theory. The new york times today digs into that more, reporting that james mitchell and bruce jessen's work with the cia has resurfaced what it terms \" one of the most classic experiments in modern psychology. \" seligman's 1960s experiment involved dogs that had been administered electric shocks, with no method for getting those shocks to stop. They were then placed in a scenario where they could stop them if they jumped over a low barrier — but they didn't. More torture report details: legal experts tell the times that americans who factor into the report could be prosecuted by foreign bodies such as the international criminal court — though those experts frame the chances of that happening as slim to none and any decision to do so as politically fraught. The us hasn't signed the treaty that formed the icc, but torture reportedly occurred in countries that did sign. \" if i am someone implicated in the torture report, i am thinking twice about traveling to europe anytime soon, \" says an american university law professor. The torture report is proving to be a best-seller, at least in amazon's view. Cnn reports the $ 2.99 kindle version is the no. 1 seller in the \" intelligence &amp; espionage \" category — even though free versions are available online.

The agency can take such action for two years if it deems a drug to be a public threat. At low dosages, kratom tends to behave like a stimulant, but at higher doses it is reported to behave much like opioids and dull pain, reports cnn. Because kratom has long been considered an herbal supplement — and it's a popular one at that — fda efforts to curb its use and regulate its contents have been restricted. Several times more potent than morphine, it \" dulls pain very well, \" one researcher tells cnn. \" you can have very, very good analgesia. \" citing issues of dependence, abuse, negative side effects, and a lack of regulation of anything from dose to actual ingredients, the dea says the two-year classification goes into effect in late september. The classification could become permanent if research in the interim warrants it. Many are crying foul, with the huffington post reporting that advocates see kratom as a potential solution to the nation's opioid addiction. A post at forbes, meanwhile, notes that schedule i classification will limit future research on the plant. ( marijuana, meanwhile, is to remain schedule i for the foreseeable future. )",

Other developments: why so deadly? the new york times has an interactive graphic on why one in three people in the crowded club were killed or injured. Factors include the firing capacity of the ar-15 and the noise inside the club. One part that's not yet clear: whether mateen killed more people as police prepared to confront him. The orlando sentinel has a striking front page: it has only one photo and an editorial headlined \" our community will heal. \" see it here. An editor explains the decision here. The sentinel also provides a timeline of events from the shooting, one that points out 30 people were rescued.

        "summary": "\" they did everything they were supposed to do. But something was wrong with this cougar. \" that's the take from king county sheriff's sgt. Ryan abbott after a rare attack on humans left one cyclist dead in washington state saturday and another badly injured. The seattle men's identities have been released; sj brooks, 32, was killed and isaac sederbaum, 31, was injured. Police say the 3-year-old cougar, which was located and killed after the attack, was \" emaciated, \" weighing just 100 pounds rather than the more typical 140 to 180 pounds. \" it was skinnier than normal, \" says state wildlife official alan myers. A brain necropsy will be performed to see whether the animal was sick, the seattle times reports. Officials say the animal acted abnormally; cougars don't often attack humans, and the last fatal cougar attack in washington occurred in 1924. The cougar chased the men down the road; they got off their bikes and followed recommendations for facing down a cougar: yelling at it in an attempt to scare it away, and hitting it with one of the bikes when it approached. It ran off, but as the men tried to catch their breath, it circled back and grabbed sederbaum by the head, the ap reports. \" the cougar had his head in his jaws and was shaking him violently, \" myers says. Brooks dropped his bike and ran, causing the cougar to let go of sederbaum, chase brooks down, pounce on him, and kill him. \" you are in a flight or fight situation — you are going to want to flee and it's completely natural but it triggers a chase response in a cougar, \" myers says. The animal dragged brooks to its apparent den as sederbaum rode to find cell reception and call for help. ( in california, cougars have acquired a taste for pets. )",

Based on a pharmacologist's observation in the 1990s that jamaican fishermen who smoked or consumed cannabis had \" an uncanny ability to see in the dark, \" researchers at mcgill university dug in. They applied a synthetic cannabinoid to the eye tissue of tadpoles of an african toad and found, to their surprise, that it seemed to work. Specifically, they found that the cannabinoid made particular retinal cells more sensitive to light, improving the speed at which the eye responded to even dim stimulus, reports the guardian. \" we didn't believe what we were seeing, \" a study author told the montreal gazette. \" the cannabinoids were increasing the excitability of cells in the eye that connects to the brain. \" researchers then tracked tadpoles — only some of which had been given the cannabinoid — while showing them dark moving dots, which the tadpoles naturally avoid. All tadpoles performed well in the light. But in the dark, the cannabinoid tadpoles avoided significantly more dots than the others. If the same effect occurs in humans — a 2004 study found people had better night vision after smoking cannabis, but it didn't explore why, per science alert — cannabis could theoretically be used to treat retinitis pigmentosa and glaucoma by protecting retinal cells.

            "Montreal researchers have found a new role for cannabinoids. The active ingredient in marijuana — which is also naturally present in the human body — seems to improve night vision in vertebrates. The study by a multidisciplinary team including researchers from the montreal neurological institute looked at changes in tadpole retinas after exposure to cannabinoids. \"we didn't believe what we were seeing — exactly the opposite of what we expected, \" said neurologist ed ruthazer, of the montreal neurological institute of mcgill university, and the paper's senior author. Researchers expected to find the drug would inhibit the tadpoles'retinal ganglion cells ( rgcs ), which are responsible for transmitting information about light detection from the eye to the brain. \"but the cannabinoids were increasing the excitability of cells in the eye that connects to the brain, \" ruthazer said.

            "Cannabis can have some pretty strange effects on our bodies, but new research suggests there's another potential benefit of the drug - better night vision. A study in tadpoles has shown that the drug can make cells in the retina more sensitive to light, and it could not only help people see better in low light, but it could also treat degenerative eye conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa. It sounds pretty crazy, but this isn't the first time it's been reported that cannabis could improve night vision. As mo costandi reports for the guardian, 25 years ago, pharmacologist m. E. West from the university of the west indies in jamaica reported that local fisherman who smoked weed or drank rum made from the leaves and stems of cannabis plants had \" an uncanny ability to see in the dark \".

The active ingredient in marijuana — which is also naturally present in the human body — seems to improve night vision in vertebrates. The study by a multidisciplinary team including researchers from the montreal neurological institute looked at changes in tadpole retinas after exposure to cannabinoids. \"we didn't believe what we were seeing — exactly the opposite of what we expected, \" said neurologist ed ruthazer, of the montreal neurological institute of mcgill university, and the paper's senior author. Researchers expected to find the drug would inhibit the tadpoles'retinal ganglion cells ( rgcs ), which are responsible for transmitting information about light detection from the eye to the brain. \"but the cannabinoids were increasing the excitability of cells in the eye that connects to the brain, \" ruthazer said. One class of cannabinoid receptor, known as cb1, fired",
            "Cannabis can have some pretty strange effects on our bodies, but new research suggests there's another potential benefit of the drug - better night vision. A study in tadpoles has shown that the drug can make cells in the retina more sensitive to light, and it could not only help people see better in low light, but it could also treat degenerative eye conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa. It sounds pretty crazy, but this isn't the first time it's been reported that cannabis could improve night vision. As mo costandi reports for the guardian, 25 years ago, pharmacologist m. E. West from the university of the west indies in jamaica reported that local fisherman who smoked weed or drank rum made from the leaves and stems of cannabis plants had \" an uncanny ability to see in the dark \". The same thing was rumoured to be happening to moroccan",
            "25 years ago, pharmacologist m. E. West of the university of the west indies in kingston, jamaica, noted that local fisherman who smoke cannabis or drink rum made with the leaves and stems of the plant had \"an uncanny ability to see in the dark, \" which enabled them to navigate their boats through coral reefs. \"it was impossible to believe that anyone could navigate a boat without compass and without light in such treacherous surroundings, \" he wrote after accompanying the crew of a fishing boat one dark night, \"[ but ] i was then convinced that the man who had taken the rum extract of cannabis had far better night vision than i had, and that a subjective effect was not responsible. \" some of these crew members told west that moroccan fishermen and mountain dwellers experience a similar improvement after smoking hashish, and in 2002, another research team travelled to the rif mountains"

That means she is no longer welcome for travel and her beloved shopping sprees, adds afp. She and about a dozen other syrians have been added to a list of those barred from eu visits and whose financial assets there are frozen. As the recent leak of emails makes clear, asma assad likes her lavish chandeliers, candlesticks, and fondue sets. One caveat: because asma was born in britain, she will still be able to travel there. As afp notes, the so-called \" rose in the desert \" was once seen as the best hope to liberalize syria and her husband, bashar. But those hopes have long since faded. In fact, she herself has joked that she is the \" real dictator \" in the family.",

On thursday, he began the process by signing an executive order designed to loosen the rules on how individuals can buy insurance, reports the new york times. Essentially, small businesses and perhaps even individuals would have greater flexibility to band together in \" association health plans \" that would offer cheaper, less comprehensive coverage than plans in the obamacare exchanges, reports the wall street journal. The plans might even cross state lines. \" this is going to be something that millions and millions of people will be signing up for, \" the president said, per fox news, \" and they're going to be very happy. This will be great health care. \" critics say the move could fundamentally undermine obamacare if healthy individuals opt for these plans, leaving behind a less healthy group of people who want broad coverage and who would likely then see higher premiums. \" by siphoning off healthy individuals, these junk plans could cannibalize the insurance exchanges, \" says an official with the liberal center for american progress. Trump's order directs three cabinet agencies to work out the details, which might include offering cheaper short-term policies as well. Legal challenges are all but certain, reports reuters. The idea of expanding the definition of \" associations \" so that individuals could join a plan not run by their employer may run afoul of a federal law called the employee retirement income security act. \" the ' e ' in erisa is ' employee, ' \" says one health-care analyst.",

When the aclu posed the question, it says it received 247 pages of records in response, which, despite the volume, still managed to avoid providing a clear answer. The aclu's best guess is that the agency thinks warrants are unnecessary in most cases. The issue is muddled because the irs is apparently following a 1986 law declaring that government officials need only a subpoena, not a warrant, to read people's emails. But email today is obviously much different than it was back then, and a federal court ruled in 2010 that police violated a suspect's constitutional rights by reading his emails without a warrant, notes the hill. The irs, however, doesn't seem to have updated its policy. \" this question is too important for the irs not to be completely forthright with the american public, \" writes the aclu. \" the irs should tell the public whether it always gets a warrant to access email and other private communications in the course of criminal investigations.

Some other metrics: after the campaign was released, nike gained some 170,000 new instagram followers, christopher svezia, an analyst, tells cbs.

As the story goes, she immediately turned around and sold them to hui shou bao, a mobile phone recycling site, for roughly $ 18,000. And, ta da, a down payment. The story got wide pickup following a report by the bbc, which did try to verify the story: hui shou bao told the bbc it did in fact buy 20 iphones from a female client in early october, paying close to $ 900 for each. The bbc's attempt to secure an interview with xiaoli via the company failed.

Noah christensen, a junior at robert mcqueen high school in reno, nev., called rep. Mark amodei's office during the 17-minute school walkout to protest gun violence earlier this month. He expressed his opinion that bump stocks should be banned and the minimum age to purchase a gun should be increased — and that, as he told the staffer who answered the phone, members of congress should \" get off their f --- ing asses \" to do so. A congressional aide called christensen's school to inform the administration of his language, and the teen was hit with a two-day suspension for \" disrespectful behavior/language, \" cnn reports. He's also being kept from his duties as his class's elected secretary-treasurer, the nevada independent reports. Now the aclu is involved in the case. Christensen's supporters say he was exercising his right to free speech and that amodei should apologize — but the republican rep says his aide, as well, was simply exercising his own first amendment rights by reporting christensen, and that he won't apologize. The student acknowledges \" that's not maybe the wording i should have used but it's still my right to use that word, \" while his mom says, \" i don't encourage my child to go and cuss at someone, \" but in this case, \" maybe somebody does need to get off their butt and do something. \" the aclu sent a letter to amodei criticizing his office for restricting christensen's constitutional rights, and said in a monday letter to christensen's school and the school district that if the punishment is not overturned, it \" will have a chilling effect on other students who are considering engaging in the political process. \" the district says students were expected to \" act appropriately and with decorum \" during the walkout.",

Aclu officials said christiansen called the congressman's office wednesday and pleaded for lawmakers to \"get off their f — ing asses \" and enact gun-reform legislation that would help keep children safe at school. Specifically, christiansen asked the congressman to support raising the minimum age to buy a gun and to ban bump stocks, the weapon modification that accelerates the rate of gunfire. \"that very day the constituent was called to the principal's office and given a two-day suspension for 'disrespectful behavior/language, ' \" the aclu's executive director, tod story, wrote monday in a letter to amodei.

Photo by david calvert for the nevada independent congressman mark amodei won't apologize to a washoe county high school student who was suspended after delivering profanity-laced remarks to the lawmaker's office during the national walkout last week. The aclu of nevada sent amodei a letter on monday, urging him to issue the student — 17-year-old noah christiansen who attends robert mcqueen high school — an apology because a complaint from the congressman's staffer led to a two-day suspension. Aclu officials said christiansen called the congressman's office wednesday and pleaded for lawmakers to \"get off their f — ing asses \" and enact gun-reform legislation that would help keep children safe at school. Specifically, christiansen asked the congressman to support raising the minimum age to buy a gun and to ban bump stocks, the weapon modification that accelerates the rate of gunfire. \"that very day the constituent was called to the principal's office and given a two-day suspension for 'disrespectful behavior/language, ' \" the aclu's executive director, tod story, wrote monday in a letter to amodei. He also noted that the punishment occurred after \"a staff member from your office contacted the constituent '",

After the call, a congressional aide notified the nevada teen's school, which suspended him for two days. Now christiansen, 17, is at the center of a debate about decorum and free speech. The aclu is involved. And some people are seeking an apology from the congressman, who says that's not going to happen. It began last wednesday when the teen, a junior at robert mcqueen high school in reno, joined students nationwide in walking out of class for 17 minutes to demand tougher gun laws. During the walkout, christiansen called the reno office of his congressman, rep. Mark amodei, and argued for banning bump stocks and raising the minimum age to buy a gun. He also told the staffer who answered the phone that members of congress needed to \" get off their f***ing asses \" and take action. His comments did not go over well. A staffer at amodei's office called christiansen's school, which gave him a two-day suspension for \" disrespectful behavior/language \" and barred him from fulfilling his role as class secretary/treasurer. Amodei said his office received several hundred calls from students during the walkout and that christiansen"

Thanks to their chemical composition, the two rocks store data dating back 130,000 years, detailing how much water has fallen in that time, reports the international business times. Publishing their results in the journal quaternary science reviews, researchers say the oxygen levels of the stalagmites — rocks that grow up from a cave floor — indicate precipitation levels that are linked to the patterns of the sun's energy on the earth's surface. In short, they rise and fall together. It won't be for another 10,000 years, though, that \" solar insolation \" will rise above today's values, forecasting more rain. \" local governments generally prefer the narrative that the region is only in a temporary dry spell, \" says the study's lead author at the university of miami's rosenstiel school. \" to the contrary... The future long-term trend based on paleoclimate reconstructions is likely towards diminishing precipitation. \" upi notes that other climate models have suggested that the mideast will become too hot and dry to sustain large populations within a century.

As of wednesday, the bridge will be able to handle up to 40,000 cars daily, though the new york times notes the major highways that flow into the bridge on both sides are still being constructed. Tuesday's test drive took a little under 20 minutes and was covered live by russian state television. Reporters and cameras were stationed at several spots along the route. One reporter hailed the bridge as an example of \" heroism of the workers. \" the only hailing done by ukraine and the west was hailing the bridge as illegal. The ap reports ukrainian president petro poroshenko lambasted the bridge as \" yet another piece of evidence of the kremlin ignoring international law \" and \" an attempt to legitimize the temporary occupation of the crimean peninsula. \"",

The constitution's guarantee of religious freedom allows religious organizations to choose leaders and representatives of their faith, \"but it does not provide carte blanche to disregard antidiscrimination laws when it comes to other employees who do not serve a leadership role in the faith, \" the ninth u.s. Circuit court of appeals said in a 2-1 ruling. Biel worked as a public and private schoolteacher and",

The initial ruling against the teacher, in early 2017, concluded that the school could fire kristen biel because she worked as a minister, meaning the constitution would prevent her from suing under the americans with disabilities act.

The teacher, kristen biel, alleges that she was fired from her job at st. James elementary school in torrance, calif., part of the archdiocese of los angeles, after informing administrators that she had breast cancer and would have to take time off for surgery and chemotherapy. The principal told biel the school would not renew her contract because the teacher's classroom management was \" not strict \" and that \" it was not fair...

        "summary": "It's being described as a landmark decision in favor of privacy: the supreme court ruled friday that the government in most cases needs a warrant to track a person's location by grabbing data from cellphone towers. Chief justice john roberts sided with the four liberal-leaning justices and wrote the majority opinion, though he added that warrants can be skipped in emergency situations to avert an imminent threat, reports usa today. The case stems from a series of armed robberies in michigan and ohio in 2010 and 2011. Under the stored communications act of 1986, the government obtained cellphone records for suspect timothy carpenter that revealed 12,898 location points over 127 days, reports cnet. He was later sentenced to 116 years in prison, per the guardian. Friday's ruling says obtaining an \" all-encompassing record \" of a person's whereabouts without a warrant is a form of unreasonable search and seizure. \" the government's position fails to contend with the seismic shifts in digital technology that made possible the tracking of not only carpenter's location but also everyone else's, not for a short period but for years and years, \" roberts writes, noting that people \" compulsively carry cell phones with them all the time. \" in a rare move, all four dissenting justices wrote their own opinions. For example, samuel alito said the ruling \" guarantees a blizzard of litigation while threatening many legitimate and valuable investigative practices upon which law enforcement has rightfully come to rely. \"",

            "By mark silva and updated with excerpts at 6 pm edt president barack obama, fighting to assemble the votes needed for passage of healthcare legislation after more than a year of pressing congress for action, says that a vote for the bill will be a vote for reform -- and a vote against it, against reform. \" i don't spend a lot of time worrying about what the procedural rules are in the house or senate, \" obama says in an interview with fox news channel'that will air this evening on special report with bret baier. \" what i can tell you is that the vote that's taken in the house will be a vote for health care reform., \" obama tells baier. \" and if people vote yes, whatever form that takes, that is going to be a vote for health care reform. \" and i don't think we should pretend otherwise, \" the president says, pointing to the motivation behind critics attempting to block the bill. \" if they don't, if they vote against it, then they're going to be voting against health care reform and they're going to be voting in favor of the status quo. \" the public will know the difference, the president asserts. \" washington gets very concerned",

I ' m bret baier, and this is a special edition of \" special report \", beginning tonight in the blue room in the white house, mid-way through what many people are calling the most pivotal week of his presidency so far. We are interviewing president barack obama. Mr. President, thank you for the time. President barack obama: thank you for having me, bret. Baier: you have said at least four times in the past two weeks: \" the united states congress owes the american people a final up or down vote on health care. \" so do you support the use of this slaughter rule? the deem and pass rule, so that democrats avoid a straight up or down vote on the senate bill? obama: here's what i think is going to happen and what should happen. You now have a proposal from me that will be in legislation, that has the toughest insurance reforms in history, makes sure that people are able to get insurance even if they've got preexisting conditions, makes sure that we are reducing costs"

A study released monday found that a constellation of three substances in the cerebrospinal fluid was present in 90 % of people who had been diagnosed with alzheimer's.the test also showed the same markers were found in 72 % of people with mild cognitive impairment, considered an early stage of the disease, and in one-third of adults who had no cognitive problems.many experts believe that biomarkers in spinal fluid may emerge as the most accurate diagnosis of alzheimer's disease. At present, the disease is diagnosed using pencil-and-paper cognitive tests, which are subjective and may be inaccurate. The diagnosis can only be confirmed by examining brain tissue at an autopsy.researchers from belgium analysed 114 older adults who were cognitively normal, 200 who had mild cognitive impairment and 102 who had been diagnosed with alzheimer's. They looked for three specific biomarkers, proteins that develop in the brain when the disease is present. A later analysis looking at brain autopsies for confirmation found the test of spinal fluid markers was correct in 64 of 68 cases.the fact that alzheimer's was diagnosed in about one-third of people without symptoms of the disease means that the disease process is underway well before symptoms occur, the authors said.in an editorial accompanying the paper",

So the hope is to find good ways to identify people who are getting the disease, and use those people as subjects in studies to see how long it takes for symptoms to occur and in studies of drugs that may slow or stop the disease.

At cnn, for example, se cupp took ingraham to task. \" what once might have been a dog whistle is officially a scream, voiced over the airwaves of the president's favorite cable news network, \" she writes.

The bbc reports the european space agency lost communication with the schiaparelli robot less than a minute before it was supposed to reach the martian surface wednesday. The lander's parachute definitely deployed, but it's unclear what happened after that, according to the new york times. \" these are not good signs, \" says the head of the mission operations department. And while it's possible the lander crashed and broke, the esa isn't giving up yet. It could spend the next few days trying to figure out why it lost communication with the lander and how to get it back. The good news is the lander wasn't integral to the mission, which is centered around the trace gas orbiter, currently circling above mars and collecting information about its atmosphere.",

        "summary": "A fierce new strain of hiv in cuba is highlighting an old danger — of sleeping around without using any protection, cbs news reports. Researchers say the new hiv is a combination of strains ( possibly from multiple sex partners ) that more quickly invades cells and turns into full-blown aids. A study in cuba looked at blood samples of 73 people recently infected with the \" crf19 \" strain, 52 of whom had aids, and compared them to 22 blood samples with aids from more ordinary hiv strains. The result: crf19 patients had \" abnormally high doses \" of hiv, eureka alert reports. They also got aids only three years after infection, compared to the usual 10. In fact, crf19 infects so quickly that patients may not realize they're sick until it's too late for antiretroviral therapy to help, science times reports. This strain is more dangerous because it's better at grabbing onto human cells and eventually entering them. Typical hiv holds onto cells at one anchor point and advances to another as the virus progresses, giving the patient a few healthy years. But crf19 moves faster, possibly because fragments combined from hiv subsets hold onto each other through an enzyme that helps the virus replicate. Hiv's mutating ability is nothing new, but this one's a doozy — and may hold particular significance for miami because \" cuba is local for miami, \" a physician tells the miami herald. He's also troubled by the study's small sample size and the researchers'decision to not treat the patients. \" it's unethical to wait until someone progresses \" toward aids, when \" they can no longer benefit from treatment, \" he says.

            "Engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting multiple strains of hiv, the virus that causes aids. Once inside a host, these strains can recombine into a new variant of the virus. One such recombinant variant observed in patients in cuba appears to be much more aggressive than other known forms of hiv. Patients progress to aids within three years of infection - so rapidly that they may not even realise they were infected. Before it can enter human cells, hiv must first anchor itself to them. The virus does this via anchor points, or co-receptors, which are proteins on the cell membrane. In a normal infection, the virus first uses the anchor point ccr5. In many patients, after a number of healthy years, the virus then switches to the anchor point cxcr4. This co-receptor switch coincides with a faster progression to aids. Writing in",
            "Scientists have discovered a highly aggressive new strain of hiv in cuba that develops into aids three times faster than more common strains of the virus. This finding could have serious public health implications for efforts to contain and reduce incidences of the virus worldwide. Researchers at the university of leuven in belgium say the hiv strain crf19 can progress to aids within two to three years of exposure to virus. Typically, hiv takes approximately 10 years to develop into aids. Patients with crf19 may start getting sick before they even know they've been infected, which ultimately means there's a significantly shorter time span to stop the disease's progression. The scientists began studying the cases in cuba when reports began coming in that a growing number of hiv-infected patients were developing aids just three years after diagnosis with the virus. The findings of their study were published in the journal ebiomedicine.",
            "In a new study published in the journal ebiomedicine, researchers with belgium's university of leuvan report the discovery of a new strain of hiv which may prove to be far more lethal to patients in the west. Originally found in patients in cuba, the new strain poses particular threats to those infected with hiv as it can develop into aids within three years of infection. Though efforts have significantly lowered the infection rates of hiv, as well as prolonged lives with the help of antiretroviral drugs, researchers fear that the fast-moving virus may advance too quickly to treat. Like us on facebook while there are many variations in the form of the autoimmune infection, typical hiv infection in the absence of treatment takes on average 5 to 10 years before entering the lethal stages of aids. And with antiretroviral pharmaceuticals, treatments in collaboration with powerful cocktails aimed at changing the immunological response can extend"

She says the students meant no harm and she stands by the project. \" you cannot discuss racism without discussing the klan, \" she said. \" to do so would be to condone their actions. \"",

And while tridevil, aka alisha hessler, isn't ' fessing up, florida's wtsp has dug up an especially telling stolen-item report involving hessler earlier this month at tampa international airport. After her bag was stolen and then recovered, airport police listed its contents as including a \" 3 breast prosthesis. \" hessler might be acknowledging the ruse at least subtly. She's a massage therapist, and snopes has found her website for \" alisha's golden touch \" that refers to her as a \" provider of internet hoaxes since 2014 \" and a \" specialist in massage for three breasted women. \" in an interview with the british tabloid the sun posted today, hessler was still sticking by her story. \" this is not a fake, \" she says. \" i had the procedure done. If people don't believe it, that's up to them. \" snopes says it has reached out to hessler, who is hoping to land a reality tv show, to clear up its questions. It speaks to one plastic surgeon who says this would have been a lengthy, hugely complicated procedure. So unless some actual third-party proof emerges, and perhaps the identity of the alleged plastic surgeon, she gets the site's \" false \" label. In an earlier interview with wtsp, hessler explained that she wouldn't allow a close look at the extra breast because \" it's in episode six of my show. \"",

Though humans were a little late in discovering that — by the time we made it to the arctic island 3,700 years ago, the beasts were on their last legs, scientific american reports — the genes of one of that lived there 4,300 years ago is giving new insights into what may have fueled the creatures ' undoing. When compared to the genome of a mainland mammoth who lived more than 40,000 years prior, researchers found that a \" mutational meltdown \" had taken place among the island dwellers, one that left the beasts with a poor sense of smell and possibly diminished mating. They also weren't so woolly by the end, with gene mutations blamed for a shiny, translucent coat, per nature. Reporting in the journal plos genetics, researchers found that gene mutations caused the island mammoths to lose olfactory receptors and urinary proteins, which in modern elephants are important for mating, per nature. Researcher rebekah rogers explains it wasn't inbreeding that did the wrangel mammoths in, but a population so small that it messed with natural selection. \" any mammoth was better than no mammoth at all, \" so \" bad mutations that would normally be weeded out weren't removed from the population because of reduced competition. \" paleontologist ross macphee tells nature the findings could inform modern conservation efforts: they're \" maybe telling us something very important about what happens in populations already under severe threat because of diminished range and numbers. \" ( mammoths could be de-extinct in two years. )",

            "In their heyday, woolly mammoths blanketed the siberian steppe, alaska and large parts of north america. But by 10,000 years ago, warming climates had turned many of the grasslands they grazed into forest. And humans, well they weren't so friendly either — one mammoth provides quite a feast. So the mammoths largely disappeared. Except there's this one holdout population. On an island in the arctic ocean, called wrangel island. Where the last mammoths hid out … for more than 6,000 years. \" so the pyramids have been built, they've started to grow tea in china, and civilization had formed, and here are these mammoths no one knew was there, for the longest period of time. \" rebekah rogers, an evolutionary geneticist at the university of north carolina. \" and then people finally found this island around 3,700 years ago, around",
            "Woolly mammoths ( mammuthus primigenius ) populated siberia, beringia, and north america during the pleistocene and early holocene. Recent breakthroughs in ancient dna sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two specimens of woolly mammoths ( palkopoulou et al. 2015 ). One mammoth specimen is from a mainland population 45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful.

Palin actually endorsed cruz when he was running for the senate, and he's said he wouldn't have made it there without her support. But he's not happy with the idea of palin endorsing trump — when the endorsement was just a rumor, he told cnn it would be a \" blow \" to her, because she'd be \" endorsing someone who's held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life, on marriage, on partial-birth abortion \" rather than conservative views.

Kippy's! ice cream shop in venice is now offering a four-day cleanse, although its version of ice cream doesn't contain any dairy products — it's made from coconut cream. For $ 240, you get five pints of the stuff each day, plus free daily yoga classes. Owner kippy miller tells cbs los angeles that 12 people did the cleanse last month and lost weight — and over on gizmodo, brent rose, who was one of those lucky dozen, writes about doing it with his girlfriend. Yes, they lost weight — about 6 pounds for rose, and closer to 5 pounds for his girlfriend — but they both gained it back within days. The big question: is it healthy? the weight loss can probably be explained by the calorie count ( the ice cream adds up to 1,200 calories per day, which one nutritionist says is \" a great range \" to stay in while dieting ), but you're also ingesting 70 grams of fat and more than 120 grams of sugar per day. That concerns the nutritionist, and a doctor agrees, telling cbs news that the cleanse involves \" a boat load of processed saturated fat and sugar every day; pretty much the two worst things you can put in your body \" and adding that any weight lost would almost certainly come right back. If, however, you are more concerned with how it tastes, rose and his girlfriend found the ice cream delish.",

Scientists there think the 2006 rules used to boot pluto from the planet club are bogus, and they recommend a different standard under which it would qualify, per a ucf release. The researchers specifically take issue with the international astronomical union's 2006 declaration that a celestial body is a planet only if it \" has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, \" meaning it's the \" largest gravitational force in its orbit, \" in the ucf translation. Pluto does not meet that standard — but the ucf researchers say it's not supported in scientific literature, reports new atlas. In fact, they found one only published study in the last two centuries using the clear-their-orbit standard to define a planet, and that 1802 study was based on now-debunked information. \" the iau definition would say that the fundamental object of planetary science, the planet, is supposed to be defined on the basis of a concept that nobody uses in their research, \" says phillip metzger, lead scientist on the study, in icarus. \" it's a sloppy definition, \" he adds. \" if you take that literally, then there are no planets, because no planet clears its orbit. \" the ucf team instead recommends that a celestial body deserves to be called a planet if it's big enough that its gravity shapes it into a ball, or sphere. That was one of three criteria the iau listed in 2006, but metzer thinks it should be the only one. It's \" not just an arbitrary definition, \" he says. \" it turns out this is an important milestone in the evolution of a planetary body, because apparently when it happens, it initiates active geology in the body. \" ( pluto's sky is similar to ours. )",

Fbi director james comey told lawmakers sunday that the bureau had found no evidence to warrant criminal charges against clinton in a trove of newly-discovered emails. Trump insisted at a rally in the detroit suburbs that it would have been impossible for the fbi to review what has been reported to be as many as 650,000 emails in so short a time. He claims she's being protected by \" a rigged system. \" trump says, \" hillary clinton is guilty. She knows it, the fbi knows it. The people know it. \" he says it's now up to \" the american people to deliver justice at the ballot box on november 8. \" ___ 7: 19 p.m. In financial trading sunday evening, dow jones index futures jumped about 200 points ahead of monday's stock market opening, apparently in response to fbi director james comey's decision that seemed to lift a cloud over hillary clinton."

Here's what they're saying about the show, which premieres tomorrow: it's a \"credible dramedy with the misfortune of arriving after the similar — and better — modern family, \" writes brian lowry of variety. There are so many plot threads that it \"risks becoming brothers and sisters-lite ( which is already pretty lite, come to think of it ). \" \"it's sweet and funny and heartbreaking, and relatable to the point of cliché, \" says paige wiser of the chicago sun-times. \"parenthood strikes all the right notes, although it's not yet can't-miss television. \" \"where are the laughs? \" asks vince horiuchi of the salt lake city tribune. There's potential here, but the show needs to strike a better blend of comedy and drama. \"perhaps, like a good parent, the network can nurture this series into something it can be proud of. \"",

        "summary": "The rider is an american cowboy tale from a relatively new chinese director. It also features a cast of people who've never acted before. And it's apparently awesome. Brady jandreau, a real-life cowboy who suffered a brain injury in a 2016 fall, stars alongside his friends and family members in chloé zhao's new feature, a lightly fictionalized telling of his struggle to get back on a horse. What critics are saying: describing it as an \" achingly beautiful heartland elegy, \" justin chang says the rider \" comes as close to a spiritual experience as anything i've encountered in a movie theater this year. \" he credits its \" gorgeous frontier lyricism \" and star at the los angeles times. \" is jandreau acting, or merely being? i'd suggest a third option somewhere in between, in that mysterious realm where art resides, \" he writes. \" how many stirring moments does it take to make a great movie? whatever the number, the rider has more than enough, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. His review describes an \" ineffably beautiful drama \" of intense bonds and \" masculine pride, \" benefited by the \" complexity and poignancy \" jandreau brings. \" it's a rare treat to be so affected by — and connected to — a movie hero of so few words, and such vivid ones, \" morgenstern says. At the atlantic, david sims calls the rider \" the best film i've seen so far in 2018. \" far from \" amateurish, \" it \" feels like the announcement of a major artistic talent in zhao, \" who \" blends narrative with documentary seamlessly, giving the audience a glimpse into a way of life rarely seen on the big screen. \" sims point outs \" a remarkable training sequence that … zhao allows to play out near-wordlessly. \" noting terrence malick's influence on zhao's work, godrey cheshire says \" the apprentice here emerges as a master. \" the rider is \" the best american movie this critic has seen in the past year \" and \" the kind of rare work that seems to attain greatness through an almost alchemical fusion of nominal opposites, \" he writes at rogerebert.com. Zhao should be thanking her lucky stars that she met jandreau, he adds. \" watching him is breathtaking. \"",

According to the conversation, dryococelus australis — also known as the \" land lobster \" — was happily living on lord howe island between australia and new zealand when a british ship ran aground a century ago. Rats fled the ship and promptly started gobbling up the insects. By 1920, the flightless, plant-eating insects were declared extinct. Only they weren't, reveals a study published last week in current biology. Two-dozen insects that appeared to be land lobsters were found on the volcanic ball's pyramid, about 12 miles from lord howe island, in 2011, usa today reports. But they looked slightly different than the dryococelus australis of lord howe island, and scientists couldn't be certain they weren't a different species. Until now. Comparing dna from the insects found on ball's pyramid and museum specimens of dryococelus australis collected prior to its rat-aided extinction, researchers found less than 1 % difference. That's close enough to say the \" land lobster \" is alive and well. However, with fewer than 30 believed to be left on ball's pyramid, it could be the rarest insect in the world. Scientists are breeding the dryococelus australis with the hope of reintroducing it to lord howe island — once the rats are taken care of, of course.",

If they were giving everything they had, the theory went, they wouldn't have finished side-by-side with huge smiles on their faces. \"the hahner twins lisa and anna ended their olympic marathon race more than 21 minutes behind the winner ( and ) more than 15 minutes on their best performance, ( in position ) 81 and 82. It looked as though they completed a fun run and not ( an ) olympic ( race ), \" german athletics federaton director thomas kurschilgen told reporters. \"victory and medals are not the only goal, \" he added in an email to the new york times. \"still, every athlete in the olympic competitions should be motivated to demonstrate his or her",

        "summary": "James bond may have given up smoking, but his health — and high fitness level needed to evade nemeses — is at risk thanks to secondhand smoke. Concerned about 007's overall health, a team led by medical doctor nick wilson at the university of otago reviewed all 24 bond films ( apparently the patient was unavailable ) to find that the super spy has been exposed to considerable amounts of secondhand cigarette smoke, per a tongue-in-cheek tobacco control study. While wilson gives bond credit for giving up smoking in 2002 — he lit up within the first 20 minutes of a film on average before then — he says bond's sexual partners who smoke still present a risk, and not just because 15 % have tried to harm or kill him, per popular science. By keeping his relationships short-lived, bond is limiting some of the impact from secondhand smoke, wilson quips, per the sydney morning herald. But there are real-life implications as a 2016 report notes youths who view smoking on screen are twice as likely to smoke as others. Bond himself smoked in 83 % of films in the 1960s and 40 % in the 1980s, though not in any in the 1990s. Only one bond film — 2006's casino royale — had no smoking imagery. \" the persisting smoking content remains problematic, \" the team says in a release, noting 2015's spectre — in which only minor characters smoked — resulted in 261 million \" tobacco impressions \" among americans aged 10 to 29. Says wilson, it's time for bond to smarten up. ( bond's drinking is also a problem. )",

It describes the epidemic of tobacco use among youth ages 12 through 17 and young adults ages 18 through 25, including the epidemiology, causes, and health effects of this tobacco use and interventions proven to prevent it. Scientific evidence contained in this report supports the following facts: we have made progress in reducing tobacco use among youth; however, far too many young people are still using tobacco. Today, more than 600,000 middle school students and 3 million high school students smoke cigarettes. Rates of decline for cigarette smoking have slowed in the last decade and rates of decline for smokeless tobacco use have stalled completely. Every day, more than 1,200 people in this country die due to smoking. For each of those deaths, at least two youth or young",

Kayla marisa seloff, 22, and joshua gene leal, 27, were arrested early saturday after a neighbor heading to work reported seeing two people enter the vacant home, then flashes of light from inside, cw39 reports. Police say that when they showed up, they peeked into a window and saw seloff and leal on the floor in one of the rooms and that the two initially tried to hide as officers gained entrance. Eventually the pair emerged to talk with police, who say seloff at first tried to pass off the home as hers, claiming leal as her husband and the home as their own recently purchased abode. But when cops asked for proof, seloff came up short and confessed to being the home seller, not the home dweller. The actual new owner said seloff wasn't allowed to be there and agreed to charges for both for criminal trespass. It's not clear if seloff was charged for the marijuana pipe and small stash of pot cops say they found in her car when she went to get her id.
