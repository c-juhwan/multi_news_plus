        "summary": "A man in india has confessed to inviting over his daughter's alleged rapist, serving the man dinner, and murdering him with a pair of hot tongs, fox news reports. The unidentified 36-year-old says he only meant to torture the man with tongs and strangulation, and wept when he died on friday. \" i burned his genitals once, he screamed, \" the man reportedly told police. \" i did it again, he shuddered. When i did it the third time... He did not move. He was dead … i did not want to kill him. \" according to the father, the attacker was a medicine supplier who lived in the same building in delhi and came over one day when the 14-year-old girl was alone. He allegedly raped her and threatened her \" with dire consequences \" if she told anyone, the indian express reports. Police say the father found out, but didn't report it because he believed relatives and neighbors would put the blame on his daughter. She ended up pregnant and unhappy, and \" stopped eating properly, \" her mom says, while the alleged assailant was seen happy with his own family. The furious father called the supplier to ask why he did it, and apparently got a mouthful of invective in return. That's when the dad devised his invitation, he says, though police contend he planned the murder right after he heard his daughter's story. The supplier was found with his mouth and hands tied on a bed, and \" burn injuries on his private parts and stomach, \" an officer says. \" the body was sent for an autopsy. \" ( click to read about how rape in india could be prevented by toilets. )",

It won't provide \" much relief for drought-stricken california, as california's rainy season is winding down, \" mike halpert, deputy director of the noaa's climate prediction center, tells the la times, explaining that the pacific ocean weather pattern will only help drought-stricken areas if it persists into the next rainy season. Forecasters say this el nino won't have much effect on us weather patterns at all, since it's arriving too late to create the usual wet, cool conditions, though it may bring temperatures up elsewhere in the world, reports scientific american. The noaa — which describes el nino as an \" ocean-atmospheric phenomenon marked by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the central pacific ocean \" — first spotted signs of the phenomenon a year ago, and halpert tells the ap that experts aren't sure why it has taken so long to turn up. The agency says there is a 50 % to 60 % chance that this weak, late, and unusual el nino might persist through the summer, which could lead to a decrease in the number of atlantic hurricanes, though halpert warns that 1992's hurricane andrew struck during an el nino summer.

They urge doctors to wait at least a full minute, the result being babies with healthier levels of blood and iron, and even higher birthweights. The delayed clamping brings a slightly higher risk of jaundice, but researchers say the benefits far outweigh the risks. The finding, published in the cochrane library, is in line with the world health organization recommendation that doctors wait one to three minutes, notes ob.gyn.news. Doing so allows the infant to receive more blood from mom via the placenta. Will the review change long-standing practice in the us? the new york times thinks it has the potential, though it would likely be a gradual process. \"i suspect we ' ll have more and more delayed cord clamping, \" says one doctor affiliated with the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists. Part of the rationale behind the quick clamping so common in the us is that it cuts down on the risk of maternal hemorrhaging, but the study — a review of data from trials involving nearly 4,000 women — found no increased health risk to mothers if doctors wait a little longer.",

It's a log cabin dating back to around 1850s and thought to be one of the earliest structures of its kind in north texas, reports nbcdfw.com. Developer curtis grant found the cabin when he began tearing down the home in flower mound that had been built around it. A researcher used tree-ring analysis to date the cabin to the mid-19th century, and the cross timbers gazette says that means it was likely built by one of the first settlers in the area, william gibson. He put up the cabin, which measures 16 feet by 16 feet, in order to claim the 360 acres around it as part of a land grant. \" we want to save this cabin at this site, \" says flower mound historian mark glover. \" some of the earliest people to settle in north texas built this house. \" grant is on board, and he and the town are trying to figure out how to make that happen. It would mean scaling back the planned 12-home development and setting aside three of the lots for the cabin as a historical site. \"i ' m not a multi-millionaire, \" says grant, who nbc says wasn't under any legal obligation to stop his work. \" i can't afford to just give the land. \" but the town says it doesn't have the estimated $ 500,000 it would take to buy the lots. They're hosting an open house today for people to see the cabin, which could lead to a fundraising campaign to preserve it.

Instead, it's \" total crap, \" with an \" incoherent \" script.

The central idea of having mcclane team up with his son is just dreadful, adding \" a note of sentiment, but of false sentiment, \" writes mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle. Jai courtney's character is \" as unwelcome as james bond jr. Or sherlock holmes jr.

        "summary": "Squirrel breeding is a real job — and apparently a very dangerous one if you're dealing with the wrong kind of squirrel. After the mysterious deaths of three german men who all worked as breeders of variegated squirrels — a kind of squirrel native to central america that's sometimes kept as an exotic pet — researchers have identified a new virus that had apparently jumped from the squirrels to the men, livescience reports. The men, who were in their 60s and regularly socialized together, died between 2011 and 2013 from inflammation of the brain, and researchers say at least two of them had been scratched or bitten by the squirrels. They died a few months after showing symptoms, including fever and weakness. The virus found in the men is a new bornavirus, a kind of virus often found in horses and sheep, according to a study published in the new england journal of medicine. The european center for disease prevention and control suggests avoiding direct contact with variegated squirrels — which should be pretty easy for most people — and a professor of medicine at nyu langone medical center tells healthday that there's no need to fear a major squirrel-borne outbreak. \" it is possible that this virus could spread to squirrels here in the us and occasionally to humans, but we wouldn't see sustained spread, as there is no evidence of spread from human to human, \" he says.

Parneros initially sued because, he claimed, the company fired him for no reason after just 14 months on the job; b&n says in its suit that parneros \" downplays what occurred. \" now, in response to the bookseller's countersuit, he has issued a statement denying all of the company's allegations. The sexual harassment claim is \" completely false \" and he never bullied anyone, he says, adding that he was also \" fully supportive of the sales process from the start. \" but b&n says that in addition to the female employee who says that, on two occasions, parneros subjected her to unwanted touching or sexual comments, the company has received \" additional complaints about parneros ' inappropriate behavior toward women \" since he was fired. Pareneros'suit sought $ 4 million in severance plus other damages; b&n's suit says the company should be allowed to recoup pareneros'salary, bonus, and any other benefits accrued during the time his \" disloyal conduct \" was allegedly occurring, plus cancel his outstanding equity awards.

Her estranged husband david pena instead says she said to him: \" i love you. Please don't let [ my son ] see me like this. \" that's the story pena's defense attorney, david mugridge, told in court wednesday at his client's murder trial in fresno as he tried to explain in opening statements why, after mendiola was killed on november 29, 2016, pena scrubbed the crime scene with bleach and drove around in her car with her tarp-covered body, per the fresno bee. The car and her body were eventually found by cops, and they were able to track down pena by following pings from mendiola's cellphone, which he had on him, ksfn reports. Pena's story, via his attorney, is that he found mendiola in her garage with a knife in her back, possibly stabbed by an intruder. Mugridge says pena slid the knife out and held her, which is when she allegedly made her request for him to clean up the scene so her son matthew wouldn't see it. Prosecutor nathan lambert tells a different story, noting mendiola had booted pena from the home just 10 days earlier, and that on the day of the murder, \" she was beaten, hit in the face, she was bloody, her wedding ring ripped off her finger, she was stabbed in the back with a large knife, a knife that was so large it was able to pierce her lungs \" — and that pena was the one who did all of that. The prosecutor also says pena didn't call 911, and that messages found on his cellphone accused mendiola of having an affair. \" he talked about an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, \" lambert says, per the bee. Pena could see at least 16 years behind bars if he's convicted. ( two ended up dead after a wife learned of her husband's alleged affair. )",

The hartford courant has a live blog going as its reporters go over the documents. Some excerpts from there and from cnn: before the shooting, police say nancy lanza traveled to new hampshire for a few days as an \" experiment \" to leave her son home alone. She stayed at a hotel, and her son shot her the morning after she returned. She had told a friend that the 20-year-old lanza had \" some sort of autism, \" that life was difficult, but that she was proud of his accomplishments and never felt in danger. At the school, an officer went to lanza as he lay on the ground and asked lanza who had shot him; he was trying to get a response, apparently unaware that lanza was the gunman and had just shot himself. Police took a birthday card from the house sent to lanza by his father: \" send me an e-mail when you want to go hunting or shooting, \" it read. A neighbor heard gunshots the morning of the shooting, apparently when lanza killed his mother, but chalked it up to hunters. \" my god, he's still shooting, \" a wounded teacher is quoted as saying. \" whoever he is, he's still shooting. \" after the shooting, police had to slide their badges under classroom doors to prove it was safe to come out. An officer carried one of the young victims from the school, saying, \" come on, sweetie, come on sweetie. \"",

The avma is upset because their euthanasia guidelines were cited when they have nothing to do with use of a bow and arrow to kill a cat. Click here to read more about the avma's stance on the issue. Wednesday ( june 24 ) 12: 55 p.m. An austin county grand jury returned with a \" no bill \" against the brenham veterinarian who bragged about killing a cat with a bow and arrow. That means kristen lindsey will not be charged. 8: 45 a.m. Now two months since former brenham veterinarian kristen lindsey's social media post bragging about a cat she shot with an arrow went viral, a grand jury is set to hear about the case for the first time.

        "summary": "Australian researchers say they've come up with the first shark-proof wetsuits, reports the bbc. Divers and surfers might be a little disappointed to learn that the suits aren't made of some magical fiber that wards off sharp teeth — this is all about visual tricks. One has black and white stripes, on the theory that a shark would see that as a warning to stay away from possibly poisonous prey, explains the west australian. The other suit is basically blue, and adorned in a way to make the wearer invisible in the water to the color-blind sharks. The first is for surfers and swimmers, the second for divers. After a big spike in shark attacks in australia, scientists from the university of western australia teamed up with designers from the commercial shark attack mitigation systems to create the $ 500 suits. They just went on sale this week, so it's too early to tell whether the designs work in the real world. A contributor at slashdot sums it up this way: \" apparently australians have come up with the brilliant idea: if you don't want to be eaten by a shark, it's best to not go swimming in shark-infested waters in a seal costume. \" ( from the sharks ' perspective, becoming the victim of an optical illusion is probably better than this fate. )",

Their blue and white elude suit is said to make divers much less visible to sharks by drawing on research into the way they see their prey. A separate design - the diverter - has black and white stripes to signal that a surfer is not good to eat. The project follows a wave of shark attacks in western australia. Sharks are common in australian waters but fatal attacks are rare - on average, one person is killed by a shark in a year. But five people were killed in the year to july 2012. The designers say they used new scientific insights into sharks ' perceptions of light and colour blindness to come up with a product which could camouflage a diver or snorkeler in the water. One of the entrepreneurs, craig anderson, told the afp news agency that the elude suit created \" confusion \" for the shark's visual systems.'substantial demand'the university of western australia researcher, shaun collin, said the black-and-white design would ward sharks away from surfers. \" many animals are repelled by a striped pattern which indicates the potential prey is unsafe to eat.",
            "Wa researchers will today unveil world-first wetsuits designed to protect surfers, swimmers and divers from shark attacks by using scientific discoveries about how the predators see and detect prey. The shark deterrent wetsuits come in two different strategic designs - one that blends the wearer with background colours in the water and the other that makes the wearer highly visible but uses disruptive patterns unlike the appearance of a shark's normal prey. The project began two years after five people were killed by sharks in two years along the wa coastline, making the state the shark attack capital of the world. Hamish jolly and craig anderson, both keen surfers and ocean lovers, were awarded a $ 20,000 state government grant to work with university of wa shark scientists to design the wetsuits based on science of shark vision, neurology and behaviour. Mr jolly said yesterday that initial results of testing the wetsuits in the ocean with wild sharks had been extraordinary and had given them the confidence to release the wetsuits for sale. \" there's been a lot of anecdotal stuff about it and attempts at this, mostly trying to make the wearer look like a sea snake or putting stripes on the wetsuits, but what we have done is to put the science to the anecdotes, \" he said.

One of the entrepreneurs, craig anderson, told the afp news agency that the elude suit created \" confusion \" for the shark's visual systems.'substantial demand'the university of western australia researcher, shaun collin, said the black-and-white design would ward sharks away from surfers. \" many animals are repelled by a striped pattern which indicates the potential prey is unsafe to eat.",
            "Wa researchers will today unveil world-first wetsuits designed to protect surfers, swimmers and divers from shark attacks by using scientific discoveries about how the predators see and detect prey. The shark deterrent wetsuits come in two different strategic designs - one that blends the wearer with background colours in the water and the other that makes the wearer highly visible but uses disruptive patterns unlike the appearance of a shark's normal prey. The project began two years after five people were killed by sharks in two years along the wa coastline, making the state the shark attack capital of the world. Hamish jolly and craig anderson, both keen surfers and ocean lovers, were awarded a $ 20,000 state government grant to work with university of wa shark scientists to design the wetsuits based on science of shark vision, neurology and behaviour. Mr jolly said yesterday that initial results of testing the wetsuits in the ocean with wild sharks had been extraordinary and had given them the confidence to release the wetsuits for sale. \" there's been a lot of anecdotal stuff about it and attempts at this, mostly trying to make the wearer look like a sea snake or putting stripes on the wetsuits, but what we have done is to put the science to the anecdotes, \" he said. The \" cryptic \" wetsuit is designed to hide the wearer in"

In fact, sparkling water sales have doubled in the past five years. \" for me, rock bottom was a recent, obscenely long workday during which an entire 12-pack of coconut la croix somehow made it down my throat, \" journalist olga khazan writes. So she had a vested interest in the answer when she took to twitter to find out from dentists whether fizzy water is bad for your teeth. Warning: the answer may bum you out. \"my advice is to keep acidic drinks to meal times, and if you have to sip drinks between meals, then plain water is the safest, \" professor of dentistry damien walmsley says. That's because sparkling water — even the unflavored kind — contains carbonic acid. That makes the water sparkle, but it can also wear down tooth enamel. And it's worse if other flavoring acids are present. A 2007 study put teeth in flavored sparkling water for 30 minutes and found it to be as bad for them as orange juice. But just how bad unflavored seltzer is for you depends on other factors, such as diet and fluoride intake ( sorry, portland ). \"for an average, healthy person, carbonated, sugar-free beverages are not going to be a main cavity-causing factor, \" dentist andrew swiatowicz says. He says anyone who's super concerned can always \" just swish with regular water after. \" back in july, bustle looked at five other questions bubbling up around sparkling water, such as if it keeps you as hydrated as regular water and whether it makes you gassy.",

While bottled flat water has a ph of about 7 — or totally neutral — that of perrier is about 5.5. The flavorings, though, can bring the ph down, making the beverages even harsher on tooth enamel.

The los angeles times reports the department is spending $ 300,000 to replace belt buckles, belt snaps, baton rings, and key holders to make them better match the bronze badges, lapel pins, and tie clips worn by deputies. Sheriff jim mcdonnell says the change from silver to gold will make deputies look more professional, which will in turn lead to suspects giving them more respect. \" they need to exude command presence, \" mcdonnell says of his deputies. But those deputies aren't so sure new belt buckles are the way to do it. The president of the association for los angeles deputy sheriffs says the department is \" in turmoil \" and has more pressing needs. The union issued a statement against the new belt buckles on tuesday, the los angeles daily news reports. The union says the sheriff's department has an annual budget deficit of $ 250 million, which has left it with 300 deputy positions and 1,000 professional staff positions unfilled. Deputies work back-to-back shifts, and detectives and administrators are pulled away from their regular work and sent out on mandatory patrols. While the union understands the \" desire to have a professional uniform appearance, \" it says this is not the time to do it.",

The parsemus foundation has tested an injectable, non-hormonal polymer contraceptive on male baboons that appears to successfully prevent pregnancy in females, medical daily reports. The procedure, which requires just one vasalgel injection for long-lasting effects, also seems to be reversible and is hopefully headed into human trials next year, with a possible market date of 2017. The daily beast explains the process: instead of snipping the vas deferens as a vasectomy does, the contraceptive is shot directly into the reproductive tube; the polymer then keeps sperm from entering. To reverse it, another injection can flush out the polymer. The method could prove useful to \" a 20-something or 30-something man out on the dating market, \" according to a post in the new york times by a foundation official. But it won't likely be embraced by pharmaceutical companies, which bank on women taking \" the pill \" long-term, notes medical daily. At least one jezebel commenter isn't optimistic about vasalgel's appeal: \" something tells me that dudes will not be too keen on the injection aspect of this. \" ( a future birth-control chip for women could last 16 years. )",

Japanese monetary authorities bought dollars and sold trillions of yen, driving the yen down from 84.5 yen to the dollar to 82, the new york times reports. Their goal: to protect japanese exports, which have taken a beating this year as the yen hit a 15-year-high against the dollar. Japanese investors cheered, sending the nikkei up 2.3 %, according to bloomberg. But not everyone was a fan. \"intervention is like putting a band-aid on, \" an oksana securities analyst tells the wall street journal. It's \"not a fundamental solution. \" what japan really needs, critics argue, are major reforms to reduce its dependence on exports. The move also tells the rest of the world that it's looking out for no. 1, says michael shuman of time.

            "Tokyo — the japanese government's currency-market intervention wednesday was an attempt to apply short-term emergency treatment to rapidly deteriorating economic conditions, while avoiding measures to address the underlying causes. One reason policy makers resorted to intervention, despite widespread doubt about its effectiveness: they have largely exhausted their options for more-powerful cures. After nearly two decades of trying to prop up the economy with extensive fiscal and monetary steps, japan is grappling with government debts nearly twice the size of its economy, and interest rates hovering at or near zero since the mid-1990s. That severely limits what officials can do. Wednesday's trillion-yen currency-dumping..."

Researchers who spent a decade tracking insects 500 to 4,000 feet above the ground in south-central england using radar beams and nets found about 3.5 trillion bugs and butterflies migrate across the region each year — moving south in the fall and north in the spring, much like birds. To picture it another way: their mass is equal to about 20,000 airborne reindeer, reports the bbc. An ecologist says the number is \" stunning, \" per science, and another wonders how many more fly \" over the basins of the amazon or the congo? \" indeed, \" if you were to repeat this study almost anywhere else, i guarantee that you would exceed those numbers, \" study author jason chapman tells npr, citing england's cold and wet conditions. While small insects weren't picky about wind direction, scientists were surprised to find that larger insects appeared to be more deliberate in choosing whether to fly given current wind direction. \" it signifies that the insects have a compass mechanism in order to know which is north and south, but they also have the capability to then fly up high into the sky and assess the direction of the wind, \" compare the two, and decide what to do, which is \" quite complex, \" chapman says. The researchers also noted that the bugs weren't exactly leisurely flitting above. Some take advantage of fast-moving air currents to travel distances of up to 200 miles at speeds of up to 36 miles per hour. ( meet the world's longest-distance flier. )",

        "summary": "Five thousand. That's the number of man-portable air-defense systems — more conveniently known as manpads and able to down low-flying planes — venezuela has obtained from russia, according to a reuters scoop published monday. It's the largest stash of shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles in latin america, and while us officials are worried about them ending up in dubious hands, the idea of them being in government hands may not be much more palatable. \" the situation in venezuela continues to deteriorate, \" cia honcho mike pompeo told the senate earlier this month. President nicolas maduro \" gets more desperate by the hour. \" and many hours have passed since: the country on saturday logged its 50th day of often-violent protests. What you need to know: saturday's demonstrations were grim: the bbc and guardian report a 21-year-old was set on fire in caracas, and all but 20 % of his body was burned. He survived. There's some contention over whether he was a maduro supporter, as the president himself claimed, or accused by the crowd of being a thief. The death toll associated with the protests stands at 48. What do protesters want? a vote. The country has faced unrelenting food shortages, pervasive crime, and inflation that's believed to have exceeded 700 % last year — almost twice that in south sudan, reports the new york times, which notes the 2014 murder rate was on par with the civilian casualty rate in 2004 iraq. Many blame maduro and want him out ahead of schedule: the next presidential election isn't until late 2018. Why the situation is so ludicrous: a cbc analysis explains venezuela is thought to have a crude-oil reserve of about 300 billion barrels: \" even at reduced current world prices, back-of-the-envelope calculations show that oil wealth alone should make all venezuelan families us dollar millionaires. \" but that oil has been a curse: at least, according to a venezuelan political scientist quoted by the bbc. The country has put all its eggs in the oil basket, he argues, and that's produced an abject lack of investment, talent, and production outside the oil sector. So what's maduro's solution? convening a special assembly to rewrite the country's 1999 constitution. The opposition isn't on board, but the ap reports maduro on friday said the effort would move forward. It's not all maduro said friday: the trump administration recently imposed sanctions on eight members of venezuela's supreme court ( the protests followed a late-march court ruling that wrested legislative power from the opposition-controlled assembly, though the court then backtracked ), and",

Over the next year, he plans to track two male northern pacific rattlesnakes, each about 10 years old, found near the site of a wildfire that burned 36 square miles in kittitas county, wash., in 2012, reports the yakima herald. Chase is particularly interested to see if the snakes — embedded with small radio transmitters and data loggers to gauge body temperature — will avoid the burned area. He ' ll track the snakes ' movements a couple of times a week until the devices are removed next year and will also keep track of their growth. \" this is going to be the first study seeing how rattlesnakes are going to be affected by these large-scale events, which are getting more frequent and intense, \" he says. If snakes do avoid burned areas, chase predicts the results could be devastating. \" an ecosystem is pretty much just a network of all kinds of interactions happening, and so taking any component out is going to be bad, \" he says. Snakes are an important food source for eagles, owls, and badgers, and they provide a check on rodents and insects. However, penn state researcher chris howey, who is studying how timber rattlesnakes respond to fire in pennsylvania, says fire may actually benefit snakes. Less foliage, for example, may provide more opportunities for snakes \" to bask in the open and to maintain a warmer body temperature, \" he tells penn state news. \" this then could translate to things like digesting a meal a little bit better, growing a little bit faster, reaching sexual maturity sooner, and maybe even having more babies. \" ( here's why snakes lost their legs. )",

In a few short weeks, however, shrubs and forbs will poke through the ash, taking advantage of the nitrogen that was released during the fire. Turkeys will feed on the remains of dead insects, and small mammals will emerge from their burrows to feed on seeds of oaks and hickories, whose thick bark protected them from the heat of the fire. But what of less visible animals? penn state postdoctoral researcher chris howey is investigating how fire changes the landscape for often overlooked animals, like reptiles. \"when you think about the conservation of an animal, you think about food resources and shelter — the physical habitat, \" says howey. \"but when you start thinking about reptiles, they go beyond that; they also need thermal resources. \" as ectotherms, reptiles depend on their surroundings to maintain their body temperature, basking in the sunshine to warm up or seeking shady areas to cool down. This dependence may make them particularly sensitive to changes in the landscape made by burning.

From now on, those with grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins in the us should be allowed to visit, the judge ruled. Previously, the white house argued for a far more limited group: parents, spouses, fiances, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and siblings. The hawaii judge, however, declared that \" common sense \" requires that \" close family members be defined to include grandparents. \" in fact, \" grandparents are the epitome of close family members, \" he wrote. \" the government's definition excludes them. That simply cannot be. \" in another notable reversal, the judge said that people who didn't have family but only an agreement with a resettlement agency also should be exempted, reports politico. All this comes after the supreme court allowed the ban to temporarily stay in place but provided exemptions for those with \" bona fide \" relationships in the us. The hawaii decision is the first court case to try to suss out the definition of \" bona fide. \" the supreme court will hear arguments on the larger issue of whether the ban is unconstitutional in october.",

The order, issued thursday evening local time in honolulu by judge derrick watson in hawaii, deals a temporary blow to one of the president's signature initiatives.

The justices ' order allowed the administration to restrict entry by people from six mostly muslim countries, except for those who have what's judged to be a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united states, including close family members. A federal judge in hawaii this week expanded those relationships beyond what the trump administration approves — grandparents, for example. The filing with the supreme court says the lower court's expansion encompasses \" virtually all family members, \" and \" reads the term ' close ' out of the ( supreme ) court's decision. \" the administration asks either for a clarification of the court's meaning of close family, or a promise to rule on the question later, but with a stay of the hawaii order in the meantime. In an order issued late thursday, federal district court judge derrick watson not only added a list of relatives but also found that any refugees with ties to resettlement agencies in the u.s.

In one option, house republicans could propose an extension that would give speaker john boehner until the end of next month to gain approval of the trade adjustment assistance program, which will help workers who lose their jobs thanks to global trade agreements. Approval of the measure, part of the tpp, would give obama the needed authority, though it was defeated 302-126 on friday. Voting on the extension could take place today. \" there are senior white house officials who were in touch with members of congress over the weekend, \" says white house press secretary josh earnest, without mentioning names. Aides tell the times that obama and boehner spoke over the phone. Still, passage of the taa at this point seems unlikely as 70 democrats don't appear to have changed their minds. Officials are toying with the idea of adding the taa to a customs or must-pass bill, but many say democrats would still oppose it. An attempt to pass the fast-track authority alone may not garner the required votes, either, as some democrats who voted in favor of the measure on friday were only interested in the aid for workers. \" we obviously did a lot of heavy lifting over here to get the bill passed, \" senate majority whip john cornyn tells politico. \" but the truth is, this is the president's problem, and it's the democrats who basically cut him off at the knees. \"",

Democrats responded that it's up to republicans to figure out how to proceed. \"the point is, republicans have to decide how they can go [ forward ], then we ' ll have to make some response to that.

            "Mr. Boehner could schedule a vote to force a second effort on the aid known as trade adjustment assistance. But there were few indications monday that large numbers of democrats were ready to reverse themselves, approve the aid and send the trade legislation to the president's desk. Advertisement continue reading the main story the political dynamic became more complicated over the weekend when hillary rodham clinton, the party's leading presidential contender, expressed support for ms. Pelosi's efforts to try to make any future trade deal more palatable to democrats. Her statements could have provided lawmakers, already rallied by organized labor, more incentive to stand against giving the president added trade-negotiating authority. Advertisement continue reading the main story another option would be for republicans to try to persuade members of their own party, most of whom traditionally oppose such worker assistance, to vote for it in the interests of reaching their larger trade goal. But that would require about 90 republicans switching sides, an unlikely development, and leadership aides were skeptical of that approach.

Wilson approached brown because he and others \" were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic, \" said jackson.

The place was an indiana court, where richard hoagland had to appear for a hearing about back child support. The amount a judge ordered him to pay — $ 1.86 million — is eye-popping, as is the story behind it. The indianapolis star reports that story made headlines in 2016, when richard was arrested in zephyrhills, fla., where the then-63-year-old was living with his wife... Who knew him as terry jude symansky, the dead man whose identity he assumed after fleeing indiana in 1993, leaving matthew, brother douglas, and wife linda iseler behind. The ruse unraveled when the real symansky's nephew discovered via ancestry.com that symansky had \" married \" four years after his 1991 death. The palm beach post reports richard was sentenced in relation to the identity theft in may 2017 and moved back to indiana in april after serving his time. The following month he was in court again as iseler tried to collect the child support that had gone unpaid since he abandoned then-6-year-old douglas and 9-year-old matthew. The star notes richard showed up in court in clothes that seemed straight out of a thrift store, which the family took to be an attempt to appear impoverished. It didn't work, with magistrate william p. Greenaway noting in his ruling that richard had managed to acquire an airplane while in florida. But whether the money — almost $ 1.4 million of which is interest on the unpaid child support, per the journal gazette — will be paid remains to be seen, as his assets are also being considered as part of his florida divorce.

A twitter user says her american flight last month was delayed 45 minutes thanks to a faulty coffeemaker. A man says his hourlong flight in november was delayed 40 minutes for the same reason. And this isn't anything new: a dallas banker told the wall street journal in 2012 that a leaky coffeepot also grounded one of his flights. Because planes ' coffeemakers are so elaborate — they include circuit breakers, wiring insulation, and special latches to hold the pot in place, and they're sometimes hooked up to water tanks treated with chemicals — plenty of things can go wrong. Of course, you want officials to identify a problem that might present a fire risk. But even the smallest of issues can require the machine to be disabled ( no water or power ) or swapped for a functional one. Airlines realize this is an issue: united recently increased checks on coffeemakers, while american is considering replacing all of its machines, which can cost up to $ 20,000 apiece. In the meantime, know that flight delays blamed on coffeemakers are for your own safety. As a pilot wrote to the times in 2002, it's not worth risking \" an in-flight electrical fire for the sake of not having your flight delayed. \" ( see where flights are delayed most. )",

        "summary": "Don't be surprised if you hear leonard cohen's hallelujah dominating airwaves today as a tribute to the man described by some as the best songwriter who ever lived. But there's quite the story behind the song covered by more than 300 artists, including rufus wainwright, willie nelson, justin timberlake, neil diamond, and bob dylan. Part of an album released in the us by an independent label in 1986 — sony \" didn't think it was good enough, \" cohen later said — it took more than a decade before it became famous, usa today reports. Jeff buckley, who first heard john cale's cover on a 1991 cohen tribute album, recorded his own version in 1994. It was that version that finally became popular when buckley died in 1997. The creation of the song is also fascinating. Cohen reportedly wrote some 80 verses for hallelujah — which took five years to complete — though the finished version contained only five, reports the washington post. He later recalled sitting in a new york hotel room in his underwear while \" banging my head on the floor and saying, ' i can't finish this song. \" \" today, it's considered \" pop music's closest thing to a sacred text, \" according to maclean's magazine. In his 2012 book on the song, alan light called it \" an open-ended meditation on love and faith \" that's both \" joyous and despondent, a celebration and a lament. \" of course, it's not the only cohen song worth listening to. Time points out five others, including one released this year.",

We would have predicted the opposite: that three-quarters of the nation would embrace the possibilities of what amounts to a real-life mute button. But, apparently, no. Similarly counter to our expectations, far more americans yearn for the discovery of an unpublished agatha christie book ( 24 percent ) than one by j. D. Salinger ( 10 percent ).

( you can see them here. ) photos of a blood-splattered crime scene were also shown, but it was a watch case that seemed to be the focus of the day. At least one, and possibly two, expensive watches were stolen from it during the initial investigation, former police chief g.s. Van rensburg testified, which the defense emphasized showed shoddy police work, the telegraph notes. Though officers were searched at the scene, the watches didn't turn up. Other apparent missteps: van rensburg also described a ballistics expert picking up pistorius ' gun, cocking it, and removing the magazine without putting on gloves, the ap reports. Further, pistorius ' bathroom door, key to the case, was held in van rensburg's office as opposed to an evidence hold, which, the defense argued, means it's contaminated, per cnn — though the former chief noted that he felt the office, which only he had access to, was the safest place for it. ( the revelation of the door's whereabouts led van ransburg to quit. ) a last standout bit from his testimony: though pistorius'defense rests on his belief that an intruder was in the bathroom, van rensburg told the court the bathroom window was too high for \" someone to have gained access. \"",

A new study, however, shows early modern brits from 10,000 years ago, who migrated from europe over a land bridge into england, may not have been quite as pale as many of their colin firth-like contemporaries. The guardian reports on dna research out of university college london and the natural history museum that reveals \" cheddar man, \" a mesolithic skeleton found in gough's cave in 1903, had blue eyes, dark curly hair, and \" dark to black \" skin. The finding suggests that lighter-skinned europeans evolved later than previously thought. \" to come face-to-face with what this guy could have looked like... [ is ] something a few years ago we couldn't have imagined, \" one researcher tells the bbc. Scientists extracted his dna by drilling a hole in his skull to draw out bone powder. They focused on genes tied to hair, eye, and skin color and found cheddar man didn't have the reduced-pigmentation gene those with lighter skin have today in many euro populations. The researchers suspect a cereal-based diet back then may have lacked vitamin d, and so lighter skin tones may have evolved to draw in more sunlight for vitamin d, as individuals with more melanin aren't as efficient at producing vitamin d as their lighter-skinned counterparts. The upshot of the discovery, per the guardian: \" skin color was not always a proxy for geographic origin in the way it is often seen to be today. \" ( all human eyes are actually brown. )",

        "summary": "With flooding in the houston area not expected to abate until at least wednesday, municipalities in the area have begun issuing their first evacuation orders. Meanwhile, police continue nearly nonstop rescues of stranded residents, shelters are filling up, and many highways are impassable. All of which has some people asking: why didn't houston tell people to evacuate before the storm? here's a look at the back-and-forth: in defense: \" you literally cannot put 6.5 million people on the road, \" houston mayor sylvester turner said sunday in defending the no-evacuation decision, per cnn. \" if you think the situation right now is bad, you give an order to evacuate, you are creating a nightmare. \" city officials feared people could become trapped in cars. Lessons of rita: in 2005, local authorities ordered an evacuation ahead of hurricane rita, triggering mass gridlock. \" in the houston area, the muddled flight from the city killed almost as many people as rita did, \" per the houston chronicle, which notes that more than 100 died in the exodus. Conflicting messages: on friday, texas gov. Greg abbott said that \" even if an evacuation order hasn't been issued by your local official, if you're in an area between corpus christi and houston, you need to strongly consider evacuating. \" in response, a spokesman for the harris county office of homeland security and emergency management tweeted, \" local leaders know best, \" reports the washington post. No nudge: cnn meteorologist chad myers agreed with the decision not to issue a mandatory evacuation, but he says the lack of even a voluntary evacuation order may have lulled people into a false sense of security. That \" may have led people to stay because there was not even a nudge from local officials. \" smarter plan? kathleen blanco, governor of louisiana during hurricane katrina, tells the daily beast that finger-pointing would be inevitable no matter what local officials decided. However, she suggests the houston area lacked a plan. \" it's not apparent to us watching that they have developed a sensible evacuation formula, \" she says. \" you have to allow people in the southernmost regions to get out the quickest. \" harvey's different: harris county judge ed emmett, who had urged people to stay put, noted that harvey's danger wasn't so much the hurricane factor as the rain factor. The latter, he said, made the decision more difficult. \" with a rain event over a county of four-and-a-half million people, you don't know exactly where the rain is going to fall",

The late anthony bourdain once said after eating it, \" your breath will smell as if you'd been french-kissing your dead grandmother. \" so it's conceivable that more than 2 tons of the stuff crammed onto an airplane's cargo hold might overwhelm one's olfactory senses, which is exactly what happened in indonesia. The bbc reports a sriwijaya air flight destined monday for bengkulu out of jakarta was grounded for an extra hour after passengers almost got physical with crew members after boarding the plane and wrinkling their noses at the stench of the durian in the cargo hold. One passenger detailed his experience on facebook, noting that after complaining about the odor to a flight attendant, he \" finally yelled at the other passengers, ' [ who ] on this plane wants to fly??? \" the others apparently agreed that they didn't, he said, and as things got heated, passengers almost came to blows with the crew. Some passengers then got off the plane and said they wouldn't fly until the fruit was unloaded, which is what the crew eventually ended up doing, per abc australia. The bbc notes the fruit has been banned from certain hotels and various modes of public transit, including planes. Meanwhile, a rep for the airline sent a statement to the jakarta post insisting \" it's not illegal to carry durian in a flight as long as it is wrapped properly in accordance with flight regulations — carried inside the hold. Many airlines do this. \" ( could the durian also be an aphrodisiac? )",

To the dismay of victims ' families, lubitz, 63, instead argued his 27-year-old son was incapacitated by a carbon monoxide leak in the cockpit of the plane while the captain was locked out.

That's not enough to convince journalist tim van beveren, who spoke at the press conference alongside the elder lubitz.

Named after the russian physiologist who introduced the world to pavlovian classical conditioning and its subset aversion therapy, the pavlok wristband helps attach a negative association to an action as people shock themselves every time they engage in behavior they want to stop. And while the science is still out on any long-term effects, the new york times collects anecdotal reports about people using it successfully to quit smoking and cut back on snacking — along with some skepticism about the need for this $ 199 gadget. Creator maneesh sethi has also introduced the shockclock to help people get out of bed, though fortune has mixed reviews, noting that there are obvious workarounds to being shocked — such as sleepily taking the wristband off or sleeping through it. The zap lasts for less than a second, and its severity is programmable, with a broad range of 50 volts ( a \" strong vibration \" ) to 450 ( being stung by a bee with an xxl stinger ), reports cosmopolitan.

Using tough tones, he assailed republicans as the party of \"no, we can't \" – a play off his campaign slogan \"yes we can \" – and accused his critics of talking about him like a \"dog. \" but he said he'd keep fighting \"every single day, every single hour, every single minute \" to turn the economy around. But those same republicans said they had no interest in obama's new plan – a sign that it would face an uphill battle in congress. In his speech to the milwaukee area labor council, obama laid out the goals of his new program: rebuild 150,000 miles of roads; construct and maintain 4,000 miles of rail, enough to go coast to coast; and restore 150 miles of runways, while putting in a next-generation air traffic control system to reduce travel time and delays.

Doctors at the university of toledo diagnosed cat scratch disease as the culprit. \" anything that is exposed to the cat's mouth, including if you have a little scratch that the cat licks — that's how you can get it, \" says dr. Kris brickman. A cat also can pass it along through its fur, or if it bites or scratches hard enough to break the skin. It's extremely rare for the bacterial infection to cause blindness, though people with weak immune systems are more prone to serious complications, explains a cdc fact sheet. More typically, those affected come down with a headache or fever. \"i woke up one day and i couldn't see out of my left eye, \" janese walters tells the toledo tv station. \"i looked in the mirror and i thought i had pink eye or something. \" brickman says the eyes are vulnerable because of the way the infection affects blood vessels. The best safeguard is to wash thoroughly after playing with your cat — especially if it's a kitten — and to immediately clean any bites or scratches. A good flea treatment also helps, because that's how cats become infected in the first place, notes wpxi. Despite the ordeal, walters is keeping her cats.

            "Caitlyn, the abused pit bull mix found in north charleston a week ago, spent two hours in surgery on wednesday and veterinarians say they had to take less of her tongue than expected. After the surgery, she rested in her kennel, covered by a blanket and getting attention from the staff at veterinary specialty care in mount pleasant who have been providing round-the-clock care for the ailing pup. Dr. Henri bianucci at veterinary specialty care in mount pleasant said on tuesday he thought caitlyn may lose as much as 25 percent of her tongue during wednesday's surgery to reconstruct her jaw and take out the dead tissue in her lip and tongue. \" her tongue was in way better condition that we anticipated.

            "Caitlyn, the abused pit bull mix found in north charleston a week ago, spent two hours in surgery on wednesday and veterinarians say they had to take less of her tongue than expected. After the surgery, she rested in her kennel, covered by a blanket and getting attention from the staff at veterinary specialty care in mount pleasant who have been providing round-the-clock care for the ailing pup. Dr. Henri bianucci at veterinary specialty care in mount pleasant said on tuesday he thought caitlyn may lose as much as 25 percent of her tongue during wednesday's surgery to reconstruct her jaw and take out the dead tissue in her lip and tongue. \" her tongue was in way better condition that we anticipated.

Before dawn an american captain showed local village elders around what used to be the us base, the washington post reports, showing them the bullet-ridden crane and full fuel bladder they'd traded for an unmolested passage out of the valley. Since 2005, 42 americans have died in the valley — and many more afghans. Us troops originally came here to drive out al-qaeda, but they stayed on the theory that they could draw enemy fighters away from areas that were more important. But now stanley mcchrystal says he believes they were just an \"irritant to the people, \" instigating combat by their mere presence. \"i care deeply about everyone who's been hurt here, \" he tells the wall street journal. \"but i can't do anything about that. I can do something about people hurt in the future. \"",

Moretti, the son of a west point physics professor, and shamshir khan, a valley elder whose son had been jailed for killing two u.s.

        "summary": "The list of ways humans have altered the planet continues to grow: animals are becoming more nocturnal, possibly as a means of avoiding the superpredators we've become, per a new study. The meta-anaylsis of 76 studies on 62 mammal species across six continents, published in the journal science, found mammals were less active during daytime hours and more active at night when humans were nearby, regardless of whether the humans were threatening or not, reports the guardian. Study author kaitlyn gaynor of the university of california, berkeley, draws a comparison between humans and dinosaurs, pointing out it was only after the dinosaurs ' extinction that mammals emerged from the dark. \" humans are now this ubiquitous terrifying force on the planet and we are driving all the other mammals back into the night-time, \" she says. Evidence suggests this is the case with california's coyotes, brown bears in alaska, leopards in gabon, tigers in nepal, and boars in poland, per scientific american and outside. On average, mammals were 1.36 times more nocturnal in response to human activity, meaning an animal who historically split its active time between night and day now spends 68 % of its active time at night. \" that's pretty striking, \" says gaynor. Outside points out it's not all downside: this could mean fewer attacks on humans and less transfer of disease. But the change could also transform entire ecosystems, with gaynor giving the example of coyotes in california shifting from eating squirrels and birds to animals more active at night, like mice and rabbits. ( why 25 % of mammals commit infanticide. )",

A name has finally been bestowed upon the youngest child of prince william and kate middleton, reports people, ending four days of suspense since the baby's birth on whether the couple would go traditional or adventurous. Louis arthur charles is the boy's full name, per a kensington palace statement, and he ' ll go by \" his royal highness prince louis of cambridge \" — a \" surprise choice \" that \" confounded expectations, \" per cnn. Louis means \" renowned warrior \" in french, and although it's not a traditional brit name, it appears to have more than one tie to the royal family itself: prince philip's grandfather was named prince louis alexander of battenberg, prince charles had a favorite uncle named earl louis mountbatten, and louis is also part of the names of both the new baby's father ( william arthur philip louis ) and brother ( george alexander louis ). As for the infant's middle names: charles is obviously a shout-out to the baby's grandfather, and both prince william and prince charles boast arthur as part of their extended names. The three-time grandpa, for one, is looking forward to having louis in the mix. \" it is a great joy to have another grandchild, \" prince charles said in a statement, per people. \" the only trouble is i don't know how i am going to keep up with them. \" what appears to still be a source of confusion: whether to pronounce the baby's name \" loo-ee \" ( as cnn notes ) or \" loo-is \" ( as the sun claims ).

Unless they're doing something the kkk considers to be \" morally wrong, \" fox carolina notes. Jones also says that specific homes weren't targeted. \"we can't tell who lives in a house, whether they're black, white, mexican, gay, we can't tell that, \" he says. \" and if you were to look at somebody's house like that, that means you'd be pretty much a racist. \" his words of assurance aren't helping oconee residents feel much better. One man calls the bags \"unacceptable, \" and a woman says she and her neighbors are \" very angry, very upset, very ashamed … that this exists. \" it's not the first time the klan has used this stop-and-drop method: the christian science monitor reports that fliers stating \"seal the border — protect our nation \" were found in katy, texas, earlier this month, while the chicago tribune says that residents of an illinois suburb received kkk fliers with candy canes during the holiday season.

But making it to 110 ( and gaining the title supercentenarian ) is thousands of times harder — only 1 in 5 million do, according to time. The volunteer-based gerontology research group has been tracking these elderly elite, of which there are currently a confirmed 72, since 1990, and has published the list online for about 15 years. They call it table e, and 97.2 % of the people on it are women. And while the oldest living person is misao okawa of osaka, japan, the second oldest is american gertrude weaver, an arkansan who celebrated her 116th birthday on, of all days, the 4th of july. ( okawa has her beat by 121 days. ) the researchers tell smithsonian that it's a challenge to maintain the list because so many try to get on it who don't have the documents to confirm their age, or who are making false claims, like the turkish man who tried to assume his dead — and 10 years older — brother's identity. The group has 40 volunteers around the globe who work to suss out and confirm the supercentenarians. As part of the vetting process, the alleged supercentenarian must present two to three age-proving documents, like a birth or baptismal certificate, and a current photo id granted by an \" unbiased government agency. \" these requirements pose a problem in places like africa, china, and india, whose governments didn't keep birth records in the 1800s; table e currently contains no one from those locations, though the group expects that to change.

Sponsored links ireland's attorney lake lytal says the settlement is well deserved. \" when this case was first filed, many people criticized it simply because it occurred at a strip club, \" lytal told the press. \" but we feel the $ 650,000 settlement goes to show that this was a serious case with serious injuries. \" this isn't the first time a florida man filed a lawsuit for injuries sustained at strip club. According to the smoking gun, paul shimkonis lost his 1998 case against a clearwater club"

Today come the details: the bbc reports the total haul recovered from cornelius gurlitt's munich apartment was 1,258 unframed works and 121 framed ones, and they're in fairly extraordinary condition, with no damage beyond a layer of dirt. In that group are a number of works that were previously unknown, by greats such as henri matisse and marc chagall. But that's not the only thing that's unknown. The head of the augsburg state prosecutor's office says they don't know where the 80-year-old is right now, and, further, \" we don't have any strong suspicion of a crime that would justify an arrest. \" bloomberg reports that gurlitt made only infrequent visits to the apartment, which the new york times reports was targeted following an exchange between gurlitt and customs officials in september 2010. They found him holding $ 12,150 in € 500 notes while on a train arriving from switzerland, which they found suspicious.

Clinton made her initial comments — in which she credited nancy reagan with \" very effective, low-key advocacy \" — in an interview with msnbc during its coverage of her funeral. Soon after the interview aired, msnbc's twitter feed was flooded with comments accusing clinton of misrepresenting history and insulting the 1980s activists who pressured elected officials to step up the response to aids.
