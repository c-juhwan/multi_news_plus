Though gamecrush has been in a public beta stage since march, the site formally launched today. Players — generally, men — pay 60 cents a minute to play games on xbox live or an arcade game service against a \" playdate \" of their choice. But they also need to pony up for tips. And that tipping system hints at another side of gamecrush — players tip points to their playdates, who redeem them for cash. How exactly a playdate earns her tips is left open to the players, who are assured by gamecrush that their interactions are not monitored. There's even a special area of the site called \" the edge \" that's billed as an everything-goes chatroom. \" add it all up, \" writes ryan tate for gawker, \" and gamecrush looks like a cleverly veiled sex talk parlor. \"",

        "summary": "The predictions are getting worse: japanese officials today said that it could take as many as 40 years to decommission the fukushima nuclear plant, upping the previous estimate of 30 years. According to the detailed roadmap, tepco intends to spend the next two years clearing the spent fuel rods out of the storage pools situated in the reactor buildings; but the lion's share of the time will go to removing the melted nuclear fuel. That process will take some 25 years, and will necessitate the use of robots — and technologies that haven't even been invented yet, reports the new york times. The wall street journal zeroes in on one of the toughest steps in the process: figuring out how to drain thousands of tons of irradiated water from the reactor buildings ' basements. The cracks that the earthquake created in these buildings will then be repaired, allowing the reactors to be refilled with water, which must occur before the melted fuel can be removed from them. Once that process is complete, it ' ll be another five to 10 years until the reactors are completely decommissioned.",

            "Tokyo — japan unveiled its plan to clean up the fukushima daiichi nuclear plant and return the surrounding region to normal, a 40-year process that represents one of the most ambitious such efforts in history. The plan lays out a timetable to completely dismantle the plant, where reactors overheated dangerously following the march 11 earthquake and tsunami. It includes the development of robots to decontaminate the reactor buildings and technology to seal leaks in walls submerged in radioactive water. The path laid out is arduous and slow: officials estimate they won't finish plugging fukushima daiichi's leaky reactor buildings until 2018. Removing the melted fuel rods from three reactors will take 25 years, or until about 2036. Plant operator tokyo electric power co. Has estimated the decommissioning process will cost roughly ¥ 1 trillion ( $ 12.8 billion ), although that figure is expected to rise. The decommissioning plan follows a proposal announced earlier this week, to start — as early as april — to return to their homes some of the 88,000 evacuees from areas nearest the plant, and to spend at least ¥ 1 trillion on decontaminating towns, parks and roads. It comes as the government also considers tightening food-safety standards to permit only one-fifth of the radioactive cesium that current rules allow. Together, those proposals form the backbone of japan's plan to deal with the long-term repercussions",

The predictions were contained in a detailed roadmap for fully shutting down the three reactors, which suffered meltdowns after an earthquake and tsunami struck the plant on march 11. The government had previously predicted it would take 30 years to clean up after the accident at fukushima, the world's worst nuclear disaster since chernobyl in 1986. The nuclear crisis minister, goshi hosono, acknowledged that no country has ever had to clean up three destroyed reactors at the same time. Mr. Hosono told reporters the decommissioning faced challenges that were not totally predictable, but \"we must do it even though we may face difficulties along the way. \" the plan's release follows last week's declaration by prime minister yoshihiko noda that the plant had been put into the equivalent of a \"cold shutdown, \" a stable state that suggested the runaway reactors had finally been brought under control. Critics, however, immediately challenged that statement, saying it was impossible to call the reactors stable when their fuel had melted through the inner containment vessels, and appeared to be attached to the concrete bottom of outer containment"

They ' ll also be testing a new faq page, and it's an unusual one that distances cern from demons and satan. Since the lhc began smashing particles together, conspiracy theorists have suggested physicists were about to open a door to another dimension, allowing apocalyptic forces to reach our planet, reports the wall street journal. An editorial in michigan's daily reporter in september noted cern \" could easily and suddenly, without warning, destroy our universe. \" a few pointed out that cern's logo included the 666 sign of the antichrist. Then there was the group who planned to protest the smashing of particles at cern. \" i guess they more or less see particles as planets with very small ' people ' on them, \" a rep says. \" it got to the point where there really needed to be some intervention, \" says cern's social media rep. The faq page, born in september, not only describes cern's logo as depicting particle accelerators rather than a sign of satan, it also clarifies that \" cern will not open a door to another dimension, \" though physicists can test for particles that may suggest extra dimensions exist. The nice thing is that the page can always be updated, says a rep. For example, it doesn't yet address rumors of \" occult symbolism \" hidden in a dance opera filmed inside cern. But it isn't clear if all conspiracy theories can be crushed. Cern seems to inherently draw the \" conspiracy subculture, \" says a political science professor at syracuse university. \" any time you have forces that are high energy and invisible, they lend themselves to these kinds of interpretations. \"",

Unesco yesterday announced that five aquifers were identified and two have thus far been verified in the turkana region. The new york times reports one is roughly the size of rhode island, and npr reports that scientists described the aquifers ' orientation as like a small stack of \" interconnected pancakes. \" the two hold enough water to turn the dusty region into farmland and sate kenya's water needs for 70 years — or more. It's possible that run-off from the adjacent hills feeds the underground reservoir, which would expand that timeline, the christian science monitor reports. It's big news for a country that struggles mightily with access to safe drinking water, but there are also some big hurdles. The basins sit in the far northwest, which happens to be one of the country's most conflict-prone areas, and maintaining boreholes and piping the water would be no simple task. Still, kenya seems optimistic. \" we're hoping with the two test boreholes, the water should be available within a month, \" an official tells the bbc.

            "San francisco ( ap ) — a california judge has thrown out a proposed ballot initiative that advocated killing anyone who engages in gay sex, calling the measure \" patently unconstitutional. \" sacramento county superior court judge raymond cadei relieved california's attorney general late monday of the duty to clear the so-called sodomite suppression act for signature-gathering. Cadei said it would be \" inappropriate, waste public resources, generate unnecessary divisions among the public, and tend to mislead the electorate \" for attorney general kamala harris to process the proposal. Harris had asked for a judge's permission in march to reject the initiative through a legal complaint against its sponsor, orange county lawyer matthew mclaughlin. After mclaughlin did not attempt to defend the measure in court, the attorney general last week sought a default ruling in her favor, a request cadei granted. \" this proposed act is the product of bigotry, seeks to promote violence, is patently unconstitutional and has no place in a civil society. I applaud the court's decision to block its title and summary, \" harris said in a statement tuesday. Mclaughlin did not immediately reply to a telephone call seeking comment on tuesday.

            "San francisco ( ap ) — a california judge has thrown out a proposed ballot initiative that advocated killing anyone who engages in gay sex, calling the measure \" patently unconstitutional. \" sacramento county superior court judge raymond cadei relieved california's attorney general late monday of the duty to clear the so-called sodomite suppression act for signature-gathering. Cadei said it would be \" inappropriate, waste public resources, generate unnecessary divisions among the public, and tend to mislead the electorate \" for attorney general kamala harris to process the proposal. Harris had asked for a judge's permission in march to reject the initiative through a legal complaint against its sponsor, orange county lawyer matthew mclaughlin. After mclaughlin did not attempt to defend the measure in court, the attorney general last week sought a default ruling in her favor, a request cadei granted. \" this proposed act is the product of bigotry, seeks to promote violence, is patently unconstitutional and has no place in a civil society. I applaud the court's decision to block its title and summary, \" harris said in a statement tuesday. Mclaughlin did not immediately reply to a telephone call seeking comment on tuesday. He has not commented publicly on his motivations for pursuing the initiative since he paid $ 200 to submit it for processing.

Thestreet reports walmart started selling meal kits from companies like home chef and takeout kit on its website last weekend. Amazon, of course, entered the meal kit game over the summer. The way it works for walmart: customers buy meal kits on walmart.com, the meal kit companies fulfill the orders, and walmart gets a small commission and referral fee. The ceo of meal kit company terra's kitchen says it's \" a low risk model for walmart to see if their e-commerce shoppers will have an interest in meal kits. \" it also gives meal kit companies access to walmart's huge customer base, according to business insider. So far it seems like a success, with a number of the 30 meal kits available on walmart.com having reportedly sold out already. Meanwhile, blue apron continues to be collateral damage in the amazon-walmart war. The meal kit company went public in june only to see its stock tank when amazon got involved in meal kits. And now walmart is giving a boost to blue apron's competitors, the verge reports. While the meal kit industry is valued at more than $ 2 billion, blue apron's stock has dropped more than 70 % since the company went public.

The emails display up to 10 images — if there are more than 10 on a given day, the rest can be viewed via a link that stays active for seven days. After receiving \"tremendously positive \" feedback in pilot test runs, executive program director bob dixon says the program has been particularly appealing to people living with roommates, since they're not always first to retrieve their daily mail. Frequent travelers are another group utilizing the service, which dixon personally attests to as one of informed delivery's first users. He tells npr that he was able to flag a jury duty summons while on the road and asked his son to set it aside so it didn't get lost in a towering mail pile. With the rate of mail delivery declining ( 61.2 billion pieces of first-class mail were handled by usps in 2016 compared to 98 billion in 2006 ), the service is one way the post office is innovating and trying to remain relevant. \" our emerging consumers, younger folks, are digital natives, \" dixon says. \" that's how their communications are coming to them. \" usps has opened sign-up for informed delivery at: informeddelivery.usps.com.

        "summary": "You probably thought ducks were cute waddlers who liked to eat your stale bread. Poof, your bubble has been burst. The bbc reports wild mallard ducks have been spotted eating other birds, swallowing one nearly whole, an \" extraordinary \" behavior that has never been observed before. Zoologist silviu petrovan of the university of cambridge was birdwatching at a reservoir in romania when he spotted a flock of mallards hunting a fledgling that had landed on the water. A female duck grabbed the grey wagtail in her beak, dunked it several times beneath the water, then ate it, petrovan says. A black redstart landed soon after and \" was almost instantaneously attacked \" by 10 juveniles, per the study in the journal waterbirds. Though mallards in california have been sighted munching on sand crabs, the ducks usually eat plants, insects, and the occasional small fish. As far as scientists can tell, such predatory behavior not involving fish or amphibians has never been seen before. It's not only \" very rare \" but also likely a new phenomenon, says petrovan, noting mallards have \" not... Really evolved \" to digest bones and feathers. \" the mallard was massively struggling to eat that wagtail, presumably because it couldn't actually tear it to pieces \" due to the design of its bill. So why would a duck eat a bird at all? petrovan suggests \" pressure for those fast-growing juveniles to get animal protein intake. \" ( these birds are probably safe. )",

            "The mallard ( anas platyrhynchos ) is one of the largest and most abundant and widespread duck species in the world, and also the most hunted waterfowl species in europe with around 4.5 million birds shot annually ( hirschfeld and heyd 2005 ). Mallards are widely adaptable, from sedentary or dispersive to fully migratory, and they inhabit almost every wetland type from natural to man-made, including reservoirs, urban parks and irrigation canals ( carboneras 1992 ). Due to their importance as a game species and as the wild relative of the domestic duck, mallard diet has been well described. They are regarded as omnivorous, feeding by dabbling in shallow water under 1 m in depth and by grazing on land ( snow and perrins 1998 ). Their diet primarily consists of aquatic and terrestrial plants as well as various terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates ( dessborn et al. 2011 ), but may occasionally include amphibians or fish ( carboneras 1992; olsen et al. 2011 ). The digestible protein content of the food, especially animal protein from insect larvae, appears to be a major factor for the survival and growth rate of the ducklings ( street 1978 ). High-protein food is also required by mallards during egg-laying, whereas other energy-demanding phases rely on food of plant origin to increase fat deposits ( pehrsson 1984 ).

        "summary": "You've heard the message, seen the magazine covers: having more sex will make you happier. A new study out of carnegie mellon university, however, suggests that the opposite is true, according to a post at phys.org. In their experiment, researchers asked one group of married couples to have twice as much weekly sex as usual over a three-month period, and they gave no instructions to a second group. All the couples filled out surveys along the way, and, as bustle notes, \" this is where things get weird. \" those who had double the amount of sex reported lower levels of sexual enjoyment and happiness at the end of the experiment than they did at the beginning. The lead researcher is the first to acknowledge that the reason might be because the couples were instructed to have more sex as part of a research experiment, not the most thrilling of circumstances. He elaborates, with some oddly specific advice: \" if we ran the study again, and could afford to do it, we would try to encourage subjects into initiating more sex in ways that put them in a sexy frame of mind, perhaps with baby-sitting, hotel rooms, or egyptian sheets, rather than directing them to do so. \" another researcher adds that couples should be less focused on numbers and more on creating the right environment when they do have sex. Or as wired sums up: \" the moral of the story, folks, is that it's all about quality over quantity. \" ( another study finds that millennials will have fewer sexual partners than their parents. )",

        "summary": "Chameleons may not be the only creatures on the planet capable of shade shifting, but they're probably the best at it — panther chameleons in particular. They can go from green and blue hues to yellow and red ones in a matter of minutes, and scientists say they now think they know how. Reporting in nature communications, researchers say that instead of relying on pigments, these reptiles also boast nanocrystals called iridophores beneath their skin, which contract or expand to essentially reflect different levels of light. To study this, the researchers observed the male panther chameleon of madagascar — which isn't easy given how skilled they are at shade shifting. \" i assure you: in madagascar, they are really difficult to spot, \" study co-author michel milinkovitch, a biophysicist at the university of geneva, tells the los angeles times. By filming color changes and examining the chameleons'skin using transmission electron microscopy, the scientists were able to see two layers of skin with iridophores. It turns out that tiny guanine nanocrystals boast very specific spacing between each crystal that in turn reflects different layers of light — shorter spacing reflects blue light, longer spacing red. By interacting with yellow pigment cells ( xanthophores ) in the skin, greens and oranges emerge. What's more, some less-organized crystal spacing may even reflect near-infrared light, helping to cool the chameleons. \" we need to continue investigating the chameleons, \" milinkovitch adds, \" because part of the answers are there and nowhere else. \" ( chameleons don't necessarily boast longevity. )",

Skin structure and raman spectroscopy we examined the skin ( ultra ) structure by histology and tem, using standard procedures, for example, as described in ref. 14. Samples were taken with biopsy pinches ( diameter 2 mm ) from male skin patches: when comparing skin before and after excitation, biopsies were separated by a maximum distance of 1 cm. For the relaxed state, the biopsy was taken within a few seconds after taking the animal from its cage and immediately placed in fixative. For the excited state, the animal was engaged in a male – male combat and a biopsy was taken again. The colour of skin biopsies was checked after fixation, to ensure that only those samples with well-preserved colours were used for tem.

That's \" beyond index \" ( the scale goes to 500 ), and more than 20 times what the world health organization calls safe, the ap reports. The government has closed 103 factories and cut its vehicle use by 30 %, reuters adds. Over the past two weeks, pollution levels have largely held to dangerous numbers; the who says anything above 20 isn't healthy, while above 300 is \" hazardous. \" it's a particularly bad time for flights to be canceled, with travel peaking around the chinese new year on feb. 10.",

He also was known for his humanitarian work, becoming a unicef goodwill ambassador in 1991. Moore received a knighthood for his charity work in 2003, thus becoming sir roger moore. The hollywood reporter says moore's bond was \" more of a charmer than a fighter, \" especially in contrast to the original sean connery take. And it seems moore agreed with that: \"my personality is entirely different than previous bonds, \" he once said. \" i ' m not that cold-blooded killer type.

I have always thought that my first responsibility is not to serve a political party but to serve my constituents, my state, and my country, and then to work across party lines to make sure good things get done for them. \" \" the politics of president kennedy — patriotic service to country, support of civil rights and social justice, pro-growth economic and tax policies, and a strong national defense — are still my politics. So maybe that means that jfk wouldn't fit into any of today's partisan political boxes neatly. \" some first reactions: steve kornacki, salon: \" he could run as a democrat, he could run as republican, he could run as an independent, but each path led to the same glum place. So he's hanging it up instead. \" it's fitting that it ends this way, given that he perfected the role of \" every republican's favorite democrat \" when he first ran in 1988, then settled into that role in the senate.

One of the teens is a us citizen, but not much else is known about him. Two of the teens are age 16 and the third is 19, and they were reportedly hitchhiking home last night when snatched near hebron, reports haaretz. The best guess is that militants will try to use them in a swap for prisoners held in israeli jails. Israeli police got a cell phone call from one of the youths about 10pm yesterday, and though he didn't speak, the noise in the background suggested they were in trouble, reports the new york times. The only lead is the discovery of stolen, burnt car in the area. Benjamin netanyahu, who has met with his senior leaders on the case, says he holds the palestinian authority responsible for the boys'safety. The development comes less than two weeks after palestinians formed a new government, though israel thinks it's controlled by hamas and refuses to negotiate on anything beyond security issues.",

Back in 1993, the man who published salman rushdie's the satanic verses in norway was shot three times outside his home. William nygaard survived, but no arrests were ever made. This week — two days before a deadline that would have forced police to close the case — authorities finally filed charges, reports the new york times. However, they're releasing few details, not specifying how many people are charged, their names, or what, if any, evidence exists. About the only thing authorities will say is that they think the shooting is indeed related to the controversy over rushdie's book and that the suspects are \" foreign nationals who are not in norway, \" per the afp. \" this is good news, and one can hope that this 25-year-old case will now finally advance, \" rushdie said in a statement, though he criticized the withholding of names and nationalities of the suspects. Nygaard, now 75, also praised the development and said he has no regrets about his decision to publish. As for his unexpected survival despite being shot three times: \" i used to be a very good norwegian ski jumper, \" he said. Rushdie's book first came out in 1988, and iran's supreme leader at the time considered it so blasphemous to islam that he issued a fatwa on rushdie that forced the author into hiding and remains in effect to this day. As recently as 2016, groups in iran raised $ 600,000 to beef up a bounty already estimated to be $ 4 million.",

I couldn't stop reading — i even set up a dedicated @adamslisa column in tweetdeck – but i felt embarrassed at my voyeurism, \" keller explained. \"should there be boundaries in this kind of experience? is there such a thing as tmi? are her tweets a grim equivalent of deathbed selfies, one step further than funeral selfies? why am i so obsessed? \" keller's rhetorical questions were met with anger and hurt from her audience",
            "Unranked media power couple bill and emma keller have discovered a question so pressing, so important to our time that they both felt the need to write a column in their respective papers about it in the same week. Is lisa bonchek adams, a stage four cancer patient, having cancer wrong? according to the kellers, the answer is \" yes. \" the biggest problem in their views, seems to be that adams — who is aggressively blogging and tweeting about every aspect of illness and treatment — just won't be quiet about having cancer. Emma keller, who has had cancer herself, published a critical op-ed in the guardian last wednesday about adams's twitter feed. In it, keller seems to be concerned about whether adams's decision to publicly discuss her diagnosis and treatment is \" dignified, \""

The former house speaker made the plea today at a federal courthouse in chicago, reports the chicago tribune. Hastert, who is accused of making illegal cash withdrawals from his bank accounts, has largely been in seclusion since the news broke, notes politico. He reportedly was paying hush money to cover up allegations that he molested a male high school student decades ago. ( this woman says her late brother was molested, too. ) hastert, 73, didn't address reporters'shouted questions as homeland security officers escorted him into the courthouse. The new york times gets into detail: \" after making his way through the building's revolving doors, mr. Hastert walked slowly, his body slightly hunched, toward the metal detector. A courthouse security officer used a wand on him after the metal detector sounded when he walked through. \" he was later released on a $ 4,500 bond, reports the washington post. Hastert faces up to 5 years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines on each of the two felony counts against him. ( he's got a high-profile lawyer, however. )",

        "summary": "Should you ever need heart surgery, it might be worth pressing for an afternoon appointment. New research in the lancet finds patients who undergo morning heart surgery are twice as likely to suffer heart issues and other complications as patients who have surgery in the afternoon, per the bbc. It's not that doctors are drowsy in the morning and therefore prone to mistakes. Rather, researchers say the body's circadian rhythm regulates genes that are in top form and better able to handle stress in the afternoon, a fact that also explains why one's risk of heart attack is highest in the morning. To discover this, researchers conducted several studies, one monitoring 596 patients who underwent an aortic valve replacement, half in the morning, half in the afternoon. After 17 months, they found 18 % of morning patients had suffered a major adverse cardiac event, acute heart failure, cardiovascular death, or a heart attack during the operation, compared to 9 % of afternoon patients. Morning patients also had twice the risk of other complications, per the study, which identified 287 genes linking the body clock to heart health, reports the independent. A second study also found morning patients had significantly higher levels of troponin, a measure of heart damage, per the new york times. This doesn't mean morning surgeries should be avoided, but \" we should identify patients at high risk for complications — those with diabetes or other metabolic risks, for example — and operate on those in the afternoon, \" a study author tells the times.",

        "summary": "Synthesized versions of tetrahydrocannabinol — that's thc, the active ingredient in marijuana — already exist in pill form and are used to treat nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss that often follows cancer treatments or appears in patients with aids. But a new process out of germany could offer a less expensive, easier way to create this cannabis component from scratch, with nary a marijuana leaf in sight: genetically engineering it from yeast, the new york times reports. Biochemists at the technical university of dortmund say in a paper published in the biotechnology letters journal that by using the yeast, a consistent supply of thc for medicinal purposes could be generated without growing pot. \" this is something that could literally change the lives of millions of people, \" the ceo of a company that produces yeasts for thc and cannabidiol — another compound used for medicinal purposes — tells the times. Japanese experimenters were among the first to eke out one of the necessary thc enzymes from yeast nearly a decade ago, and since then, less expensive and quicker dna technology has helped scientists across the board find the rest of the genes needed to make thc. Right now only a small amount of thc can be generated from the yeasts, though scientists are working on boosting that production with some finagling of the gene-engineering process. And yeast does have one big competitor when it comes to producing thc: marijuana itself, with some varieties containing an ample 30 % thc content by dry weight, the times notes. \" right now, we have a plant [ that's ] essentially the ferrari of the plant world when it comes to producing the chemical of interest, \" a professor who helped out with earlier gene-sequencing efforts tells the paper. \" cannabis is hard to beat. \" ( hemp isn't pot, by the way — and there's just one gene that separates them. )",

            "Kcbs-tv channel 2 reporter serene branson smiled uneasily. She was back in the newsroom thursday for the first time since becoming an instant — and reluctant — media sensation after she had infamously garbled her words during a live report at the grammy awards but the 31-year-old journalist wasn't going back to work just yet. Instead she was back to be interviewed by her anchor, pat harvey, and to finally view the 17-second clip that triggered ridicule, concern and speculation that she'd suffered an on-air stroke or worse. She had deliberately avoided the clip, fearing it would only aggravate her stress as doctors raced to determine the medical cause behind the misfire.eyeing a monitor in the newsroom, branson quietly observed the report in which she began speaking incoherently. She felt a chill as she watched herself trying so hard to be professional but realizing that something was horribly wrong. \" one thing i've learned when working as a journalist is that when people are uncomfortable or unhappy, they react differently to what they're truly feeling, \" she said. \" that was me feeling a little uncomfortable at what happened to me. I consider myself a perfectionist. And there i was, frustrated and terrified because the words i wanted to come out were not coming out. \" branson's chill seemed to pass quickly —",

The very serious-sounding history institute of the dprk academy of social sciences released a report about it, saying the unicorn's refuge was outside a temple in pyongyang. Conveniently, the report added that the lair — which is associated with an ancient legend — proves pyongyang once played a key role in a united korea. How did they spot the lair? it has \" a rectangular rock carved with words ' unicorn lair ' \" sitting outside, the report said. North koreans aren't the only ones dipping into old stories: villagers in the serbian town of zarozje say a vampire has been stalking the area since its home, a grain mill, fell over a few months ago, the ap reports. Locals seem divided about whether it's real or just an attempt to boost tourism in an impoverished area, but the legend of blood-sucking sava savanovic does date back centuries. \" if romanians could profit on the dracula legend with the tourists visiting transylvania, why can't we do the same with sava? \" says a local council member.",

As some moderates backed away from the plan, health and human services secretary tom price said white house officials \" strenuously disagree \" with the \" not believable \" cbo report, which predicts that 24 million fewer americans will have health insurance a decade from now if the house health care plan replaces the affordable care act. A roundup of coverage: house speaker paul ryan went for a glass-half-full approach and highlighted the report's prediction of a smaller deficit, the washington post reports. The bill is about \" giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford, \" ryan said. \" when people have more choices, costs go down. \" top republicans showed no sign of backing away from the bill after the report, though some gop senators expressed deep misgivings, the hill reports. Sen. Bill cassidy called the cbo score \" awful, \" while others said they would wait for the house's final version. Sen. Lindsey graham said the chamber would work to improve the house product, not reject it. Democratic leaders chuck schumer and nancy pelosi held a joint press conference and called for the house bill to be dumped, the guardian reports. \" in terms of insurance coverage it's immoral, in terms of giving money to the rich at the expense of working families it is indecent and wrong, \" pelosi said. House republican rob wittman said he's opposing the house bill because of the cbo report. \" it is clear that this bill is not consistent with the repeal and replace principles for which i stand, \" he said in a statement posted on facebook. \" i do not think this bill will do what is necessary for the short and long-term best interests of virginians and therefore, i must oppose it. \" the new york times takes a look at the report's findings and at who will be most affected by the house health bill. Those most likely to lose health insurance under the plan are low-income people without children who gained medicaid coverage under the affordable care act.

        "summary": "A black employee at a bay area-based construction firm is suing the company for racial discrimination and harassment, alleging that her supervisor gave her confederate-themed gifts at a holiday party before firing her in march. Tishay wright, a former project administrator at southland construction management, claims the gifts were retaliation from boss and co-owner kenneth hayden after wright objected to him calling her and another female employee \"my bitches, \" courthouse news reports. According to sf gate, the suit says hayden stopped wright from picking a present at an anonymous company christmas exchange and handed her a special wrapped gift. Inside she found a confederate flag-decorated purse with photos inside of hayden dressed as president trump sitting before a confederate flag and posters reading \"the southland shall rise again \" and \"make southland great again. \" \"i couldn't believe what i had received from my bosses, \" wright says. \"it takes me back to slavery days. I am not a slave. \" wright claims she was fired in march after telling co-owner anita hayden that the gifts were inappropriate. The suit alleges further discriminatory workplace behavior by the haydens, claiming that along with reducing her responsibilities after she complained about kenneth's language, the supervisors used racist rhetoric, including telling a sikh intern to \"go get your people before they blow something up \" and often joking that mexican workers could be paid in beer. Southland construction has yet to issue a statement regarding the complaint filed on thursday. \"i kept being told by my family to not be afraid to speak up, \" says wright, who hails from liberal berkeley, where she \"never encountered anything like this. \"",

The drop is owed to many factors, including internal squabbles, legal troubles, the improving economy, widespread demoralization at president obama's re-election — and the adoption of some extremist policies by mainstream politicians, the splc says.

Democrats are calling for additional measures before they ' ll provide such authority as obama pushes for passage of the trans-pacific partnership. Senators in his party want to address currency manipulation, child labor laws, and the possibility of job losses, among other concerns, before the trade deal is agreed, the times notes. \" we can't keep pushing through trade deals that benefit multinational companies at the expense of workers, \" democratic sen. Elizabeth warren told npr this morning, as cnn notes. Among those who opposed the measure was democratic co-sponsor ron wyden of oregon. Majority leader mitch mcconnell called the vote \" shocking \": \" what we've just witnessed here is the democratic senate shut down the opportunity to debate the top economic priority of the democratic president of the united states. \" obama could now be stuck between a rock and a hard place: he might have to accept democrats ' provisions to pass the measure — but doing so could spell disaster for the trade negotiations themselves, the times reports.",

Government, which aims to choke off tehran's oil revenue and force a halt to nuclear development it believes is aimed at making weapons, said india, south korea, japan and turkey have made significant cuts to oil imports from iran. Iran says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. The european union will impose a full embargo on iran's oil from july 1. The measure will also effectively cut off tanker insurance, a major problem for asian buyers who traditionally account for the bulk of iran's oil sales. The iea report came out days ahead of nuclear talks in moscow between iran and world powers - the united states, britain, france, germany, russia and china. The organisation of the petroleum exporting countries, of which iran is a member, will meet in vienna this week to discuss production running at a multi-year highs. U.s. Ally saudi arabia has been stepping up supply to replace lost iranian barrels. Earlier this year, oil prices rallied to $ 128 a barrel, their highest since 2008, on fears of a loss of iranian production. But they have since fallen below $ 100 per barrel on signs of slowing economic growth in china, weak u.s. Data and an escalation in europe's debt crisis. The iea said the world was better supplied with oil now than in recent years but warned against calling it an over-supplied market. \" nobody knows exactly how",

Teena brayen says burglars broke into her home early tuesday while her family was sleeping and made off with five shotguns, a high-powered rifle, a pellet gun, $ 1,000 worth of ammunition, 12 machetes, smoke grenades, a bulletproof vest, and food rations, reports abc5. Brayen and her husband are members of militia group three percenters — a name based on the claim that just 3 % of the us population fought in the american revolution, per the washington post — and hoped to use the supplies to protect and provide for themselves in the event of catastrophe, or perhaps invasion by another country, brayen tells fox 8. Brayen, who believes thieves saw the family moving weapons into their cleveland home when they moved from new york a month ago, says she fears for \" military personnel, especially, and our police officers \" as one of the weapons taken \" looks like a sniper rifle \" and can pierce bulletproof vests and even cars. \" they're ready for a war, \" she says of the thieves. \" we were war-ready. \" brayen adds she believed the weapons and gear were secure when she went to sleep on monday night, but now suspects one of her two children left a door to the home unlocked. \" i don't want to see anybody get hurt by what people took out of my home, \" she says.
