        "summary": "Cornell university students have long wandered through a nearly 200-year-old tunnel that one nature official describes as \" one of the most dangerous places in the entire finger lakes region, \" mainly to get to a popular ( but illegal ) swimming hole. Now, after two student drownings in seven years, the fight is on to close off the entrance to ezra's tunnel with a steel gate, preventing curiosity seekers from entering the dangerous fall creek gorge and the swimming hangout at the bottom of ithaca's forest falls, the new york times reports. The city council is set to vote wednesday on the gate, and it's a proposal backed by local police and fire officials, who've made at least five rescues from the gorge over the past couple of summers. The cornell daily sun says a deal has been struck that would have cornell pay for the gate, with the city of ithaca retaining \" sole ownership \" of it. Not only are officials worried about drownings, they fear chunks of ceiling may fall as people pass through. Still, per the daily sun, hundreds have signed a petition against the gate, with many saying the city's gorges are what makes ithaca ithaca, and that if the tunnel entrance is blocked, students will find more dangerous ways into the gorge. Their suggestion: implement warning signage, a guide to the area, and seasonal restrictions based on water levels. But the mom of a 17-year-old who died there this summer says she wants to ensure no other family suffers tragedy. Even ithaca's mayor, who says he's conflicted on the gate, concedes the perils. \" unfettered access to the natural world is one of the perks of living in ithaca, \" says svante myrick. \" but this is an attractive nuisance — a danger that is too cleverly disguised. \" ( a college student's spelunking trip almost ended in disaster. )",

Once we had our first child and i was making a full time go of redstate, christy had to work if we were to have insurance. Frankly, we could not make ends meet on my salary alone and, even after the cost of day care, had to have the remainder of christy's salary to help make ends",
            "Megyn kelly took two of her fox colleagues to the woodshed this afternoon. In response to erick erickson and lou dobbs making controversial comments this week about a pew study finding that 40 % of american households have a mother as breadwinner, kelly brought the two of them onto her show and proceeded to tear into them. To recap: during a wednesday evening segment of fbn's lou dobbs tonight, erickson, dobbs, and other fox male contributors lamented the pew study's \"troubling \" findings, claiming it signaled a disintegration of the american family. Erickson went the farthest with his analysis, claiming it is \"anti-science \" to not believe that men are supposed to play the dominant role in the household. The group collectively bemoaned the increase of female breadwinners. In response, this afternoon, kelly asked: \"what makes you dominant and me submissive and who died and made you"

Charles county, missouri, responded to a medical emergency at berry's home saturday afternoon, but he was unresponsive and could not be revived. Berry first hit the top 10 in 1955 with \" maybellene, \" and remained a rock fixture from then on. Coming later was the iconic \" johnny b. Goode, \" ( watch that one here ) and a slew of classics such as \" roll over beethoven, \" \" sweet little sixteen, \" \" school days, \" \" rock and roll music, \" \" back in the usa, \" and \" memphis, tennessee. \" as rolling stone puts it, his \" rollicking songs, springy guitar riffs and onstage duck walk defined ( rock and roll ) during its early years and for decades to come. \" the washington post notes that he was not only a \" seminal figure \" in rock's early days, he was a rarity in that he wrote, sang, and played his own music. The beatles, the rolling stones, bob dylan, and bruce springsteen are just a few of those who considered him a major influence. In fact, john lennon once famously said, \" if you tried to give rock-and-roll another name, you might call it 'chuck berry. ' \" the st. Louis native began his musical career at age 15 at a high school review, though his first hit didn't come until his late 20s, notes ap, whose story recounts berry's multiple run-ins with the law. It also sums up his influence on music this way: \" while elvis presley gave rock its libidinous, hip-shaking image, berry was the auteur, setting the template for a new sound and way of life. Well before the rise of bob dylan, berry wedded social commentary to the beat and rush of popular music. \"",

Some 420 city customers were due to lose their water supply yesterday in a city where almost 45 % of 173,000 residential water accounts are past due. Following appeals to the un, experts have suggested that the shutoffs may violate human rights, the ap notes. Now, detroit is dropping fees for water restoration and late payments; it's also allowing residents to enter payment plans by putting forward 10 % — rather than the previously-required 30 % — of money owed. \" the new system seems to be working very well, \" says a rep for detroit mayor mike duggan. Some 25,000 are now on payment plans, per the city, compared to 17,000 a month back, the los angeles times reports. Yet thousands still appear unable to pay their bills, the paper notes; some 38 % of people in the city are living below the poverty line.

The technique is relatively easy for anyone who knows about molecular biology, and it's already been tested in mice, rats, and monkeys, the new york times reports. But a group of 18 biologists, including a crispr-cas9 inventor, cautions the dangers of genome-editing in a new study and warns \" scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, germline genome modification for clinical application in humans \" until the consequences \" are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations. \" in a similar essay last week, several scientists called for a moratorium on gene-editing research that \" could be exploited, \" as \" an ethical breach could hinder a promising area of therapeutic development. \" scientists around the world won't be forced to abide by the request, but the biologists hope to use their \" moral authority \" to bar experiments in parts of the world where lab research isn't well regulated. Similar requests have been agreed to in the past; however, scientists tell nature that research papers about created human embryos with edited genomes have already been submitted for publication. Ethicists say editing human dna to boost intelligence or beauty should never be attempted, but there are also potential dangers as the process can change genes apart from the ones intended. \" you could exert control over human heredity with this technique, and that is why we are raising the issue, \" an expert says.

Volpe explores the various ways society has so far suggested we deal with a great loss, from freud's theory that grief is hard psychological work that needs dedicated time, to elisabeth kubler-ross ' \" five stages of grief \" mode ( the default resource of sorts ) for people in emotional pain, to the dual-process paradigm, in which people alternate between dealing with their grief and putting it aside, so hope \" returns gradually. \" but volpe notes that because everyone grieves differently, and for different lengths of time, it can be hard to treat complicated grief. Enter katherine shear, a cgt ( complicated grief therapy ) pioneer. Cgt, which shear has been using since the mid- ' 90s, is a highly structured, intense method that combines cognitive behavior therapy with \" exposure therapy. \" that includes the hard stuff like taking part in activities that remind you of a lost loved one or recounting the day that person died — i.e., asking patients to \" go toward the grief. \" as volpe puts it, grief is a \" problem of narrative, \" where people get frozen in one part of the story. Cgt helps the patient get \" unstuck \" and take control of plotting the tale so he or she can \" begin to imagine a new story \" and resume living. Read more about this unusually deep type of sorrow, including why shear wants it categorized as a grief disorder in the dsm — and why others don't.

            "Center director ks2394@columbia.edu my job at the center is to steer our team to successful projects that will improve the lives of people suffering from complicated grief. As founder and director of the center i am involved in all aspects of our work. I oversee the website, supervise all of our staff, lead our training initiatives and spearhead our fund-raising efforts. You might think this is a full time job, but in fact i have one of those. I serve as the marion e. Kenworthy professor of psychiatry at columbia school of social work so i am a senior member of an academic faculty at a large university. If you are interested – that means research, teaching, writing, presenting and administrative responsibilities at the school. I have a lot of energy and i feel very lucky to be able to contribute in this way to the center, the school of social work and columbia university. I began working with complicated grief in the mid 1990's, when colleagues at the university of pittsburgh asked me to help figure out how to treat people suffering in this way. To do so i reached out to grief counselors, studied the science of attachment, loss and grief, enlisted the help of friends and colleagues and supervised clinicians in a pilot project. The approach that grew out of this early work was influenced",
            "​the pain and sorrow of bereavement is supposed to get easier to bear as time passes. But what if it doesn't? psychiatrists call it \" complicated grief \" – and it can be treated. After stephanie muldberg's 13-year-old son eric died of ewing's sarcoma in 2004, she was lost in a sea of grief. Her days were long, unstructured, monotonous. She barely left her new jersey home. When she did leave, she planned her routes carefully to avoid driving past the hospital, just a few miles away, where eric had been treated during the 16 months of his illness, or the fields where he had played baseball. Grocery shopping was a minefield, because it was painful to contemplate buying eric's favourite foods without him. To enjoy anything when he could not felt wrong. And muldberg never thought she would be able to return to the temple where he had celebrated his bar mitzvah – and where his funeral was held. Looking back, she describes herself as not knowing how to grieve after eric died. \"i didn't know what to do, how to act in front of people – what i needed to do privately, who i could reach out to. I was fearful of making people more emotional, too emotional, and having to comfort them"

In court papers obtained by the ottawa citizen, the 32-year-old coleman says joshua boyle, her 34-year-old canadian husband, became mentally and physically abusive, confining her to a shower stall for weeks at a time and once hitting her hard enough to break her cheekbone. Coleman, who gave birth to the couple's three children in captivity and is pregnant with their fourth, says she only agreed to go backpacking with boyle in central asia after he promised they wouldn't go to afghanistan. She was five months pregnant when they were kidnapped by taliban-linked militants after taking a taxi from a kabul guesthouse in october 2012. Boyle gives a radically different account of their time in captivity in the court papers, which were filed as part of a custody battle in canada, the guardian reports. He admits hitting coleman once, after she allegedly tried to overdose on medication, but he says he became the children's main caregiver after coleman neglected them. He says he went without food so coleman and the children could have more, whittled toys from wood, sewed clothes and blankets, and even caught mice for them to have as pets. The judge granted temporary custody to coleman, who's now in pennsylvania with the children, and banned boyle from contacting them. \" to say that the circumstances of this case are tragic in the extreme would be an understatement, \" the judge said.

Researchers suspected as much, but to confirm their suspicions, they decided to follow individual lemon sharks starting in 1995; that's when they tagged babies and \" toddlers \" with transponders and took tissue samples. For each of the next 17 years, researchers headed back to the site, tagging newly-born creatures. Their findings were released just this week, the los angeles times reports. The first sharks were expected to be ready to give birth in 2008. Researchers captured two at the spot — and lo and behold, both had been ided years earlier. Eventually, at least six such mothers were found. \" of the couple of hundred sharks that were born between 1995 and 1998, only about a dozen reached adulthood. So the fact that we found six we think is pretty significant, \" a lead author tells the bbc. The study suggests that it's important to conserve such nursery areas, the experts say.",

        "summary": "Not saving much for retirement? at least you're not alone: a new survey finds that 42 % of americans have under $ 10,000 saved up for later years and will likely retire broke, cbs new york reports. The 2018 poll by gobankingrates.com found that 14 % of respondents and 60 % of young americans have saved nothing at all. Among the most cited reasons were \" i ' m struggling to pay bills, \" \" i don't make enough money to save, \" and \" i ' m prioritizing paying down debt. \" some ignorance of the \" saving \" concept may also be at work, suggests tom zgainer, ceo of america's best 401k: \" the amount of people who don't even know an individual retirement plan is available is astounding, \" he says. The survey — which polled 1,000 people from millennials to baby boomers — also found that women were more likely to have less saved up for retirement. But not all news was bad: 16 % have $ 300,000 or more saved up and 10 % have between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000, fortune reports. So what to do if you're behind? motley fool recommends saving even $ 50 a month, which will turn into more than $ 124,000 over 40 years with a 7 % annual rate of return. And the matching employer donations in 401k's can create \" even bigger gains over time. \" on another hopeful note, two national studies found that roughly 33 % of seniors increased their assets during the first 18 years of retirement, some by simply reducing their spending, forbes reports.",

The unusual case involves timothy warren, a 41-year-old black fedex driver, and joseph magnuson, a 55-year-old white man. Police say warren was driving through a portland neighborhood in september when magnuson began screaming at him to slow down. However, three witnesses told officers that warren was not speeding. After warren stopped his vehicle and got out, magnuson called him the n-word repeatedly, then took a swing at warren that missed, say police. At that point, warren landed a punch above magnuson's eye that knocked him down. Magnuson lost consciousness briefly and died later in the evening, reports the washington post. \"oregon law contains no 'duty to retreat ' and mr. Warren was within his right to exit his vehicle and verbally challenge the manner in which mr. Magnuson was addressing him, \" wrote adam gibbs, senior deputy district attorney in multnomah county, explaining the decision not to prosecute. \" mr. Magnuson was the initial verbal aggressor; mr. Warren responded in kind. Mr. Magnuson then escalated and became the initial physical aggressor; mr. Warren again responded in kind. \" the da's office acknowledges that magnuson would likely be alive today had warren not stopped his vehicle, but it says warren's decision to answer the \" racist vitriol \" is \" not of legal consequence. \" also of note: the medical examiner said magnuson had been in \" extremely poor health. \" ( this woman was arrested after a racist note to her neighbors. )",

Police say senior employees were upset sagar barman went into a restricted area of zobeda textile mill in dhaka. But sagar's father, also a worker at zobeda, tells the new york times his son was killed because he complained about the beatings they received from senior employees over small mistakes. An assistant administrative officer was arrested monday in connection with sagar's death, and police are looking for seven more employees said to have been involved. An administrative officer at zobeda denies sagar was killed, telling the dhaka tribune sagar may have died when he tried to use the air compressor to clean his mouth. Despite child labor being illegal in bangladesh, unicef estimates there are 4.9 million children under the age of 14 working in factories and elsewhere. Sagar had been working at zobeda for seven months when he was killed. \"i thought, as we are poor, it will be helpful to run our family if my son sagar can do some work in this factory, \" his father tells the times. Two-dozen child workers were sent home from zobeda, which supplies yarn for western clothing, when police came to investigate sagar's death. It's believed hundreds of children work there. Sagar is the second child worker in bangladesh to be killed by having an air compressor inserted into his rectum this year. Two men were sentenced to death for doing the same thing to a 13-year-old boy in another town last august.",

In april, a woman returning from her lunch break was shot in the knee, per abc7. Cops have made about 20 arrests in two years and blame ex-cons-turned-hustlers. But others point a finger at tour boat operators who profit from the hawkers, who pocket about $ 20 per ticket.

Here's what neil gorsuch had to say on a wide range of topics during the early portion of the hearing: when asked if he would be able to act independently as supreme court justice and rule against trump, gorsuch said he would \" have no difficulty ruling for or against any party, \" calling it a \" softball \" question, politico reports. The new york times has seven key takeaways from the hearing thus far, including that gorsuch praised barack obama's nominee, merrick garland, but wouldn't give his opinion on how that played out, saying he \" can't get involved in politics. \" gorsuch also wouldn't give his opinion on trump's travel ban, as it's an \" issue that is currently being litigated, \" the washington post reports. Gorsuch did fight back after a democratic senator said he would uphold the ban: \" he has no idea how i'd rule in that case. \" fox news reports gorsuch called roe v. Wade \" precedent \" that has been \" reaffirmed \" multiple times. He wouldn't go so far as to say it can't be overturned. Because trump has promised to appoint a supreme court justice who would be anti-abortion rights, cnn reports gorsuch was asked if trump had asked him to overturn roe v. Wade. In response, gorsuch said he \" would have walked out the door \" if that had happened. \" that's not what judges do, \" he said. Finally, sen.

Anthony zingale, 19, is accused of threatening a plymouth woman with a knife in a rape attempt at a house party saturday night, the sheboygan press reports. Per the criminal complaint, zingale says he entered a bathroom at the party and dropped his pants to answer an urgent call of nature, despite being embarrassed that a woman was in the room already. He says that woman then lunged for a knife he had brought into the bathroom with him. A different tale emerges from the woman, who tells cops zingale came in naked from the waist down, put a knife to her throat, and warned he'd hurt her if she didn't have sex with him. She escaped by luring him out of the bathroom in a fake attempt to bring him into a bedroom instead for their \" encounter \"; she screamed for help once they were out of the bathroom and the woman's husband called police. Cops say zingale immediately offered his hands for the cuffs when they arrived, admitting he'd been drinking and saying that his mom was also at the party. Zingale, who is facing charges of sexual assault and carrying a concealed weapon, could face a long haul in the slammer if convicted: the press says up to 40 years, fox6 says up to 60. He was released on $ 15,000 bond and is due back in court june 8, whbl reports. ( see other noteworthy mugshots here. )",

        "summary": "It sounds straight out of jurassic park: researchers have successfully created chicken embryos with what livescience frames as velociraptor-like snouts. It's an end that has its beginning in a bird-dino quandary described by carl zimmer at the new york times: \" even the most exquisitely preserved fossil can't tell us which pieces of dna had to change in order to turn ground-running dinosaurs into modern birds. \" when it comes to birds ' beaks specifically, scientists have understood the parts — premaxillae, the pair of cranial bones that hold some of our own teeth, fused to form the beak. But the genetic changes that facilitated the evolution from a snout weren't known. Zimmer digs deep into the science of the beak reversion, as detailed in the journal evolution ( it's worth a read ), but the bbc puts it in layman's terms: the researchers \" isolated the proteins that would have gone on to develop beaks. Then they suppressed them using tiny beads coated with an inhibiting substance. \" and voila: instead of fused beaks, unfused and rounded bones began to develop. Lead researcher bhart-anjan bhullar specifies that what was altered were gene-produced proteins, not genes, and therefore they're weren't genetically modifying the chickens. And those embryos didn't come to term. \" they actually probably wouldn't have done that badly if they did hatch, \" he tells livescience. \" mostly, though, we were interested in the evolution of the beak, and not in hatching a'dino-chicken ' just for the sake of it. \"",

Researcher scott delpy tells the bbc it was \" 1,000 times larger than any previous study on human movement. \" americans averaged 4,774 steps per day — below the worldwide average of 4,961 steps per day and good enough for 30th out of 46 countries. Hong kong topped the list at 6,880 steps per day, and indonesia could stake a claim as the laziest country with just 3,513 steps per day. So why doesn't indonesia have higher rates of obesity than the us? researchers found that more important than overall average activity levels was what they call \" activity inequality, \" or the difference between a country's most and least active people. In countries were everyone takes about the same number of steps per day — sweden, say — obesity levels are low. Meanwhile, the us had the fourth worst levels of activity inequality in the study. According to a press release, researchers were surprised to learn activity inequality was largely driven by women. \"when activity inequality is greatest, women's activity is reduced much more dramatically than men's activity, and thus the negative connections to obesity can affect women more greatly, \" researcher jure leskovec says.",

' it's hard to say that. I knew this day was coming. These words are not easy to say. \" mr. King, a television icon, announced in june that he had decided to step down from the program, which defined a generation of cable news and inspired a generation of interviewers. The ratings for \"larry king live \" had fallen sharply in recent years. In about a month \"piers morgan tonight \" will take over the 9 p.m. Time slot on cnn. Mr. King, 77, will host specials four times a year for cnn, and he is exploring other on- and off-air opportunities. Said bill maher, a longtime friend of mr. King's, on the program, \"this is the end of the show, not the end of a man. \" all sorts of stars came on \"larry king live \" on thursday to praise mr. King. The \"nbc nightly news \" anchor brian williams said",
            "Not many people can get two presidents of the united states, ryan seacrest, dr. Phil, barbara walters, donald trump, and brian williams, among others, one program, but tonight, larry king pulled it off for the final larry king live of the program's 25-year run. Sure, a cynic might argue that king was able to get so many people to pay tribute to him because he never went tough on anyone, but either way, there aren't many well-known figures in any walk of life who could have inspired as much goodwill as king did tonight. Easy target for mocking though he might be, he's an icon all the same. For king's final speech on his final show, the clearly emotional host said he was \"without words. \" he said he \"never thought [ the show ] would last this long, \" but thanked everyone associated with the show, and of course, the viewers, for making it happen. He reminded those viewers he's not going away, saying he ' ll still have a relationship with cnn, will do radio work, and will \"be around baseball. \" he closed by saying, \"instead of goodbye, how about 'so long. ' \" it's clear king has just as hard a time imagining himself out of"

Behind-the-scenes debate, which can be viewed here, was furious. One editor found tons of comic strips in which garfield is referred to as male. But another editor pointed out that garfield only identifies himself as male in one of those examples, a strip from 1981, arguing the cat \" may have been a boy \" back then but is no longer. Someone editing wikipedia from the us house of representatives even removed garfield from the \" male characters in comics \" category. Davis himself finally settled things, telling wapo that \" garfield is male. \" he says his 2014 comment about garfield's universality was being misconstrued. \" i've always said that i wanted to work with animals because they're not perceived as being any particular gender, race, age or ethnicity, \" he explained to the daily news. \" in that sense, the humor could be enjoyed by a broader demographic. \"",

But, surprise, they don't think bulger had anything to do with it. Instead, the local da says a business partner who owed rakes lots of money poisoned his iced coffee at a mcdonald's, reports the boston globe. The suspect is 69-year-old william camuti, and he is under arrest, reports cnn. He allegedly lured rakes to a local mcdonald's to talk about a fake business deal, then dropped two teaspoons of potassium cyanide into rakes'drink. Authorities say he drove around with rakes in his vehicle for several hours afterward — as rakes died from the poisoning — then dumped his body in the woods. The middlesex da says camuti acted alone, and her office sees no connection to bulger. Rakes had hoped to testify at bulger's trial to allege that bulger and one of his henchmen essentially stole his liquor store through strong-arm tactics decades ago. ( meanwhile, bulger today angrily told the judge that he would not be taking the stand in his own defense in his murder and racketeering trial. )",

        "summary": "When a man arrived at iraq's sulaymaniyah museum offering to sell 80 to 90 clay tablets in 2011, it was farouk al-rawi's job to study them. The professor at soas, university of london, found a few fakes in the mix, but spent much of his time examining a large inch-thick tablet, for which the seller was asking a large sum. Suddenly, al-rawi told the museum's director to buy the thing, 4.3 inches long by 3.7 inches wide, no matter the cost. As al-rawi had suspected, the $ 800 buy turned out to be a missing version of the 12-tablet babylonian epic of gilgamesh, considered to be among the first pieces of literature, the history blog reports, via ancient history etc. After five days spent translating the neo-babylonian cuneiform language, al-rawi discovered the tablet was a fragment of tablet v of the poem and adds 20 lines and previously unknown details. The tablet, made of three fragments, had been glued together, but researchers aren't sure who repaired it or even who dug it up. Scientists do suspect, however, that the collection came from the ancient area of babylon. Tablet v tells of gilgamesh, king of uruk, and his companion enkidu going to kill the giant humbaba, who guards the cedar forest, home of the gods. The tablet confirms enkidu spent time with humbaba as a boy, but shows humbaba to be more of a \" foreign ruler \" than a \" barbarian ogre, \" the impression that comes across in other versions, according to 2014 study. It mentions that monkeys, cicadas, and birds were present in the forest, and their chatter formed a kind of symphony. It also shows that gilgamesh and enkidu felt guilty after killing humbaba, which hadn't previously been referenced. ( a study of its ink lends credibility to the so-called \" gospel of jesus ' wife. \" )",

The tablet was acquired by the museum in late 2011 as part of a collection of 80-90 tablets sold by an unnamed shady character.

Unable to find lasting work, 37-year-old adam smith is living on food stamps with his wife and four kids in the rv they call home, he tells abc news. \" i think people are scared, \" smith says of potential employers. \" i think people are scared that it could happen again. \" back in the summer of 2012, as thousands of people were opposing chick-fil-a's stance on gay marriage, smith rolled into a chick-fil-a drive-thru for a free glass of water and slammed the female attendant: \" chick-fil-a is a hateful corporation, \" smith told her as the filmed the exchange. \" i don't know how you live with yourself and work here. I don't understand it. \" smith posted the video before returning to work at vante, a tucson-based medical manufacturer — and the proverbial you-know-what had hit the fan by the time he got there. The receptionist told him \" the voicemail is completely full, and it's full of bomb threats, \" he says. Fired that day, smith lost his $ 200,000 salary and more than $ 1 million in stock options. He and his family moved to portland, where he got a cfo job, but lost it two weeks later when they realized who he was. He says he has since been honest in interviews, but companies have been too wary of fallout to hire him. \" i don't regret the stand i took, but i regret … the way i talked to her, \" an emotional smith says of the worker. The interview coincides with his recent digital release of a memoir, a million dollar cup of water ( a paperback version is out april 21 ), which chronicles his professional collapse and years of soul-searching. It's not faring so well on amazon, which smith addressed on the site on friday. \" regarding the many 1-star ratings my book has received today and yesterday, i would like to note that i have only sold 17 digital copies thus far, yet there are 23 1-star ratings on my book.

        "summary": "Under the right conditions, hackers could theoretically exploit a built-in feature in smartphones to steal passwords and pins, and it all comes down to the tilt users employ and the way they type, the guardian reports. In a study published in the international journal of information security, newcastle university researchers note that most smart devices today come crammed with various sensors, from gps to orientation and rotation features, but malicious sites and apps don't need to get user permission to gain access to many of these sensors — meaning they may \" covertly ' listen in ' on your sensor data, \" and from there pick up on your \" touch actions, \" such as the pins and passwords you type in, computer science expert maryam mehrnezhad says in a press release. The way users clicked, scrolled, and tapped on the devices, as well as the way they held them, resulted in a \" unique orientation and motion trace, \" which allowed researchers to figure out what a user was typing on certain websites. Co-author siamak shahandashti compares it to a jigsaw puzzle: \" the more pieces you put together, the easier it is to see the picture. \" in the end, the scientists hit a 70 % accuracy rate on the first try when trying to figure out users ' four-digit pins; that number jumped to 100 % after five tries. The researchers, who have informed google and apple of their findings, note that most users are more concerned about hackers gaining access to tools like a phone's camera or gps, but this study shows there is reason to be concerned about a device's seemingly innocuous sensors as well.

The first set of ads will reportedly jump right into where trump stands on the issues, and they may also be reserved to swing back at rivals. \" if you attack trump, he will attack you 10 times as hard, \" a trump adviser tells fox. The hill notes jeb bush and john kasich could be two targets, as they've gone on the offensive against trump the most — for example, a bush super pac ponied up more than $ 3 million earlier this month for an ad aimed at trump. And that's not the only big news in donald's domain. Politico reports that multiple sources have confirmed a deal struck between trump's campaign and the republican national committee that gives his campaign access to the rnc's voter files, said to harbor data on more than 200 million americans — data politico notes is \" critical for identifying and mobilizing persuadable voters. \" although the details aren't yet clear, the site reports the rnc typically ensures that campaigns it list-shares with are well versed in data operations. The list-sharing agreement also stipulates that candidates pledge to support the eventual party nominee. Though trump signed a loyalty pledge in september vowing he wouldn't run as an independent if he doesn't secure the gop nomination, the washington post noted it isn't legally binding and \" means almost nothing. \" ( no more free publicity for trump from honest tea bottle caps. )",

Per reuters, a good number of economists, investors, and other financial experts don't think the economy can handle a rate hike yet, and expectations that such an increase is coming are still low: a poll of economists found most didn't anticipate a rate rise until december ( investors are leaning more toward february ), and timothy duy writes for bloomberg that he expects the \" doves at the [ fed ] … [ to ] rule the roost again this week. \" this despite yellen's august statements that she saw a strong case for a rate increase \" in light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation. \" but, as duy puts it, the hawks are growing \" restless \": the economy is getting close to its employment target, after which, he says, \" bad things will happen, \" including inflation passing its own target and possibly leading into a recession. And some experts say the fed remaining wishy-washy is undermining confidence — and that the harder investors push against a rate increase, the more the risk of an overreaction \" with unpredictable and negative economic fallout \" if a hike does go through, per reuters. But others, such as federal reserve governor daniel tarullo, say there's still not compelling evidence of inflation and that september would be too early to boost rates. Duy notes that, in the end, caution is likely going to win out, and rate-hike advocates will have to wait until december to try again. ( the new york times gets into why the issue is complicated. )",

Ryan wants the unanimous support of all the major house caucuses, but politico is skeptical that the 40 or so conservatives who make up the freedom caucus — the group that forced out john boehner — will come around. To gain the group's endorsement, ryan needs the backing of 80 % of its members, and \" early signs from the conservatives are they might never get there, \" says politico. For one thing, ryan wants to do away with a rule that would allow a simple majority of the house to remove the speaker, notes the washington post, a procedural weapon favored by the group. The conservatives also want to change other house rules to make sure their group has sway, and ryan is balking, reports the new york times. Expect lots more wheeling and dealing before the friday deadline laid down by ryan. The other demands — ryan's full statement at time — revolve around changing the duties and focus of the job. For example, ryan has three young kids, and he wants to spend less time fundraising on the weekends all over the country, saying, \" i cannot and will not give up my family time. \" instead, ryan would focus on communicating the party message in tv appearances. He also wants to \" move from being an opposition party to a proposition party, \" making the speaker's role a more \" visionary \" one. \" it's not a job i've ever wanted [ or ] i've ever sought, \" says ryan. \" i came to the conclusion that this is a very dire moment, not just for congress, not just for the republican party, but for our country.

Reliable records on the stat go back to 1993. A man shot in the ankle in brooklyn around lunchtime on monday broke the three-day streak, but the friday-through-sunday record stands. \" i can't remember the last time we had a weekend where we didn't have at least one shooting in the city, \" says nypd chief terence monahan, who the new york post notes has been with the department since the early ' 80s. What monahan says often leads to shootings is gang violence, and he says what helps prevent them is his department concentrating on keeping retaliation at bay. \" one ( shooting ) can turn into five if we're not on top of it, \" monahan says, explaining that departmental planners meet each friday to come up with a game plan on how to keep the big apple safe. Although the murder rate in the city of 8.6 million people has gone up about 8 % from last year, 734 people had been shot in 2018 as of sunday, compared with 753 in 2017 during the same period. \" this is working because the nypd has the best strategy, the best training … because this department never rests on its laurels, \" mayor bill de blasio says.

A sample of what the critics are saying: gaga's \" disarming, naturalistic presence is crucial to the movie's force, \" writes manohla dargis in the new york times. \" she has been stripped down here, her mask removed. You can see her skin, the flutter in her veins, which brings you close to her, and can make both the actress and her character feel touchingly vulnerable. \" \" cooper has managed to do the impossible, \" writes mark daniell in the toronto sun. \" he's put together an instant movie classic that will have audiences falling in love with his brand new creation. \" cooper's own strong performance may not be a surprise, but gaga's? we knew she could sing, \" but as an actress, she's a complete revelation. \" pay attention early, advises ty burr in the boston globe. \" the opening 45 minutes of a star is born are as good as mainstream moviemaking gets in the 21st century, and the rest is only slightly less impressive for being so familiar. \" as for gaga: \" the role of ally is so meta as to cast doubt on whether lady gaga can play other kinds of parts; the performance is so galvanizing that you don't remotely care. \" gaga has done some crazy things on stage, writes johnny oleksinski in the new york post. \" but her biggest transformation occurs in the new film a star is born. In it, she becomes an oscar-worthy actress. \" gaga shows \" brilliant restraint, \" and cooper shows a deft hand as a director, especially in the stage scenes.

Their two older boys made it to safety. \" rudy had managed to get mckayla from the buggy and she was in his arms, \" recounts lisinda. \" i could hear rudy screaming for help and i could hear the boys screaming for help. \" rudy lost his grasp on their daughter, and when lisinda managed to swim to him, he was unconscious and mckayla was nowhere in sight. All were pulled from the water by rescuers within 15 minutes, but rudy died that night and mckayla four days later, reports the guardian. A detective says waves went from 6 feet to 13 feet in a half-hour. Six people in total drowned around the coast that tragic weekend, reports the bbc.

        "summary": "The trump administration is apparently still stewing about the un's vote on jerusalem last week. Ambassador nikki haley issued a stark statement tying us financial support of the un with whether it met us demands — the fourth time in a week's time the us has done so, the new york times notes. To wit, the us government says it negotiated a significant cut in the un budget, reports the ap. In a statement sunday, the us mission to the un said the un's 2018-2019 budget would be slashed by more $ 285 million, noting reductions would also be made to the un's \" bloated \" management and support functions. The announcement didn't make clear the entire amount of the budget or specify what effect the cut would have on the us contribution. Haley said the \" inefficiency and overspending \" of the organization is well-known, that \" we will not let the generosity of the american people be taken advantage of, \" and that the us would continue to \" look at ways to increase the un's efficiency while protecting our interests. \" the times notes this stance is in line with president trump's ongoing criticism of the un, which last december he tweeted was \" sad \" and \" just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. \" but critics say the us ' approach could backfire and end up \" subverting respect, \" per the times, and human rights groups note that while they agree inefficiencies should be cut, they're keeping a wary eye on developments. \" it's crucial that we don't curtail the un's ability... To save the lives of men, women, and children worldwide, \" says the un director at human rights watch.",

A judge in the african country ruled in favor of the adoption tuesday after asking madonna what he termed \" uncomfortable questions \" in court papers obtained by the ap. The judge said he felt such questions were necessary to make sure the \" professional performer \" wasn't \" merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech. \" he added that madonna was \" very candid \" in her answers. In an instagram post wednesday night, she revealed her new daughters ' names when she shared a photo of other malawi orphans and noted, \" there are 650 orphans at home of hope where estere and stelle have lived for 4 years since they were 5 days old. \" in her initial instagram post confirming the adoption, madonna said she was \" overjoyed \" to add the girls to her family and asked for privacy from the media. But the ap has some details from the court papers, including the fact that madonna kept the girls ' birth names in an effort to preserve their malawian identities. They were born via cesarean section and their birth mother died within a week due to birth complications; their father, who attended an adoption hearing last month, was not able to provide for all of his dependents, which include five older siblings of the twins. People notes that back in july, madonna posted an instagram photo of the girls ( in which she refers to them as \" stella and esther \" ) with now-older-sister lourdes, who was with madonna at the girls ' orphanage at the time.

Now his death is playing a role in unrest in the wake of tuesday's presidential vote, chaos that threatens to plunge kenya into violence with reverberations around the african continent. Here's what's happening: disputed results: the first results in the closely watched election suggest a clear-cut finish: president uhuru kenyatta got more than 50 % of the vote over opposition leader raila odinga and thus can avoid a runoff. The problem: odinga is refusing to accept the results, alleging that hackers helping kenyatta's party rigged the outcome, reports the bbc. Election officials inside and outside the country are scrambling to assess the claims. The murder: odinga cites the july killing of chris msando, whose tortured body was found on the outskirts of nairobi. He had been in charge of it for kenya's election body, and odinga alleges that msando's killers stole his credentials, accessed the nation's election servers on tuesday, and manipulated them to ensure a big kenyatta win, reports the new york times. The election \" was a fraud, \" he charged. Violence begins: odinga called for calm, but his supporters already have begun staging sometimes violent protests, reports the ap. At least two people were fatally shot in unrest in nairobi. A decade ago, another disputed election — odinga lost that one, too — led to what was essentially a civil war that left more than 1,200 dead and 600,000 displaced. 2 troubling quotes: \" i don't control the people, \" said odinga after his call for calm. And his supporters chanted \" no raila, no peace \" in the western city of kisumu, reports reuters. Bellwether: this has repercussions beyond kenya's borders, writes joshua keating at slate. Kenya is \" something of a bellwether \" in africa, where electoral democracy already seems to be faltering in nations such as zambia, rwanda, and the democratic republic of congo, he writes.

The zoo, which drew outcries several weeks ago when it killed a healthy giraffe and dissected it publicly, killed four lions this week to make way for an incoming adult male lion, reports afp. The zoo put down two aging females whose place as primary breeders will be taken by two younger females, along with two 10-month-old cubs who would have been killed by the new male anyway, say zoo officials. It's all about \" the pride of lions ' natural structure and behavior, \" they say. The zoo hopes the new male and two younger females will form a new pride, reports ap. This time around, no public dissection will take place because \" not all our animals are dissected in front of an audience, \" says a zoo spokesperson. The story is generating lots of attention already, though the afp quotes an ethicist who complains about the \" disneyfication \" of zoo animals.",

That price tag doesn't get microsoft minecraft creator markus persson ( who hasn't held his tongue about microsoft in the past ), nor the stockholm-based gaming company's two other founders, reports the wall street journal. The journal sees the buy as a partially surprising one for satya nadella, who, after taking the helm in february, said microsoft needed to focus on selling software. But the verge and the journal run down three things the acquisition of the insanely popular lego-like multiplayer game's maker gets microsoft: it gives microsoft \" an asset with a loyal and largely young following, \" could help the company woo developers, and gives microsoft the ability to add game features available only on windows. ( there currently isn't a windows phone version of the game, but the verge sees that coming; the game will continue to be available on ios and android. ) an interesting side note: the verge points out that microsoft can use cash held overseas to foot the bill, \" rather than bringing funds back to the us and getting taxed on a similar buyout back home. \" as for persson, \" he's decided that he doesn't want the responsibility of owning a company of such global significance, \" says mojang. \" he ' ll continue to do cool stuff though.

The extract is typically known as wax thanks to its gooey nature, though it also goes by the street names of shatter, budder, honey, and many others, reports the new york times. Users of the high-thc product — typically ingested via an e-cig-like device called a vape pen in a practice known as \" dabbing \" — prize it for its potency and for its low profile. As the paper notes, \" even if discovered, parents, teachers or even the authorities hardly seem to know what it is. \" its booming popularity points to a larger issue: as marijuana loses its social stigma, with medical and now recreational use legal in many states, extracts like wax are largely uncharted territory. The dea says high-grade marijuana tops out at about 20 % thc. Wax, on the other hand, ranges from 40 % to 80 %. \"people don't understand that the high thc content can lead to the intense psychological and physical effects, more than what they are expecting, \" one addiction expert tells the minneapolis star tribune. Minnesota authorities seized 12 pounds in the first three months of 2016, with a street value of $ 300,000, compared to a quarter-pound for all of last year. The \" stupefying \" high can last for hours, cause one to pass out, and \" border on hallucinatory, \" per the times. But another notable danger of wax lies in its production, which involves dousing marijuana with a solvent such as butane to extract the thc. As the popularity of wax increases, so do explosions related to making it, according to the daily reporter of coldwater, michigan.

Perry told a cedar rapids crowd that any attempt by the federal reserve to implement an extraordinary stimulus — ie, a qe3 or \"printing money \" — before the election would be \"almost treasonous. \" perry warned that texas would treat fed chair ben bernanke \"pretty ugly \" if he visited the lone star state after such a move: according to a video appearing on the left-leading website think progress, a reporter asked perry what he",
