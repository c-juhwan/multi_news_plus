In reilly's telling, they're not, and his column arguing for the name's continued use has not gone over well. Before we get to the derision, here's a synopsis of it: reilly cites a poll that found 90 % of native americans weren't irked by the name, lists three native american-majority high schools that have \" proudly \" worn the name for decades, and mentions that \" nobody on the blackfeet side of my wife's family has ever had someone insult them with the word. \" his take? \" white america has spoken. You aren't offended, so we ' ll be offended for you. \" but it's his closing lines that are particularly under fire: \" trust us. We know what's best. We ' ll take this away for your own good, and put up barriers that protect you from ever being harmed again. Kind of like a reservation. \" some reaction: \" we don't know why he's essentially equating criticism of overtly racist iconography with the forced relocation of entire nations, or how anyone could possibly publish this, \" writes tim marchman at deadspin. \" we're not sure we want to know. \" but the most, er, descriptive critique comes from dave zirin at the nation, who writes \" like a poop in the pool, i think i ' m just going to let [ the closing lines ] sit there and speak for itself. \" ( zirin's fairly lengthy takedown is worth a read. )",

        "summary": "Big dodo news out of the science world this week. Yes, it's still extinct, but a study published thursday in scientific reports finally sheds light on the life cycle of the famously dead bird. \"we know so little about these birds that everything was basically a surprise, \" paleontologist and study author delphine angst tells new scientist. The dodo, a \" large flightless pigeon, \" lived in the swamps and caves of the island of mauritius until the arrival of europeans in the 1500s, at which point it promptly went extinct within the next century. During those 100 years, humans spent a lot of time hunting the dodo but not a lot of time studying it. That's where angst's research comes in. By studying 22 bones from 22 dodos, angst determined that the bird's life cycle was built around surviving the lack of food and extreme weather of mauritius'summer, which lasted from november to march. After the summer, dodos would completely lose their feathers and regrow new ones, as evidenced by cavities in some the bones where calcium was extracted for feather growth. Females would lay eggs in august, and those eggs would hatch in september. Juvenile dodo bones had a large supply of immature cells showing that young dodos grew quickly to be ready for the impending summer. The telegraph reports this life cycle explains why europeans of the time offered such differing descriptions of the dodo, from having \" downy feathers \" to \" three or four black quills \" to no feathers at all — they were seeing the bird at different stages of moulting.",

The atlantic points out silverstein was also a songwriter and penned \" a boy named sue, \" made famous by johnny cash. Though silverstein released nine albums, he also recorded some \" eye-popping \" songs that weren't formally released, with titles like \" i love my right hand \" and \" get my rocks off \"; the latter was covered by none other than marilyn manson.

        "summary": "A human heart might seem like a hefty chunk of meat, but its 650 calories would hardly fill up a hungry cannibal living in paleolithic times. It's a finding that is forcing researchers to rethink why cannibalism was practiced in that period if not as a last resort to fend off starvation. To better understand the reasons behind cannibalism, james cole of the university of brighton opted to count calories for all edible parts of the human body using autopsy data, reports quartz. Including everything from the skeleton to the skin, he discovered a 145-pound man was worth 125,822 calories, reports time, with 32,376 calories from his 45 pounds of lean muscle. At about 590 calories per pound of muscle, that's not much of a meal, per ars technica. If a group of 25 neanderthals dined on a single body, they'd each get about a third of the calories needed for that day, cole says. But if the same group dined on a similarly sized boar, with 1,800 calories per pound of muscle, they'd have enough to feed them for three days, cole says. With 3.6 million calories of muscle from a mammoth, the group could be fed for a month. Since humans would likely have been challenging to hunt, cole's study, published in scientific reports, calls into question \" the viability of hunting and consuming hominins for strictly nutritional reasons, \" cole says. \" we're not very nutritional at all, \" he adds, per national geographic. Cole argues cannibalism instead involved opportunity, competition, and ceremony. ( evidence of cannibalism was just found in a spanish cave. )",

So when he intercepted the ball last night and ran for 39 yards to score a touchdown against the patriots, it wasn't that surprising that he fell to his knees in what appeared to be a quick religious prayer. But that two-second prostration ( which you can see as a gif on sb nation ) earned abdullah a 15-yard \" unsportsmanlike conduct penalty \" for apparently violating the league's celebration rules, usa today reports. A look at the rule and reactions: abdullah's prayer was reportedly a violation of an nfl rule that states \" players are prohibited from engaging in any celebrations or demonstrations while on the ground, \" the kansas city star reports. But last year, as noted by sb nation, former nfl rules guru and ref mike pereira pointed out that this rule isn't meant to come down on a quiet religious gesture: \" you're not penalized for going to the ground to give praise after a td. \" abdullah's gesture also closely resembles tim tebow's famous and \" widely celebrated \" genuflection, rodger sherman writes on sb nation, noting, \" the only differences between the two are the positions of their knees and shoulders, the faiths they belong to, and whether or not the nfl's referees called a penalty. \" it's not like abdullah hadn't mentioned this might happen: \" if i get a pick, i ' m going to prostrate before god in the end zone, \" he said in the star. Abdullah also tells the star he thinks he may have received the penalty because he slid into the prayer after he got a \" little too excited, \" but his coach, andy reid, says, \" when you go to mecca, you should be able to slide wherever you want.

Researchers and social commentators have proclaimed the existence of the link for decades, with research suggesting as much appearing as early as the 1970s. But arielle kuperberg's research, released by the nonpartisan council on contemporary families, came at the issue from a different angle; \" people were measuring it the wrong way, \" she says.

Her finding, based on 1995, 2002, and 2006 survey data encompassing 7,000 couples compiled by the us government: \" cohabitation does not cause divorce. \" what she did find, the christian science monitor reports, is that the age when a couple starts living together, married or not, is the biggest indicator of whether they ' ll make it.

            "Donald trump's bid for the white house has always been a media circus. Now, it's being run by one of the ringleaders. The trump campaign announced today that it has hired breitbart news network executive chairman steve bannon as campaign ceo. Paul manafort, who has been running the show since the ouster of former campaign manager corey lewandowski, will stay on as campaign chairman and chief strategist, but it seems without question that his power will be seriously diluted. Bannon's hire highlights a troubling trend: the blurring of the lines between media as campaign observer and campaign operative. With bannon leading trump's presidential bid, the lines are now erased. That the head of breitbart would eventually just up and join the trump campaign may have seemed a foregone conclusion to anyone who's been watching the conservative media outlet this election cycle. Breitbart has been openly pro-trump, even as other conservative outlets like the national review and red state have come out against him. When breitbart reporter michelle fields accused then-campaign manager lewandowski of battery, a charge that was eventually dropped, breitbart's staff sided with the trump campaign, telling reporters to stop speaking out about the story.

Jeffery zeigler, a retired detroit firefighter, was arraigned friday on charges including assault with intent to murder, per the ap. Oakland county sheriff's deputies were called to zeigler's rochester hills ' home about 8: 20am thursday after a woman told 911 that her husband had chased a black male who tried to break in. Deputies learned that a shot had been fired and found brennan walker — unharmed — down the street. Walker's statement to police differed from that given by zeigler, according to assistant prosecutor kelly collins. \" we do have the benefit of home security video, \" collins told the court friday. He said zeigler's account was not borne out by the video. \" the victim in this matter, a 14-year-old child, indicated what had happened to the police and his version did bear out on that video, \" he said. The video was taken from zeigler's home security system. Walker has said he woke up late thursday, missed his school bus, and became lost in the christian hills subdivision while trying to walk the bus route to rochester high school. When he knocked on the door to zeigler's home, walker said a woman inside began yelling \" ' why are you trying to break into my house?

Now, not only he but scotland yard metropolitan police commissioner sir paul stephenson have some explaining to do before government investigators, with stephenson already facing calls for his resignation, reports the telegraph. It was sir paul who earlier this week briefed prime minister david cameron on the growing scandal. But he conveniently forgot to mention that one of the key suspected culprits had worked for him, sources tell the daily mail. Wallis, who dined several times with stephenson during his time as editor, landed the yard consultant work in 2009, shortly after leaving the tabloid. He earned some $ 36,000 for working two days a month providing \" strategic communication advice and support, \" according to sources. The tabloid scandal, involving illegally hacked phones of as many as 4,000 british citizens, is threatening not only to topple owner rupert murdoch's massive media empire, but is also damaging the reputation of politicians like cameron supported by the conservative publisher and his minions. Now, it appears that police, who may have taken payments for providing information to reporters, are about to be sucked into the rapidly growing black hole. Stephenson has insisted his integrity is \" completely intact. \"",

On howard stern's radio show tuesday morning, an absolutely livid olson said she was dating sheen when he had hiv, and yet he insisted to her he was clean. \" i didn't want to use lambskin, i wanted to use regular condoms, \" she said. \" there were times that we didn't use condoms \" at all, when things got more serious, she added. As tmz reports, olson could possibly file a lawsuit or press criminal charges over her claims. Were sheen to call her and apologize, \" i would say f --- you, is what i would say, and hang up the phone, \" said olson — who on friday preemptively posted a message on her website assuring fans she does not have hiv, people reports. As for sheen's ex-wives, sheen said on today that he told denise richards and brooke mueller about his diagnosis right away, us reports. He was still married to mueller when he was diagnosed in 2011, but mueller's rep confirms via statement to e! that she and the couple's twin boys remain hiv-free. E! also confirmed that richards and her two daughters with sheen are hiv-free. ( click to find out which celebrity pal is already supporting sheen. )",

In an april column for the guardian, michael wolff outlined how the network had turned into a \" rec room artifact, \" that was losing the great-tv battle. In a piece for paidcontent picked up by time, daniel frankel counters that hbo has once again become tv's \" most relevant programming brand \" — but it isn't because of its shows. Rather, it's establishing itself as king of the platform game. As of last week, kindle fire users can now access hbo go, another addition to hbo's repertoire that grants subscribers access via everything from ipads to the xbox 360. And that gives it a growing reach that, posits frankel, trumps the need to have the most-talked-about show on cable. Because in \" measuring its audience across platforms, the audience for game of thrones this season has averaged over 10 million viewers, \" writes frankel. That's double the audience mad men claims, and these days that fact matters more than critical acclaim. \" when you're fighting to make potential cord-cutters cable subscribers who pay an additional 12 bucks a month for premium channels, merely appealing to well-educated media consumers in manhattan and la may not be enough. \" click for his entire column.",

        "summary": "How many trees are there on earth? a lot … or, more precisely, 3.04 trillion ( about 422 per person on the planet, cnn notes ). That's what some scientists discovered this year after conducting a global tree census, npr reports. To put that number in context, it would take some 96,000 years to plant 3 trillion trees, if you were planting a tree per second, says ecologist thomas crowther, who led the study while working at yale university. A previous estimate, based on satellite images, had the world's tree population at about 400 billion — some 7.5 times less than the new estimate, which was published september in the journal nature. \" it's a huge, astronomical number that i don't think i could comprehend before this study, \" crowther tells npr. Still, crowther cautions, \" it's not like we discovered new trees, \" so it's not time to say, \" there's plenty left. No worries. \" in fact, per nature, the researchers think the total number of trees has been slashed nearly 50 % in the last 12,000 years. And about 15 billion trees are cut down each year. The tree census involved getting tree counts in certain areas from people on the ground, using existing forest inventories, and entering the data into computer models. The whole thing started when crowther's friend, part of the billion tree campaign, was trying to figure out what kind of impact planting a billion trees would have. He asked crowther how many trees are on the earth. At the time, crowther tells npr, \" it doesn't seem like anyone had any idea. \" now they do … and the information could be used to weigh whether trees should be preserved, rather than cut down to make way for farms, a stanford university ecologist tells nature.

It's not just contracts that link the private firm to washington: president obama's top intelligence official, james clapper, used to be a booz allen executive, and the man who held clapper's job in the bush administration works there now. Close to half of booz allen's 25,000 workers have top secret security clearance: they have \" access to information that would cause ' exceptionally grave damage'to national security if disclosed to the public, \" in the company's words. The washington post figures a leak was bound to happen thanks to the speedy post-9/11 outsourcing of intelligence jobs; a 2010 analysis by the paper found 1,931 private companies engaged in national security-related work. And the system in place for quietly reporting concerns is less clear to contractors than to government workers, a former nsa official tells the times.

Alexander would have been 16 at the time, though authorities were never able to identify the body. She had been shot twice. The break in the case came last summer, when an old friend got to wondering about alexander and tracked down her half-sister, reports people. After they spoke, a missing person's report on alexander was finally filed — apparently the first one in the case. With that crucial step in place, investigators in the two states eventually matched up their cases, and a dna sample from a relative confirmed alexander's identity. Authorities still don't know who killed her or how she ended up 1,200 miles from home. A sister says alexander ran away to escape a \" volatile, \" drug-addicted mother, reports wham-tv, and she also insists that the family filed a missing person's report when she disappeared.

In an abc interview ahead of tomorrow's release of her memoir, hard choices, clinton told diane sawyer that she's still working on the hard choice about 2016 and there won't be an announcement this year. \" i just want to kind of get through this year, travel around the country, sign books, help in the midterm elections in the fall, and then take a deep breath and kind of go through my pluses and minuses about what i will — and will not — be thinking about as i make the decision, \" she said. Clinton also declined to say whether she would testify before a congressional committee investigating the 2012 killing of four americans in benghazi. But while clinton claims to still be making her mind up, a new washington post/abc poll finds that she has the backing of a massive 69 % of democrats and democratic-leaning voters, and chris cillizza at the washington post believes there is no doubt she is running. She is already racking up endorsements, signing up top talent to the ready for hillary super pac, and working hard to combat negatives like karl rove's suggestion she has brain damage, he notes. So why the wait? for clinton, \" there's absolutely no reason — or benefit — to formally declaring her candidacy anytime soon, \" cillizza writes. \" she is such a heavy favorite for the democratic nomination that nothing in the contest will move until she does. \"",

The bigger question may be whether the original conspiracist, vargas, was serious or joking, notes usa today. He uses the handle buylegalmeds and peddles hemp syrup, so if it was an attempt to generate publicity, points to vargas. Buzzfeed, meanwhile, recalls that clinton was the subject of a similar conspiracy back in 2016, and it gained enough steam that a woman known for her clinton impersonations stepped forward to say that, no, she wasn't involved in any fake official appearances. \" at least this time around the body double question seems to be much more lighthearted — but still totally false! \" writes jane lytvynenko.",

Jeff jensen of entertainment weekly was one of the few critics \" more than satisfied \" with \" an emotionally draining epic that had me crying with almost every single ' awakening ' and has left me mulling the true significance of the sideways world. \" max read at gawker says the lost writers forgot what every creative writing student is taught: \" don't end your story with all your characters being dead. It is like cheating. It is worse than cheating! it is the wussiest thing a writer can do. And these smug dickheads went ahead and did it. \"",

        "summary": "The hubble space telescope is in \" safe mode, \" which does little to explain the trouble it's in. The renowned telescope entered safe mode around 6pm friday — meaning it's essentially now just holding steady — following the failure of one of the gyroscopes used to point and steady the instrument. The gyro had looked to be on its final legs for a year, and its failure wasn't a stunner, per a nasa release. But the surprise came when a backup gyro didn't work as planned when fired up, the result being that hubble is now pointed the wrong way, reports cnn. Scientists are working to revive the backup, but nasa says the telescope can still function if they can't. The hubble started with six gyroscopes, but two failed years ago. The most recent pair of failures means that just two are currently functioning. If that remains the case, one will be shut off to serve as a backup, and hubble will operate with a single gyro. It's not ideal, but it's workable. \" while reduced-gyro mode offers less sky coverage at any particular time, there is relatively limited impact on the overall scientific capabilities, \" says nasa's release. No other maintenance mission is planned for hubble, stationed 340 miles above earth; the james webb space telescope was expected to have replaced hubble by now. But following a series of delays, it's now expected to launch in 2021, reports per engadget.",

The federal government hit the $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling yesterday, and while tea party-backed lawmakers are sticking to their guns on cutting spending, their former allies among the business establishment want the government to simply raise the ceiling before funds run out. The us chamber of commerce — representing many powerful business interests that rely on government contracts — is urging republican lawmakers to seek compromise, a position the white house hopes to exploit as it searches for the votes to raise the debt ceiling.

As any color close-up of him reveals, he had one blue eye and one brown — so how did they get that way? rumor had it that the pop star was afflicted by a condition called heterochromia, the telegraph reports. As quartz explains, heterochromia is rare in people and gives each iris a different color. Yet there's another condition that better suits the legendary singer: called anisocoria, it makes one pupil larger than the other and mimics the effect of differently colored eyes. Indeed, bowie had a permanently dilated eye ( his left ) that prevented it from reacting to changes in light. That would give it a darker appearance compared to his right iris's natural blue color. Dilated pupils are also more likely to have \" red eye, \" which can add to the different-color effect. But that's all too boring for rock ' n ' roll: according to anecdotal history, a 15-year-old bowie got in a fight with his friend george underwood over a girl, and underwood's nail ended up stuck in bowie's left eye and forever dilated the pupil, the new yorker reports.

        "summary": "You may be tempted to stay up to check out all the new late-night tv hosts, but make sure you've got your orange glasses on first. Various studies and expert opinion suggest that special filters, light bulbs, and the aforementioned orange-tinted eyewear can help block melatonin-disrupting blue light emitted by electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computer screens, the new york times reports. Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone tied to sleep onset, and blue light has been shown in some studies to suppress its production. The most recent research comes out of a swiss study published in the journal of adolescent health, in which 13 teen boys were outfitted in these glasses, known as blue blockers, during the evening while they used devices with led screens. The result, per the times: the boys experienced \" significantly more \" sleepiness with the orange-tinted glasses than when they were sporting clear ones. A 2009 study of 20 adults came to similar conclusions, showing that subjects who wore amber-tinted eyeglasses enjoyed better sleep than those in yellow-tinted glasses ( blocking uv light only ). Orange shades aren't the only solution being bandied about: bulbs that emit less blue light, filters to cover devices, and apps that change devices ' blue-light emissions are also available, per the times. Or, one could simply cut down on the gadgets once night comes. While experts tell the paper that being exposed to blue light is preferable during the day, it makes sense in the evening to block whatever blue light you can, either via smaller led screens, dimmer light, or a cutdown on usage. \" if you can look at the iphone for 10 minutes rather than three hours, that makes a lot of difference, \" a neuroendocrinology professor tells the times. ( thank these three for inventing blue light. )",

            "The pattern of waking during the day when it is light and sleeping at night when it is dark is a natural part of human life. Only recently have scientists begun to understand the alternating cycle of sleep and waking, and how it is related to daylight and darkness. A key factor in how human sleep is regulated is exposure to light or to darkness. Exposure to light stimulates a nerve pathway from the retina in the eye to an area in the brain called the hypothalamus. There, a special center called the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) initiates signals to other parts of the brain that control hormones, body temperature and other functions that play a role in making us feel sleepy or wide awake. The scn works like a clock that sets off a regulated pattern of activities that affect the entire body. Once exposed to the first light each day, the clock in",

        "summary": "A soaring number of americans are facing an old age of poverty because they are still saddled with student debt, according to a government accountability office report released yesterday. The government has the power to slash social security or disability benefits to pay off federal student loans, and the number of people who have had their benefits reduced surged to 155,000 last year from just 31,000 in 2002, bloomberg reports. Some 3 % of households headed by elderly people carry student loan debt, and they are much more likely to be in default, the gao report found. Some older americans are still paying off debt from when they were much younger, others took out loans after going back to school later in life, and others co-signed loans for children or grandchildren. \" some may think of student loan debt as a just a young person's problem, \" sen. Bill nelson, chair of the special committee on aging, told a hearing yesterday, reports reuters. \" as it turns out, that's increasingly not the case. \" a big part of the problem — as with many other problems — is inaction from congress, slate reports. A law says that the government can't seize retirement benefits if it will leave people with a check of less than $ 750, but that limit was set in 1998, when it was above the poverty line, and hasn't been updated to keep pace with inflation since. ( in another student controversy, many parents are still paying off the loans of their dead children. )",

Isis maintains that islam will prevail only after western forces invade syria and set off an apocalyptic battle, and the ancient texts it cites specifically foretell the \" romans \" setting foot in dabiq. \" here we are, burying the first american crusader in dabiq, eagerly waiting for the remainder of your armies to arrive, \" said kassig's executioner at the time. \" in other words, isis wants a western ground force to invade syria, as that would confirm the prophecy about dabiq, \" writes peter bergen at cnn. An earlier isis primer at the atlantic also makes note of the prophecy, observing that \" western media frequently miss references to dabiq in the islamic state's videos, and focus instead on lurid scenes of beheading. \" one real concern for the west is that such an invasion — allowing isis to sell it as a prophecy fulfilled — would boost recruitment for the group at a moment when that effort is lagging, adds rukmini callimachi of the times. \" it's a very powerful and emotional narrative, \" a professor of mideast studies tells the newspaper. \" it gives the potential recruit and the actual fighters the feeling that not only are they part of the elite, they are also part of the final battle. \" ( new documents reveal isis to be a \" deeply calculating political organization. \" )",

In an appearance at the white house rose garden, president obama announced that the united states has asked the world trade organization to facilitate formal consultations with china over its limits on rare-earth exports, in a case filed jointly with japan and the european union. Officials in beijing said tuesday that china will vigorously defend its right to control the export of such materials. The official state-run news agency, xinhua, warned that any u.s.

And china has shown in recent years that it is not afraid to use its dominance in the crucial market as a cudgel.

            "The obama administration filed a trade complaint on tuesday asking china to loosen its restrictions on exports of rare-earth minerals — materials essential to the manufacture of a wide range of products, from missiles and computers to car batteries and cellphones. In an appearance at the white house rose garden, president obama announced that the united states has asked the world trade organization to facilitate formal consultations with china over its limits on rare-earth exports, in a case filed jointly with japan and the european union. Officials in beijing said tuesday that china will vigorously defend its right to control the export of such materials. The official state-run news agency, xinhua, warned that any u.s. Move to lodge a trade complaint over the issue would \"backfire. \" in choosing to make a stand, u.s. Officials are highlighting an industry over which china has a near-monopoly. The country now produces more than 95 percent of the world's rare-earth minerals, which are used in almost all advanced industrial products, from helicopter blades to solar panels to the batteries in electric cars to flat-screen televisions. And china has shown in recent years that it is not afraid to use its dominance in the crucial market as a cudgel. In 2010, during a territorial dispute with japan, the chinese government halted the shipment of anything containing so-called \"rare-earths \" to japan, causing a temporary panic",

The police chief of greenland, new hampshire, and a drug task force attempted to execute a search warrant on the home of cullen mutrie at around 6pm, the ap reports, but mutrie allegedly opened fire, killing maloney and wounding four detectives. \" in those final days, he sacrificed his life in public service as a law enforcement officer in new hampshire, \" says a police spokesman. The shooting led to an overnight standoff, with mutrie holed up inside the home. When things got quiet around 2am, authorities sent a robot equipped with a camera into the house, and found mutrie dead along with a female acquaintance, in either an apparent murder-suicide or double-suicide. Maloney's tragic death wasn't the only police shooting last night either; in modesto, california, a deputy and civilian were killed while trying to serve an eviction notice, in an incident that somehow ended with the apartment catching fire.

After being teased by \" mischievous elements \" in a warehouse, the animal headed to the hospital, where it entered a three-patient ward, the wall street journal reports. The patients were evacuated, but the leopard stayed in the facility for 12 hours, an official says. After wildlife advocates turned up to tranquilize the animal, it fled — by smashing through a window and a wall. Soon after, it bit a police officer, but \" i am absolutely fine now and set to hunt the leopard down, \" the officer says. With the animal still free, schools and stores in the city have been closed today. Such incidents aren't common in meerut, but two people were killed by leopards last year elsewhere in india.",

Cdc researchers, who began recommending the vaccine for women and girls in 2006, say the results of a new study are \" exactly what we would expect. \" after the hpv vaccine became available, infection rates fell 64 % to 4.3 % among girls 14 to 19 and dropped 34 % to 12.1 % among women 20 to 24. Rates of hpv — the most common sti in the us — among women 25 and older did not drop, though this age group is far less likely to be vaccinated, per the new york times and guardian. The rate among sexually active females 24 and under who were vaccinated was just 2.1 % from 2009 to 2012, while the rate among those who weren't vaccinated was significantly higher at 16.9 %, reports usa today. One doctor calls the study \" incredibly exciting. \" \" the vaccine is more effective than we thought, \" says debbie saslow of the american cancer society. \" it means there's going to be a whole lot less disease \" related to hpv. Cases of genital warts and pre-cancers for women in their 20s will begin dropping soon, followed by cases of cervical, vaginal, anal, and throat cancers in a decade or so, she adds. \" but we would see greater impact with greater vaccine coverage, \" the study's lead author says. By 2012, researchers found just 51 % of teen girls and 33 % of women under 24 had received at least one of the three doses of the vaccine. Saslow says it isn't as strongly recommended by doctors as other vaccines, but the times notes this study will likely \" serve as a welcome energizer in the tumultuous struggle to encourage hpv vaccination. \" later studies will focus on the vaccine's effect on young men and boys.

The concoction, which changes colors and flavors as it's mixed, contains whole milk, whipped cream, a variety of flavored syrups, and blue and pink \" fairy powders \" sprinkled on top — all of which serves up 59 grams of sugar in the grande ( 16-ounce ) version. That may not mean much on its own, but buzzfeed offers context: for starters, 59 grams ( about 15 teaspoons ) significantly exceeds the american heart association's recommendation of no more than 6 to 9 teaspoons of sugar daily. If you're more of a visual learner, consider that a can of coke has about 39 grams, or that you'd have to eat nearly six servings of frosted flakes to come near the unicorn elixir's sugar content.

Reuters and the ap report that after a three-month delay due to manufacturing concerns, ocrevus will become accessible in the united states in two weeks. It is the first treatment approved for primary progressive multiple sclerosis ( ppms ), a severe form of the chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system where symptoms steadily worsen, usually without remission, eventually causing loss of cognitive ability and paralysis. In one of the two clinical trials testing the drug, patients with ppms saw a 24 % decrease in the risk of symptoms progressing compared to those receiving a placebo, reports the new york times. Jerrie gullick, a patient in the ppms clinical trial, says that while she hasn't been cured, she is relieved to see the decline slowing. \"i was figuring another five years, and i was going to be bed-bound, and one day i realized i might have 20 or 30 more years of this, \" says gullick. \"it's like i was on a bullet train, and i was transferred to a local. \" according to the fda, ocrevus is an intravenous infusion that must be administered by healthcare professionals. The cost of treatment is listed at $ 65,000 per year, which, while expensive, is a 25 % decrease from a rival treatment currently being used in the united states. As for patients with the more common relapsing form of ms, ocrevus is seen as safer than many of the existing treatments, with fewer serious side effects.",

        "summary": "An apparent chemical attack that killed scores of people tuesday is being called one of the worst atrocities of the syrian civil war — and president trump blames his predecessor. The \" heinous \" actions of the assad regime \" are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution, \" trump said in a statement, per nbc news. \" president obama said in 2012 that he would establish a'red line, ' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. \" syrian activists say at least 72 people, including many children, were killed in a regime airstrike on a rebel-held town in idlib province. In other developments: russia's ministry of defense claimed the deaths were the result of an airstrike on a \" terrorist \" chemical weapons workshop in the town of khan sheikhoun, cnn reports. The syrian government also blamed rebels for the deaths and denied involvement in the airstrike. The us, britain, and france are pushing the united nations security council to adopt a resolution condemning the attack and ordering the syrian government to provide international investigators with information, including flight logs, the new york times reports. Secretary of state rex tillerson said it was clear the attack involved chemical weapons and accused the assad regime of \" barbarism, \" nbc news reports. \" those who defend and support him, including russia and iran, should have no illusions about assad or his intentions, \" tillerson said in a statement. \" anyone who uses chemical weapons to attack his own people shows a fundamental disregard for human decency and must be held accountable. \" turkey's health minister says 30 syrians were taken across the border for treatment and that they showed symptoms of a chemical attack, according to reports in the turkish media. Harrowing photos and videos from the scene showed piles of dead children. Hassan haj ali, commander of the free idlib army rebel group, tells reuters that russia's claim rebels are responsible is a lie, and that opposition forces in the area don't have the capacity to produce chemical weapons. He says many people saw the plane bomb the area with gas. The washington post calls trump's statement blaming obama \" puzzling, \" especially in light of trump tweets from 2013 in which he urged obama not to enforce his \" red line \" against syria after a chemical attack. The attack is believed to have involved sarin gas, which has been used before in syria. Chemical weapons expert colonel hamish de bretton-gordon tells the bbc that russia's version of events is \" pretty fanciful \" and that it's hard to believe that a gas like sarin would have",

Manuel hassassian, the palestinian envoy to britain, tells the bbc that the moves are a \" declaration of war \" in the middle east and will be the \" kiss of death \" to hopes of a two-state peace plan. Moving the embassy to the disputed city of jerusalem is required by a law brought in under bill clinton in 1995, the ap notes, but it has been waived on national security grounds under six-month waivers ever since. Officials say trump is likely to sign another waiver delaying the move and will keep doing so until preparations for the move to jerusalem are complete, which could take as long as four years. The trump announcement is expected at 1pm est, and us embassies around the world, especially in the middle east, have been advised to step up security, the guardian reports.

Researchers, who tracked 150,000 soldiers from 2001 to 2008, found that most of those who killed themselves were heavy drinkers who suffered from depression or had been diagnosed with manic depression, cnn reports. Surprisingly, being deployed for longer than a year was associated with a lower risk of suicide. The study suggests that military suicides can be curbed with the same approaches used in civilian life, but the problem in the military is that doctors can end patients ' careers by recommending early discharge, making soldiers less likely to seek help, army medical corps col. Charles engel tells bloomberg. \" the answer has to be an effort to approximate civilian standards of confidentiality, \" he says. \" unless we're dealing with an imminent risk to combat or a tactical mission, really we should be using civilians'standards. \"",
