Police opened fire on their buses, killing six people. Witnesses said that most of the survivors - all trainee teachers - were bundled into police vans. Some had gone into hiding and contacted their relatives after several days, still fearing for their lives. Twenty-two police officers are being held in connection with the 27 september shooting. Mr blanco said one of those detained had admitted that 17 students had been shot dead at the site where the bodies were found. But he stressed that investigators had not confirmed the suspect's story. ' anonymous tip'the students had been taking part in a protest over job discrimination against rural teachers.

According to mohl, viafore managed to cling to his boat for up to 10 minutes after it capsized on their april 19 voyage on the hudson river, but graswald didn't place a call to 911 until 20 minutes after the capsizing — and witnesses saw her deliberately capsize her own kayak. Bail was set at $ 3 million, the new york daily news reports. After the hearing, graswald's lawyer said there seemed to be \" a really big difference \" between the \" inconsistencies \" police spoke of when she was charged with murder earlier this month and the outright confession mohl spoke of at the hearing, which he thinks may have been coerced, the new york times reports. Graswald is from latvia and her lawyer tells the poughkeepsie journal there was a \" very clear language barrier \" when she spoke to investigators. Before the hearing, the lawyer defended some suspicious social media posts and diary entries from his client. Police in poughkeepsie say a body was pulled from the hudson river yesterday, but they haven't confirmed it's viafore, the times reports.",

The plan would replace the tax code with a 9 % corporate tax, 9 % income tax and 9 % federal sales tax, which would amount to a big tax cut for the wealthy, who spend little of their income, but a big tax increase for most other families, since it eliminates the deductions they rely on. \"just like it would be wrong to claim pizza is a low-calorie meal, cain's description of the plan's impact on working americans is highly misleading, \" kessler concludes. The plan was dealt another blow yesterday when one of cain's own consultants told politico that, contrary to cain's assertions in the debate, the plan was not practical, because it's \"so alien to the current system that it would be a great shock, \" and that while it was a fine plan economically, it \"wouldn't be the one i picked. \"",

Troyer said that information led officers to the two men. Officers searched the men's home with cadaver dogs and found the woman's body. Detectives think the burglary happened before the missing person report was filed, and that the house was a random target and the men were not involved in her death. \" we were able to backtrack that these guys were actually burglars and thieves and not murderers, \" troyer said. \" but still, pretty creepy...

A man opened fire during her victory speech, killing one person and critically wounding another, reports ctv. The suspect, a man in his 50s, then started a fire and ran away. He was pursued by firefighters and held until police arrived. Witnesses reported hearing the man say — in french — \" that's enough \" and \" the anglos are waking up, \" the globe and mail reports. After nine years in opposition, the parti quebecois won a minority mandate in the canadian province's election. Leaders have promised to confront the federal government and win more powers for the province. Another pro-independence referendum is a possibility, although polls show support for independence is much lower than in 1995, when the pro-independence side lost a referendum by a margin of just 1 %. \" i have convictions and i am going to defend them, \" marois said during her victory speech. \" there will be a referendum when the quebec population wants a referendum. \"",

Nyasasaurus parringtoni lived between 240 million and 245 million years ago, some 10 million to 15 million years earlier than any other dinosaurs previously discovered. Researchers stopped short of calling the nyasasaurus the earliest dinosaur, because just six vertebrae and an upper arm bone are available to study, but numerous clues indicate the beast is, in fact, a dinosaur. \" there was this big gap in the fossil record where dinosaurs should've been present and this fossil neatly fills that gap, \" the study co-author tells the bbc. Paleontologists have long believed dinosaurs existed in the middle triassic period, the era from which this fossil dates. If it is indeed a dinosaur, this fossil shows that dinosaurs started out \" as a very insignificant group of reptiles \" before exploding into the dominant life form on earth millions of years later, the co-author says.

They say people ducked for cover when gunshots rang out as thousands of people left the stadium. They then saw the shooter running into a nearby car and driving off. On saturday, the brazilian military executed a controlled explosion near the finish line of the men's road cycling race. They were blowing up a suspicious bag that had been left unattended, the guardian reports. Officials say the bag may have belonged to a homeless man, but they had to take precautions. The racers were 60 miles away at the time, but the explosion \" stunned \" people hoping to watch the end of the race, according to afp. The sydney morning herald reports a bullet came ripping through the media room at the deodora equestrian center and landed near a photographer saturday. No one was hurt, but the bullet left a hole in the tent's roof. The venue is near a military base, and it's possible the bullet was accidentally fired toward the venue by someone on the base.",

        "summary": "Feel like you're working too much? consider moving to europe: europeans work 19 % fewer hours than us workers, or about one hour less per weekday, a new paper finds. Researchers looked at three labor-force surveys from the us and europe to find out how many hours a person works, on average, in various countries. They found that americans work an average of 1,353 hours per year, the highest number of the 19 countries studied, fortune reports. Compare that to italy, where each person only works an average of 960 hours per year, the lowest number of hours of any country studied. Americans are also retiring later, taking less vacation time, and, as quartz reports, are more likely to work odd hours, such as the middle of the night or weekends. As recently as the early 1970s, us and western european workers actually clocked about the same number of hours, bloomberg reports. It's not clear what's changed or how to account for the discrepancy, but some economists point to the fact that there's more incentive to work harder for a promotion in the us, because people earn a wider range of incomes there than in europe, so it's more likely they ' ll get a significant raise. There's also the fact that taxes are significantly higher in europe, meaning that there's less of an incentive to work more hours and earn more money that will be taxed. Finally, there's the fact that labor unions and worker protections are stronger in europe, and pensions are more generous there.",

            "A recent study found that, on average, europeans work fewer hours than americans do. According to the paper, americans work nearly 25 % more hours than europeans. In other words, that's an additional 258 hours per year or an hour more each weekday. The working paper, which has not yet been published, was written by three economists — alexander bick of arizona state university, bettina bruggeman of mcmaster university in ontario, and nicola fuchs-schundeln of goethe university frankfurt. The authors looked at 18 european countries and the u.s. Of the 19 total countries they examined, the u.s. Came out on top averaging 26.1 hours per person per week; italy worked the fewest hours with an average of 18.4 hours. The study looked at hours per person. It doesn't only include people currently in the workforce, but those either retired or taking time off for some other reason, like unemployment or vacation. Ultimately, it doesn't measure productivity, but rather total time spent at work. The disparity in hours worked between the u.s. And europe could be explained in various ways or, more likely, is an amalgamation of numerous different reasons. Taxes, for one, are much higher in europe than in the u.s. According to bloomberg, that gives european workers less incentive to work longer hours. It may also have something to do with labor unions, which generally have more power in europe than they do in the u.s. Additionally, europeans tend to get generous pensions, rather than investment plans like the 401( k ) many american workers receive. As a result, there are more american workers over 65-years-old now than there have been at any point in the past 50 years."

Shocking stories have emerged about the plight of the estimated 40,000 people there. Doctors without borders says 28 people — including six babies — have starved to death since december 1, with another 250 people currently suffering from \" acute malnutrition. \" the situation has become so dire that residents have resorted to eating cats, reports nbc news.

Madaya is controlled by anti-government forces but encircled by government troops, and the un struck a deal last week to allow the aid. The bigger problem is that about 400,000 syrians are believed to be trapped in similar situations elsewhere. \" using hunger as a weapon flies in the face of international law, \" notes the analysis. \" yet global and regional powers — like russia, iran, the united states and saudi arabia — are unable or unwilling to pressure their battlefield allies. \"",

Insiders tell nbc that major networks may be willing to host him, just not exclusively. There might also be a spicer reality show in the works, one source says. Spicer has already signed with worldwide speakers group to manage his paid speaking engagements.

The title, which was dreamed up by two men separately after mitt romney's comments about pbs and big bird at the first presidential debate, is a play off 1995's \" million man march \" for civil rights, also held at the national mall. Los angeles animation executive michael bellavia, 43, bought www.millionmuppetmarch.com while watching the debate, then later discovered that idaho university student chris mecham, 46, had launched a facebook page with the same name. Shortly after the debate ended, they were already on the phone planning the protest. \" romney was using muppets as a rhetorical device to talk about getting rid of public broadcasting, which is really so much bigger than sesame street, \" mecham says. \" while he was still talking i was thinking of ways i could express my frustration at that argument. \"",

But no. \" [ abrams ] started yelling... ' you won't believe this, you've got to come here and see what's happening, ' \" his phd adviser lea goentoro tells national geographic. Reporting this week in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences, abrams says he watched the jellyfish, which relies on being symmetrical to move about, not regenerate the missing arms but rather rearrange its remaining six limbs so that they were symmetrical again. The phenomenon, dubbed symmetrization, has never before been observed in nature, and abrams was floored. The jellyfish was using its own muscles to push and pull on its remaining six arms to space them out evenly again. ( they confirmed this by observing that muscle relaxants made the jellies unable to rearrange their arms, while increasing muscular pulses allowed them to rearrange their arms faster. ) and the discovery was accidental; abrams and his team had only been cutting into the common moon jellyfish to practice for their future study on what are called immortal jellyfish, which had yet to arrive in the lab. They've since observed symmetrization in moon jellies many times, and it takes anywhere from 12 hours to four days to complete. ( scientists recently made another staggering observation, this one in norway. )",

Recreational park and rock creek regional park, \" processed for human consumption, \" and the meat given to the maryland food bank, though a montgomery parks rep tells bethesda magazine the number will probably be more like 100 to 150. \" these geese are year-round residents and create multiple issues for park users and staff, \" david petersen says. \" the excessive feces they leave, up to one pound daily, is not only unsightly but causes unsanitary conditions. \" he also tells wtop that geese protective of their offspring have been known to attack people, and that their grazing damages turf and grass. Petersen says that the gathering of the geese, which will run the parks department about $ 20 per bird, will take place through the end of june and into mid-july and stresses that it wasn't an easy decision to put the geese down, especially after criticism from the humane society. \" these roundup and killing programs for geese are not effective because they simply leave open empty attractable habitat, and that habitat will be refilled by geese coming in from nearby areas, \" a humane society director tells bethesda magazine. Petersen rebuts that, noting to wtop that the parks department has been tapping into other, nonlethal methods \" for a number of years \" and that \" all these things have been marginally effective. \" he also points out it's not an unusual method to get rid of pesky fowl, noting everyone from homeowners associations to federal agencies have gone this route.

The family's attention now turns to the lone survivor, elijah estrada, 10, who was released from a hospital over the weekend. He had been ejected from the red volkswagen convertible, and witnesses say they helped pull him from the water, where he had been holding on to flotation buoys. Elijah's uncle, steven abbott, tells the victorville daily press that the boy is doing well and appears to be in good health. Relatives kept a vigil at the aqueduct in hesperia amid a makeshift memorial of candles, flowers, and stuffed animals as police searched for noah in the water and by air. Authorities ended the search because of unsafe conditions from a strong current and poor visibility. Two gofundme accounts ( here and here ) have been set up to help kevin abbott, the husband and father, pay funeral expenses. Abbott, an iraq war veteran who was not in the car, is \" having a hard time right now, \" says a cousin. \" he's been put in a position where he's now a single father, so we're looking for any support we can get. \" the car crashed through a fence and into water about 6: 40pm thursday, and the cause is under investigation.

The much-anticipated report was released this morning following a furious night of editing, but the substance of it hasn't changed much since a draft was released in august.

Addie died after 160 days in the nicu; a few weeks later, hanson pumped for the last time, then gave away all her excess milk: 5,000 frozen ounces — that's nearly 40 gallons — or enough to feed about 22 preemies for a month, nurses say.

Now, investigators and the new york times may have pinpointed the culprit behind the cfc-11 chlorofluorocarbon: factories making foam insulation in remote parts of china. Putting cfc-11 in the insulation, which is used in buildings and refrigerators, isn't as costly as legal alternatives, and some factory owners were surprisingly frank with the times about their usage. \" of course, we chose the cheaper foam agent, \" one factory owner, whose plant has since been shut down, says. \" that's how we survived. \" the environmental investigation agency, an independent watchdog, says it found at least eight factories in china using cfc-11 to make foam. The eia estimates up to 70 % of foam production there uses the chemical, per climate home news. An expert tells the times that factories using cfc-11, a violation of 1987's montreal protocol, are often smaller operations ( some don't even have names ) that move around rural outposts to avoid detection; if they do get caught, they simply shrug and pay any fines, if they're not shut down. A study published in nature in may stressed the issues that this unexpected jump in cfc-11 emissions could pose, namely pushing back the full recovery of the ozone layer by at least 10 years ( the target date was originally for the middle of this century ). The head of the un's environment program tells the times that the renewed cfc-11 production is \" an environment crime \" that requires immediate action. \" we have to dig deeper, \" erik solheim says in a statement. \" based on the scale of detected emissions, there is good reason to believe the problem extends beyond these uncovered cases. \" ( in other news, researchers see a controversial way to help the planet. )",

In the world we avoided thanks to the protocol the uv index measure during a washington, dc or los angles mid-summer day would be at least 30 by 2070. Anything over 11 is considered extreme. There would have been an additional 280 million cases of skin cancer, 1.5 million skin cancer deaths, and 45 million cataracts in the united states, according to the u.s. Epa. Further, climate change would have been far worse by mid-century because the chemicals that \"eat \" ozone are also super-greenhouse gases, thousands of times more potent than co2. And that would have meant the potential intensity of hurricanes and cyclones would have increased three times, another study found.

Mit researchers say the extinction period's duration clocked in at 60,000 years, plus or minus 48,000 years. As phys.org puts it, that's \" practically instantaneous, from a geological perspective. \" to get your geological periods and catastrophic disasters straight: the die-off signified the end of the permian period and launched the start of the triassic; the mass die-off of the dinosaurs happened much later, 66 million years ago at the cretaceous period's close, when livescience reports 85 % of life was wiped out. The researchers came to their conclusion by using cutting-edge dating techniques on tiny minerals known as zircons found in rocks in meishan, china, that date to the period. But the rocks also held carbon dioxide data; from there, the researchers determined that a surge of the gas occurred 10,000 to 20,000 years before the die-off: ocean acidification may have have occurred, and sea temps could have jumped as much as 50 degrees. But what was the source of the increased carbon dioxide that marked the beginning of the end? mit researchers are now dating rocks from the siberian traps to determine if volcanic eruptions there could have been the culprit.",

        "summary": "Pee-wee herman is back in his first movie since 1988's big top pee-wee — and this time he's coming to us via netflix. Bestowed an invite to a birthday party, pee-wee leaves his comfortable fairville and confronts reptiles, bank robbers, and some ladies looking to get hitched in pee-wee's big holiday. Here's what critics are saying: audiences are in for \" a shaggier, less rigorously paced adventure \" than they might be used to with pee-wee, but they ' ll find \" frequent and long-lasting laughs along the way, \" writes erik adams at av club. Even at 63, paul ruebens hasn't lost his \" undeniable energy \" and the film as a whole is \" a testament to the lasting power of reubens'signature character. Like fairville, he exists outside of time. \" jason guerrasio agrees that \" reubens'strange brand of humor … works as well today as it did in the ' 80s. \" some of the finest moments come via gadgets or a scene involving a balloon, he writes at business insider. \" yet the secret weapon of the movie, its modern touch, is ( joe ) manganiello. He is extremely funny and has a chemistry with reubens that you'd never think would work until you see it on the screen for yourself. \" \" the odd-couple bromance … is something to behold, \" but pee-wee's \" antics haven't aged well, \" writes brian truitt at usa today. Whether he finds a receptive audience among a new generation \" depends on their capacity for old-fashioned humor, \" he adds. There's nothing close to as memorable as what can be found in pee-wee's big adventure, he says. \" holiday can't be considered a big adventure or even a worthwhile nostalgia trip. \" brian lowry felt \" an initial rush of nostalgia and enthusiasm, which by the end had given way to silliness fatigue, and the question, ' when will this be over? ' \" which might simply be \" a reminder that some things are best consumed in smaller doses, \" he writes at variety. \" reubens remains as deft at bringing his man-sized child to life as he ever was, \" but \" the biggest surprise, frankly, might be that the funniest person here is frequently manganiello. \"",

Chekatt is accused of killing three people and wounding 13 on tuesday night. Castaner said earlier thursday that three of the injured had been released from the hospital and three others were fighting for their lives. More than 700 officers were deployed to find chekatt, government spokesman benjamin griveaux told cnews television. French authorities said chekatt had 27 criminal convictions, receiving the first at age 13.

The resettlement program has emerged as an issue in the us presidential campaign, with republican nominee donald trump alleging displaced syrians pose a potential security threat. Alice wells, the us ambassador to jordan, said sunday that keeping americans safe and taking in some of the world's most vulnerable people are not mutually exclusive, the ap reports. \" refugees are the most thoroughly screened category of travelers to the united states, and syrian refugees are subject to even greater scrutiny, \" she said. The resettlement program focuses on the most vulnerable refugees, including those who were subjected to violence or torture or are sick. Close to 5 million syrians have fled civil war since 2011. Most struggle to survive in tough conditions in neighboring countries, including jordan, which hosts close to 660,000 syrian refugees. Only a small percentage of syrian refugees have been resettled to third countries. Instead, donor countries are trying to invest more in job creation and education for refugees in regional host countries to encourage them to stay there instead of moving onward, including to europe. Wells said the us has taken in more refugees from around the world over the years than all other nations combined. \" [ i feel ] fear and joy, fear of the unknown and our new lives, but great joy for our children's lives and future, \" says nadim fawzi jouriyeh, 49, from the war-ravaged syrian city of homs.

        "summary": "In all of israeli history, only one man has been sentenced to death by a civilian court and then executed: adolf eichmann. On wednesday, the country released the nazi's handwritten plea for clemency, penned two days before he was hanged. The afp reports the release coincides with international holocaust remembrance day, and quotes, along with the bbc and ynetnews, from the may 29, 1962, letter, in which eichmann tries to make the case that he was merely following orders when he implemented the \" final solution \": \" [ the judges ] made a fundamental mistake in that they are not able to empathize with the time and situation in which i found myself during the war years. There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders. Had i been, as the judges assume, the fanatical driving force in the persecution of the jews, this should have been reflected in a promotion and other rewards, but i was never granted any benefit. I am not able to recognize the court's ruling as just, and i ask, your honor mr. President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out. \" the times of israel reports that eichmann — who fled a pow camp after the war, made his way to argentina, and was kidnapped by israeli intelligence agents in 1960 — was cremated hours after his may 31 hanging; his ashes were spread in the mediterranean sea. Wednesday's release includes related documents, including president yitzhak ben-zvi's rejection of the request; the letter eichmann's wife, vera, wrote to ben-zvi; and chief prosecutor gideon hausner's moving handwritten opening statement that referenced the \" six million accusers \" with him who \" are now only ashes. \" ( the dark details of france's wwii vichy regime were exposed last month. )",

That name had long clued archaeologists into the potential for such a find: dingwall is likely derived from the word thingvellir, or \" the field of the assembly, \" livescience reports. But finding a \" thing \" site is no small task, in part because the gatherings usually occurred in open fields, and the temporary nature of them meant only modest traces of human life were left behind. Indeed, this is only the second \" thing \" found in the uk, the scotsman reports. It was uncovered after the team used historical records to identify a mound that had once been called the \" assembly mound \"; a parking lot now covers it. Excavations \" indicated that the mound was man-made, \" likely in the 11th century, says site director oliver jt o ' grady, and \" radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late norwegian political influence in ross-shire and wider. \" he and his team aren't exactly sure who built the site, but based on its size, that creator would have needed both \" political power and resources, \" explains livescience.

It ended thusly: \" i give my name that all know of me, so history do tell, what love can do to a gentleman born. Yours truly, jack the ripper. \" it appears to belong to wealthy liverpool cotton merchant james maybrick, who died a year later, but many experts dismissed the tell-all tome as a sophisticated forgery. Now, the telegraph reports, a team led by writer and film director bruce robinson has unearthed timecards that show which electricians were working on maybrick's home, battlecrease house, on march 9, 1992, the morning the book was said to have been found. The man who came up with the diary, scrap metal dealer mike barrett, claimed to have gotten it through a family friend who died soon thereafter, leading many to believe it was a fake. But barrett was a colorful character who frequented the saddle inn public house in anfield, where one of the electricians working on battlecrease house was also a regular. Because barrett fancied himself a writer, it is believed that the electricians who found the book passed it onto barrett, who then famously contacted a london literary agent that very day in march claiming he had jack the ripper's diary, adds the sun. Mental floss notes that many suspects have been proposed over the decades, including a former royal obstetrician. ( the ripper's last known victim remains mysterious. )",

That's because all kinds of metals end up in sewage sludge, which is the leftovers from treated sewage, science reports. Researchers in arizona recently found that a city of a million people could generate up to $ 13 million a year in such metals, with $ 2.6 million of that coming in the form of gold and silver. They studied the samples, which came from 32 states, with a mass spectrometer, discover reports; the tool uses extreme heat to reveal elements. On a global scale, they found, sludge probably contains about 360 tons of gold each year. \" while we expected that the metals were present at low concentration, the fact that the small amounts represent such a significant economic value was definitely surprising, \" a study co-author tells time. Getting at those metals might sound like a pipe dream, quite literally, but a city in japan was able to get about four pounds of gold from every metric ton of ash from burned sludge. That's better than what some mines can offer, science notes. \" we need to make this push where we stop thinking about ( sewage sludge ) as a liability and instead we think about it as a resource, \" says an outside researcher. Unfortunately, there's not currently any technology to extract metals from sludge on a large scale, but if we could someday find a way to do so, there could be environmental benefits, too: the metals in sludge, which is often used as fertilizer, may not be great for the environment, so removing them could be a good thing.

The satellite will be tasked with logging the positions and distances to some 1 billion stars — that's 1 % of the stars in the galaxy — but it's expected to turn up much more. Its sophisticated instruments ( among them, a 1 billion-pixel camera ) should facilitate the discovery of unknown asteroids, comets, dead stars, and even planets, reports the bbc. The end result: the most realistic understanding yet of how the milky way was assembled. The european space agency describes the process: each star will be reviewed an average 70 times over a five-year period, with gaia measuring the distance of the star from the sun ( along with properties like brightness, temperature, and chemical composition ) as it moves around the sun. The repeat measurements will allow gaia to map the brightest stars ' coordinates to within seven micro-arcseconds, which an esa official describes as an angle \" equivalent to the size of a euro coin on the moon as seen from earth. \" space.com notes that the esa launched a previous star-mapping mission in 1989; that satellite, hipparcos, could measure the distances of bright stars within 3,250 light-years with a modest margin of error.

        "summary": "From a month-old copy of physical review letters, npr stumbled on an article bearing the somewhat impenetrable title, \" viscoelastic suppression of gravity-driven counterflow instability. \" behind the mouthful was an interesting premise: that the calamitous bp well could have been plugged using oobleck. The combination of two parts cornstarch to one part water, which takes its name from dr. Seuss's bartholomew and the oobleck, is a bizarre substance that flows like a liquid at slow speeds, and turns solid at fast. The idea is the brainchild of physics professor jonathan katz, who noted that in the failed top-kill approach, the oil and gas rocketing up the well broke the drilling mud into fine particles. That made him wonder whether there was a fluid that wouldn't share the same fate — and then he thought of oobleck. Katz, who was on the energy secretary's advisory panel, sent out his idea; but he was cut from the panel a short time later due to some controversial social opinions on his website. The report in physical review letters notes that when katz experimented with the mixture and mineral oil under highly idealized circumstances, it did indeed work. A bp spokeswoman told npr its engineers decided the idea wouldn't fly, and one professor of fluid dynamics points out another issue: because oobleck turns into a solid at fast speeds, he calculated that you'd have to pump it so slowly that you couldn't get it down the hole faster than the oil was coming up.",

She was first arrested in june and has now been sentenced to a year in prison for allegedly spreading propaganda against the ruling system, reports the ap. She tried to enter the stadium with other women to protest iran's ban on women attending male-only matches, and her brother believes she was singled out for harsh treatment because she holds both iranian and british citizenship. Iran extended a long-standing ban on women attending men's soccer matches to volleyball in 2012, arguing that women needed protection from unruly fans. Amnesty says ghavami was beaten after her arrest and put in solitary confinement in a tehran prison, where she spent two weeks on hunger strike last month. Her lawyer tells the los angeles times that he has never been given the chance to meet with his client outside of court and that authorities have threatened to put her on trial again over unspecified additional charges. The bbc reports that british authorities have raised objections to ghavami's treatment, and a petition to free her has received more than 700,000 signatures.

        "summary": "\" think before you jerk. \" \"jerking isn't a joke. \" such slogans, as reported in the washington post and elsewhere, garnered national attention when used to remind drivers in south dakota not to over-correct their steering on slick roads. Indeed, the standard theory behind the way we steer our cars dates back to the 1940s but has left us with a longstanding mystery: data shows that we have a habit of jerking the wheel from time to time, puzzling researchers. Now, experts in sweden are explaining the phenomenon, and their findings could lead to better safety systems in cars, according to a release at eureka alert. The jerkiness is tied to the way humans reach for things: when something is close by, we move our arms more slowly to grab it than we do when it's further away. The result is that both movements take the same amount of time. \" we immediately recognized this pattern \" as similar to steering behaviors, a researcher says. \" it was a bit of a eureka moment. Was it possible that this basic human behavior also controlled how we steer a car? \" a study of more than 1,000 hours of drivers ' movements suggests that it certainly was. The team developed a mathematical model addressing the behavior; now, \" it is possible to predict how far the driver is going to turn the wheel, right when the person starts a wheel-turning movement. It's like looking into the future, \" the researcher says. That could improve safety: for instance, if a sleepy driver is edging off the road, his car's support system could predict how much he's going to jerk the wheel to try to correct things, often disastrously, and intervene to prevent it. ( south dakota eventually decided to drop the \" don't jerk and drive \" campaign. )",

On the campaign's web site, it had sharable links reading \"think before you jerk \" and \"jerking isn't a joke, \" which some saw as an innuendo for masturbation. Officials admitted to the argus leader the double meaning was intentional. \"i decided to pull the ad, \" said trevor jones, secretary of the department of public safety, in a statement. \"this is an important safety message and i don't want this innuendo to distract from our goal to save lives on the road. \" a video for the campaign is still available online. \"i think the intent clearly was … when you start to go off the road, you should take your foot off the gas and gently go back on, \" state rep.

It's like me going through their drawers at their house, \" says jarvis kennedy, the tribal council's sergeant-at-arms. \" how would they feel if i drove over their grave and went through their heirlooms? \" he adds. Though he fears some artifacts will be stolen, kennedy gave no indication that he would go pick them up. \" all the stuff they are doing out there, it's like a crime scene, \" he says. \" once this is done, we ' ll see what's missing. \" last week, the tribe asked federal agencies to prosecute occupiers who \" disturb, damage, remove, alter, or deface any archaeological resource on the refuge property, \" per indian country today media network.",

Using images of a tablet discovered in 1976 but since lost, the pair dissected a series of jokes carved by a babylonian student thousands of years ago, and their conclusions, originally published in the journal iraq, have been getting some attention. The tablet contains six riddles that the researchers call \" wisdom literature, \" but the huffington post notes that the aphorisms aren't too different from today's frat party jokes. One refers to alcohol: \" in your mouth and your teeth, constantly stared at you, the measuring vessel of your lord. -what is it? beer. \" and while it may not be that funny to you, the researchers note that \" your teeth \" could also be interpreted as \" your urine. \" the aforementioned \" yo mama \" joke is, unfortunately, a piecemeal translation: \"... Of your mother is by the one who has intercourse with her. What/who is it? [ no answer ]. \" writing for io9, alasdair wilkins notes, with appreciation, the researchers'decision to leave \" it ambiguous whether the word is ' who ' or ' what'the mother is having sex with — even in ancient babylon, you just can't rule anything out when talking about one's mother. \"",

Mark udall revealed the existence of the report yesterday during a prickly hearing with caroline krass, president obama's nominee for cia general counsel. The senate is fighting to declassify its own 6,300-page report on torture, which reportedly castigates the program. The cia has blocked and vigorously rebutted that report, but lawmakers think its secret internal report backs it up. Krass didn't respond directly to udall's questions about the report yesterday, and udall says he won't support her nomination until the cia opens up about torture. He might not be her only detractor, either. The real drama in yesterday's hearings came when dianne feinstein pressed krass on whether she'd release the justice department legal memos used to justify practices like torture and drone strikes. Krass was evasive at first, but ultimately replied, \" i do not think so, as a general matter, \" arguing that the memos were \" confidential legal advice, \" the guardian and politico report. \" you are going to encounter some heat in that regard, \" feinstein warned.",

Specifically, says the lawyer for jacques rouschop, \" his stomach is too large and his penis is way, way too small, \" reports the ottawa citizen. The 44-year-old is accused of raping and choking two sex workers in 2013 in his pickup truck. But his first defense witness was a registered nurse who took the suspect's measurements in jail and testified that rouschop's penis was about 2 inches when erect. The 5-foot-6 rouschop also weighed about 400 pounds at the time of the alleged attacks and has an umbilical hernia about the size of a baseball, reports the national post. To buttress his case, jurors were shown photographs of his naked body. \"due to his weight and his appearance, he will be the first to tell you that he has had a lot of trouble attracting members of the opposite sex, and that getting a woman's attention, let alone having sex, was not something that happened very often for him, \" says his lawyer. She acknowledges that rouschop, a career thief, did indeed visit sex workers, but she maintains that he could not have raped a woman from behind, as one of the sex workers testified. The allegations stem from a police investigation into the 2013 murder of another sex worker, and while police have publicly linked rouschop to that crime, they have not charged him, reports the ottawa sun. \"he believes he is the subject of a witch hunt, \" says his attorney.

        "summary": "Nobody wants to bring home bedbugs after being on the road, and now scientists have some practical advice on how to avoid that fate. A new study in scientific reports shows that the little critters are drawn to the scent of dirty laundry, and the lead author translates that into traveling tips. For starters, put your luggage up on metal racks in a hotel room because bedbugs won't be able to climb up the smooth surface, says entomologist william hentley of the uk's university of sheffield, per gizmodo. You might also store your dirty clothes in a separate airtight bag. If the hotel has no metal racks, consider storing your entire suitcase in a plastic bag, which may seem like a pain, but nothing compared to the chore of ridding your home of bedbugs. \" soiled clothing left in an open suitcase, or left on the floor, of an infested room is more likely to attract bed bugs, \" the authors write. \" when packed into a suitcase, they will accompany their host back home. \" they figured this out by unleashing bedbugs in a room and leaving them be for 96 hours. Roughly twice as many bugs ended up in a cotton bag filled with dirty laundry as opposed to a bag of clean clothes. A rutgers entomologist who wasn't involved with the study tells science it's legit and offers some advice of his own. \" the biggest thing is not keeping your luggage on the bed, \" he says. Travelers also should wash and then dry clothes at the highest temperature upon returning home, he adds, because \" heat is the achilles heel of the bedbug. \" ( another study suggests the bugs prefer certain colors. )",

            "In the absence of a human host, bed bugs were twice as likely to aggregate on bags containing soiled clothes compared to bags containing clean clothes. Contrary to our predictions, elevated co 2 did not affect this result. We did not observe bed bugs aggregating on the side of the room with the co 2 source, but instead found an increased likelihood of bed bugs leaving their refuge. Our data are most consistent with the notion that elevated co 2 initiates host-seeking behaviour. This is similar to findings in aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae where very small increases in co 2 concentration stimulate host-seeking behaviour19, 20. The position of the co 2 source in a closed room above and away from the bed bug release point means directional cues as to the source of co 2 may have been difficult for bed bugs to discern and so it is not possible to conclude whether or not the lack",
