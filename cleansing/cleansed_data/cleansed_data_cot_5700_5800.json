His attorney says he is an aspiring police officer with an interest in military equipment — and a terrible sense of humor that got him in trouble. An tso sun, an 18-year-old exchange student from taiwan, was arrested tuesday night in upper darby on a charge of making a terroristic threat, cbs reports. Police say sun, who has been in the us for five months, was reported after telling a classmate at his suburban philadelphia high school: \" don't come to school on may 1, because i ' m going to shoot up the school. \" sun also allegedly asked the same student where he could buy a gun, and police say he researched assault rifles online. Police didn't discover any guns in sun's room with a host family, though they displayed items that they said showed the teen was plotting something \" horrible, \" the washington post reports. The items included a crossbow, a tactical vest, ammunition, a ski mask, and what police said were gun-making materials. \" when you're able to amass these types of items and you're not even a citizen of the united states … something's wrong somewhere, \" said police superintendent michael chitwood. Defense attorney enrique latoison acknowledged that it \" looks bad, \" but said everything in sun's room was legal and some of the items were part of a halloween costume. \" he was just thinking he's being funny.

Emwazi and alexanda kotey, 32, were part of a group referred to by prisoners ( including americans james foley, steven sotloff, and kayla mueller ) as the \" isis beatles \" because of their british accents, per cnbc. They were said to be the worst of the captors, traumatizing hostages with electric shock, waterboarding, and fake executions, and believed to have beheaded 27 hostages. And the guardian says yet another londoner, 31-year-old drug dealer aine davis, was also one of the so-called beatles and that he, emwazi, and kotey all attended the same london mosque ( a fourth, \" paul, \" played a smaller role ). Kotey, whose name was confirmed by a us intel official and others familiar with british nationals in syria, is of ghanaian and greek cypriot background and converted to islam in his early 20s when he met a muslim woman ( he had two kids with her before they parted ways ). Not as much has been revealed about davis, who itv says was of gambian heritage, born in london, and \" in need of guidance \" and a father figure, per someone who ided himself as an associate; the guardian adds davis ' wife was the first woman to be jailed on terrorism charges linked to syria. Kotey, who was especially key in radicalizing young men to come to syria, was either the beatle known as \" ringo \" or \" george. \" one danish ex-hostage recounts how ringo kicked him 25 times in the ribs on his 25th birthday, while george was simply known as the \" most violent and unpredictable \" of the four.

Lisa casali, an italian food writer who has penned an entire dishwasher cookbook, prefers to use canning jars and vacuum bags to make everything from couscous to dessert ( here's an instructional video of her making the former ), for one very practical reason: they're airtight, so you can add soap and do your dishes at the same time. \" after some experiments, i found that it wasn't just a different way to cook — it was a really particular technique, \" she says. \" something i was looking for years: the way to cook at low temperature at home. \" next up ( we hope ): how to roast a pig in a clothes dryer.",

While those six astronauts won't be affected much by the crash itself — they have enough supplies — three are due to return home next month, and the other three by mid-november, and several factors prevent them from extending their stays. Russia's space agency originally planned to launch a manned mission sept. 22, but that has now been postponed until late october or early november due to the failed launch, cnn adds.

Alexei krasnov of the space agency, roscosmos, said the next manned mission, originally planned to launch on september 22, now would occur in late october or early november, according to the ria novosti report. In the united states, nasa's space station program manager told reporters monday that the timing of the rescheduled mission could force the temporary de-manning of the space station later this year. However, the nasa official, mike suffredini, said no decisions can be made until a commission appointed by russia completes its investigation of the august 24 crash involving a soyuz rocket -- the same kind used to power the flights of crew members to the space station. With a planned rotation of the six crew members aboard the space station scheduled to begin next month, a delay in using the soyuz could prevent the ability to bring replacements, suffredini said. \" if we don't have soyuz flying by the middle of november -- the 16th or so, the normal landing time for the last crew -- we would have to de-man iss at that point, \" suffredini",

The international space station may have to start operating without a crew in november if russian engineers don't figure out soon what caused a recent rocket failure, nasa officials announced today ( aug. 29 ). The unmanned russian cargo ship progress 44 crashed just after its aug. 24 launch to deliver 2.9 tons of supplies to the orbiting lab. The failure was caused by a problem with the progress'soyuz rocket, which is similar to the one russia uses to launch its crew-carrying vehicle — also called soyuz — to the station. Currently, six astronauts reside on the space station. They shouldn't be unduly affected by the progress crash, nasa officials said, because they have enough supplies to last a while on orbit. But three of these astronauts are due to return to earth next month, and the rest are scheduled to come back in mid-november. At the moment, the soyuz is the only way to get astronauts to and from the station. So if the rocket anomaly isn't identified and fixed soon,"

However, the nasa official, mike suffredini, said no decisions can be made until a commission appointed by russia completes its investigation of the august 24 crash involving a soyuz rocket -- the same kind used to power the flights of crew members to the space station. With a planned rotation of the six crew members aboard the space station scheduled to begin next month, a delay in using the soyuz could prevent the ability to bring replacements, suffredini said. \" if we don't have soyuz flying by the middle of november -- the 16th or so, the normal landing time for the last crew -- we would have to de-man iss at that point, \" suffredini",
            "Sunlight glints off the international space station with the blue limb of earth providing a dramatic backdrop in this photo taken by an astronaut on the shuttle endeavour just before it docked after midnight on feb. 10, 2010 during the sts-130 mission. This story was updated at 12: 30 p.m. Edt. The international space station may have to start operating without a crew in november if russian engineers don't figure out soon what caused a recent rocket failure, nasa officials announced today ( aug. 29 ). The unmanned russian cargo ship progress 44 crashed just after its aug. 24 launch to deliver 2.9 tons of supplies to the orbiting lab. The failure was caused by a problem with the progress'soyuz rocket, which is similar to the one russia uses to launch its crew-carrying vehicle — also called soyuz — to the station. Currently, six astronauts reside on the space station. They shouldn't be unduly affected by the progress crash, nasa officials said, because they have enough supplies to last a while on orbit. But three of these astronauts are due to return to earth next month, and the rest are scheduled to come back in mid-november. At the moment, the soyuz is the only way to get astronauts to and from the station. So if the rocket anomaly isn't identified and fixed soon,"

        "summary": "Last week, australian officials said someone had plotted an indian ocean course on the flight simulator belonging to the pilot of missing malaysian airlines flight 370. This week, a renowned air-crash expert adds onto that, saying he believes the jet was deliberately brought down into the water, the bbc reports. Larry vance, who once headed up canada's transportation safety board, appeared on the aussie program 60 minutes and said that \" definite evidence \" suggests a controlled landing, not an autopilot crash that would've left plenty of floating debris, per the guardian. \" somebody was flying the airplane into the water, \" he said on the program. \" there is no other alternate theory that you can follow. \" he also thinks \" the fuselage is intact for the most part, and is on the bottom of the indian ocean, \" per the telegraph. Among the evidence vance cites are photos of one of the plane's recovered wing flaperons. The jaggedness of the wing section — suggesting it had eroded off as it dragged across the water, rather than enduring a clean break if it had haphazardly crashed — as well as the fact that the flaperon had been deployed at all indicate someone likely guided the plane into the water, vance said. \" the force of the water is really the only thing that could make that jagged edge that we see, \" he noted. Australian transport safety bureau investigator peter foley agrees with the \" rogue pilot \" theory, noting that a closer look at the crash by french officials indicates the jet was in a \" deployed state, \" meaning the plane may have landed outside of the current search area. The atsb hopes a second wing part discovered on the tanzania coast may offer further clues about the plane's final moments, news.com.au reports.",

        "summary": "Debi thomas is living in a bug-infested trailer in the appalachian mountains, broke and unemployed, the huffington post reports. But it wasn't always like this. Three decades ago, thomas was a champion figure skater. She won both the us and world championships and became the first african-american athlete to medal at the winter olympics. After her figure-skating career ended, she became a certified orthopedic surgeon. Then things changed. She says two failed marriages cost her her nest egg, and she had to close her private practice after only two years. She also lost custody of her 13-year-old son. Now the 48-year-old thomas is stuck in a mobile home with her fiancé, who has issues with anger and alcohol; his two sons; and a swarm of bedbugs, the huffington post reports. According to the new york daily news, thomas was reduced to begging fans for money through a gofundme page set up 10 months ago. \" what we need now is help keeping our heads above water until we can make our dreams a reality, \" she states in a video on the page. One of those dreams: a reality show. But she and her fiancé raised less than a quarter of the hoped-for $ 10,000. Instead, thomas has worked with a life coach for the reality tv series iyanla: fix my life on own, the huffington post reports. ( this athlete gave up her spot at the olympics to her twin sister. )",

        "summary": "Medicare's books have been opened up after an extended legal battle, and perhaps the most startling detail is that a single doctor was reimbursed nearly $ 21 million in 2012 alone. Florida ophthalmologist salomon melgen was one of 344 physicians who raked in more than $ 3 million from medicare that year, accounting for nearly $ 1.5 billion of the $ 64 billion paid to individual doctors in 2012, an ap analysis of the data finds. ( lab and ambulance services bump the total medicare paid out to $ 77 billion. ) the highest paid 2 % of doctors accounted for nearly a quarter of total medicare payments, and in the $ 3 million-plus club, the category leader was ophthalmologists; 151 of them accounted for nearly $ 658 million in medicare payments. The physician data released by the obama administration had been off-limits to the public for decades and will be pored over in the weeks to come by researchers, fraud investigators, insurers, and consumers, reports the new york times. Groups who pushed for the release of the database argue that it will speed up payment delivery reform and help guide patients to doctors who deliver quality care, but the american medical association, which opposed the release, warns that \" releasing the data without context will likely lead to inaccuracies, misinterpretations, false conclusions, and other unintended consequences. \" the washington post sounds a few notes of caution, pointing out that some high-billing doctors'totals could be explained by their efficiency or heavy number of medicare patients; further, some specialized procedures incur significant overhead, meaning a chunk of the money could end up in the hands of drug or medical device companies.",

He then hatched his plan: pose as a tourist, disarm a guard rather than bringing his own gun, and then, well, we ' ll let him take it from here: \" aim for target. No civilians to be injured.

Irish news anchor philip boucher-hayes has been following townley/islam for a while, and says, \" if i had to speculate wildly as to why townley has handed himself in to police it would be either because he has once again fallen on hard times and wants three square ( meals ) and a bed at the taxpayer's expense. Or perhaps he's trying to put himself beyond the reach of his creditors. \" as to a motive, islam says prince harry has \" blood on his hands \" because of his connection to the british army. In other royal news, prince william recently went boar hunting, leading outspoken animal rights activist morrissey to call the prince a \" thickwit \" and declare that he hopes william's and harry's \" hunting guns backfire in their faces, \" the daily beast reports.",

        "summary": "Whisky connoisseurs have long claimed that whisky tastes better with a splash of water, or on the rocks with ice cubes. And while that will always, ultimately, be a matter of taste, scientists in sweden have decided to study how the addition of water chemically alters the drink. They report in the journal scientific reports that they think they've hit upon a clue: diluting whisky with water coaxes the fixed number of taste molecules to the drink's surface, where we can enjoy them infiltrating our nostrils and mouths. To test this, scientists made their own computer model simulations to observe the water and ethanol of whisky and then watch how the molecules of those basic elements interact across different concentrations of the molecule guaiacol, which gives single-malt scotch whisky a smoky taste, reports npr. It turns out that when whisky is above 50 % alcohol, guaiacol lays low, resting at the bottom of a glass. A little water moves it closer to the surface for a boost in flavor, breaking dense clusters of alcohol, which cling to guaiacol molecules, and dispersing them upward. So what level of dilution is best? popular science asked wild turkey's master distiller for his thoughts; he admits to adding two ice cubes. ( scotch whisky sales recently took a dive in the us. )",

The bbc reports that sandford was tearful as he apologized in court for what he had done and for costing the taxpayers money. \" i just feel terrible about it, \" he said. \" you have a medical problem. You should not be ashamed or embarrassed about it. You need medication, \" the judge told sandford. \" you're not evil or a sociopath like a lot of people we have. I don't think you wanted to kill anybody. This was just some crazy stunt that your mind told you to do. \" according to court papers, sandford was in the us illegally on an expired tourist visa at the time of the june 18 rally. After he was arrested for trying to grab the officer's gun, he told secret service agents he had driven there from california to kill trump.

Previous research has found that beauty influences popularity, grades in school, and salary, reports the washington post. So it might not be too far a stretch to suggest that beauty plays a role in politics, too. One team of scientists posited that because beautiful people make more money, which makes them \" less inclined to support redistribution, \" it would follow that they'd tend to be more conservative as well. Reporting in the journal of public economics, they say their latest research confirms this. First, researchers showed participants photos of political candidates in finland, the european parliament, australia's house of representatives, and the us senate as well as candidates for state governorship. People rated candidates on a 5-point scale, and on all three continents the politicians on the right were rated more beautiful. They also found that without any other information, voters tend to assume that candidates with the so-called \" right look \" are conservative. Mediaite notes that in the us, the study found that republicans cared more about candidates ' looks than democrats did, if those voters didn't have much more information about them.

The research also noted that this was a correlation and not causation. Essentially, attractive people tend to drift towards more conservative political positions because life tends to be easier for them, considering they tend to make more money, and are thus going to be generally more resistant to the type of social welfare and redistribution programs championed by liberals.

The beaked whale in question apparently took a wrong turn into a river and swam into modern-day kenya about 17 million years ago, reports livescience. Based on where it was found, researchers have been able to pinpoint with the most accuracy yet when the east african plateau began rising. As the los angeles times explains, that is a monumental moment in the history of mankind, because this \"geologic upheaval \" transformed the region from dense forests into grasslands — and made it essential that early humans be able to walk upright. \" the whale is telling us all kinds of things, \" says a paleontologist at southern methodist university who co-authored the study in the journal pnas. \" it tells us the starting point for all that uplift that changed the climate that led to humans. It's amazing. \" the whale skull was originally found in 1964, misidentified as a turtle, and lost in storage for decades at harvard. Upon its redisocovery, researchers were able to use the original 1964 field notes to find the exact spot where it was found. \" today, that same spot is more than 2,000 feet above sea level, \" notes upi. Researchers know the fossil is 17 million years old because they can accurately date a lava flow found above it. As a result, they can safely conclude for the first time that the epochal uplift began no earlier than 17 million years ago. ( in israel, archaeologists unearthed a one-of-a-kind ancient mask. )",

New york police said a year ago that they were investigating de la huerta's allegations. No charges have been filed in the case, but weinstein is charged there with the rape of another woman. In a new allegation, the suit states that the following month weinstein exposed himself to the actress in a beverly hills hotel when she went to confront him. She alleges weinstein tried to get de la huerta to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman. About a year after the incidents, de la huerta was fired from the hbo show boardwalk empire, and the lawsuit states she has reason to believe weinstein was involved. It cites a photo that appeared in the new york times of weinstein talking to martin scorsese, a director and executive producer on the show, a few weeks before her firing. Weinstein's attorney ben brafman in response to the suit pointed out the lack of charges in new york, and said in an emailed statement that de la huerta's \" newly minted version of events including her new california claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination. \" more than 75 women have accused weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in hollywood, of wrongdoing.

The doctor, however, found that shkreli has \" generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and unspecified personality disorder, \" and that his actions were consistent with a \" sense of entitlement \" and a \" narcissistic outlook. \" it's not clear whether the assessment addressed shkreli's intelligence. But prosecutors made a point to note, \" dr.

In a letter to brooklyn federal court judge kiyo matsumoto on tuesday, shkreli's defense team asked that he be sent to the cushy digs located within camp canaan, a high-security federal prison for men in waymart, pa. Though matsumoto does not ultimately determine where shkreli will go, she can issue a recommendation to the us bureau of prisons. The judge sentenced shkreli to the prison time friday, in addition to a $ 75,000 fine, court-mandated therapy, community service and a nearly $ 7.3 million forfeiture. The order follows shkreli's conviction last year on charges of securities fraud for defrauding investors in multiple hedge funds he ran. The infamous loudmouth has been languishing at the metropolitan detention center since september, when he posted on facebook that he'd pay $ 5,000 per strand of hair, with follicle, plucked from the head of former secretary of state hillary clinton. While shkreli would typically have been destined for a white-collar camp, matsumoto found the hair bounty constituted a solicitation of a threat and rendered him a danger to the community, landing him in a much harsher penitentiary.

        "summary": "Despite its many purported advantages, the mediterranean diet might not be all it's cracked up to be. According to a new study in the international journal of epidemiology, its effects depend largely on socioeconomic status. Researchers surveyed 19,000 people ages 35 and over in italy, giving each a score based on how closely they followed the mediterranean diet, ranging from 1 on the low end up to 6 or more. After just over four years, they found a two-point increase in score meant a 15 % reduced risk of cardiovascular disease overall — but not for participants with low incomes and minimal education. While a two-point increase meant a reduced risk of 61 % for those with a household income of at least $ 47,000, and 57 % for those with post-secondary education, \" no actual benefits were observed for the less advantaged groups, \" per a release. Despite similar adherence to the diet, that remained the case after researchers accounted for healthy habits common among the rich, like getting plenty of exercise, avoiding smoking, and making regular visits to the doctor, per healthday news. Researchers suspect that's because people with higher education or income tended to eat a greater variety of foods, as well as more whole grains, organic produce, and fish, which can be expensive, per ctv news. They also prepared vegetables in healthier ways. Together, this means they benefited from a \" more adequate intake of essential nutrients, \" says study author giovanni de gaetano.

Abc news reports mars will be within 46.8 million miles of earth at 5: 34pm eastern time on monday. At that time, it will take light just 4 minutes and 11 seconds to travel between the planets, according to space.com. The proximity is due to mars and earth aligning in their orbits, something that happens every 26 months. How close they are when they line up varies due to the elliptical shape of their orbits. Mars will be even closer in 2018. While you still won't be able to see any details of mars without a powerful telescope, monday will present a great opportunity to spot it with your naked eye. Just after it gets dark, look low on the horizon toward the east-southeast. Mars will appear as a bright \" fiery, yellow-orange'star. ' \"",

Byrd, a son of west virginia coal country who used his mastery of senate rules and a taste for hardball tactics to become a passionate and often feared advocate for the state and the senate he loved, died monday at age 92. The democrat's 51 years in the senate made him the longest serving senator in history, while his white mane, stentorian voice and flamboyant speeches citing roman emperors gave him the presence of a man from a grander, distant time. In many ways, byrd embodied the changes the nation has undergone in the past half century. A one-time segregationist and opponent of civil rights legislation, he evolved into a liberal hero as one of the earliest, unrepentant and most vocal foes of the iraq war and a supporter of the rights of gays to serve in the military. He was the acknowledged senate renaissance man, who could recite poetry by memory for hours and yet be ruthless in advancing his legislative agenda — which often involved corralling federal dollars for his perpetually struggling state. As the senate opened monday, byrd's desk was draped in black cloth with a bowl of white roses. Flags outside the white house and the capitol flew at half-staff.

A researcher who worked on the chagos islands in the indian ocean in 2016 says he witnessed a large coconut crab attack a sleeping seabird, which then became dinner. Mark laidre of dartmouth college says he first spotted a crab climbing a tree to a low branch where a red-footed booby, which normally weighs about 2 pounds, was napping in its nest. The crab broke the bird's wing, causing it to fall to the ground, then continued attacking it, breaking its other wing, reports new scientist. At that point, other crabs arrived for dinner, says laidre, who filmed part of the scene he described as \" pretty gruesome. \" it was the first time this hunting of a large, vertebrate animal had been observed among coconut crabs, which are the world's largest land-dwelling invertebrates, reaching up to 3 feet wide and weighing up to 9 pounds. The behavior might not seem surprising given the crabs'size — they're often the largest species in the coral atolls they call home, per the guardian — but newsweek explains they were previously thought only to be scavengers with a particular taste for, as their name suggests, coconuts. Though it's possible the seabird was a one-time meal, laidre — who says he's discovered that birds and coconut crabs rarely inhabit the same islands — suspects the crabs play a more dominant role in their ecosystem than previously known.",

They are renowned for their tree-climbing abilities and taste for coconuts, which they crack open with their powerful claws. They do sometimes eat meat, but until now it was thought that they only obtained it by opportunistic scavenging. Advertisement"

The person killed was a newspaper carrier who was driving to pick up papers for the morning delivery; her vehicle careened over an embankment after she was shot. Bristol herald-courier publisher jim maxwell confirmed 44-year-old jennifer rooney, who had been delivering papers since august, was killed in the overnight shooting. He called it a \" senseless act of violence \" that has stunned the small city on the virginia border.

The suspect and the four people who were injured were taken to the bristol regional medical center. Media reported that tbi agents were processing four separate crime scenes, and wjhl calls the shootings \" random. \" devine said police are working \" as aggressively, as quickly, and as carefully as possibly \" to gather evidence and determine what happened.",

That's the gist of molar mic, a communications device detailed in a new $ 10 million pentagon contract with a california company, defense one reports. Smithsonian magazine and cnet lay out how the sonitus technologies device works: with a transmitter that's worn around the neck and a tiny custom-fit microphone clipped to a user's upper back molars, the bluetooth-like system is able to sync up with a telephone, walkie-talkie, or other communications method, and the user will be able to take in communications through his or her jaw and skull bones. \" you can hear through your head as if you were hearing through your ear, \" says sonitus ceo peter hadrovic. He says it's akin to how you hear yourself when you chomp down on crunchy foods. The mic allows for discreet communications, and can also help individuals stay in communication with team members while in hazardous situations — while they're parachuting out of a plane, say. Prototypes of the device have already been tested in afghanistan deployments, as well as in rescue efforts in texas after last year's hurricane harvey, per a press release. A sonitus rep tells gizmodo it won't extend molar mic beyond military use until the pentagon contract is fulfilled, and there's no timeline yet for when that might be. The air force is set to be the first military branch to get a crack at the device, with other branches expected to follow. Sonitus says molar mic could have further application down the road for first responders, industrial workers, and security personnel.

Now, for the first time, marcel nadjari's words have been published in full. Historian pavel polian tells deutsche welle that nine buried documents were found at the concentration camp and he describes them as \" the most central documents of the holocaust. \" they were written by nadjari and four fellow members of the \" sonderkommando \" unit, which was tasked with moving bodies from the gas chamber to the crematorium. Nadjari's letter, found in 1980, was written in his native greek and mostly illegible. A year-long project using multispectral image analysis helped reveal all but about 10 % of the document. Gizmodo reports on the sonderkommando's unthinkable task: remove the teeth from the dead, shave their heads, and ultimately dispose of their ashes into rivers. \" we carried the corpses of these innocent women and children to the elevator, which brought them into the room with the ovens, and they put them in there the furnaces, where they were burnt without the use of fuel, because of the fat they have, \" he wrote. \" when you read what work i did, you will say, how could i... Burn his fellow believers, \" he wrote. \" many times i thought of coming in with them [ into the gas chambers ] to finish, but i have always kept my revenge: i wanted to live to avenge the death of papa and mama, and that of my beloved little sister, nelli. \" nadjari didn't get his revenge, but he did survive; he died in new york in 1971.

        "summary": "Newly discovered bits of \" foreign dna \" in modern africans indicate that a mysterious \" sister species \" may have walked the earth with neanderthals and humans, according to scientists. The dna doesn't resemble dna from any modern-day humans, nor from neanderthals, whose dna sometimes shows up in modern-day europeans. \" we're calling this a neanderthal sibling species in africa, \" said joshua akey of the university of washington. He believes human interbreeding occurred with the mystery species 20,000 to 50,000 years ago when neanderthals were waning in europe, and modern humans were beginning to spread out from africa, reports the washington post. A skull with unusual features found in nigeria could be a remnant from the vanished species, notes the post. Many scientists are not surprised that another species — and even others — existed and died out in the shadow of us. But others are skeptical, particularly because of the dearth of fossil and archaeological evidence. Stanford paleoanthropologist richard klein told the new york times that it's irresponsible for geneticists to publish findings on the origin of humans without trying to reconcile them with fossil and archeological evidence.",

There's only one way that genetic material could have made it into modern human populations. \"geneticists like euphemisms, but we're talking about sex, \" said joshua akey of the university of washington in seattle, whose lab identified the mystery dna in three groups of modern africans. These genetic leftovers do not resemble dna from any modern-day humans. The foreign dna also does not resemble neanderthal dna, which shows up in the dna of some modern-day europeans, akey said. That means the newly identified dna came from an unknown group. \"we're calling this a neanderthal sibling species in africa, \" akey said. He added that the interbreeding probably occurred 20,000 to 50,000 years ago, long after some modern humans had walked out of africa to colonize asia and europe, and around the same time neanderthals were waning in europe.

            "Among the dna sequences special to pygmies, dr. Tishkoff and colleagues found a variant of the usual gene that controls development of the pituitary gland, the source of the hormones that control reproduction and growth. This could be the cause of the pygmies'short stature and early age of reproduction, the researchers say. Photo the genomes of the pygmies and the hadza and sandawe click-speakers contained many short stretches of dna with highly unusual sequences. Through mutation, the genomes of species that once had a common ancestor grow increasingly unlike one another. Dr. Tishkoff's team interprets these divergent dna sequences as genetic remnants of an interbreeding with an archaic species of human. Genetic calculations suggest the interbreeding took place between 20,000 and 80,000 years ago. From calculations of the amount of divergence in the dna, the geneticists estimate that the archaic species split from the ancestors of modern humans about 1.2 million years ago, about the same time as did the ancestors of the neanderthals, who dominated europe during the end of the last ice age.

Shelley moore capito of west virginia, susan collins of maine, and lisa murkowski of alaska said tuesday they can't support the idea of scrapping the affordable care act unless the gop has a replacement plan, not just the promise of one, reports usa today. Trump's suggestion: the president says the gop strategy is clearer now: \" i think we're probably in that position where we ' ll just let obamacare fail, \" he told reporters tuesday, per politico. \" we're not gonna own it. I ' m not gonna own it. We ' ll let obamacare fail and then democrats are going to come to us. \" also opposed: eleven governors, including five republicans, also came out against the repeal-with-delay plan on tuesday, reports nbc news.

Now, \" it's still his job to implement the law he so despises. \" old lesson: an analysis at the new york times says the gop got a reminder of something: \" an american entitlement, once established, can almost never be retracted, \" writes jennifer steinhauer. Republican lawmakers opposed to obamacare in principle were loathe to take it away from constituents.

            "New york ( reuters health ) - if you're someone who lies in a tanning bed too much, you may be likely to suffer from addictive behavior often seen with substance abuse, as well as anxiety, according to a new study. Health catherine mosher and sharon danoff-burg, researchers at memorial sloan-kettering cancer center and the state university of new york, albany, respectively, asked 229 students at a large northeastern university about alcohol and substance abuse behaviors; all of the students reported using indoor tanning facilities in the previous year. Fifty of the study participants, or just under 22 percent, met the criteria for addiction on both of the two questionnaires. Those who met the criteria for addiction had in fact used tanning facilities more frequently in the previous year than those who weren't addicted. Those 50 participants also had very slightly higher levels of anxiety symptoms, as well as higher rates of alcohol and marijuana use. Mosher told reuters health by e-mail that the study was only able to note the connections between tanning and other factors like anxiety and substance use, and there is no way to tell if one of these behaviors actually leads to the other. \" from a public health perspective, the findings suggest that there may be a subgroup of individuals who are addicted to indoor tanning and have an underlying mood disturbance, \" mosher said. This is not the first study suggesting that tanning - whether outdoors or on tanning beds -- can be addicting. Others have found that as many as half young adults and beachgoers meet some criteria for a \" substance-related disorder \" when it comes to tanning. Previous research has also linked tanning and cigarette smoking. John overstreet, a spokesperson for the indoor tanning association, dismissed the idea that excessive tanning should be called an addiction. \" they're labeling this as an addiction to attract your attention, the media's attention, but whether it is useful science, i think the jury is very much out on it, \" he told reuters health.

Now both are facing excommunication from the church for apostasy, the new york times reports. They were notified of the move on consecutive days this week, so they suspect officials at the church's salt lake city headquarters are behind the decision ( though the church denies that ), but both received notice from local officials. The president of dehlin's stake, or church region, in utah asked him to resign or face a disciplinary hearing on wednesday, while kelly's local bishop in virginia told her she faces a disciplinary hearing on june 22. She had previously been warned by her stake president that she would face excommunication if she did not shut down her ordain women movement. Kelly founded the movement last year, and at its last demonstration, 500 demonstrators protested a male-only priesthood meeting carrying \" proxy cards \" representing 400 more supporters who couldn't be there. As for dehlin, he founded mormon stories, a website and series of podcasts that address controversial issues and \" hard questions \" some members face, he says; he's also published research into issues gay mormons face and has given a ted talk on being an \" ally \" to gay mormons. He calls what he's going through \" heart-wrenching \" in a message on his site.

The 55-year-old wandered off around 4pm saturday and never returned to grand island mansion, where the reception had been held. Family members and friends spread fliers over the past few days, while local police and the coast guard searched along the shore and the california highway patrol looked for clues from the air, all to no avail. On tuesday, the sacramento county sheriff's department called off the search, reports the sacramento bee. A sheriff's rep says there is no sign of \" suspicious circumstances or foul play \" and that family members indicated the native of india suffered from depression. Although prasad was considered to be missing of his own accord, \" all resources were utilized \" to look for him, per a sheriff's department statement, because of his possible mental health issues and the fact he wasn't familiar with the area. Durga says her dad — who she thinks possibly tripped or fell unconscious — doesn't have his passport or cash on him. The only sign of discontent she had noticed: his idleness since coming to the states about a month prior. \" he was a workaholic back in india and was managing several projects, \" she says, per the bee. \" he was bored. \" ( this father of the bride went missing after his tux fitting. )",

Or maybe the yakuza's decline has been exaggerated by officials ( organized crime is certainly alive in kyushu, where gang wars are still raging, the japan times reports ).

He was found on a street by a passerby and died shortly afterward in a hospital.

According to an employee of the fisheries cooperative, ueno was not the kind of person who could become the target of a grudge. He was in charge of negotiations on various matters with the city and the prefecture, the employee said. But ueno and his family have long been targets of violence. Gunshots were fired into the wall of his house in 1997, and the following year his elder brother was shot dead on a street. In 2007, both his daughter's house and his son's workplace were also targeted by gunfire.

            "New haven — a construction worker died saturday after falling into a smokestack at the yale university power plant on tower parkway, fire officials said. Assistant chief matthew marcarelli said the 53-year-old man was from oregon and was a longtime employee of the company doing the work at the plant. He said the department is not yet releasing the name of the man, but said his family had been notified. Firefighters faced a \" prolonged and very complicated technical rescue \" to get to the worker, who was in cardiac arrest when he was removed and later died at yale-new haven hospital, marcarelli said. He said firefighters began entering the chimney from the top, while others started working at an old access point at the bottom of the chimney. They ultimately reached the worker through the access point after cutting through a stainless steel liner that had been installed as part of the project at the power plant. Marcarelli said the rescue took about 30 minutes. The fire department and yale said the university police and the federal occupational health and safety administration are investigating the incident and the cause of the fall."

A subsequent salmonella outbreak involving peanut corporation of america's products sickened more than 700 people and was linked to nine deaths. Parnell was convicted last year of 72 counts relating to the sale of tainted peanut products and faces a sentence of up to 803 years when he's sentenced today, reports the ap, which notes that the federal judge has the option of imposing a lesser sentence. Parnell's brother michael, who helped fake lab test results, is due to receive a lesser sentence, as is former plant manager mary wilkerson. Food safety violations usually result in misdemeanor charges, and parnell is the first person convicted of a federal felony in such a case, cnn notes. The potential life sentence is unprecedented, and parnell's lawyer says it is \" absurd. \" randy napier, who lost his 80-year-old mother to salmonella poisoning linked to tainted peanut butter, disagrees. \" we need to send a message to these food manufacturers, \" the north carolina man tells the ap. \" no one else should have to go through what we did, watching my mother die.
