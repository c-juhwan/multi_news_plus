Dan johnson died in what the coroner says was a \" probable suicide \" after posting that the accusations were false and only god knows the truth, wdrb reports. Police, who were contacted after the message was posted, say johnson shot himself on a bridge in bullitt county, south of louisville. On monday, the kentucky center for investigative reporting published an investigation that included a 21-year-old woman's allegation that johnson, a married pastor, sexually assaulted her after a party in his church on new year's eve 2012, when she was 17. Johnson refused to step down tuesday despite calls for his resignation from both republican and democratic leaders, the louisville courier-journal reports. The 57-year-old said he had \" compassion \" for his accuser and was \" sorrowful that she's in this dark place in her life. \" in his facebook post, he said he loved god, his wife, his parents, and his five children, and spoke of having had ptsd since the 9/11 attacks. His loved ones should \" blame no person, satan is the accuser, so blame the devil himself, \" he wrote. Kentucky gov. Mark bevin tweeted his condolences to johnson's family. \" these are heavy days in frankfort and in america, \" he wrote. \" may god indeed shed his grace on us all... We sure need it. \"",

In a class-action lawsuit representing what the chicago tribune reports is tens of thousands of users, the illinois woman has marched her smart dildo to chicago to sue sex-toy company standard innovation. She accuses the company, which is based in ottawa, of consumer fraud, unjust enrichment, intrusion upon seclusion, and violating the federal wiretap act and the illinois eavesdropping statute — and she's asking for unspecified punitive damages, reports vocativ. The woman reportedly bought her we-vibe rave for $ 130 in may and proceeded to use it several times before learning via a defcon hacking convention talk ( which cnet reported on last month ) that her extremely personal usage was being scrutinized for marketing purposes by its maker, reports courthouse news.

        "summary": "No punches or chairs were thrown, but the democratic debate in brooklyn thursday night is being widely described as a battle, a brawl, and a slugfest. If they weren't before, hillary clinton and bernie sanders are now genuinely bitter rivals, according to commentators who are more or less evenly split on whether clinton or sanders won the debate, suggesting the pair managed to fight to a draw. Chris cillizza at the washington post calls it for clinton. She \" won on points \" and \" drove home — again and again — the idea that sanders talked a good game but couldn't back it up, \" he writes. Sanders was too sarcastic and dismissive to win over clinton supporters, according to cillizza, but \" if you came into this debate liking sanders, you left it loving him. \" clinton suffered a \" drubbing \" and turned in a \" cringeworthy \" performance, according to dylan matthews at vox, who notes that sanders was on offense all night and deployed his economic justice arguments very effectively. He \" didn't just accuse clinton of being weak on climate change: he accused her of being weak because she's in hock to billionaires and corporations, \" matthews writes. Thursday wasn't one of clinton's \" more impressive showings, \" according to niall stanage at the hill, who notes that she appeared to leave herself some \" wriggle room \" while trying to avoid being outflanked on the left by sanders on issues like a $ 15 minimum wage. Her \" tendency to take refuge in nuance — or, her detractors would say, to provide slippery answers — continues to be a problem, \" he writes. Clinton \" did slightly better in terms of her performance \" in a contest that had so much shouting and interrupting it resembled recent gop debates, writes julian zelizer at cnn. Sanders had good moments, including the raising of questions on clinton's foreign policy record, zelizer writes, but clinton scored with attacks on sanders ' gun control record and with her \" commitment and determination to fight for women's issues. \" click for some of the debate's best lines, including sanders'scathing take on clinton's paid wall street speeches.",

            "Why are we asking this now? the us government has been dragged into a bizarre legal battle between descendants of the apache leader geronimo and a secret society of yale students called skull and bones, whose members allegedly raided his grave during the first world war. Yesterday, the justice department asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed in february, on the 100th anniversary of geronimo's death, seeking to recover the legendary warrior's remains and re-bury them near to his birthplace in the gila wilderness of southern new mexico. The legal action, by 20 descendants of geronimo, claims a group of skull and bones members, including george w bush's grandfather, prescott, took his skull from fort sill in oklahoma in 1918. The artefact has allegedly been stored in a glass case at the organisation's clubhouse in new haven, connecticut ever since. The justice department became involved because barack obama and his defence secretary robert gates are named alongside the skull and bones society as co-defendants, due to the fact that geronimo was initially buried on public land. So who was geronimo? for much of his lifetime, geronimo was considered the greatest terrorist in america.

Her parents say they have evidence of how she was relentlessly bullied by four classmates for months even though they continued to ask the school to discipline those responsible.grossman's mother says the bullies still haven't been punished. \" we know that the poor behavior and poor decisions these kids make has not changed, \" dianne grossman said. \" they do not believe ultimately that they are responsible for it. \" mallory's parents are suing to change the way all schools confront bullies in class and on social",

The earthworks were likely used for public gatherings and rituals, researchers report in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. They've been hidden beneath a thick canopy of trees for about 2,000 years, but modern deforestation has made them easier to spot from above. The earthworks are surrounded by ditches and causeways in a way that history buffs will find familiar. \" the earliest phases at stonehenge consisted of a similarly laid-out enclosure, \" lead researcher jennifer watling, of the university of sao paulo, tells the telegraph. Researchers say the discovery adds another new wrinkle about the amazon, refuting the notion that it has been largely untouched by humans until modern times. \" the fact that these sites lay hidden for centuries beneath mature rainforest really challenges the idea that amazonian forests are ' pristine ecosystems, ' \" watling says in a news release. But scientists say the indigenous people of the time appeared to manage the land carefully, clearing small tracts of bamboo forest to create the earthworks and encouraging the growth of species they could use and trade, reports upi. Because few artifacts have been found at the sites, researchers think they were used only for special occasions. ( even earlier ditches may have predated the forest itself. )",

The iron-eating species, named halomonas titanicae, has 50,000 tons of iron to get through, but it may not take it long to do so: the titanic has been underwater 98 years, and one study coauthor tells our amazing planet she now fears it may only have 15 to 20 years left. \" it's deteriorating much faster \" than she previously thought, and \" eventually there will be nothing left but a rust stain, \" she says. \" what is fascinating to me is that we tend to have this idea that these wrecks are time capsules frozen in time, when in fact there [ are ] all kinds of complex ecosystems feeding off them, \" says a maritime historian. Researchers believe the bacteria help to create icicle-shaped rust, or \" rusticles, \" in which 27 different bacteria — including halomonas titanicae — live. The rusticles grow and eventually disintegrate, \" recycling the iron and returning it to nature, \" says the coauthor. The authors add that the possibility exists that the bacterium could also be harming offshore oil and gas pipelines, and say that studying it \" may also equip us to devise coatings that can prevent similar deterioration to other metal structures. \"",

            "The wreckage of the rms titanic may soon be lost, thanks to a newly discovered rust-eating bacteria. Researchers at dalhousie university in halifax, nova scotia, in canada have been examining the bacteria eating away at the remains of the famous ship as it sits on the ocean floor. Using dna technology, dalhousie scientists henrietta mann and bhavleen kaur and researchers from the university of sevilla in spain were able to identify a new bacterial species collected from rusticles ( a formation of rust similar to an icicle or stalactite ) from the titanic wreck. The iron-oxide-munching bacterium has fittingly been named halomonas titanicae. The bacteria have critical implications for the preservation of the ship's wreckage. \" in 1995, i was predicting that titanic had another 30 years, \" mann said. \" but i think it's deteriorating much faster than that now. Perhaps if we get another 15 to 20 years out of it, we're doing good... Eventually there will be nothing left but a rust stain. \" the wreck is covered with rusticles; the knob-like mounds have formed from at least 27 strains of bacteria, including halomonas titanicae. Rusticles are porous and allow water to pass through; they are rather delicate and will eventually disintegrate into fine powder. \" it's a natural process, recycling the iron and returning it to nature, \" mann said. For decades following the ship's sinking in 1912, the titanic's final resting spot remained a mystery. Discovered by a joint american-french expedition in 1985, the wreck is located a little more than 2 miles ( 3.8 kilometers ) below the ocean surface and some 329 miles ( 530 km ) southeast of newfoundland, canada. In the 25 years since the discovery of the wreck, the titanic has rapidly deteriorated. While the disintegration of the titanic makes preservation of the ship impossible, the bacteria doing the damage may be useful in accelerating the disposal of other old ships and oil rigs. Further, it could also help scientists develop paints or protective coatings to guard against the bacteria for working vessels. While the loss of the wreck over time concerns dan conlin, curator of maritime history at the maritime museum of the atlantic in halifax, he notes scientists know much more about the titanic than most shipwrecks. \" what is fascinating to me is that we tend to have this idea that these wrecks are time capsules frozen in time, when in fact there all kinds of complex ecosystems feeding off them, even at the bottom"

Pires and vilhena were specifically photoshopped to look like brazilian paralympians bruna alexandre and renato leite, cnn reports. According to mashable, both alexandre and leite were in the studio for the shoot and posed for a picture with the models. For her part, alexandre says she's fine with the photoshopped image, as it helps bring attention to the paralympics. The models, both of whom are paralympics ambassadors, also don't understand what the big deal is. \" as ambassador, we lend our images to give visibility [ to a cause ], and that's what we are doing, my god, \" the bbc quotes pires as saying.

This morning smiley fired back on good morning america, and now the longtime partners are embroiled in a war of words. Using investigators from a law firm, pbs said it found that smiley had engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships with subordinates and fostered an abusive work environment, charges the host denied again today. While smiley admitted he has engaged in workplace relationships, he claimed they were consensual and that he never gave his romantic partners preferential professional treatment, usa today reports. Smiley also denied sending lewd text messages and creating a hostile work environment, saying, \" i have an intense environment. … that's not for everyone, so it might be that the environment wasn't good for you. \" a pbs spokesperson responded by saying smiley \" needs to get his story straight, \" the los angeles times reports. \" mr. Smiley acknowledged he has had multiple sexual encounters with his employees then struggled to recall the number of current employees with whom he has had sex, \" the spokesperson said. In the meantime, smiley's show remains on indefinite suspension, a situation its host calls a \" huge mistake. \" \" they need to fix this, \" smiley said. \" they need to correct it. \"",

Wally pfister's directorial debut ( he's been christopher nolan's longtime cinematographer ) raises worthwhile questions about technology, identity, and good and evil, critics say — but they're not entirely won over: \" transcendence looks and sounds like a christopher nolan film that got attacked by malware, \" writes peter hartlaub in the san francisco chronicle. It's definitely not boring, but its \" narrative flaws and logical leaps sabotage sustained enjoyment. \" meanwhile, it paints scientists as \" oblivious dimwits who dive headlong into potential catastrophe with no safeguards. \" the movie \" explores its ideas with sincerity, curiosity, and terrifying beauty. This makes its failures all the more depressing, \" notes matt zoller seitz at rogerebert.com. \" too often... The movie doesn't feel ambiguous or complicated, merely muddled and wishy-washy. \" in the los angeles times, however, kenneth turan does see ambiguity: \" justice is done to the complicated factors at play here. Determining with certainty whom the heroes and villains of this narrative are is not so easily done. \" sure, it's not perfect, but it's \" an ambitious and provocative piece of work that is intriguingly balanced between being a warning and a celebration. \" in the new york times, manohla dargis sees \" modest pleasures \" in the movie. \" however predictable and ridiculous, the film raises the question of what — as the machines rise — makes us human and why, which certainly gives you more to chew on at the multiplex than is customary these days. \"",

It is understood the baby had been conceived before she flew to afghanistan to begin the six-month tour. The gunner was in her 34th week of pregnancy when she went into labour.

            "The woman, a gunner in the royal artillery, had complained of stomach pains before medics informed her she was in labour. She gave birth to a son five weeks premature in camp bastion on tuesday. Mother and baby are both said to be in a stable condition, with a specialist paediatric team from the john radcliffe hospital, oxford, preparing to travel to afghanistan to assist them on the flight home. The ministry of defence last night confirmed it was against military policy for servicewomen to be deployed on operations while pregnant and said they had been unaware the servicewoman was expecting. It is the first time a soldier from the uk has given birth while in afghanistan. The gunner, who has not been named, had been deployed with the 12th mechanised brigade since march and had not been aware she was carrying a child, according to the daily mail newspaper. It is understood the baby had been conceived before she flew to afghanistan to begin the six-month tour. The gunner was in her 34th week of pregnancy when she went into labour. The mother, reported to be originally from fiji, and baby are being cared for at the camp bastion field hospital until they are able to safely fly home to britain.

The site says it comes down to funding, and if the money is there, then yes, this could come to pass. But the verge notes the announcement follows one that came in february 2017, when spacex proclaimed it would send two people around the moon in its falcon heavy rocket by the end of 2018 — a vow that now doesn't appear to be coming to fruition. Meanwhile, in its original tweet, spacex promises more details on monday, including \" who's flying and why. \" one cryptic clue comes from musk himself, who responded shortly after the announcement to a tongue-in-cheek twitter query. \" elon, it's you, isn't it? \" asked gamer taylor harris, to which musk replied with an emoji of the japanese flag.

Enter a 42-year-old woman from the uk, who, since one long-ago day when she was 14, had a contact lens lodged under the lid of her left upper eyelid without even knowing it. Buzzfeed reports on the odd case described in bmj case reports, an event the journal describes as a \" 28-year trauma. \" cbs dallas-fort worth reports the woman had experienced a swollen and droopy eyelid for about six months, and when she finally went to get it checked out, an mri scan revealed a cyst just above her left eye. Doctors went in to remove the cyst, and what was inside it puzzled them: there was a rigid gas permeable ( rgp ) contact lens embedded, a type of hard contact lens that predates the softer ones most people use today. As everyone scratched their heads as to why she would have this type of lens in her eye, her mother remembered that when her daughter was 14, she'd been slammed in the eye by a badminton birdie while wearing her contacts and suffered minor injuries that fully healed. They all just figured her lost contact had popped out and dropped to the ground when the birdie hit her face, and cnn notes she never wore rgp contacts again. Since the lens has been removed, the woman's more recent eye problems have dissipated. ( this woman had 27 contact lenses stuck in one eye. )",

In 2013, the facility performed the first successful surgery to remove a fetal heart tumor, reports the philadelphia inquirer. And now doctors there have done it again. They managed the feat in october on baby juan in a delicate operation more complicated than the first. Doctors placed the mother, cecilia cella, under general anesthesia, then made an incision in her uterus to drain the amniotic fluid, further anesthetized the fetus, and carefully lifted his tiny arms out of the uterus to bring his chest up to make an incision, cut the ribs, and remove the tumor, per live science. While they couldn't cut out the last 2 % of the tumor for fear of hurting the heart, it bought him time and juan survived. The rest of the still-growing tumor was removed a few weeks after his birth at 31 weeks. He's almost four months old now and thriving. \" we've only been able to watch these tumors grow and inform the mother that the fetus probably would not be able to survive, \" one surgeon says. Now, \" a different result is possible. \" the family returned to uruguay in march. \" it was a hard time, crazy time, but we are extremely happy how everything was solved, \" says dad pablo paladino, per cbs news.

But when he and bianchi pressed restaurant owners on where they could find it, most told them the \" big garlic \" was \" extinct. \" ( according to the slow food foundation, there are fewer than 10 aglione producers, all based in tuscany's chiana valley. ) the partners managed to track down some seeds, however, and started growing their product on a 5-acre plot of land bianchi owns in le marche. What makes their garlic more palatable to the nose, mouth, and stomach: the lack of the chemical compound allicin, which is produced when garlic is chopped or crushed, food and wine notes. The two also say their garlic is organic and that most of their garlic-tending labor is taken care of by … ducks: the birds chow down on weeds ( but not the garlic plants themselves ) and fertilize the soil with their droppings.

An unlikely roman duo, a construction engineer and a commercial lawyer, have spent the past three years cultivating a special giant variety of garlic that used to be prevalent in tuscany but has not been produced in large quantities for 40 years.

This giant garlic has a particular aroma and contains no allicin ( a particular chemical compound ) or its derivatives. This garlic is an almost ivory shade of white, nearly spherical in shape and is slightly flat at the extremities.

Jarrod clowery, who suffered burns and multiple shrapnel wounds, said on necn television, a local cable channel, that he thought mr. Tsarnaev was trying to get killed during the shootout with police in watertown and expressed doubts about whether the death penalty would be the right punishment. \"why give him what he wants? \" mr. Clowery asked. After the verdict, the boston globe ran an editorial urging that mr. Tsarnaev be spared the death penalty. The jury is already \"death qualified \": that is, only those who said they were open to applying the death penalty were allowed to serve, while those who flatly opposed it were excluded. Many of those who were chosen said they were open to the argument either way. The question now is the degree to which a jury that so thoroughly embraced the government's case might be inclined to accept the argument that mr. Tsarnaev's crimes were so heinous that he deserved to die. A poll of boston voters taken in the midst of the trial, when witnesses were giving the most heart-wrenching testimony, found that 62 percent of bostonians said they would sentence mr.

It says he is a close associate of zachary chesser, the muslim convert serving 12 years for threatening the creators of south park. The suspect's younger brother, gulet mohamed, has been fighting his placement on the us no-fly list for years and the brother's lawyer says the family believes liban fled to avoid harassment he suffered from the fbi over the case.

Advancing what the country's pm has deemed \" the most misunderstood bill in denmark's history, \" danish lawmakers voted 81-27 tuesday to pass the bill, allowing authorities to confiscate assets from asylum seekers to help pay for housing and other expenses, cnn reports. The value of assets migrants can keep was amended from about $ 440 to the $ 1,500 mark, per the ap, but anything from money, jewelry, and watches to mobile phones, and computers can be seized, per the danish immigration ministry ( a rep who spoke to the independent somewhat contradicted that, saying \" assets … necessary to maintain a modest standard of living, \" such as watches and phones, could be kept ). Exempt are \" sentimental \" items such as wedding rings and medals. Those for the law say it holds migrants to the same standard as citizens, who must sell assets over $ 1,500 before they can collect social benefits, the ap notes. In exchange for this \" payment, \" refugees get the same access to universal health care, education, and other benefits as citizens, a liberal party rep told cnn earlier this month. ( the rep added, \" we are not going to take the jewelry away from people. … [ that ] is outrageous. \" ) the ap notes some german states and switzerland have similar laws. But human rights groups are decrying the measure, with amnesty international saying it's the latest step in a \" dismal race to the bottom \" of dealing with the migrant crisis. \" to prolong the suffering of vulnerable people who have been ripped apart from their families by conflict or persecution is plain wrong, \" a rep says, per cnn. \" today's mean-spirited vote … seeks not only to pilfer the possessions refugees cling to. \" the new law also boosts the waiting period for refugees to apply to bring family over from one year to three, per the independent.",

A year after the grizzly population near yellowstone national park was removed from federal protection — with numbers estimated at 700, up from 136 in 1975, per national geographic — the wyoming fish and game commission voted unanimously wednesday to allow hunters to shoot up to 22 grizzlies on public and private lands east of the park. Officials say the carefully planned trophy hunt won't hurt the species'recovery. But critics point out grizzlies are some of the slowest terrestrial mammals to reproduce, with females birthing offspring once every three years, and stress 56 bears died in 2017 as a result of poaching, vehicle collisions, and other issues. \" you can't kill that many bears through hunting, on top of the number already dying through a variety of causes, and not have a negative impact on the bear population, \" one critic tells natgeo. Others say climate change puts the grizzly food supply at risk. Critics also say the sale of bear licenses is unlikely to help wyoming's budget crisis. An out-of-state hunter must pay $ 6,000, but wyoming residents will pay $ 600. Several lawsuits, including some from tribal groups who view the grizzly as sacred, are seeking to restore federal protection of the animal, thus ending hunts. Should they fail, there's talk of mass protests. Idaho is only allowing one male grizzly to be killed this year, while montana is skipping a hunt, \" citing pending lawsuits and a wish to move cautiously as the species nears recovery, \" per the missoulian.

Seismic strain builds up at certain points where the plates touch and this is abruptly released when they jump position. Port-au-prince, the capital of haiti, has twice been destroyed, in 1751 and 1770.

The los angeles times reports that eight people have died along the river nicknamed the \" killer kern \" since march, though one of those fatalities was a heart attack. At least two others remain missing. One of those pulled from the river saturday has been identified as michael ramirez, a 27-year-old orange county rapper who disappeared while swimming on june 22. Also saturday, a 22-year-old los angeles man drowned after being warned about the dangers. Bureau of land management and forest service officials say they warned him and his cousins about jumping from rocks into the river that morning, bakersfield.com reports. The warning apparently went unheeded, however, and he was dragged into the main current and underneath the surface. His body was found by a nearby campground. Authorities say the rise in drownings on the 165-mile river is likely due to visitors being unused to such high waters and fast currents, the times reports. Last winter was one of the wettest on record and followed five years of drought. Snow melting on the sierra nevada has caused the kern to swell with cold, fast-moving water. In 2011, the last big-water year in california, three people drowned in the kern on the fourth of july, and authorities are warning people to keep away this year.",

A new study suggests that exercise keeps you from chowing down on more than your body needs after a tough mental task. Previous research has shown that people eat more after such tasks, like tests or grant deadlines, say university of alabama scientists in a release. ( this phenomenon might explain the \" freshman 15, \" notes the new york times. ) the problem is that mental activity uses energy, and our brain, wanting that energy replenished, tells us we're hungry. Hence, the food binge. The researchers, however, found that people who were asked to perform tests ate less pizza afterward if they exercised for 15 minutes in the interim. Why? scientists aren't entirely sure, but they suspect it has to do with a spike in lactate levels in the blood triggered by the exercise. The theory is that the brain uses the lactate as fuel and gets sated that way, limiting the urge to overeat. \" lactate may have replenished the brain's energy needs, \" says researcher gary hunter, adding that more research is needed to figure out the interplay of both lactate and blood sugar in eating behavior. All told, the group that exercised added 200 fewer calories than those who simply rested, a figure that accounts for the calories expended during exercise, according to the study published in the journal medical &amp; science in science &amp; exercise.

A man had been thrown from his truck when it crashed, witnesses say, and jessica smith was just one of many who came across the wrecked pickup on interstate 385. \" she was the one [ who ] wanted me to pull over to see if [ the driver ] was ok, \" smith's cousin, who was with her as they drove by the scene around 1: 45am, tells wspa. When smith, a certified nursing assistant, didn't find anyone in the truck, she leaned over the bridge over highway 276 and yelled down, fox carolina reports. Witnesses say she heard yelling back and flung both legs over the bridge, apparently thinking the ground wasn't far below; she fell 23 feet to her death, per the greenville county coroner. Hope smith says she ' ll take in jessica smith's 9-year-old son, isaiah, who she says was the light of her sister's life. \" she would go to the ends of the earth to do for him and that was her biggest fear … not being around for him, \" hope smith tells fox, noting that jessica had posted a facebook status the day before her death worrying she might not always be there for isaiah. The truck driver, meanwhile, survived his own fall, though there's no official word on his condition, per wyff. ( a good samaritan in arizona died trying to protect a woman from a purse-snatcher. )",

Nurse kaci hickox, who was put in mandatory quarantine in a newark, nj, hospital after returning from treating ebola patients in sierra leone, has filed a $ 250,000 lawsuit against the new jersey governor and state health officials for violating her civil rights, nj.com reports. \" i never had ebola. I never had symptoms of ebola. I tested negative for ebola the first night i stayed in new jersey governor chris christie's private prison, \" she said in a statement released by the aclu. The lawsuit reveals for the first time that the cdc cleared hickox before she left the airport, nj.com notes. \" my liberty, my interests, and consequently my civil rights were ignored because some ambitious governors saw an opportunity to use an age-old political tactic: fear, \" hickox said. The other governor she's referring to is new york gov. Andrew cuomo, who, like christie, backed down from a hard-line quarantine policy within days, new york notes. Hickox's lawyers say christie is being sued as an individual, which they hope will dissuade other officials from violating the civil rights of health workers, especially when there's no valid scientific reason to do so, nj.com reports. After she was released from quarantine in new jersey, hickox successfully fought quarantine in maine and now works in oregon. ( a new test can detect every human — and animal — virus there is. )",

        "summary": "Cogs in the wheel toiling away in an office have probably dreamed of working from home in pajamas. But a new study out of stanford university suggests telecommuting may not be all it's cracked up to be, leading business insider to assert that \" traditional workspaces will never disappear. \" the study followed 249 call-center workers for a chinese travel agency in a nine-month experiment, with half working full time in the office and the other half working remotely four days a week, and afifth day in the office. Home workers ' productivity rose 13 % during the study, and ctrip decided to offer telecommuting as an option. Interestingly, half of those who worked remotely chose to go back to the office — some because they hadn't produced well at home, but others because they simply missed interacting with colleagues. A 2012 census bureau report shows telecommuting numbers skyrocketed between 1980 and 2010; global workplace analytics notes telework grew 80 % from 2005 to 2012. But gwa also points out just 2.6 % of the us workforce was made up of remote workers as of 2013. Half of ctrip's remote workers said they wanted to go back to the office due to lack of social interaction, as well as distractions like tv. A similar scenario played out at nyc's timehop last winter when the ceo closed the offices for two weeks and made all employees work remotely, as per forbes. Although workers were better able to concentrate, they also felt lonely and had a hard time toeing the work-life line. \" since i ' m already home, i can't justify getting up from my laptop and relaxing.... I ' m working from home, so when i ' m home, i should be working, \" one worker said. ( here's another person who says no to telecommuting. )",

Mikhail lesin, the founder of russian state-run media rt and a former senior adviser to vladimir putin, was found dead in 2015 in his hotel room in washington dc. More than a year after his death, a federal prosecutor ruled lesin — who had multiple blunt-force injuries to his head, neck, and torso — died due to getting drunk and falling down multiple times. Now, two fbi agents and a us intelligence officer say that's not the case. \"lesin was beaten to death, \" says one fbi agent, who adds the us government appears to want that fact covered up. At the time of his death, lesin was staying in a hotel room paid for by the justice department, according to buzzfeed's sources. He died the night before he was scheduled to meet with the department to discuss the workings of the russian propaganda machine. One agent says the consensus in the fbi is that lesin was assassinated on the orders of the kremlin or putin himself. \"whether it was over rt, money, pissing off putin, or a combo, or all of it, i don't know, \" one fbi agent says. \"but falling down drunk? come on. That's bullshit. \" buzzfeed is suing to get the fbi's investigative file on the case. And they're not alone.

        "summary": "A new study — conveniently timed around halloween — points to a tasty way to improve our memories. For three months, study subjects ages 50 to 69 consumed a drink full of cocoa flavanols, which are antioxidants. On a memory test, the subjects scored about 25 % higher than did another group whose drink was lower in flavanols. The test looked at the kind of memory linked to remembering where you parked your car or what your new friend looks like, the new york times reports. Those drinking the high-flavanol mixture showed scores comparable to people several decades younger; an average 60-year-old in the study, for instance, demonstrated memory on par with a 30- or 40-year-old, scientific american reports. What's more, they showed increased activity in a part of the brain associated with such remembering. \" they got this really remarkable increase in a place in the brain that we know is related to age-related memory change, \" says an outside expert. What they didn't show, however, was a boost in activity in a part of the brain that's damaged in the early stages of alzheimer's disease — so chocolate may not offer protection against that disorder. And unfortunately, snickers bars aren't going to do much for your memory: you'd need to eat some seven bars of dark chocolate per day to get the levels of the epicatechin flavanol that study subjects were getting ( 900mg per day in the higher-flavanol group, science daily reports ). One more note: the study was partially funded by candy giant mars, though a scientist says it wasn't biased.",

Email print scott small, a professor of neurology at columbia university's college of physicians and surgeons, researches alzheimer's, but he also studies the memory loss that occurs during the normal aging process. Research on the commonplace \"senior moments \" focuses on the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with formation of new memories. In particular, one area of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, which helps distinguish one object from another, has lured researchers on age-related memory problems. In a study by small and colleagues published oct. 26 in nature neuroscience, naturally occurring chemicals in cocoa increased dentate gyrus blood flow. Psychological testing showed that the pattern recognition abilities of a typical 60-year-old on a high dose of the cocoa phytochemicals in the 37-person study matched those of a 30-or 40-year old after three months. The study received support from the food company mars, but small cautions against going out to gorge on snickers bars, as most of the beneficial chemicals, or flavanols, are removed when processing cocoa.

        "summary": "Thom tillis may be doing more baby-kissing and less hand-shaking after he recently expounded on whether restaurant workers should have to wash their hands after using the bathroom and before they go back to handle food. The freshman senator made his stance known at yesterday's bipartisan policy center event in dc, where he relayed a tale about a conversation he had in 2010 with a north carolina constituent, according to roll call. As they sat in a starbucks chatting about businesses opting out of certain government regulations, tillis said the woman asked him what his thoughts were about mandating eatery workers lather up after a bathroom break, msnbc reports. Tillis'reply? it's ok if they don't, \" as long as [ the restaurant posts ] a sign that says ' we don't require our employees to wash their hands after leaving the restroom, ' \" he said, as per talking points memo. The senator's rationale is that patrons will stay away on their own from restaurants whose employees don't feel like following simple hygiene. \" the market will take care of that, \" he said he explained to his constituent. His speech echoed right-leaning arguments that mandatory government regulations such as these create a \" nanny state, \" as joy wang writes for msnbc. Wang also points out, though, that there would still be the \" unsuspecting or poorly informed few who might … come away with a bonus order of food poisoning thanks to unsanitary practices. \" at the chicago sun-times, chad merda notes an ehs-net study cited by the cdc that found that \" 12 % of food workers said they had worked when they were sick with vomiting or diarrhea. \" bpc president jason grumet got a few laughs at the end of the q&a by telling tillis, \" i ' m not sure if i ' m going to shake your hand, \" per msnbc.",

After noticing how often diners appeared more engaged in their phones than in their company at hearth, canora began placing pretty vintage boxes and old tobacco tins on tables to encourage people to put their phones away. Each box, decorated with the words \" open me, \" includes a note inviting diners to \" unplug \" and \" connect with your fellow diners \" by hiding phones in the box, reports eater. The james beard award-winning chef says about 60 % of diners have obliged — and the change in atmosphere is \" remarkable. \" not only does the box become a topic of conversation, but the removal of phones from the dinner table allows guests to better connect with each other — something that is far more important to canora than having photos of his food spread around instagram, the chef says. \" if you don't want to do it, don't, \" says canora. But \" if there's one time in the 24 hours in your day that's a time to engage with the person you're with, it makes sense to me that it's around the dinner table. \" overall, he says, \" i think people are digging it. \" other restaurants are trying out similar strategies, though not all are as lenient as hearth.

That's because the owner hean-noël fluery has imposed some rather strict rules on diners. Fleury has decided to ban clients from using mobile phones at the table. He says it's all in the name of conviviality and fun. The owner has decided to use a football-style card system whereby waiters will blow a whistle and show a yellow card to someone caught using their phone. If they are caught again then it will be red, meaning the culprit will be asked to leave the restaurant. The restaurant owner told the local that staff have been forced to \" send off \" a few diners. \" some have refused to put down their phones and said they don't like the rule and have left, \" he said. \" i don't mind, i'd rather people like that eat in another restaurant - there are three in the village. \" if they are in a bad mood or grumpy they should go"

        "summary": "Archaeologists have found new evidence that pretty much proves humans were in the americas as early as 15,500 years ago — around 1,500 years earlier than previously believed. Researchers have long believed that the first north americans, referred to as the \"clovis \" people, crossed the bering strait to reach north america during the last ice age 13,000 years ago. Now, they may need to rethink how people got here, the new york times reports. In a report published today in science, the scientists reveal they've found more than 50 well-formed artifacts in central texas that drastically predate the clovis culture. \"this is the oldest credible archaeological site in north america, \" says the team leader. When these artifacts were discovered, glaciers would have rendered many of the interior corridors early people were believed to have migrated along impassible; instead, some theorize, they must have traveled along the coast, either on the shore or on boats hewing close to it.",

            "\"this is the oldest credible archaeological site in north america, \" michael r. Waters, leader of the discovery team, said at a news teleconference. Dr. Waters, director of the center for the study of the first americans at texas a&m university, and his colleagues concluded in the journal article that their research over the last six years \"confirms the emerging view that people occupied the americas before clovis and provides a large artifact assemblage to explore clovis origins. \" if the migrations began at earlier, pre-clovis times, moreover, extensive glaciers probably closed off ice-free interior corridors for travel to the warmer south. Archaeologists said this lent credence to a fairly new idea in the speculative mix: perhaps the people came to the then really new new world by a coastal route, trooping along the shore and sometimes hugging land in small boats. This might account for the relatively swift movement of the migrants all the way to peru and chile. The first of the distinctive clovis projectile points represented advanced skills in stone technology. About a third of the way up from the base of the point, the artisans chipped out shallow grooves, called flutes, on both faces. The bifacial grooves probably permitted the points to be fastened to a wooden spear or dart. Other archaeologists pointed out that the buttermilk creek dates, more than 2,000 years earlier than the clovis chronology, are not significantly older than those for other sites challenging the clovis-first hypothesis. In recent years, early human occupation sites have been examined coast to coast: from oregon to wisconsin to western pennsylvania and from maryland and virginia down to south carolina and florida. James m. Adovasio, an archaeologist who found what appears to be pre-clovis material at the pennsylvania site known as meadowcroft rockshelter, was not involved in the buttermilk creek excavations but has visited the site and inspected many of the artifacts. These pre-clovis projectile points were also bifacial but not as large and well turned as the later technology. The most striking difference was the absence of the characteristic fluting.

The debra l. Friedkin site, texas, contains an assemblage of 15,528 artifacts that define the buttermilk creek complex, which stratigraphically underlies a clovis assemblage and dates between ~13.2 and 15.5 thousand years ago.

Baxter said that by allowing women to miss work during their periods, the company may be more productive. \" there is a misconception that taking time off makes a business unproductive - actually it is about synchronizing work with the natural cycles of the body, \" she told the mirror. \"immediately after a period is a time when women are actually three times as productive as usual. \" the idea of a \"period policy \" isn't new — menstrual leave began in japan in 1947 and other countries, including south korea, taiwan and indonesia, have laws in place, the mirror reported. Nike is thought to be the only worldwide company to officially include menstrual leave as part of their code of conduct. The idea has been enthusiastically received by all employees, bex noted. \" for too long there's been a taboo surrounding periods - i have women staff telling me their ashamed to admit they're in pain, \" she said"

        "summary": "The coming of the spanish conquistadors changed peru's shape forever — literally, according to researchers who say sand ridges stopped forming along the northern coast after the incas were forced out of the area or killed by disease after francisco pizarro's 1532 arrival. Phys.org explains that radiocarbon dating shows fire pits on the area's coastal ridges date back 5,000 to 400 years and were used to cook mollusks, whose discarded shells were left behind. With a dearth of vegetation to anchor the sand in place, these millions of shells, researchers daniel belknap and daniel sandweiss say, held the sand ridges in place against the wind. And a fierce wind it was, with an archaeologist who previously studied the site telling science that \" if you are there at two in the afternoon, you get these 40-kilometer winds blowing there, and your eyeglasses are scoured. \" the university of maine, orono, researchers began mapping the ridges, some as tall as 23 feet, in 1997, and determined they also owed their genesis to earthquakes, which released sand down the chira river and to an inlet, where shore currents took the sand northwest along the coast. There, the shells did the rest; but as the incas vanished from the area, so too did some of the later-formed ridges. \" the last 500 meters of the coast is low and hummocky, not like the discrete ridges before, \" belknap says, with the two writing in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that \" culture contact can lead to unexpected consequences. \"",

The first ame church in the south was founded in 1816, and historian edward ball tells the new york times that it remains hugely important to black southerners. \" this church is much more than a place where people sing gospel, \" he says. \" it's tethered to the deep unconscious of the black community. \" in its early days, the church's ministers faced arrest for violating laws on black people gathering without white supervision, cnn reports, and it was burned in 1822 after one of its founders, denmark vesey, plotted a slave revolt. Members were forced underground for decades when all-black churches were outlawed, the church's history page says. It adopted the name emanuel after the civil war, and it had to rebuild once again when the church building was destroyed by an earthquake in 1886. In the 1960s, it was a center of the civil rights movement, hosting leaders such as martin luther king jr. President obama, who knew murdered pastor clementa pinckney, paid tribute to the church's history in an address yesterday, the post and courier reports. \" mother emanuel church and its congregation have risen before — from flames, from an earthquake, from other dark times — to give hope to generations of charlestonians, \" he said.",

They threw the remains, as well as most of the shark, back in the water, keeping only the animal's head and fins. \" we feared that the human remains may bring bad luck to us, \" the fisherman says. The group left the shark's jaw in the sun to dry the next day, prompting concern from one of their wives: \" i don't want the sight of that jaw, knowing that the shark had eaten a human being. Who knows, the victim's spirit might visit us, \" she says. The jaw had a diameter of 17 inches, leading one outside expert to suggest it could have been far bigger than the fishermen guessed: he figures it could have weighed more like 1,300 pounds, the inquisitr reports.

        "summary": "Cave bears, the close cousin of the brown bear, roamed vast swaths of present-day russia across to the united kingdom and down to spain for hundreds of thousands of years until they went extinct 25,000 years ago. A large beast at roughly 12 feet long and 5 feet tall at the shoulder, the cave bear — so named because they hibernated in caves, though they didn't live in them — left behind a trove of bones and teeth for scientists to study, so one group decided to investigate their teeth for clues to their mysterious extinction, reports phys.org. What they learned is that the bears, unlike their omnivorous relatives today, were \" strict \" vegans, eschewing fish, small mammals, and insects, they report in the journal of quaternary science. \" similar to today's giant panda, the cave bears were therefore extremely inflexible in regard to their food, \" one researcher writes. \" we assume that this unbalanced diet, in combination with the reduced supply of plants during the last ice age, ultimately led to the cave bear's extinction. \" of course, this is just an assumption, and the scientists say they're now working on studying more teeth and bones to learn more. So far the team has been able to use a portable scanner popular with dentists to create 3d scans of molars from the lower jaws of cave bears and other bears that today roam the northern hemisphere, such as black asiatic and polar bears, reports science magazine. The team also notes a head-scratcher: two cave bear cubs had collagen suggestive of a vegan diet, though they were nursing. ( this man survived being pulled into a cave by a bear. )",

The christian science monitor reports new sonar imaging shows the \" mount everest of shipwrecks \" is far more deteriorated than anyone knew. \" it looks so dramatically different, \" stockton rush tells the ap. Rush's company, oceangate, spent two days taking sonar images of the famous shipwreck. Those images were presented during a press conference monday, reports the boston globe. Most noticeably, it appears a large chunk of the andrea doria's bow broke off sometime in the past two years. \" imagine it as a collapsing cave, \" rush says. \" once the cave loses its basic structure, it deteriorates very quickly. \" oceangate planned to spend a week taking images of the shipwreck, but serious fog, winds, and waves forced the company to pack it in early. It plans to return next year to continue the work and hopes to create a \" virtual model \" of the andrea doria wreckage to help divers navigate the ship as it continues to deteriorate. Oceangate says such a model could save lives. Countless divers have risked death taking the 240-foot dive in freezing, fast-moving waters to explore the shipwreck, leading to the \" mount everest \" nickname. Nearly 1,700 people were aboard the andrea doria, which was coming from italy, when it collided with another boat and sank in 1956. Forty-six doria passengers were killed.

Pacific daylight time, august 21, 2014 the severe drought gripping the western united states in recent years is changing the landscape well beyond localized effects of water restrictions and browning lawns. Scientists at scripps institution of oceanography at uc san diego have now discovered that the growing, broad-scale loss of water is causing the entire western u.s. To rise up like an uncoiled spring. Investigating ground positioning data from gps stations throughout the west, scripps researchers adrian borsa, duncan agnew, and dan cayan found that the water shortage is causing an \"uplift \" effect up to 15 millimeters ( more than half an inch ) in california's mountains and on average four millimeters ( 0.15 of an inch ) across the west. From the gps data, they estimate the water deficit at nearly 240 gigatons ( 63 trillion gallons of water ), equivalent to a four-inch layer of water spread out over the entire western u.s. Results of the study, which was supported by the u.s. Geological survey ( usgs ), appear in the august 21 online edition of the journal science.

            ".................................................................................................................................................................................... Copyright © 2014 albuquerque journal the current, severe drought has not only gripped new mexico and the western united states for several years, it has also lifted up the land itself, positioning buildings, streets and mountains in albuquerque about 0.15 of an inch higher than a decade ago. That news comes from the scripps institution of oceanography at the university of california, san diego, in a study published thursday in the online edition of the journal science. \"it probably doesn't change life for people in albuquerque or the southwest, but it's significant that so much water is being moved around that it can cause the land to move up or down, \" said a local scientist, university of new mexico geophysicist brandon schmandt. \"this is an amazing measurement, one that we haven't had access to before. \" the effect of the drought, which scripps describes as a \"growing, broad-scale loss of water … causing the entire western u.s. To rise up like an uncoiled spring, \" is even more pronounced in the mountains of california, where the \"uplift effect \" is more than half an inch.
