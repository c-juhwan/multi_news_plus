Declaring tebow his \" personal quarterback and savior, \" jeff neuman at realclearsports catalogs five miracles made in last night's game. \" zero points on his team's first 11 possessions — and then three scores on their last three, aided by a coach's weird strategy, thin air, a fumble, and a total brain cramp by a veteran running back. Truly, tim tebow works in mysterious ways. \" writing for the montreal gazette, ed willes also drops the m-word, wondering if \" we've ever seen a run like this in the last 50 years of sports: an athlete who's at once both divisive and irresistibly charismatic; an athlete who's in the miracle business every week; an athlete who transcends everything around him. \" he's certainly divisive, agrees todd stames at fox news, blaming \" anti-christian bigots \" for their disdain of the quarterback. Why, stames asks, do his detractors get away with ridiculing his on-field prayer, aka \" tebowing \"? he's america's \" athlete of the moment, \" noted a less agog mark maske in advance of yesterday's game in the washington post, inspiring jerseys labeled \" jesus \" even if \" he hasn't mastered the most basic skill of his position — throwing a football accurately to another player — to the satisfaction of many nfl experts. \" click to read the most entertaining tweet about tebow's prowess, penned by a star of the office.",

        "summary": "Springfield, mo., has been shaken by the murder of a young girl who was kidnapped in broad daylight while walking just a block from her home. A couple who were in their garage at the time say a man in a pickup truck pulled up next to 10-year-old hailey owens and asked for directions. She turned to walk away but he called her over and when she took a couple of steps closer, he \" lunged out of the vehicle, grabbed the girl with his left hand and threw her into the truck like a rag doll, \" they say. The couple gave police the truck's license number, while other witnesses gave chase on foot and one tried to follow in a car but lost the truck, the kansas city star reports. As the community rallied on social media in an effort to find the truck, the license number led police to the home of craig michael wood, a coach at a local middle school. When they arrived, he was walking out of his truck with a roll of duct tape. They found the girl's body in a storage tote in a basement that smelled strongly of bleach, court documents state. She had been shot in the back of the head and there is evidence her wrists had been tied. The prosecutor — a father of two girls around the same age — fought back tears as he praised the \" remarkable response \" of citizens and police and said he didn't think anything could have been done differently, reports the news-leader. Wood is being held without bail on charges including first-degree murder and could face the death penalty.",

Exhibition curator martin clayton said: \" like anyone about to undertake a journey, leonardo is making a list of things to take with him - though alongside everyday items such as shirts, stockings and a towel, he lists his anatomical tools such as forceps, a scalpel and a bone-saw. \" soon afterwards we know that he was dissecting corpses in the medical school of the university of pavia, to the south of milan, and so this packing list may have been drawn up before a journey to pavia. \" this page is fascinating - leonardo often covered the pages of his notebooks with observations about anatomy, but this page gives a really personal insight into leonardo himself. \" the papers were probably",
            "Spectacles, a towel and shoelaces might seem unremarkable items to add to any packing list before embarking on a journey, even in the 16th century. Few, except perhaps the renaissance artist and anatomist leonardo da vinci, would also include \" a pane of glass, forceps and a fine-tooth bone saw \". The extraordinary \" to-do \" list, written around 1510 in his distinctive mirror-writing, is taken from a page of his notebooks never before seen in public, and which gives rare insight into leonardo, the man, as well as his thoughts on what it takes to be an anatomist. The page is a densely packed miscellany of notes that cover the entire surface. It is thought he wrote it just before travelling to pavia, south of milan, to dissect corpses. The \" to-do \" list, translated, reads: \" on the utilities. Spectacles with case, firestick, fork, bistoury [ a surgical knife ], charcoal, boards, sheets of paper, chalk, white wax, forceps, pane of glass, fine-tooth bone saw, scalpel, inkhorn, penknife. \" get hold of a skull.

        "summary": "\" churches are burning again in the united states, and the symbolism of that is powerful. \" so writes emma green at the atlantic after at least five mostly black churches went up in flames over the past week following the charleston church massacre. Investigators say the blaze that badly burnt god's power church of christ in macon, ga., was not caused by likely problems such as electrical malfunction, and wbtv reports that a fire at briar creek road baptist church in charlotte, nc, has already been ruled arson. The pastor there, mannix kinsey, says he forgives the arsonist and hopes it won't be deemed a hate crime: \" just the climate, \" he says. \" we all have to consider what else... We need to do to actually be able to work together. \" among other church fires, mostly in southern states, local and federal officers are looking blazes in warrenville, south carolina, and knoxville, tenn. Green notes that arson cases increased at black american churches in the mid-to-late 20th century, but reporting standards today make it harder to track more recent church arsons. Marking a blaze a hate crime is harder still, says a staffer at the national fire protection association, because then \" you either have to know who did it or they have to leave you a message in some way that makes it very obvious. There are an awful lot... That are not hate crimes — they're run-of-the-mill kids doing stupid things. \" indeed, investigators at the macon fire have already deemed it arson but say there's no evidence of a hate crime, the ap reports.",

The pair were arrested in 1990, shortly after 17-year-old victim andrea hood threw herself out a window and escaped after 36 hours of repeated sexual assault, reports the oregonian; the brothers then vanished. Roberts eventually surrendered in 2006 and is now serving a 108-year prison sentence. But jackson was nowhere to be found until his case was featured on cnn's the hunt with john walsh in july. Authorities say they then received a tip that led them to the man walsh called \" one of my most wanted guys, \" per cnn. The us marshals service says jackson was living in mexico as paul bennett hamilton. Mexican immigration authorities and us marshals seized him at a hotel in guadalajara on monday as he was heading to work at an electronics store.

Branstad, a republican, has accepted the offer, three people close to the matter said on condition of anonymity.

Gray was arrested without force or incident. \" according to the post's timeline of events, the prisoner who says he heard gray banging on the walls was in the van for the last six blocks of the ride to the police station — after gray, who was handcuffed and wasn't wearing a seat belt, had already asked for medical help. Six baltimore police officers have been suspended over the death and police plan to turn the results of their investigation over to prosecutors on friday. Nbc news reports the report won't be made public. As capt. Eric kowalczyk put it: \" there is evidence that has to be preserved, so we have tried to find the balance of releasing as much information as we can. \" the mayor's office has said it hopes police will \" share any additional facts and details to the public that could shine some light on this, \" reports the baltimore sun.",

Speaking at a regional security conference in singapore, north korea's top diplomat said his nation is taking steps in the right direction while washington fails to reciprocate, the new york times reports. Ri yong-ho, north korea's minister of foreign affairs, said in a closed-door meeting that north korea has taken steps toward denuclearization — like dismantling a nuclear test site and stopping nuclear tests — but america hasn't reciprocated by curbing sanctions or declaring the korean war officially over. \" the united states, instead of responding to these measures, is raising its voice louder for maintaining the sanctions against the dprk, \" he said in part. Ri was friendlier while secretary of state mike pompeo remained at the conference, shaking his hand and exchanging pleasantries for a photo op, the washington post reports. \" there are many productive conversations to be had, \" ri told him. Ri was also given a letter from trump that followed up on a missive last week from kim jong un ( the contents remain private, but trump recently tweeted thanks to kim for \" your nice letter \" and added, \" i look forward to seeing you soon! \" ). Another tidbit: before flying to indonesia, pompeo told russia not to help north korea get around un sanctions that moscow had approved. Meanwhile, the un warned friday that north korea is skirting un sanctions with illegal transfers of oil products and has hired a syrian middleman to sell weapons to libya and yemen, afp reports.

Some 50 indonesians were in south korea last wednesday to meet with president lee myung-bak to discuss the purchase of the t-50 golden eagle from korea aerospace industries. But once they left the five-star lotte hotel, shadowy things reportedly occurred in room 1961. Police say two men and one woman entered the room, which contained two laptops. When an aide returned to room 1961, he came upon the woman. From there, reports differ: she either said she was in the wrong room, and quickly left, or he spotted her downloading files onto a usb drive. The aide reported that a laptop was missing, and it was discovered shortly thereafter — in a stairwell, in the hands of the two men... Who turned it over and fled. The purported intelligence agents were reportedly looking for information about indonesia's negotiating strategy for the jets, for which korea has been desperately trying to find buyers. \" it was an unintended consequence that they were caught, \" a senior korean official told the chosun ilbo.",

Airline trade association, an organization that spends millions of dollars trying to influence his panel. The pennsylvania republican is currently at the center of high-stakes negotiations to enact the most sweeping overhaul of the federal aviation administration in decades. The package could include changes to the nation's air travel system, including the privatization of the air traffic control system. Airlines for america's members — all of the nation's largest airlines — have a major interest in the legislation. Story continued below shuster and shelley rubino, vice president for global government affairs for airlines for america, have been romantically involved since last summer, according to multiple sources familiar with their relationship. Rubino, a former top house democratic leadership aide, has been with the trade group since march 2012. The two are often seen together at fundraisers and d.c.

That's why researchers behind a study published friday in science say the world needs to band together to save them. Researchers found only 9 % of the 1,451 bird species studied had enough protected areas along their migration routes to provide adequate spots to rest, eat, and breed. \" this sort of analysis is a wake-up call for us to really do a much better [ job of ] understanding where birds are, \" one expert tells the times. The loss of habitat is putting many migrating birds at risk of extinction, according to a press release. Which is bad because — as the times notes — these birds are important to everything from pollination to pest control. More than half of migratory bird species have experienced declining numbers in the past three decades, the times reports. The problem is the lack of global cooperation in protecting these birds. For example, germany has protected areas for more than 98 % of its migratory bird species, but less than 13 % of those species have adequate protection along their entire route, which can span continents and cross oceans. \" it won't matter what we do in australia or in europe if these birds are losing their habitat somewhere else — they will still perish, \" the study's co-author, dr. Richard fuller, says in the press release. \" we need to work together far more effectively round the world if we want our migratory birds to survive into the future. \"",

Scientific american reports on a pair of x-class solar flares ( the most powerful type of flare ): an x2.2 that burst out of a sunspot at around 5: 15am edt, followed by a much stronger x9.3 flare at 8: 02am, per the noaa's space weather prediction center. That second flare was a doozy: it was the first x9-level flare since 2006, causing a \" wide area of blackouts \" to high-frequency radio with \" loss of contact for up to an hour over [ the ] sunlit side of earth, \" as well as the degradation of low-frequency radio, which is used for navigation, for about an hour. \" harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however — when intense enough — [ it ] can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where gps and communications signals travel, \" nasa notes. Solar scientists say the sun has undergone changes over the past three decades: there's been an odd sunspot dearth during the low-activity periods of 11-year solar cycles, magnetic field distribution has thinned, and even the sun's rotation rate has shifted. \" it's clear that we are in unusual times, \" an expert tells newsweek. It doesn't look like the show is over: a geomagnetic storm warning is in place for the next few days after a coronal mass ejection — a large explosion of plasma and magnetic field that often accompanies a solar flare — that could cause auroras later this week.

Whoppers, chicken sandwiches, and big kings will now be officially on the menu at 9 a.m. Perhaps because bk already offers a substantial breakfast menu, based mostly around its bacon, egg, and cheese croissan ' wiches, they were struggling for a new idea to remain relevant in the morning fast food front. Then again, it isn't that new. Savvy burger king customers know that many outlets will serve you burgers during breakfast hours if you ask nicely, and they're likely to be the best whopper you eat all day — because you ' ll know without a doubt that it was made fresh and to-order. Which fast food place takes the lead in breakfast matters to the industry, because morning purchases are the only area that have grown significantly over the past 5-10 years. Breakfast might be the only war left to win.",

File - this wednesday, june 20, 2012 file photo shows a burger and fries at a burger king in richardson, texas. The miami-based chain on thursday, may 8, 2014 announced it is offering \" burgers for breakfast, \"... ( associated press ) the miami-based chain says its \" burgers at breakfast \" menu includes its whoppers, cheeseburgers and big king sandwiches, as well as its original chicken sandwich, french fries and apple pie. The items are offered alongside the chain's normal breakfast menu. Burger king worldwide inc. Said in an email that more than 5,000 locations will participate in the program. The company said it began rolling out earlier this month but did not say whether it would be available permanently or for a limited time. The rollout was reported earlier thursday by the website burgerbusiness.com. Burger king's move comes as fast-food chains look to tap into the growing breakfast category. Most notably, taco bell recently launched its national breakfast menu by poking fun at mcdonald's in tv ads. But finding success in the morning isn't necessarily easy for new players. Wendy's co., for instance, recently gave up on testing breakfast and says it doesn't plan to pursue it again anytime soon. In a phone interview, wendy's ceo emil brolick noted that"

In an excerpt of her memoir published in sports illustrated, favor hamilton recounts their night with pearl. She writes, \" pearl had flipped a switch inside me, awakening a certainty that i could please clients even more than she'd pleased me. \" she says that over a six-month period she convinced mark to let her become an escort named \" kelly, \" telling him, \" it would be just one or two times with their top clients. \" in fast girl, she recounts leaving \" one of the fanciest hotel suites in las vegas \" having just made $ 1,200. \" this is way better than winning a race, i thought. This is better than competing in the olympics. \" she says that once the rush of pushing sexual boundaries started to fade, she began telling some clients her true identity.

Meanwhile, sanders called donald trump's immigration plan — which he characterized as rounding up 11 million people in the middle of the night and deporting them — a \" vulgar, absurd idea. \" both clinton and sanders distanced themselves from the immigration policies of president obama, who has been criticized for raids targeting undocumented immigrants, the washington post reports. This makes sense as latinos tend to change their opinion on candidates based on their stance on immigration, while other demographics seem not to care, according to enten at fivethirtyeight. For example, obama got a 12 % approval rating bump among latinos in 2014 following an executive order granting temporary legal status; no other group changed their opinion on him. Clinton was able to hit sanders on voting for a bill that would protect the so-called minutemen patrolling along the border. He argued that it was a small part of a larger bill.",

The draft now goes before the entire platform committee in july during a meeting in orlando. Both former secretary of state hillary clinton and sen.

Clinton senior policy adviser maya harris called the draft \" the most ambitious and progressive platform our party has ever seen. \" the draft includes language opposing the death penalty ( which clinton supports under certain circumstances ), supporting a $ 15 minimum wage, and calls for new legislation",

She fought with her husband frequently, but stayed with him until 2001 when she returned to syria. Khadija sharif, aka umm ali: bin laden married his second wife, nine years his elder and a teacher of islam, in 1983. She found his lifestyle too trying, and bin laden allowed a divorce though some say it hurt him deeply. Khairiah sabar, aka umm hamza: she was apparently a child psychology professor from a wealthy family who wanted to marry a \" true holy warrior. \" she was a favorite of bin laden's because of her commitment to jihad. Siham sabar, aka umm khaled: another well-educated professor, older than her husband, whose brother was a holy warrior. She married bin laden in 1987. One friend of bin laden's says that he married his second, third, and fourth wives because they were spinsters and he expected to be rewarded for the good deed in the afterlife. Unknown: there is little information on the woman bin laden married in 1994. The relationship was never consummated and was annulled within two days. Amal ahmed abdulfattah, aka amal al-sabah: his youngest wife and the one injured in the raid on his compound after reportedly rushing the navy seals.

The rebel group, which controls parts of some towns and cities as well as large areas of countryside, urged the government to \" implement an immediate ceasefire, withdraw its troops, tanks and artillery from syrian cities and villages, \" and allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians, the bbc reports. If the government fails to act, \" we are free from any commitment and we will defend and protect the civilians, their villages and their cities, \" the rebel group's leader said. Both sides have violated the ceasefire over the last two months, but un observers say the syrian regime is the worst offender by far, reuters notes.

The fsa's colonel qassim saadeddine in homs said if there was no response by friday lunchtime the fsa would consider itself \" no longer bound \" by the plan. But the fsa head, general riyad asaad, later denied the deadline existed. Instead, he urged peace envoy kofi annan to issue a statement declaring the peace plan to have failed. The bbc's paul wood, who has just returned from three weeks inside syria, says there is no ceasefire holding on the ground. In the latest of a string of bloody incidents, un observers have confirmed the discovery of 13 shooting victims near the city of deir el-zour. Analysis the ceasefire exists in name only. Most people within syria don't think that the un plan will work anyway. I think the threat to lift the ceasefire by the free syrian army will just mean business as usual. The free syrian army, from what i could see, are under enormous pressure. They're having to sell their furniture to buy bullets.

            "Beirut syrian rebels on wednesday gave president bashar al-assad a 48-hour deadline to comply with an international peace plan otherwise they would renew their battle to overthrow him. The ultimatum was issued after u.n. Observers reported the discovery of 13 bodies bound and shot in eastern syria, adding to the world outcry over the massacre last week of 108 men, women and children.

            "Image caption the free syrian army accuses the government of ignoring the un-sponsored peace plan a commander in the rebel free syrian army ( fsa ) has given the government of president bashar al-assad a 48-hour deadline to observe a un ceasefire. The fsa's colonel qassim saadeddine in homs said if there was no response by friday lunchtime the fsa would consider itself \" no longer bound \" by the plan. But the fsa head, general riyad asaad, later denied the deadline existed. Instead, he urged peace envoy kofi annan to issue a statement declaring the peace plan to have failed. The bbc's paul wood, who has just returned from three weeks inside syria, says there is no ceasefire holding on the ground. In the latest of a string of bloody incidents, un observers have confirmed the discovery of 13 shooting victims near the city of deir el-zour. Analysis the ceasefire exists in name only. Most people within syria don't think that the un plan will work anyway. I think the threat to lift the ceasefire by the free syrian army will just mean business as usual. The free syrian army, from what i could see, are under enormous pressure. They're having to sell their furniture to buy bullets. A few more serious weapons are trickling through: we believe some anti-tank weapons",
            "Beirut syrian rebels on wednesday gave president bashar al-assad a 48-hour deadline to comply with an international peace plan otherwise they would renew their battle to overthrow him. The ultimatum was issued after u.n. Observers reported the discovery of 13 bodies bound and shot in eastern syria, adding to the world outcry over the massacre last week of 108 men, women and children.

By the end of the study, 236 people had died, and yes, the more fried potatoes they ate, the more likely those participants were to be among the dead. This does not demonstrate cause and effect, reports time — people who eat fried potatoes might be more likely to eat other fried foods, or exercise less, or any other number of things that are instead ( or also ) a culprit — but it's not a big leap to conclude that a steady diet of fried potatoes isn't helping matters. For now, the center for nutrition policy and promotion recommends three to five servings of vegetables per day that are prepared low in fat — think roasting and steaming. ( deep-fried twinkies are now easer to find. )",

The thieves also stole one crew member's purse, and she was able to track it to a nearby dumpster because her phone was inside. As for that app, the crew didn't name it, but business insider says it sounds like a new one called sketchfactor. The idea is to give users a sense of a particular neighborhood's \" sketchiness \" factor, and it's not sitting well with critics. At valleywag, for instance, sam biddle calls it racist because it's all about helping white people avoid black neighborhoods. \" sketchy, \" he adds, is \" the term young white people use to describe places where they don't feel safe because they watched all five seasons of the wire. \" ( click here and here to read about two other news crews that got mugged on the job. )",

That's a different way of attempting to communicate location; currently, a sonic beacon is issued for 30 days, but in deep water, that signal can get muffled. The new satellite-reliant system would reveal the plane's location within seconds and will transmit updated location data for about six days. Its underwater counterpart will transmit a sonic beacon for a to-be-extended 90 days, per new regulations. Wired notes the new black boxes will record 25 hours of data, versus the current two, which could provide insight into everything from previous flights to prior maintenance in the event of a crash.",

The next highest total, 2000's 88 attacks, falls well behind the new record, which doesn't count incidents in which a shark was provoked, say, by a grabby scuba diver. The total is also a leap from 72 attacks in 2014, per national geographic. A whopping 59 occurred in the us last year — another new record — up from 53 in 2014. Florida counted 30, north and south carolina each had eight, and hawaii saw seven. Outside of the us, australia counted 18 attacks, while south africa counted eight, reports usa today. Starting to panic? there's no need. Just six people were killed by sharks in 2015 — a number that experts say has remained constant over the past decade. In comparison, 100 million sharks are killed by humans each year. \" we can and should expect the number of attacks to be higher each year, \" but \" the chances for any individual who goes in the water surviving have probably never been higher, \" researcher george burgess says. While more people in the water is partly to blame for the high number of attacks, burgess says the increase is also tied to better reporting and 2015 being the hottest year on record. We're now seeing sharks venture into warming waters where they aren't expected, burgess says, which might explain a single attack in new york last year.

        "summary": "Nearly 2,500 men in the united states are expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. And live science reports researchers are worried too many of them will opt to have both breasts removed in an increasingly popular — yet risky and often unnecessary — procedure. A study of more than 6,000 male breast cancer patients between 2004 and 2011 published in jama surgery shows the percentage of men electing to have a healthy breast removed along with the affected breast has nearly doubled from 3 % to 5.6 %. Lead researcher dr. Ahmedin jemal tells live science that percentage is higher than the number of men who actually need the procedure — known as a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy — and there is little proof the operation actually helps people live longer. The washington post reports researchers believe the increase in these types of mastectomies in men — which mirrors a similar increase in women — could be due to improved testing that gives patients more information about their cancer risks. \" we have created a culture of breast cancer awareness, and we've created a countercultural response of fear, \" one scientist tells the post. \" when you do a mastectomy, you reduce fear greatly. \" yet, researchers say such aggressive operations can be both expensive and risky, especially when patients may not need them. And the post reports the number of people electing to have both breasts removed might be even higher today than in 2011 because of the \" angelina effect \": the positive response angelina jolie got after having a double mastectomy two years ago.",

At least that's the takeaway from two columns on the plan: \" the system is failing, \" write the editors at bloomberg. Workers aren't saving enough, employers aren't contributing enough, and social security benefits will barely keep people afloat when they can no longer work. But, unless some sort of incentive is given or unless they're forced to opt in, most people won't participate in myra, either. And without congressional approval, employers can't be forced to offer myra plans. So how do we fix this broken system? it will be a long process, requiring bold moves including \" gradual reform of social security... So that more generous benefits are given to those who need them, with the cost recouped from the better-off through lower benefits and higher contributions. \" at the los angeles times, michael hiltzik agrees: sure, this isn't a bad idea, but it doesn't go far enough. Myra yields will be low, and the temptation to withdraw money early will be high. In fact, all of obama's proposed ideas so far have been \" only token solutions to the retirement income gap. \" the truth is, a \" retirement crisis is looming for millions of americans. \" one potential solution supported by a small but growing number of those in congress: increase social security benefits.",

That's his proposal for the \" myra, \" a retirement account aimed chiefly at lower-income workers whose employers don't offer traditional defined-contribution plans such as 401k's. In many respects the myra is a welcome idea. But if obama's goal is to distract policy-makers from more substantial proposals to shore up the american retirement crisis -- by expanding social security, for example -- then it won't cut the mustard. The plan, as the president outlined it in his address and the white house fleshed out a bit more wednesday, aims to give lower-income workers a way to start building retirement nest eggs in tax-deferred accounts, through regular payroll deductions made by their employers. The employers would have to agree to offer the service to employees. The accounts would be available to those earning less than $ 191,000, but the minimum initial contribution would be $ 25 and subsequent contributions could be as little as $ 5. The money would be invested in a government-backed bond with a yield pegged to the government securities investment fund offered to federal employees through the government's thrift savings plan, a retirement program.

And \" if you're looking for a way to make a sex scene between two objectively gorgeous people pretty nauseating, having a teenager do a voiceover that confirms the aunt-nephew relationship of the characters that are rolling around naked is a solid effort. \" writing for usa today, kelly lawler found the episode bordering on \" dull. \" what was once shocking and brilliant has been replaced by a show \" in which almost everyone gets along, where major characters are seldom in danger of dying, where a zombie dragon breathing cold fire can take down an ice wall because the plot demands it...

At vanity fair, joanna robinson digs deep into the name and the others who have had it: jon would be the third ( with the second being his most likely dead half-brother ). And then there's maybe fake aegon... In a separate piece, robinson raises the possibility that a \"'deadly ' jealous rivalry \" between tyrion and jon snow may be in the cards.

The family of ezequiel cordoba is suing alvarenga for $ 1 million, alleging that he ate the 22-year-old's body, reports the daily mirror.

Alvarenga paid cordoba $ 50 to accompany him on what was to be a two-day fishing trip off the coast of mexico in november 2012, per the telegraph. Alvarenga's lawyer denies the allegation of cannibalism, saying the cordoba family is trying to make a quick buck now that alvarenga has become famous. Alvarenga's lawyer notes the lawsuit was filed days after the release of 438 days, a book about the fisherman's survival. \" i believe that this demand is part of the pressure from this family to divide the proceeds of royalties, \" he says, adding that cordoba's family had demanded 50 % of the profits back in april. \" many believe the book is making my client a rich man, but what he will earn is much less than people think. \" alvarenga has said he and cordoba survived months together before the increasingly distraught younger man finally succumbed to hunger. He says he kept the corpse on the boat for six days, chatting with it for company, before coming to his senses and throwing it overboard.",

Salvador alvarenga spent 438 days drifting across the middle of the pacific ocean until he washed ashore in the marshall islands in january last year. The 36-year-old was with crewmate ezequiel cordoba, 22, when the boat they were in was crippled by a storm, leaving them drifting 6,700 miles from the coast of mexico. Mr alvarenga, from el salvador, later told how he stayed alive by drinking urine and turtle blood and eating fish and birds he caught by hand.

Salvador alvarenga, 36, is the only man known to have survived for over a year at sea. And when he set sail from the coast of mexico in november 2012, he thought he was setting out on a two-day fishing trip, having paid 22-year-old ezequiel cordoba $ 50 to accompany him. But a vicious storm with 10ft waves knocked out the 25ft boat's communication systems, and washed their supplies overboard. Mr alvarenga, a hard-living, tough professional from el salvador, radioed the boat's owner and demanded to be rescued. His last words to land were: \"come now, i am really getting ------ out here. \" cordoba, a novice fisherman, panicked, said mr alvarenga.

        "summary": "A body discovered at the home of new york giants cornerback janoris jenkins has led to a manslaughter charge for his brother. William jenkins, released from a new jersey prison in 2016 after serving time for drug charges, was arrested in new york around 2am tuesday; he had violated his parole by leaving the state. Eight hours later, authorities received a 911 call and responded to the fair lawn home of janoris jenkins, 10 miles north of metlife stadium, where they found the body of 25-year-old roosevelt rene. Described as a family friend and music producer working under the name trypps beatz, rene had been living at the home while the nfler was in his native florida, having wrapped up a giants minicamp two weeks ago, per espn and nj.com. Though authorities asked a neighbor if they'd heard gunshots, per wabc, nfl network's mike garafolo reports police are investigating the death as a \" possible strangulation/suffocation. \" rene's body was reportedly found in the basement of the home by a worker, according to tmz. William jenkins, who also lived at his brother's home, was charged wednesday with aggravated manslaughter and is being held at ontario county jail in new york. Janoris jenkins — a 2017 pro bowl starter who signed a five-year, $ 62.5 million contract with the giants in 2016, per the ap — remains in florida, with the giants organization saying it is \" aware of and monitoring the situation. \"",

It's not entirely clear what the fake film, titled run, is about, but it appears to involve bey and jay robbing banks in ski masks, shooting guns, fleeing from the cops on motorcycle, and walking away from explosions.

The superstar shared four sweet photos of her and solange on instagram yesterday. The photos were all uploaded the same day, may 14, and show bey and solange in a variety of loving sisterly poses. There's solange hugging bey onstage at a concert. There's the pair smiling at what looks like an awards show. And there they are in what looks like the back seat of a car. The message is clear: \" there is nothing wrong with our relationship! we love each other! we are fiiiiiine. \" but just like those updates couples do on facebook when they're a little too eager to prove how in love they are, something about the gallery of photos is a bit too strident. And given how beyonce is able to give a plastic smile through anything -- even her sister trying to pummel her husband -- her standard way of dealing with things seems to be \" deny, deny, deny. \" beyonce strikes me as the type of person who could really use some therapy.

        "summary": "Cornealious \" mike \" anderson was supposed to go to prison in 2002 — but due to, he says, a \" clerical error, \" the missouri man just started serving his 13-year prison sentence nine months ago. Anderson was convicted in a 1999 armed robbery, and was supposed to go to prison after he exhausted all his appeals. But the state never ordered anderson to prison, because it somehow mistakenly believed he was already there, cbs news reports. Then, when the time came for what should have been anderson's discharge date last summer, the state realized it couldn't discharge him... Because he had never been in prison. Anderson had made no attempt to hide over the ensuing years — he got married and is a father of four, started a contracting business, and built a house — where he was re-arrested in july. Anderson's attorneys have filed a motion arguing that after so long, jailing anderson amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, and thus he should be released. Even anderson's victim agrees, as do the more than 11,000 supporters who've signed an online petition calling for anderson's release. The state attorney general is expected to respond tuesday. Anderson, now 37, was 22 when he and a friend robbed a st. Louis burger king night manager at gunpoint, the new york post reports. No one was hurt, but the victim talked to the riverfront times after anderson went to prison last year and said that he was emotionally \" screwed up \" by the crime. Even so, he says it \" doesn't seem right \" that anderson should have to go through this ordeal because of a government error. ( anderson may not have fled the law, but this female fugitive — who was caught last month on a florida houseboat 18 years after her conviction — most definitely did. )",

Just how was it that filmmakers managed to catch the disturbing evidence? filmmaker andrew jarecki today told morning shows about the process: with lots of audio to sort through, the crew hired additional editors, he said on good morning america. Checking the material, \" one of the editors came back and said, ' i think i found something, ' \" jarecki said. The clip, recorded while durst was in a bathroom with his mic on, left jarecki and his colleagues stunned. At the time, they were getting ready to finish up the project, he told cbs this morning, as variety reports. \" it was so chilling to hear it, \" he told gma. \" it makes you very uncomfortable. \" he said the audio was recorded three years ago; the timing is a topic of some puzzlement. While the new york times earlier reported that the audio wasn't found until two years after the interview, jarecki told cbs this morning it was a matter of months, variety reports, and he said police have had access to the recording for \" many months. \" gawker raised questions about whether there was some kind of deal between the filmmakers and law enforcement, but on gma, jarecki said there wasn't. \" we don't have that kind of power, \" he notes. \" we had no idea of the arrest timing. \" either way, the material in the show may not even be admissible in court, experts tell the times.
