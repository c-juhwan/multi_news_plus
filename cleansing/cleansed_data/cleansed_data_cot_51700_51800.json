Now 95, wölk — who, with time, learned to take pleasure in eating again — just started talking about her experiences. \" there was never meat because hitler was a vegetarian, \" wölk tells der spiegel. \" the food was good — very good. But we couldn't enjoy it. \" as germany went hungry, wölk tasted things like white asparagus in sauce made with real butter, noodle dishes, and exotic fruits. She was ordered into the food-tasting service by the ss after she fled berlin for the east prussian village of gross-partsch, located less than two miles from hitler's \" wolf's lair, \" at age 24. She and 14 other young women made sure the allied forces hadn't poisoned the food; then it was served to hitler. A lieutenant ultimately saved her life when the soviet army was closing in, sending her on a train to berlin. She later learned the other food tasters were shot by the soviet soldiers; she herself was eventually caught by the soviet army, and raped repeatedly. In 1946, she was finally reunited with her husband, who had been at war and imprisoned. She finally decided to talk about her life because, she says, \" i just wanted to say what happened there. That hitler was a really repugnant man. And a pig. \" hers is not the only fascinating world war ii story to emerge this week: the ap reports that a virginia farm, used during the war as a refuge for jews escaping germany, has been added to the state's landmarks register.",

The listing of hyde park in nottoway county is among 13 additions to the register by the state department of historic resources. Others include historic districts in five towns, a new deal-era elementary school in northern virginia and houses and homesteads dating back centuries. Department store owner william b. Thalhimer purchased hyde park in 1938 to create a training farm for students who sought to escape adolf hitler's extermination of jews. From 1938 to 1941, about 30 jewish immigrants lived and worked at hyde farmlands, which was devoted to dairy and poultry operations. Many later went on to fight for the u.s.

In an interview with the guardian, former navy secretary john lehman lays it out in blunt terms: \"there was an awful lot of participation by saudi individuals in supporting the hijackers, and some of those people worked in the saudi government, \" he says. \"our report should never have been read as an exoneration of saudi arabia. \" lehman adds that he's not implicating members of the saudi royal family or top civilian officials, but rather lower-echelon employees, perhaps in the saudi ministry of islamic affairs. Last month, the leaders of the commission — former gop gov. Tom kean of new jersey and former democratic congressman lee hamilton of indiana — cautioned against releasing the 28 pages and noted that just one saudi official had been implicated in the plot. ( that was diplomat fahad al-thumairy, who was deported and remains a \" person of interest, \" notes the new york times. ) but lehman says he knows of at least five other saudi employees who were under suspicion. \"they may not have been indicted, but they were certainly implicated, \" he says. \"there was an awful lot of circumstantial evidence. \"",

            "A mental adventure familiar to most students is that of cramming one's mind with knowledge in the run up to an exam. Once the exam is done, we gleefully evacuate our brain of all this hard-won learning that's no longer needed. Within days, we can barely remember the subject matter, let alone the details. At such moments, it's as if we've forgotten on purpose. It might then come as a surprise to learn that until recently, there was little scientific evidence that people could have any deliberate influence on their rates of forgetting. But in the last few years, a small family of experimental techniques have showed that, under the right conditions, we can in fact deliberately forget things. The effects are subtle, but nonetheless suggestive: being able to forget at will would, after all, be a killer life skill. But how does deliberate forgetting work? an exciting new study sheds light on the question. Jeremy manning and kenneth norman have been doing wonderful work on memory for years, and in a remarkably cunning experiment, they provide evidence that we forget things by discarding the mental context within which those memories were first learned.

Obama wants to shift the cia from its paramilitary footing back to an intelligence one, and perhaps bring greater transparency to the drone program. But lawmakers don't trust the military with the keys. One source said the provision was more complicated than simply withholding money for the switch, and former officials said it could contain language forcing the military to demonstrate its targeting procedures were up to cia standards. Intelligence committee chair dianne feinstein last year said she'd \" really have to be convinced \" that the military could exercise as much \" patience and discretion \" as the cia in avoiding civilian casualties, statements she says she stands behind. The military didn't help its case last month either by hitting a wedding party in yemen; in an op-ed yesterday, yemen's minister for human rights said that strike had sent a \" wave of outrage \" across the country.

        "summary": "Millions of people pay for the privilege of leaving their shoes and belts on and their laptops in their bags during airport security screenings. But a study out of the university of illinois at urbana-champaign says by making the tsa's precheck program free — it's currently $ 85 for the regular background check and a five-year membership — lines will be made shorter, the tsa will save money, and everyone's life will be a whole lot easier at our congested airports, the los angeles times reports. The problem is hitting the sweet spot of having enough travelers going through the expedited precheck lines to justify the cost expended on staffing those dedicated lines. The original goal by this point was to have 25 million signees in the program and others like it ( such as customs and border protection's $ 100 global entry program ), but by may, per bloomberg, not even half that number had come aboard. The study published in the journal of transportation security checks out different scenarios to see which would end up paying off for both the tsa and consumers, per a release. Although getting rid of the five-year fee of $ 85 for 25 million travelers would result in losing $ 425 million a year, if every traveler who signed up went through precheck at least six times a year, the cost savings would amount to $ 459 million annually from decreased staff and equipment costs — a net savings of $ 34 million per year. \" it will facilitate more people going through checkpoints more quickly, make the system more secure, and produce a cost savings for the tsa, \" sheldon jacobson, the study's lead author, says in the release. \" it's a win-win-win situation. \" a noted drawback: if the fee were waived only for frequent fliers, occasional travelers might be miffed at having to pay, as would those already paid up.",

Over a five-night period, researchers in boston had some subjects read for four hours a night on an ipad; others did their reading on printed books, with the lights low, the washington post reports. Among members of the ipad group, levels of melatonin, a chemical behind sleepiness, decreased. It took them longer to drift off by an average of 10 minutes, the wall street journal reports. And once they did, their periods of rapid eye-movement sleep were shorter. The effects weren't limited to the nighttime. Their circadian rhythms were affected, and the next day — even if they'd slept eight hours — they reported being more tired. And in the long term, reduced melatonin may boost the risk of various forms of cancer ( prompting the rather frightening headline \" reading an ipad in bed may increase cancer risk, \" the atlantic notes ). At issue is what's known as \" blue light, \" the kind often given off by backlit gadgets, the journal adds. \" we introduce these devices that have medical and biological effects without requiring any health studies on their impact...

One central tenet was operant conditioning: the bed must be a sanctuary, such that the brain is trained to sleep when it is in the bed. The allowance for sex — which, in its ideal form, is one of the most stimulating things a human body can experience — always seemed to me at odds with the stimulus-control approach. A note to aspiring self-help writers: the book for better sleep, kitchen sex remains unwritten. Otherwise, though, the idea of stimulus control made sense to a lot of people.

So researchers out of the university of lyon chose to investigate another aspect of learning — not recall but relearning, where something previously learned has been forgotten and must be re-acquired.

Some learned them at night, slept, and relearned them in the morning, while others learned the words in the morning, didn't sleep, and relearned them at night. The group that slept between sessions performed so much better that even those who forgot the most words relearned them faster during their morning session than the least forgetful members of the group relearning the words at night. The results don't clarify which is at play — sleep boosting learning, which helps improve later relearning, or sleep simply allowing for uninterrupted learning processes to speed up relearning — but either way, sleeping between studying seems worth a shot.

Among its benefits are improved energy and mood, better immune system functioning and blood sugar regulation, and greater alertness and ability to concentrate. Given all of these benefits, the fact that a third of the human lifespan is spent sleeping makes evolutionary sense. However, sleep appears to have another important function: helping us learn. Across a plethora of memory tasks — involving word lists, maze locations, auditory tones, and more — going to sleep after training yields better performance than remaining awake. This has prompted many sleep researchers to reach a provocative conclusion: beyond merely supporting learning, sleep is vital, and perhaps even directly responsible, for learning itself. Recent discoveries from neuroscience provide insights into that possibility.

Evens allegedly sent moore an email asking for $ 250 for nude pictures of \" 6 guys and 6 girls \" in december of that year; a month later, moore allegedly replied with, \" hack all week for me. \" prosecutors say the hacking ended may 2, 2012. The two face up to 7 years in prison. Wired shares this 2012 quote, from moore to a woman whose picture reportedly appeared on his site: \" i don't know how you can point a finger at me; you took the picture.

Reuters reports tom enders announced monday that the company plans to test a prototype self-piloting flying car by the end of the year. He says airbus has the \" technological wherewithal \" to make it happen and that they are currently in the \" experimentation phase. \" enders says the vehicle could be used like a ride-sharing app, help people avoid traffic, and save municipalities money on roads. Sounds pretty cool, but a number of naysayers are putting the brakes on our flying car fantasies. Slate points out airbus admittedly hasn't figured out \" sense-and-avoid technology \" — or, in other words, how to keep its flying cars from smashing into stuff. And jalopnik notes that current designs look less \" flying car \" and more \" flying helicopter, \" which is slightly less exciting. Also, the whole flying car thing still needs faa approval to become a reality, and that's probably not going to happen any time soon.",

He promised that \" democracy will win and it will survive \" as large numbers of demonstrators gathered in tunis to protest the attack, reports reuters. Meanwhile, isis militants today claimed responsibility for the attack, reports the bbc. But in a bright spot, two spanish tourists who hid in the museum all night have now been found safe; juan carlos sanchez tells the ap that \" we thought the terrorists were still outside. But it was simply the police who were searching for people. \" cristina rubio is four months pregnant; both are fine. In other developments: prime minister habib essi says one of the two gunmen, yassine laabidi, was known to authorities, but security services were unaware of links to militant groups, the bbc reports. Both gunmen were killed by security forces, and authorities say they're still hunting several accomplices. Tunisia has now detained a total of nine people. Officials say tourists from japan, italy, colombia, australia, france, poland, and spain were killed in the attack, according to the bbc. Poland, which has sent a plane with doctors to help treat the injured, says two of its citizens were killed, two are missing, and nine are among the 40 or so wounded, the ap reports. Tunisia, birthplace of the arab spring, is the \" arab world's most successful democracy, \" which may have made it more of a target, but there are fears the attack could lead to greater authoritarianism, reports the new york times. Isis supporters are praising the attack online, as per the times. The telegraph reports that tunisian media are speculating that ahmed al-rouissi, the country's most-wanted terrorist, may be involved. The tunisian government says he became a senior isis leader in libya and was killed in fighting last weekend. Tunisian officials have speculated that the adjacent parliament building may have been the attackers ' initial target, and that they may have switched to the museum because it had less security, the new york times reports.",

Corker said the lawmakers had been \" on the five-yard line \" when it came to completing the reform, but that dodd told him he was under pressure by the white house to wrap up efforts to complete bank reform quickly in the committee so that congress can take steps it needs to pass health care legislation, also languishing on capitol hill. \" there is no question that white house politics and health care have kept us from getting to the goal line, \" corker said to reporters. \" the fact of the matter is, he is a victim of health care policy. We're still almost there but it looks like we're not going to get there. \" dodd plans to have the 22 senators on the committee vote on the bill during the week of march 22, after which it could be quickly considered on the senate floor some time in the spring.

            "Washington ( marketwatch ) -- after months of efforts to craft a bipartisan bill, senate banking committee chairman christopher dodd plans to introduce a revised version of sweeping bank reform legislation on monday, most likely without republican support. Dodd had hoped to release a bipartisan bill, after working furiously with sen. Bob corker, r-tenn., to reach a solution. However, dodd said that time was running out to pass a bill in 2010. \" there isn't a lot of time left to complete bank reform this year, \" dodd said to reporters at a news conference. \" the real problem i ' m facing is that clock. \" at a separate news conference, a visibly disappointed corker said that he and dodd, along with other members of the committee, were extremely close to completing a bipartisan bill, coming to agreements on dozens of controversial areas such as how much power to award a new regulator for consumer protection of mortgage and credit card products. Corker said the lawmakers had been \" on the five-yard line \" when it came to completing the reform, but that dodd told him he was under pressure by the white house to wrap up efforts to complete bank reform quickly in the committee so that congress can take steps it needs to pass health care legislation, also languishing on capitol hill. \" there is no question that white house politics and health care have kept us from getting to the goal line, \" corker said to reporters. \" the fact of the matter is, he is a victim of health care policy. We're still almost there but it looks like we're not going to get there. \" dodd plans to have the 22 senators on the committee vote on the bill during the week of march 22, after which it could be quickly considered on the senate floor some time in the spring. Not enough time? in his news conference, corker also criticized dodd's plan to have the banking committee begin and complete its review of the bank bill in one week. \" this is a very important",

President obama would likely never get the approval of the un security council for a military response because of russia's veto power. When bill clinton was in the same boat in 1999, he turned to nato and got its blessing for 78 days of airstrikes. \"it's a step too far to say we're drawing up legal justifications for an action, given that the president hasn't made a decision, \" a government official tells the times. \"but kosovo, of course, is a precedent of something that is perhaps similar. \" obama was meeting today with national security aides to determine next steps if the us concludes that bashar al-assad used chemical weapons.

Pentagon officials said the decision did not reflect any specific orders from washington, but both destroyers had on board tomahawk cruise missiles, long-range weapons that probably would be among the first launched against targets in syria should the president decide to take military action. On friday, the russian government called on president bashar al-assad of syria to allow united nations investigators into the areas east of damascus where the attack occurred. But american and foreign diplomats said russia's move did not reflect any shift in its backing of mr. Assad or its resistance to punitive measures in the security council. In a statement, russia's foreign ministry put the onus on syria's opposition forces to provide secure access to the site of the \"reported incident. \" a second statement suggested that the russians believed the attack was actually a provocation by the rebels. It cited reports criticizing government troops that were posted on the internet hours before the attack. \"more and more evidence emerges indicating that this criminal act had an openly provocative character, \" aleksandr k.

The mail goes on to chronicle mezvinsky's day, noting that he was on his phone while with charlotte and that he later \" enjoyed lunch for an hour-and-a-half \" with a friend, suggesting that dads can't quite cut it while filling in for moms. Slate's elissa strauss calls the article a \" remarkably unselfconscious example of mom-shaming. \" maria guido fumes on scary mommy: \" the whole purpose of this article and subsequent coverage is to remind women that they are somehow going against nature by not being a mom first, all the time. \" a chicago tv station invited readers on its facebook page to \" sound off \" on whether it was ok for clinton to skip the drop-off.

        "summary": "The supreme court heard oral arguments yesterday in abc v. Aereo, a much-watched case that could have big implications for both cloud computing and broadcast television — implications the justices didn't seem comfortable with. Aereo allows users to record broadcast tv online and watch it at their leisure. The major broadcast networks are suing it for copyright violation, and stand to lose billions in fees cable companies pay to carry their programming. Aereo says it's simply renting users the equipment to do online what they can legally do at home. Here's how the arguments went: \" if you're comfortable with the supreme court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of tuesday's oral arguments … should change your mind, \" writes jon healey at the la times. Stephen breyer at one point made an analogy to \" what used to be called a phonograph record store. \" he also worried that aereo's antennas could \" pick up every television signal in the world, \" which isn't true, healey pointed out, \" because the world isn't, you know, flat. \" the justices seemed skeptical of aereo's business model. \" it's not logical to me that you can make these millions of copies and essentially sell them to the public, \" sonia sotomayor said. John roberts said the company was only using thousands of small antennas, instead of a few big ones \" to get around copyright laws, \" the wall street journal reports. But the justices also seemed genuinely worried that their decision could stifle innovation. Sotomayor asked what effect this would have on \" the dropbox and the icloud. \" when the broadcasters ' lawyers told them to \" just be confident \" that aereo's service was different, samuel alito said, \" i don't find that very satisfying. … i need to understand what effect it will have on these other technologies. \" aereo's best hope is that the justices adhere to a lower court's cartoon network vs. Cablevision ruling, which held that customers could make dvr recordings on cablevision's hard drives, writes lyle denniston at scotusblog. At one point, anthony kennedy suggested lawyers pretend that decision had come from the high court. Ultimately, the justices didn't seem to like their options. \" this is really hard for me, \" sotomayor confessed. \" i don't see how to get out of it, \" breyer agreed.",

( andrew harrer / bloomberg / ) if you're comfortable with the supreme court resolving disputes over technology, the transcript of tuesday's oral arguments in abc vs. Aereo should change your mind. Admittedly, the case is about copyrights, not circuitry. In particular, the issue focuses on whether aereo's service violates broadcasters ' exclusive rights to transmit works to the public. Yet the inner workings of aereo's system are crucial to that issue, at least from aereo's point of view. And the justices struggled to get past a simplistic view of the technology involved. For example, at one point justice stephen g. Breyer",
            "Aereo, the streaming video service that everyone's talking about but few people actually have, defended its existence today in front of the u.s. Supreme court while lawyers for the nation's broadcasters and the federal government looked to smash the company's tiny antennae into bits … legally speaking. You can read the whole transcript in this pdf. Like most scotus transcripts, it actually makes for an amusing and thoughtful read, while showing that these hearings are much more about a group of people debating the issue instead of some camera-ready lawyer making a made-for-tv speech that knocks the justices'socks off. Since it will be months before the supremes get around to issuing their opinion on this case, let's bide our time with some highlights from today's arguments … of phonograph records and coaxial cable … at the core of the broadcasters ' case is whether or not",
            "Analysis in the digital age, perhaps only someone as old as justice stephen g. Breyer ( or older ) would fret about what might happen to a store that sells \"phonograph records. \" it is doubtful, in the extreme, whether there are any of those anymore, but no matter: breyer and other justices searched on tuesday for ways to demonstrate that they want to be careful about what they do about today's modes of entertainment. With a new method of watching tv via an internet connection before the court for analysis, the court moved back and forth between killing that novelty by forcing it to pay sizable fees to download copyrighted tv programs, or giving it a fighting legal chance to survive as a cheaper alternative to cable. Aside from struggling somewhat to learn just how this new entry in home entertainment actually works, the hour-long hearing in american broadcasting companies, inc. V."

The judge said he received medical records showing that kasem was not responding to the nutrition and fluids he's been receiving, that painful complications have resulted, and that doctors recommend the nutrition and fluids be withheld, the new york daily news reports. He upheld daughter kerri kasem's conservatorship over her father, despite the fact that kasem's wife, jean, with whom the children have been feuding over his care, insisted kasem told her last week, via eye and eyebrow movements, he wants to live. She said as she left the court hearing that kasem's kids will have their father's blood on their hands, but kerri kasem insists to the daily news they've done all they can: \" we had to take him off [ fluids ] because his lungs were filling up. It sounded like he was drowning, \" she says, and \" the feeding was backing up because he can't digest. \"",

        "summary": "Framing the state of the economy in personal terms, referring to \" my numbers, \" president trump blasted fed chief jerome powell and the central bank itself in an interview with the wall street journal. Trump called the fed the \" biggest risk \" to the economy, due to the three times it's raised interest rates this year; it will likely do so a fourth time in december. Trump lamented powell \" was supposed to be a low-interest-rate guy. It's turned out that he's not, \" adding that powell \" almost looks like he's happy \" when he raises the rates. Trump also seemed irritated that during former president obama's tenure in the white house, interest rates hovered near zero. The journal explains the fed has been increasing the benchmark rate as a move to control inflation and keep financial bubbles at bay. Cnn, meanwhile, notes the \" historically low \" interest rates under obama were needed to jump-start a post-recession economy. Still, trump told the journal that while it's \" too early to say, \" he \" maybe \" isn't so sure he should have nominated powell. \" i don't know, \" he said when asked in what scenario he'd remove his fed head, a move for which nbc news notes there's no precedent. \" i ' m just saying this: i ' m very unhappy with the fed. \" both former fed chief janet yellen and ex-trump economic adviser gary cohn say the president should ease up on the central bank, traditionally an independent entity, per cnn. More from trump's journal interview here, including his take on his former attorney, michael cohen. ( cohen just made a big political move. )",

But as the woman, identified as xiang liujuan, fell halfway through, she pushed her toddler son to safety. The south china morning post reports a woman standing nearby caught him, moved him to the side, then managed to briefly grab xiang's hand. But seconds later she was gone, pulled in by the machinery. Most details come from outlets citing the wuhan evening news, as well as an extremely graphic video of the incident. The hong kong free press reports by way of the evening news that xiang's entire body was \" sucked into \" the escalator's treads. Those treads had to be cut in order for her to be removed, in a process that took roughly four hours. Her husband was reportedly on the scene; he had apparently been with his wife and son but hadn't gotten on the escalator yet. Afp cites an anonymous evening news source who claims work had recently been completed on the escalator and that the maintenance workers failed to properly screw in the access panel. The incident occurred at the anliang department store in jingzhou, hubei province, and public opinion seemed to be split between faulting store management for not immediately turning the escalator off and praising the mother's dying act of love.

Under the deal negotiated by cohen between the married broidy and the playmate, the woman agreed to never discuss the relationship or she would have to forfeit the money. Cohen reportedly struck the deal in late 2017, about a year after paying porn star stormy daniels $ 130,000 not to talk about her alleged affair with trump. Broidy says cohen approached him about the matter after the playmate's attorney contacted cohen. In the current campaign cycle, broidy and his wife have donated more than $ 600,000 to the rnc and gop campaign committees, per the post.

Dylan discussed three favorite works from childhood and andrea pitzer at slate suspects the nobel prize winner for literature may have cribbed much of the moby dick portion from sparknotes. She says at least 20 of the 78 sentences involved strongly resemble sparknotes passages and compares several of them side by side. Multiple phrases, including \" ahab's lust for vengeance, \" appear both in sparknotes and dylan's talk, but not in moby dick itself. He had to give the talk to collect $ 922,000 in prize money. \" some men who receive injuries are led to god, others are led to bitterness, \" a quote that one blogger thought dylan had invented, appears to be based on sparknotes. Pitzer suggests that dylan donate some of the prize money to the sparknotes writer, though others are more forgiving. University of minnesota music professor alex lubet tells the star-tribune that dylan's lecture shouldn't be treated like a classroom assignment. \" his lecture is wild and strange, \" lubet says. \" it's meant to be a post-modern work of art. Any kind of a collage technique is fair game. \" in a 2012 rolling stone interview, dylan addressed claims he had lifted lyrics, saying that in songwriting, \" you make everything yours.

But \" residents not using a filter are asked to flush the water for at least seven minutes before collecting to boil, \" adds the detroit news. The break resulted in a drop in water pressure that may have allowed bacteria into the system. As a headline at fark succinctly puts it, \" residents are being told to boil the water before they not drink it. \" ( the mayor is promising that new pipes are in the works. )",

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, science alert reports. As the researchers put it, the stains are \" totally unrealistic \" when compared to what they should look like. The shroud, which is held in the cathedral of st. John the baptist in italy, is considered an icon, as opposed to a genuine religious relic, by the vatican; fox news notes \" the church has never weighed in on its authenticity. \" \" this is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations, \" the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis tells buzzfeed news. \" even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have. \" the study found inconsistent staining, with researchers concluding multiple poses were used to create the bloodstains — a standing model was likely used to imprint patterns on the cloth at various angles for various body parts. Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The braunschweiger zeitung newspaper has reported that the split came after grieger was critical of a report about the activities of auto union during germany's nazi era.

It's a good restaurant, with a great cocktail and a clever bread operation. But that's as far as i got into the meal. About ten minutes after my party of four sat down, we heard yelling — loud, sustained, top-of-lungs yelling — coming from the kitchen. Mr. Forgione was dressing down a member of the staff, in full view of many of the customers. The dining room quieted as patrons exchanged uncomfortable glances. No one said a thing though. Soon the target of the chef's harsh words delivered our amuse-bouche, and the poor guy was so rattled he could barely speak above a mumble. A few minutes later, the chef was at it again. Fifteen seconds. Another fifteen. And without much forethought, i pushed back my chair and walked through the open doorway of the kitchen. I don't remember exactly what i said, though i did not raise my voice to the point beyond where people in the kitchen could hear it. I told the chef that his behavior was making me and others uncomfortable. I let him know that i thought it was mean. And i asked him to cut it out",

The issue of his return came up publicly yesterday when defense chief chuck hagel testified before congress, and republican jeff miller pressed him on why bergdahl was still in germany, notes the idaho statesman. \"why hasn't he been returned to the united states? \" asked miller, who seemed to be suggesting that the pentagon was keeping bergdahl overseas to shield him from questions. \" we have seriously wounded soldiers that have returned to the united states almost immediately after they are stabilized.... You're trying to tell me that he's being held in landstuhl, germany because of his medical condition? \" hagel: \"congressman, i hope you're not implying anything other than that. The fact — miller: \" i ' m just asking the question. \" hagel: \"i ' m gonna give you an answer too. I don't like the implication of the question.

        "summary": "Bernie sanders didn't lose the democratic race on tuesday night, but with big wins for hillary clinton in ohio and at least three other states, he lost the momentum from his surprise win in michigan and fell further behind in the delegate count. Analysts say that although the senator plans to keep his campaign going, clinton could now be impossible to catch. A roundup of coverage: sanders is now more than 300 pledged delegates behind clinton, which may be an insurmountable margin, reports politico, which describes his candidacy as a \" teetering jenga pile of youth support, momentum, and access to online millions \" — now minus the \" buttressing block \" of ohio. Tuesday night's results were a huge setback for sanders, who had been counting on wins in the midwest to keep his candidacy viable, reports the new york times, which notes that clinton's delegate lead over sanders is about triple the size of the lead obama had over her at this stage in 2008. The washington post also declares the race all but over for sanders, calling ohio a \" back-breaking blow \" that makes it nearly impossible for him to catch clinton — though he clearly \" has both the determination and the resources to keep fighting, \" and his campaign has already \" accomplished far more than almost anyone anticipated. \" sanders would need a \" series of very big victories in big states \" to catch up at this point, the los angeles times reports, but because of how delegates are allocated, clinton is still unlikely to clinch the nomination before california votes in june. In her primary night speech, clinton praised sanders ' \" vigorous campaign, \" but her focus was donald trump. \" when we hear a candidate for president call for rounding up 12 million immigrants, banning all muslims from entering the united states, when he embraces torture, that doesn't make him strong, it makes him wrong, \" she said, per the hill. \" we should be bringing down barriers, not building walls, \" she continued. \" you know, to be great, we can't be small. We can't lose what made america great in the first place. \" sanders probably can't win, but he should definitely stay in the race, writes timothy egan in a new york times op-ed, praising the vermont senator for energizing young voters, forcing the democratic party to pay attention to the \" angry millions in the margins, \" and pulling clinton to the left on issues like trade deals and wall street. By staying in the race, sanders ' ideas \" will shape every part",

        "summary": "A long-awaited report on allegations of bullying in the nfl is in, and the main headline-grabbing point is that richie incognito ( and others ) did indeed harass miami dolphins teammate jonathan martin ( and others ), reports the miami herald. But the report by attorney ted wells also gets a little squishy on the subject. For instance, it concludes that incognito didn't intend to cause \" lasting emotional injury \" or drive martin to quit the team — martin left in october over the abuse, but remains under contract — and it cites a range of factors that make this case unique. Some of the highlights: ' was indeed harassed ': \" to be candid, we struggled with how to evaluate martin's claims of harassment given his mental health issues, his possible heightened sensitivity to insults and his unusual, ' bipolar ' friendship with incognito. Nonetheless, we ultimately concluded that martin was indeed harassed by incognito, who can fairly be described as the main instigator, and by ( teammates john ) jerry and ( mike ) pouncey, who tended to follow incognito's lead. \" other victims: incognito, pouncey, and jerry also repeatedly harassed a member of the team's athletic training staff and another unnamed lineman, reports usa today. Calls for new guidelines: \" as all must surely recognize, the nfl is not an ordinary workplace. Professional football is a rough, contact sport played by men of exceptional size, speed, strength, and athleticism. But even the largest, strongest, and fleetest person may be driven to despair by bullying, taunting, and constant insults. \" the report encouraged new \" workplace conduct rules \" for the league. ' breaking jmart ': one of the more damning points cited against incognito is that he fined himself $ 200 for \" breaking jmart \" in a notebook kept by the team's offensive linemen, reports cbs sports. When the story broke, he asked teammates to destroy the notebook, but that didn't happen. Coaches didn't know: the report says coach joe philbin and staff were unaware of the abuse. It also says that \" incognito and his teammates may not have been clearly notified that they were crossing lines that would be enforced by the team with serious sanctions. \" read the full report here.

Letourneau spent nearly eight years in jail, but the couple stayed together and now have two teenage daughters, audrey and georgia. Abc is providing a few teasers, including the nugget that letourneau wants to teach again, presumably only after getting her status as a sex offender lifted. Fualaau, meanwhile, will discuss his struggles with alcoholism and depression, notes us weekly. \" it was a huge change in my life, for sure, \" fualaau recalls of the scandal. \" i don't feel like i had the right support or the right help behind me...
