Officers arrived at mcpherson square near the white house yesterday to enforce a no-camping law, dcist reports, and protesters complied as tents containing equipment or personal artifacts were removed. But when officers approached occupy dc's library, protesters locked arms and faced off in an aggressive scrum with police. By day's end, eleven protesters were arrested and one officer was hospitalized after an occupier threw a brick in his face. One protester seemed to be unconscious when handcuffed by police and carted away. Many occupiers appeared to accept that the 128-day settlement was over, but a lawyer who has represented occupy dc said he would \" be filing some paperwork \" in response to the police action, reports dcist. Some protesters said that even empty tents were confiscated. \" with respect to taking tents, this is not what the government attorney promised, \" the attorney said.",

Normally healthy, the mother of two soon began suffering from burning pain, vision loss, and cloudy thinking and had sores all over her body. She writes that she was unable to talk for 8 months, instead texting and writing on a dry-erase board. She saw many doctors, certain that their diagnoses of lupus, arthritis, and thyroid problems must be wrong. Then she saw dr. Susan kolb, author of the naked truth about breast implants, who has implants herself and who suggested mold might be an issue. Sure enough, as soon as ziegenhorn's saline breast implants were removed, her symptoms vanished. Wear tv reports ziegenhorn keeps a video on her phone that shows what was once in her body: a mold-covered implant. ( she believes her implant was leaking \" moldy fluid \" into her system for years. ) she and another woman from kentucky, paula blade, have teamed up to spread the word, reports wpsd local 6. Blade's tale is a similar one, and she says that when her removed implants were tested, the implants ' valve was found to be faulty, the \" filling fluid [ was ] grossly contaminated, \" and there were signs of mold. Dr. Kolb believes the mold can often be traced to defective valves ( saline implants are put into the body deflated, and the saline is then inserted via the valve ). While an fda spokesman tells wear tv that he's not aware of similar complaints being filed by women with moldy implants, he does note that most women will eventually need theirs replaced. Dr. Kolb, however, says she's treated thousands of patients with \" saline biotoxin illness \" and feels strongly that patients should have them changed every eight to 15 years.

Cnn reports that for the first 11 minutes of the daytona beach rally, trump stayed on-message in a way that would have pleased top gop officials, slamming hillary clinton and president obama over a $ 400 million payment to iran. The next 40 minutes, however, were a more familiar mix of attacks on a wide variety of targets, including megyn kelly. But despite the public talk of unity, sources tell the washington post that rnc chief reince priebus is \" disturbed \" and \" frustrated \" by trump's recent behavior, particularly the feud with the khan family, and is seeking a campaign reboot. The trump campaign has firmly denied rumors that priebus and trump allies, including newt gingrich, are planning an \" intervention \" to get him back on track. Sources tell the ap that priebus is so concerned by the way trump is splitting the party that he's trying to enlist trump's children to help. At a second florida rally on wednesday, trump boasted about huge turnout at his rallies and told the jacksonville crowd he doubted clinton could get a crowd of 500, politico reports. \" i hear we're leading florida by a bit, \" he said. \" i don't know why we're not leading by a lot.

He is identified as saif al-adel, an egyptian who has been in the group's upper echelon for years.

In another al-qaeda development, the wall street journal reports that pakistani authorities arrested a mid-level operative in karachi. It's the first such arrest since the raid on bin laden's compound soured us-pakistan relations.

            "I appreciate the choice webster's new world college dictionary has made in selecting \" distracted driving \" as their word of the year 2009. I think its rapid intrusion into our national vocabulary shows what an epidemic distracted driving has become. There's no denying that this phrase became part of my vocabulary this past year. Below is webster's editor-in-chief mike agnes explaining their choice: now, as interesting as it is to talk about what \" distracted \" really modifies here, it's probably much more important to focus on what \" distracted driving \" says about our common sense. On its website webster's explains its choice further: a sign of the times surely, distracted driving is another reflection – and consequence – of our ongoing romance with all things digital and mobile and the enhanced capabilities they provide. While it now may be easier and quicker to feed our multitasking habits, it is not always safe, and many jurisdictions are formalizing that position by making it a crime to text or otherwise use a cellphone while driving. And that's why we've produced the psa \" calling plan, \" and that's why we've launched d! straction.gov, and that's why we want to make 2010 the year we put distracted driving behind us.",

It's a suggestion tacked onto the end of a study by dr. Matthew genge of the imperial college london published wednesday in geology. Titled \" electrostatic levitation of volcanic ash into the ionosphere and its abrupt effect on climate, \" much of the findings focus on the 1883 eruption of the krakatau volcano in indonesia. Genge writes that \" conventional wisdom suggests \" eruptions can't inject volcanic particles into the upper atmosphere \" because the temperature inversion of the stratosphere acts as a barrier to convective rise \"; ergo, these eruptions wouldn't have a meaningful impact on the upper atmosphere. But as genge explains in a press release, \" my research... Shows that ash can be shot into the upper atmosphere by electrical forces \" — and \" atmospheric electrical potential moderates cloud formation. \" his research into that krakatau eruption and the average air temperature and precipitation records from the time unearthed data \" consistent with a sudden effect on climate. \" and that takes us to waterloo: the rainy and muddy weather is thought to have played a role in napoleon's defeat, and genge notes in a single paragraph that may and june 1815 are known to have been \" notably wet in europe \" following the late april eruption of the tambora volcano, which is also found in indonesia and erupted at a greater magnitude than krakatau. As the release notes, the findings \" could confirm the suggested link between the eruption and napoleon's defeat. \"",

While the french referred to the military clash as the \"battle of mont saint-jean, \" it became known in most of the world as the \"battle of waterloo \" because the duke of wellington, who led the victorious forces, made his headquarters in the village and the dateline written on the official report he sent back to britain ultimately became linked in popular memory with the battle. \"napoleon never set a foot in waterloo — it's a fact, \" belgian historian and former waterloo resident bernard coppens told the wall street journal. 2.

And what has ended up in berlin's hands started there: it purchased the land for goebbels in 1936 to mark his 39th birthday, according to the afp; construction of haus am bogensee was completed in 1939, the telegraph reports. Goebbels described the area as a \" place of idyllic solitude, \" but it also was, according to reports, an ideal place for the \" randy goat of babelsberg \" to cheat on his wife with starlets from the film studio he controlled. He and wife magda ultimately killed themselves in hitler's bunker after poisoning their six kids.

Now researchers say they've found the answer — that kids get the flu on average every two years, adults every five — by studying antibodies in the blood samples of 151 people in southern china to sort out which influenza strains people have become immune to and when. By comparing a person's antibodies against certain strains with the dates those strains circulated, the researchers were able to ascertain when people actually had the flu, the team reports in the journal plos biology. \" the exact frequency of infection will vary depending on background levels of flu and vaccination, \" one researcher tells livescience. The researchers, from china, the us, and the uk, say there are several possible reasons why kids get the flu more than twice as frequently as adults, among them being that they are exposed to more germs due to increased interaction with others, and also that they've simply not lived as long and haven't accumulated the same antibodies against influenza strains. Interestingly, though, kids have stronger immune responses to the flu than adults. The findings could help researchers better predict how strains will adapt in the future, as well as how immunity to past strains may influence one's response to new vaccines.

            "Abstract the immunity of a host population against specific influenza a strains can influence a number of important biological processes, from the emergence of new virus strains to the effectiveness of vaccination programmes. However, the development of an individual's long-lived antibody response to influenza a over the course of a lifetime remains poorly understood. Accurately describing this immunological process requires a fundamental understanding of how the mechanisms of boosting and cross-reactivity respond to repeated infections. Establishing the contribution of such mechanisms to antibody titres remains challenging because the aggregate effect of immune responses over a lifetime are rarely observed directly. To uncover the aggregate effect of multiple influenza infections, we developed a mechanistic model capturing both past infections and subsequent antibody responses. We estimated parameters of the model using cross-sectional antibody titres to nine different strains spanning 40 years of circulation of influenza a( h3n2 ) in southern china. We found that \"antigenic seniority�? and quickly decaying cross-reactivity were important components of the immune response, suggesting that the order in which individuals were infected with influenza strains shaped observed neutralisation titres to a particular virus. We also obtained estimates of the frequency and age distribution of influenza infection, which indicate that although infections became less frequent as individuals progressed through childhood and young adulthood, they occurred at similar rates for individuals above age 30 y.

He kept it to a slim 701 words ( everyone from jefferson to clinton to george w.

They report in the new england journal of medicine on the first known cases of \" transient smartphone blindness, \" temporary vision loss that appears to be harmless. For the two uk women identified as suffering from it, the blindness was brought on by using their smartphones while lying on their sides in the dark in such a way that only one eye was viewing the bright screen while the other was blocked by a pillow. This caused one eye to adjust to the darkness while the other was adapted to the brightness. When the smartphone was turned off, \" the symptoms were always in the eye contralateral to the side on which the patient was lying \" — that is, the dark-adjusted eye responds fine to the now-dark room, but the light-adjusted eye seemed to suffer blindness for a short period. For both women, who were 22 and 40 at the time, the vision loss lasted up to 15 minutes at a time, with occurrences persisting for months, reports live science. The ap reports they were subjected to mris and other tests before seeing an eye specialist who was able to diagnose them in minutes. \" i simply asked them, ' what exactly were you doing when this happened? ' \" says dr. Gordon plant. One of the women, doubtful of the prognosis, started keeping a record of her blindness incidents, which confirmed the link. A rep for the american academy of ophthalmology says the sample size is too small to prove plant's theory, but the ap comes to a simple conclusion: always look at your phone with both eyes in the dark.

Just \" a tiny, tiny percentage \" of cereals show kids'daily values, says the group's director of research. Per the report, some 10 million us kids get too much vitamin a; 13 million get too much zinc; and almost 5 million get too much niacin. While the three nutrients are necessary, too much vitamin a can eventually cause liver and skeletal problems, too much zinc can be bad for your immune function, and too much niacin can lead to rashes and vomiting. But a kellogg's rep counters that kids need fortified cereals to get enough vitamins, and points out that of the 1,556 cereals ewg analyzed, only 23 had nutrient levels considered \" much greater \" than what kids 8 and under should eat — \" and the vast majority of these are adult-oriented cereals not regularly consumed by children. \" researchers say kids should only eat foods containing a max of 25 % of the adult daily value of the nutrients in question.",

Her car seat was found outside the vehicle, but the infant wasn't in it, reports cnn. Firefighters who feared they were on a recovery mission were later searching a patch of hay within the interstate median when a sound directed them to a small storm drain barely visible about 25 feet from the crash site. Inside, the infant \" was sitting up and looking up at us waiting for us to pull her out, \" a firefighter tells ksla. \" she wasn't screaming, she wasn't crying, was just sitting there waiting for us \" with a scratch on her forehead, he adds. Firefighters believe the infant rolled down a hill and into the storm drain. Incredibly, she was taken to a hospital and found to have suffered only a minor injury. \" there had to be some kind of divine intervention for her to end up being ok, \" the firefighter says. Authorities say the child wasn't properly secured in her car seat, which itself wasn't properly installed in the car, but police issued no citations over that. None of the four others from the car suffered serious injuries, while the driver of the 18-wheeler has been cited for an improper lane change.

Less publicly, it stands by as peacekeepers rape women and children in the central african republic, victims and human rights organizations allege. Four years after un peacekeepers were first accused of rape in the country following a decade of civil war, victims say the crime continues with impunity. Expanding upon 255 alleged incidents worldwide from 2015 to 2017, a woman tells usa today that peacekeepers raped her 10-year-old son a year ago in bouar, leaving him \" traumatized. \" a 13-year-old girl says she was raped two years ago near bangui by two soldiers who lured her with promises of \" candies and cookies. \" a 17-year-old girl says she was raped at gunpoint by two soldiers in june, and knows many women who were raped, impregnated, and later gave birth. The teen said she didn't report the crime because she feared people \" would make fun of me. \" human rights groups say victims fail to report abuses by peacekeepers for a number of reasons, including fear of reprisals. This — combined with a watchdog report showing the un needs to better investigate accusations — explains why some dispute the un's claim that there were 50 % fewer worldwide assaults on children by un peacekeepers in the first 11 months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. \" the un is claiming things are getting better, but it is in complete control over the assessments of people coming forward, \" says the co-director of aids-free world, which tracks such abuses. Un officials say progress is being made, though an investigation into alleged child rape by french soldiers in the central african republic was just closed because of insufficient evidence, reports afp.",

            "Members of operation sangaris were accused of abuse at a camp in central african republic french magistrates have closed an investigation into allegations that french soldiers raped children in the central african republic ( car ) while on a peacekeeping mission, judicial sources said monday. Members of operation sangaris, deployed to keep warring militias apart, had been accused of abusing children at a camp for people displaced by the fighting in 2013 and 2014. But magistrates dismissed the prospect of a trial, saying there was not \"sufficient evidence \", according to their ruling, seen by afp. The state prosecutor had last year called for the case to be closed. While admitting \"it is not certain that no sexual abuse took place \", the prosecutor said that \"differences \" in the testimonies of the children who came forward made it impossible to establish guilt. The allegations were first reported by the british newspaper the guardian in april 2015, tarnishing the reputation of the french military. The guardian reported that six children aged nine to 13 said they were abused in a camp in car's capital, bangui, in return for food and money. The childhood and sharing civil group will appeal the magistrates'decision to dismiss the case, lawyer rodolphe constantino said.

        "summary": "Today's big immigration news will come straight from the president's mouth. Barack obama will set out his own immigration reform plan in las vegas today, and it will offer more specifics than his 2011 immigration \" blueprint \" did. But his intention is not to put forth an actual bill — so long as the senate keeps making progress on its version, politico reports. But that approach isn't as pitfall-free as it sounds: the senate group and obama already disagree on a few points, like linking the granting of citizenship to tougher border enforcement, which obama believes would establish a state of limbo for the 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. A likely big fight: while the senate plan made no mention of same-sex bi-national couples, obama will address this population today, reports buzzfeed. It spoke with sources who said some of the senate democrats involved actually alerted lgbt leaders to the omission on sunday, which they explained as necessary for securing bipartisan backing. Chuck schumer reportedly said same-sex couples — who, even when married under state law, cannot obtain green cards for the foreign partner — could be written into the legislation as the process moves forward. Real clear politics reports that obama's overall role will be as \" cheerleader, \" pushing the public to push their members of congress to act. But he doesn't want a lot of individual measures; rather, he's expected to call for a single bill. And while the senate's bipartisan deal has won cautious praise from the white house, it will be much tougher to sell it to republican voters and many gop lawmakers, the new york times finds. Conservatives in the house have made it clear they are opposed to anything resembling amnesty, and john boehner has remained noncommittal on the proposal. \" when you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs american workers thousands of jobs, and encourages more illegal immigration, \" says rep. Lamar smith, a key republican on the house judiciary committee.",

The hill reports that there doesn't appear to be anything too explosive in the excerpts, though clinton does speak about security concerns about using blackberries at the state department, admit that she is now \" kind of far removed \" for the struggles of the middle class, and, in a discussion about dealing with lobbyists, say that you \" need both a public and a private position. \" the remarks that may be most likely to end up in a trump attack ad come from a 2013 speech to a brazilian bank. \" my dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, \" she said. Buzzfeed reports that the speech transcripts were among emails believed to be from a hacked account of clinton campaign chief john podesta. A clinton campaign spokesperson said the campaign won't confirm whether the emails are authentic, and added that the us government has \" removed any reasonable doubt that the kremlin has weaponized wikileaks to meddle in our election and benefit donald trump's candidacy. \" ( bernie sanders made numerous calls for clinton to release the speeches. )",

The station shrugged off the gaffe as an easy slip-up, pointing to other stations that have made similar errors — including another of its affiliates, whose anchor announced that \"president obama \" was dead, notes zap2it. And before slamming the sacramento affiliate's mistake, keith olbermann made one of his own, notes mediaite. The former msnbc anchor blogged that george w. Bush had \"personally de-prioritized the hunt for obama \"; an msnbc correspondent separately tweeted, \"obama shot and killed, \" the daily caller observes. Fox news is now spelling the terrorist leader's name \"usama, \" and ran a doozy of a typo when the news broke ( see it here ). Fox news notes a \"mixed \" reaction to his death among hollywood's typo-happy elite. \"i dont know how i feel about ' celebrating'death \" tweeted maroon 5 frontman adam levine. \"i believe in justice, \" tweeted katy perry, \"but don't u think that an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind? \" other celebs, however, didn't hesitate to celebrate: \"got bin laden and interuppted celebrity apprentice? win for obama all around, \" tweeted jimmy fallon.",

If you admire his work ( which i do ), then you probably admire his distinctive visual flair. If you don't ( heathen! ), then you probably think that any old schmuck could produce an equivalent work simply by grabbing a paintbrush and having a seizure. I am now fortunate enough to be able to argue for my perspective with math on my side. Lior shamir, a computer scientist at lawrence technological university, has taken a series of image analysis algorithms and shown that they can discriminate between real pollocks and pieces painted in an attempt to mimic his style.

But scientists at the university of colorado boulder report in the journal science translational medicine that caffeine has another physiological impact on sleep by delaying the body's natural surge in the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, which in turn pushes back the body's circadian clock. \" to our surprise, no one had really tested this question, \" one of the researchers tells npr. \" what we're seeing here now is another way that caffeine impacts our physiology that we didn't know about before in humans. \" the problem in this case is that the circadian clock is \" present in cells throughout our entire body, \" says the researcher. \" it's in your fat cells; it's in your muscle cells. \" messing with it appears to play a role in a wide range of health problems, from obesity to cancer. Many studies have recently suggested that bright light at night, especially the blue light emanating from our screens, impedes melatonin production. Caffeine's effect is about half what scientists found when exposing volunteers to bright light alone; volunteers who drank a double espresso three hours before bedtime experienced a 40-minute delay of the melatonin surge. Now the researchers plan to study whether caffeine consumption five or six hours before bedtime produces a similar effect. ( still want to watch tv at night? orange glasses should do the trick. )",

            "First, a prosecutor would need to appeal to – perhaps exploit – stone's natural sense of self-preservation. For all the trouble he has been mixed up in over his long career, stone has never been at any real risk of serving time behind bars. Friday's indictment might change his bearing a bit. It's one thing to rail publicly against the possibility of a theoretical future indictment, but another to see seven federal criminal charges, carrying a total maximum sentence of 50 years, in black and white. As a practical matter, stone isn't looking at anything close to 50 years, but he easily could be facing five years or so if convicted on all counts. For a 66 year-old man like stone, that could mean most or all of the rest of his life, which has to be at least a bit sobering. And the evidence laid out in the indictment seems locked in; over and over again, the indictment quotes stone's lies and then cites hard proof – typically stone's own texts – to prove that he lied. A good prosecutor could make a compelling case that cooperation offers stone his best and most realistic chance to get through the case without having to serve time. Second, as much as we don't like to acknowledge it in our quest for pure justice, money matters. It is expensive to defend yourself in federal court, and it is jaw-droppingly costly to go to trial. Stone has flashed vulnerability on this, declaring that he faces legal fees of $ 2 million – not an outrageous estimate, if a trial is involved – while noting that he is \"not a wealthy man \" and begging for crowdfunded donations. Third, stone is nothing if not ego-driven. We all are, of course, but stone's in his own league. A prosecutor might therefore make a pitch to stone along these lines.

But with some states decriminalizing the possession of weed, the feds are investigating a pot version of the.08 breath alcohol concentration set as the legal driving limit in most of the country. A new study by the national institute on drug abuse finds that drivers with blood concentrations of 13.1 ug/l thc, which is more than twice the 5 ug/l limit in washington and colorado, exhibit impairment similar to those with a.08 breath alcohol concentration, reports time. The small study of 18 occasional pot smokers between 21 and 37 involved a 45-minute driving simulator in a 1996 malibu sedan at a university of iowa dome. Not only did researchers test different combinations of high or low concentrations of thc, alcohol, the combination of the two, and placebos, but they also looked at 250 parameters of driving, with a focus on weaving. While alcohol affected both lateral acceleration ( weaving speed ) and lane departures per minute, marijuana alone did not, reports reason magazine, which takes issue with current limits: \" the five-nanogram cutoff in practice means that many regular cannabis consumers can never legally drive, even when they're not impaired, which hardly seems sensible or fair. \" ( what happens when mixing alcohol and marijuana? )",

And, while drunk driving is on the decline in the u.s., driving after having smoked or otherwise consumer marijuana has become more common.

The 29-year old was found not guilty late saturday for shooting the unarmed black teenager in a case that sparked a national debate on race and gun laws. One of his first calls was to defense witness john donnelly and his wife leanne benjamin. They got to know zimmerman in 2004 when he and a black friend opened up an insurance office in a florida building where benjamin worked. They grew close and the couple spent time with him during the trial. Over dinner with zimmerman recently, benjamin said he told them he would like to go to law school. \" i'd like to help other people like me, \" she quoted him as telling them. Zimmerman, an insurance investigator, attended community college and was a credit shy of an associate's degree in criminal justice but was kicked out of school because he posed a danger to the campus, according to family sources. \" everybody said he was a cop-wannabe but he's",
            "Reuters sanford police officer timothy smith holds up the gun used to kill trayvon martin, while testifying during george zimmerman's trial in sanford, fla., on june 28. The weapon george zimmerman used to kill trayvon martin will likely be returned to him, if he requests it. Shawn vincent, an aide to defense attorney mark o ' mara, told nbc news on sunday that the keltec 9mm handgun zimmerman used to shoot and kill martin on feb. 26, 2012 will be returned, but said he did not think authorities have released the weapon yet. \"it's something that will happen, but i don't think it has happened, \" vincent said. Vincent cast doubt on reports that the weapon has already been returned to zimmerman, who was acquitted late saturday of second-degree murder in martin's death by a florida jury. \"i ' m not sure that's accurate, \" he said. Thousands of trayvon martin supporters from across the country took to the streets after a florida jury found george zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder for the 17-year-old's shooting death. Nbc's kerry sanders reports. Florida law bars people \"convicted of a felony in the courts of this state \" from possessing \"firearms, ammunition, or electric weapons or devices unlawful. \" but because zimmerman \"is not a convicted felon"

        "summary": "The centers for disease control has issued official guidelines that boys now receive the hpv vaccine. The vaccine has been recommended for girls since 2006 to protect them from the sexually transmitted human papilloma virus linked to cancers. But because girls get the virus from boys, it \" seems appropriate, even fair, for boys to share responsibility for maximizing community immunity, \" an expert told abc news recently. The new guidelines follow a health committee vote last year recommending that the cdc modify its policy. The urgency behind hpv vaccines for boys rose last week after a study revealed that that nearly 7 % of american teens and adults have oral hpv, a virus which can lead to oral cancer. Men are three times more likely to have oral hpv than women, according to the study. The cdc is recommending the vaccine for all boys, ages 11 and 12 — the same age girls receive the vaccine. The agency also recommends older children and young adults gets the three-dose vaccine if they haven't received the vaccination at a younger age. The vaccine has been a hot-button issue for conservatives, some of whom view it as encouragement of sexual promiscuity. Former republican presidential candidate michele bachmann sparked a furor when she said during a debate that the vaccine carries a risk of causing \" retardation. \" she said later that she simply \" passed on \" a claim she heard from a stranger on the campaign trail.",

He said, â€ œ[ she ] b****** from the moment she got off the plane.â€  needless to say, kate made no new friends during her camping trip mainly because she made everyone around her miserable. Gosselin and her brood of eight kids were scheduled to stay overnight but it became so bad for the original octomom that she actually made her kids leave via a plane before nightâ€ ™s end.

The officials say intelligence shows that prince mohammed bin salman, or mbs, initially placed his mother under house arrest at a palace over concerns that she opposed the idea of the king appointing mbs crown prince and might seek to prevent him from doing so. King salman did indeed appoint his son crown prince in june, stripping his nephew of the title; mbs was quick to consolidate power. ( this week, it was reported that mbs had seized executive control of businesses linked to people he recently had arrested. ) the officials say that over the past two years, mbs has kept his father from seeing his mother, using various excuses — such as claiming his mother is getting medical treatment. The 32-year-old mbs, who revealed in a recent interview that saudi arabia would develop a nuclear bomb if iran did, will be meeting with the us president next week. As nbc reports, he ' ll likely be touted as \" a reformer who's expanded women's rights \" in saudi arabia, but the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said his treatment of his mother proves the lengths he ' ll go to to ensure he is the country's next king. Us officials have also told nbc that, based on interactions with king salman, he may not be \" consistently lucid \"; they say he has told those around him that he misses his third wife, but he does not appear to know where she is. The embassy of saudi arabia in washington denies that she is separated from her husband. See nbc for more.",

The process in which the embryo remained in cool storage all these years is called cryopreservation, and the process by which the gibsons became parents is known as embryo adoption.

From 1993 to 2003, 47 % of 18- to 29-year-olds, on average, identified as democrats or said they were independents but leaned to the democratic party, while 42 % were republicans or republican leaners. That time span included two years in which young adults tilted republican, 1994 and 1995, when republicans won control of congress. Since 2006, the average gap in favor of the democratic party among young adults has been 18 percentage points, 54 % to 36 %. This democratic movement among the young has come at a time when senior citizens have become more republican. The broader u.s. Population has shown more variability in its party preferences in recent years, shifting democratic from 2005 to 2008, moving back toward the republican party from 2009 to 2011, and showing modest democratic preferences in the last two years. Younger americans now more racially diverse a major reason young adults are increasingly likely to prefer the democratic party is that today's young adults are more racially and ethnically diverse than young adults of the past.

        "summary": "The advantage of an electronic monitoring bracelet is that authorities can track a suspect's whereabouts. The downside: they can have no idea that a suspect might be holding a girl captive in his home while wearing it. That was allegedly the case in norwood, ohio: cody jackson, described as age 19 or 20, was charged with crimes relating to the abduction of two women last august, paid a $ 100,000 bond, and was placed on electronic monitoring, reports the cincinnati enquirer. While he awaited court action, police say he got in touch with a 14-year-old girl on facebook and arranged for a taxi to bring her to his apartment roughly every other day for three weeks in february so they could have sex. He soon took control of her social media accounts and gave her a strict set of rules to follow, according to the fbi. Then, after a visit in march, he wouldn't let her leave, police say. For the next several months — including after the girl became pregnant — jackson verbally and physically abused her; told her not to refuse sex; dictated when she used the bathroom, showered, ate, and contacted family members; and banned her from singing any song performed by a man, reports deseret news. The 20-year-old mother of jackson's child also came to live with the pair and was abused, police say. She and the 14-year-old escaped in early august after jackson pleaded guilty to interference of custody — other charges against him were dropped — was taken off electronic monitoring, and fled the state. But even then, jackson over facebook threatened to kill the girl and her family if she didn't send him nude photos, authorities say. It isn't clear when she went to police. Jackson was arrested in utah on oct. 8 and will be return to ohio to face a slew of federal and local charges.",

Per usual, poignant stories are emerging: a 140-person school in the andalucia region took part in what the telegraph terms a \" lottery-selling scheme \" to raise funds for a school trip. It bought and then resold nearly 800 décimos ( each is 1/10th of a ticket, so the equivalent of 80 tickets )... Of number 79140, making for a $ 327 million windfall for the town. \" almost everyone in the village has a décimo, even if they shared it, \" says laujar de andarax's mayor. \" they're going mad over at the school! \"... And now plotting a trip to miami, not italy. The schoolkids had bought the tickets from the lottery agency in roquetas de mar, the southern beach town that happened to have sold all the winning tickets ( the ap points out that the winning number is generally sold by more than one lottery agency. ) another big winner in that town, per the local: a 35-year-old senagalese migrant who sailed from his homeland in 2007 and was rescued by a spanish lifeboat. He entered spain empty-handed, and has largely worked as a seasonal vegetable picker. \" this is a souvenir to antonio, who told...

        "summary": "The supreme court hears two landmark gay rights cases this week, starting today. Here's what to expect: what's on the docket for today? the court will consider california's voter-approved prop 8, which banned same-sex marriage after the state supreme court allowed it, the ap reports. A federal district judge struck down prop 8, but his decision was stayed until the supreme court can weigh in, the new york times reports. What's on deck for tomorrow? the court will consider the defense of marriage act, which bars the federal government from recognizing gay marriages. What outcomes could we see? a decision is not expected until late june. Worst-case scenario for gay rights activists, per politico: the court upholds both prop 8 and doma. But there are a raft of other possibilities in the prop 8 case: the justices could make same-sex marriage legal in california, but only california, thus leaving the decision up to states; they could make it legal in california and the eight other states that currently allow civil unions or domestic partnerships for gay couples; or, as activists hope, they could strike down all state bans on gay marriage. There's also the slim possibility the court will decide prop 8 supporters don't have the right to defend it in court ( california's governor and attorney general have refused to defend it ). If that happens, legal experts believe same-sex marriages would resume in the state, but ironing things out could involve a lower court. How about the doma case? there are only two likely outcomes, scotusblog reports: the court will decide it's unconstitutional or constitutional. We could see a split decision, with doma being struck down but prop 8 being upheld. Why is today historically noteworthy? exactly 10 years ago, the supreme court heard a challenge to texas ' anti-sodomy statute in lawrence v. Texas. Ultimately, the court prohibited states from criminalizing sex acts between consenting adults. Which justices should we watch? anthony kennedy, for one — he wrote the lawrence decision and is expected to be the swing member of the court; he also championed gay rights in another case, and experts believe he ' ll at least make a majority, with the four democrat-appointed justices, in finding doma unconstitutional. On the gop side, chief justice john roberts has given some hints he could swing pro-gay marriage; samuel alito may as well. But antonin scalia and clarence thomas will almost certainly not.

        "summary": "An anonymous rape victim has launched a class action lawsuit against memphis, alleging that it had a policy of disregarding rape kits, either throwing out or simply neglecting some 15,000 of them over a period of decades, courthouse news reports. Jane doe says she waited 13 years for police to test the bodily fluids she submitted after a burglar raped her, an experience shared by thousands of other victims. In many cases, the kits spoiled while waiting for testing. The city, the lawsuit alleges, \" has a history of discriminating against females, \" and gave these assaults a lower priority. The suit is asking the court to declare the practice unconstitutional, and to issue an injunction to end it. In november, memphis publicly admitted that it had 12,113 untested kits in its possession, and said it would cost more than $ 4.6 million to test them, according to wmctv. But the lawsuit raises new questions by arguing that this was no accident, bill dries at the memphis daily news writes. It claims that the city knew about the policy \" approved it, condoned it, and/or turned a blind eye to it. \" the 15,000 estimate is based on the number of sexual assaults reported to third-party agencies over that period. A 2010 report estimated that 180,000 rape kits sat untested nationwide.",

The fbi said last month it was having trouble cracking encryption on multiple phones and hard drives in the case. It's not clear whose phone is still causing trouble. Comey said law enforcement is sometimes unable to unlock phones even after obtaining warrants ordering the phones be opened, the ap reports. The fbi is trying to retrace the couple's movements before and after the attack — last month, investigators said they couldn't account for an 18-minute stretch after the attack — and determine whether anyone else helped. At this time, the fbi still has no evidence the couple had \" outside direction or support, \" the times notes, but other questions remain: investigators don't know whether the couple planned other attacks, whether anyone knew about the plans for the dec. 2 attack, or why farook left a bag containing homemade pipe bombs in the conference room they attacked. The fbi's encryption struggle illustrates what law enforcement has been warning about for more than a year — advanced encryption methods on some newer phones often hinder investigations, particularly at the state and local levels.",

( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — the latest on the worldwide threat assessment from u.s. Intelligence agencies ( all times local ): ___ 5 p.m. Fbi director james comey says one of the phones used by the killers in the san bernardino, california, attacks remains inaccessible to investigators more than two months after 14 people were fatally shot. Comey is testifying before the senate intelligence committee. He cites the case as an example of how encryption is affecting counterterrorism efforts. But he says the dilemma of bad guys \" going dark \" is mostly affecting state and local law enforcement officials who are trying to solve murder, drug and car accident cases. Companies are increasingly making devices such as cellphones with encryption that allows only the people communicating to read the messages. Comey says it's a big problem when law enforcement armed with a search warrant can't open a phone, even when a judge says there's probable cause to have it opened. ____ 3: 22 p.m. Cia director john brennan had a heated exchange with a member of the senate intelligence committee over whether the agency spied on staffers investigating harsh interrogation methods — a probe that resulted in the so-called torture report. Sen. Ron wyden, d-ore., asked brennan to acknowledge that a cia search of intelligence committee files in january 2014 was improper and would not happen again. But brennan held his ground. At the time, brennan denied that his personnel spied on senate investigators. Later, an internal cia review faulted five cia employees for hacking into the intelligence committee's computers and emails. Brennan apologized to the top committee leaders, while insisting it was \" very limited \" access. Wyden says both the cia review and an inspector general's report of the incident"

        "summary": "The hollywood reporter calls it \" uncomfortable footage. \" and how. The ap yesterday released video shot during a nov. 6 interview with bill cosby and wife camille about artwork they loaned to the smithsonian. Historically, and in a recent npr interview, cosby has remained silent if the interviewer asks questions about the rape allegations against him; that was not the case here. His comments to the ap reporter, who asked him about the allegations several times: \" no, no. We don't answer that. There is no response. There is no comment about that, and i ' ll tell you why. I think you were told, i don't want to compromise your integrity, but i don't talk about it. \" as the interview wrapped up, cosby then asked the reporter to \" scuttle \" the exchange. \" we thought, by the way, because it was ap, that it wouldn't be necessary to go over that [ i.e., specifying the topic was off-limits ]... We thought the ap had the integrity to not ask. \" cosby then says to someone off-camera, \" i think you need to get on the phone with his person immediately, \" pointing at the reporter. More: tv land will stop airing reruns of the cosby show, immediately and for an indefinite time. The ap notes the cosby show had been slated to run as part of a thanksgiving sitcom marathon. What hasn't been canceled, per the hollywood reporter: the comedian's stand-up tour. He's scheduled to appear at the atlantis resort in the bahamas today. Buzzfeed reported the claims janice dickinson made on tuesday, and got a roughly two-page letter from martin singer, cosby's new attorney, in response. He uses the words \" false, \" \" falsity, \" \" fabricated, \" \" fabrication, \" \" lie, \" and \" lying \" 19 times to describe dickinson's allegations, and closes with this: \" you proceed at your peril. \" raven-symoné ( the cosby show's olivia ) is speaking up — and asking to be left out of it all. Her instagram post: \" i was not taking advantage of by mr. Cosby when i was on the cosby show! i was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that i want no part of! everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness.

        "summary": "About the only thing banana peels were good for up to this point were comedy pratfalls and composting. A farm in japan appears to have changed that, producing a banana with a tasty edible peel thanks to what quartz labels a \" bizarre method of production. \" the technique used by d&t farm to create the mongee banana is called \" freeze thaw awakening. \" the process involves starting banana trees out in an environment that's nearly minus-80 degrees fahrenheit, then moving the trees with their still-ripening bananas to a more temperate climate of around 80 degrees — an environment banana trees typically grow in the entire time. The extreme temperature variation puts the banana's growth into a sort of hyperspeed mode, so the peel doesn't fully mature, leaving it with a texture like \" lettuce, \" a d&t farm spokesman says, per the new york post. Taste-testers for the rocketnews24 site in japan say the banana fruit itself — which has about 5 more grams of sugar per banana than the regular version — boasts a \" very strong tropical flavor \" akin to that of a pineapple, but using the descriptor \" edible \" for the skin may need tweaking. Although it's said not to have a \" strange texture \" and is \" fairly easy to eat, \" the tasters add there \" isn't much flavor \"; one experimenter even said it was somewhat bitter, though not as much so as the peels of regular bananas, which he also tasted. Not that most people will get to sample it: the mongee banana, which comes in batches of 10, is currently being sold in just one regional japanese outlet, with each banana going for around $ 6.

Silver offers a lengthy analysis, arguing that gallup has a bad track record in similar instances over recent election cycles. Bottom line: \" it's much more likely that gallup is wrong and everyone else is right than the other way around. \" ezra klein at the washington post also sounds doubtful. He thinks gallup's method of surveying likely voters, rather than registered voters, sounds like \" a model that would tend to overstate the effects of major events that favored one candidate or the other, as their supporters would grow temporarily more enthusiastic and attentive, while the other side would grow temporarily disillusioned. \" conservatives, though, are livid that romney isn't getting credit for the poll and are going after silver in particular given his status as a numbers whiz. \" anyone's who's pegging obama at a 64.8 percent chance of winning the electoral college at this point's obviously running a couple of quarts low already, \" writes donald douglas at the american power blog.",

The bank of canada put a new $ 100 bill made out of polymer into circulation, the globe and mail reports, and banks stopped issuing the old paper notes monday afternoon. Polymer $ 50 bills are coming in march, followed by $ 20, $ 10, and $ 5 bills in 2013. The notes, made of multiple layers of plastic and almost impossible to tear, will be more difficult to counterfeit and will last longer than paper money. They're also recyclable, usa today notes. Despite an increasing number of attempts to make cashless transactions possible, the central bank's governor said while unveiling the new bills that \"reports of the death of cash are greatly exaggerated, \" and as such, \"canadians … need a currency that they can trust. \" australia also uses polymer bills, and has since the 1980s; about 30 countries in total have moved away from paper currency.",
