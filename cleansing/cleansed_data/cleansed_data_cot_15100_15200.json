        "summary": "We now know that a saudi double-agent managed to get his hands on a non-metallic bomb that was designed by al-qaeda to slip past metal detectors — and a number of us officials aren't too happy about said revelation. Though the ap held the story for a few days, the cia kept it under wraps for weeks, reports the new york times, releasing it only when the cia established that the agent and his family were safe. Rep. Peter king blasted the revelation that a mole was involved on cnn last night, telling anderson cooper, \" this could really interfere with operations overseas. My understanding is a major investigation is going to be launched because of this. \" as for the bomb itself, an official says it was incorporated into \" custom-fit \" underwear, outfitted with a high-grade military explosive, and equipped with two detonation methods ( a sole method failed al-qaeda in 2009 ). He said it could be missed during even a thorough pat-down, but another official tells the times that it \" most likely would have ( been ) detected \" if the correct screening measures were followed. Npr adds that acquiring the bomb intact is a \" coup \" for us intelligence, as it's much easier to study in that form. Officials are still on the fence about whether to release images of the bomb: doing so could assist tsa agents and law enforcement, but officials fear they would be leaked to the press.",

He has denied the allegations. Arbuthnot said assange should come to court and make his case like any other defendant and didn't mince words in leveling her decision at westminster magistrates ' court, reports the ap. \" he appears to consider himself above the normal rules of law and wants justice only if it goes in his favor, \" she said. \" defendants on bail up and down the country...

Tall and wiry, with a puff of wavy dark hair, he is nearly as well known in washington for his punishing early-morning workouts as he is for his mastery of the federal budget. Asked to explain his opposition to obama's newly released budget, he replied, \"i don't have that much time. \" ryan won his seat in 1998, at the age of twenty-eight.

Us officials say troops were told to accept bin laden's surrender only if they were sure he did not pose a threat, such as having a bomb hidden under his clothing. The white house stands by its claim that bin laden resisted capture, and jay carney notes that \" resistance does not require a firearm. \" in fact, most officials, experts, and analysts rounded up by the new york times, los angeles times, and christian science monitor agree that it was a completely legal mission, being that bin laden was a legitimate military target — not to mention \" extremely dangerous, \" says one. \"if he's nodding at someone in the hall, or rushing to the bookcase or you think he's wearing a suicide vest, you're on solid ground to kill him, \" he continues. Others noted that the navy seals were moving quickly through dim rooms while under fire: \"they say he was unarmed now, but did the seals know he was unarmed? \" but der spiegel and reuters find many who disagree. Justice is \" not achieved through summary executions, but through a punishment that is meted out at the end of a trial, \" says one international law professor. It's especially problematic that the operation occurred not on an afghan battlefield but in pakistan, a sovereign foreign power. Still, it could have been worse, notes sen. Dianne feinstein: \" they could have sent a predator with hellfire missiles and killed everyone in the place.

A federal lawsuit filed by deanna salas-solano, 58, contends an employee at the drive-thru window didn't secure the lid to the \" unreasonably hot \" 20-ounce tea she ordered in september 2015. The complaint says the cup was so hot it began to burn her hands; tea then spilled onto her lap, melting her clothes and scalding her stomach, legs, and lap. Her dog, alexander, was splashed and burned. He was taken to the vet and died shortly after. With 2 % of her body surface severely burned, salas-solano underwent surgery the following day and needed to get skin grafts. The legal action seeking more than $ 75,000 for injuries, emotional distress, and lost wages notes salas-solano hadn't ordered an \" extra hot \" tea. The barista didn't slip a cardboard sleeve on the hot cup and, contrary to starbucks policy, didn't use a second cup, the suit says. A wall timer marks how fast employees fill orders, per the filing. Starbucks denies the charges, saying a video contradicts the woman's claims. Their legal teams wouldn't provide a copy of it, but kdvr watched it and says it's \" not conclusive \" what happened. The footage shows salas-solano on her cellphone, with her dog on her lap, but the station says it's unclear if she spilled the tea because the cup was hot, she got distracted, or due to a jostle by the dog. Starbucks says in a statement: \" we don't have any reason to believe our partner ( employee ) was at fault. \" ( mcdonald's has been sued more than once over hot coffee. )",

They teach about matters beyond their boundaries, but they do not operate in any meaningful way outside them. Over time, some have evolved to serve \"national communities. \" leading examples include england's eton, india's doon school, america's exeter and china's shanghai high. While these \"national \" schools teach about the larger world and include students from diverse locations, their operations still largely exist in one country and on a single campus. If \"local \" schools are the first step in the evolution of schooling and \"national \" schools are the second step, the decades ahead are likely to bring the third step: global schools. Thirty years from now there will likely be a number of such organizations. Avenues plans to be the best of this new breed of educational institution — hence its subtitle: the world school.

Why is this important to parents and children? every school brochure will say that today's great schools must prepare students for global life. If the 20th century was dominated by american leadership, the 21st century will be, as one chinese leader said, \"a kitchen with many chefs. \" modern students must have more than a passing understanding of other cultures, speak other languages fluently and appreciate other histories.

        "summary": "Robert mueller's russia investigation has a complex new focus: a meeting between trump ally erik prince and a russian businessman that took place in the archipelago nation of seychelles just a few days before president trump's inauguration. The meeting has been previously reported. In fact, prince — founder of the security firm blackwater and brother of education secretary betsy devos — testified to a house panel about it last year. But democrats now think that prince misled them about the meeting's importance, reports cnn. Prince told lawmakers that the meeting came about by chance while he was there on his own business to meet with officials from the united arab emirates. But the washington post reports that the meeting appears to have been arranged in advance as a way to set up a \" back channel \" between the trump white house and the kremlin. The key new player that has emerged in all this is lebanese-american businessman george nader. He set up the meeting between prince and kirill dmitriev and is now cooperating with mueller's investigation, per the post. If that name rings a bell, it's because the new york times just reported on nader, and on how mueller is interested in whether the uae — yes, the nation prince was meeting with on business — tried to \" buy political influence \" with the incoming trump administration. If prince was actually trying to set up a back channel to the kremlin after the election, so what? for one thing, \" it would demolish months ' worth of denials from both him and the white house that he was doing any such thing, \" notes vox. \" and it would raise serious questions about just why, exactly, all parties involved were so set on keeping the seychelles meeting secret. \"",

Doo doo the clown tells the toronto star that he was still in full clown costume sunday afternoon when he spotted an apparently disturbed man jumping on cars and called 911. As doo doo watched, the man shoved one of two women walking toward him and then began to chase them down the street. \" i screamed and screamed like 20 times, ' get in my car, ' \" the clown tells the star. He says that after the women jumped into the backseat — joining two fellow clowns that he had been driving to a train station — \" the guy went crazy, \" kicking and punching the car. He managed to rip off a mirror before police arrived and subdued him. Doo doo, also known as shane farberman, tells cp24 that he didn't realize until later that the women must have found it \" very bizarre \" to have a clown in full make-up screaming at them, though they got in the car without hesitation. \" i've been doing this for 32 years, so i forget that i ' m in costume when i ' m out there in between shows, \" he says. Farberman was joined by his two children at city hall on monday when a councilman presented him with a commendation for bravery, telling him he wasn't \" clowning around \" when courage was called for, the star reports. Cp24 reports that the attacker, a 25-year-old man, has been charged with assault and police believe he was on illegal drugs during the incident. ( the us may soon face a clown shortage, though france still has plenty of evil ones. )",

        "summary": "A glass of red wine a day might indeed keep the doctor away — at least that could be the case for those suffering from type 2 diabetes, according to a new study. It suggests red wine in moderation helps patients manage cholesterol and improves cardiac health. Researchers set out to discover the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on people with well-controlled type 2 diabetes, who generally have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and lower levels of hdl cholesterol, which is good for the heart, reports time. The 224 alcohol-abstaining participants with a low risk for alcohol abuse, aged 40 to 75, were then assigned a beverage — mineral water, dry white wine, or dry red wine — and told to drink 5 ounces with a meal each night for two years; they also followed a mediterranean diet. At the end of the study, there were no major differences in blood pressure and liver function among the three groups, reports medical news today. However, red wine drinkers were the only ones to see decreased cardiometabolic risks. They also saw a significant boost in hdl cholesterol and lower cholesterol overall, while all wine drinkers reported improved sleep, reports cbs news. Though the alcohol appeared to aid glycemic control in white wine drinkers, the differences between the red wine and white wine groups suggest alcohol wasn't responsible for all the benefits. The red wine had seven times higher levels of total phenols than the white wine, and \" it's the phenols, it's the resveratrol, it's the tannins \" in the red wine that effect these benefits, says an expert. Genetic differences also affected glycemic control, meaning certain people are more likely to benefit from drinking wine. ( just watch out for arsenic. )",

Anyway, chanel is under fire from social media and activists after including a $ 1,325 boomerang in its collection of new spring and summer accessories, the bbc reports. Beyond the people pointing out that spending more than $ 1,325 on a boomerang is maybe a stupid thing to do, members and supporters of australia's indigenous community are accusing the luxury brand of cultural appropriation. \" it's simply a misappropriation of aboriginal culture, \" the chief executive of the indigenous arts code says. The boomerang is a cultural artifact of indigenous australians, but indigenous artists have long been undercut by businesses selling cheap knockoff boomerangs made outside australia, mashable reports. \"having a luxury brand swoop in, appropriate, sell our technologies, and profit from our cultures for an absurd amount of money is ridiculous and hurtful, \" activist nayuka gorrie tells the guardian. The indigenous project officer at the australian museum notes the chanel boomerang costs nearly 10 % the average annual income of indigenous australians. Chanel responded to the backlash with a statement: \" chanel is extremely committed to respecting all cultures, and regrets that some may have felt offended. \" along with boomerangs, the company is also selling beach paddles and tennis rackets for thousands of dollars apiece.",

He began by reciting the beginning of the declaration of independence — the \" life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \" bit — and referred to it throughout his speech, calling it america's \" creed \" and \" the star that guides us still. \" and he parlayed its message into a call for unity. \" my fellow americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it, so long as we seize it together, \" he said. Other highlights from the speech, which ran about 19 minutes: \" we are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as everyone else, because she is an american, she is free, and she is equal! \" \" the commitments we make to each other through medicaid and medicare and social security, these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers, they free us to take the risks that make this country great. \" he promised to \" respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. \" \" our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law. For if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. \" according to politico this was the first time a president has ever used the word \" gay \" to refer to sexual orientation in an inaugural address. The \" our journey is not complete \" motif was repeated several times, advocating in turn for equal pay for women, immigration reform, voter rights, and finally, perhaps, a subtle nod to gun control: \" our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of detroit to the hills of appalachia to the quiet lanes of newtown, know that they are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm. \" \" that is our generation's task, to make these works, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every american. \" \" my oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride.

        "summary": "While scientists and doctors have long known that a woman's chances of having a child drop the older she gets, a new study suggests that a man's age can affect a couple's chances as well. According to a new study out of beth israel deaconess medical center and harvard medical school, the incidence of live birth declines significantly as men grow older. The study analyzed 19,000 in-vitro fertilization cycles in 7,753 couples at an ivf center between 2000 and 2014, according to a press release from the european study of human reproduction and embryology. \" declining sperm quality certainly plays some role, but our work shows that this is not the whole picture, \" says the lead researcher. \" we found similar results among couples with no documented male infertility, so something else is happening. \" researchers divided participants into four age groups: under 30, 30-35, 35-40, and 40-42. They found that the younger the man was on average, the better the woman's chances of successful birth. For example, the guardian reports, women under 30 had a 73 % success rate with ivf if their partners were between 30 and 35. Women in that same category whose partners were between 40 and 42 saw that number drop to 46 %. Among women 35 to 40 years old whose partners were between 30 and 35, there was a 54 % chance of live birth. That rose to 70 % in men under 30. The research \" may help women to encourage their male partners to get a move on, \" says an obstetrics professor not involved in the study. \" this reminds us that it takes two to tango and it's not just down to the age of the woman. \" ( older dads make for geekier sons. )",

Now, a new study from the usa in ivf couples shows quite clearly that live birth outcome is clearly affected by the age of the male partner and that in certain younger female age groups, where the effect of age is less potent, the chances of live birth can be appreciably reduced by the man's increasing age. \" our study found an independent effect of male age on the cumulative incidence of live birth, \" said investigator dr laura dodge from beth israel deaconess medical center and harvard medical school, boston, usa.

On tuesday, a jury in franklin county, ohio, awarded the 36-year-old elementary school teacher $ 1,580,000 in compensatory damages and $ 20 million in punitive damages, the columbus dispatch reports. State laws capping such awards may cut the amount by up to 90 %, but kershaw, who has now divorced jerry bailey, says the message the victory sends is the important part. \" it's brought back a lot of dark times that i tried to grow away from, \" she says. \" but i really believe that it's going to be healing for me, and this is for all women who have been abused in some way. \" bailey — who was fined $ 100 after being found guilty of misdemeanor domestic violence in the 2013 attack on his wife — had tried to stop the lawsuit, arguing in legal papers that it was \" a complaint of conduct and claims arising out of the marital relationship. \" a judge disagreed last fall and allowed the rare spouse-on-spouse civil lawsuit to proceed separately from divorce proceedings. Kershaw's lawyer tells the washington post that \" attitudes are still behind the times, which i think is why we really haven't seen a case like this. \" he tells the dispatch that he hopes the court victory will send the message that it is \" not ok for people to commit domestic violence.

The tax-exempt chamber is a major player in us politics, but not required to disclose the identities of its donors. Ag eric schneiderman yesterday issued a subpoena to officials of a foundation affiliated with the chamber, seeking emails and bank records to determine if the foundation illegally funneled $ 18 million to the chamber for political and lobbying activities, sources tell the new york times. Investigators are examining grants totaling $ 19 million from the philanthropic starr foundation — which is based in new york and headed by the former ceo of aig — to the chamber's national chamber foundation, which loaned the chamber of commerce $ 18 million during the same period of time. Though the money was supposed to be used for a \" capital campaign, \" watchdog groups say the funds financed lobbying for \"tort reform \" legislation in congress and to run largely anti-democrat issue ads in the 2004 presidential and congressional campaigns. The $ 18 million loan was interest free, and no principal was paid on it for several years, say sources. The us chamber of commerce spent $ 66 million on lobbying last year, and plans to spend at least $ 50 million on issue ads this year. Now that limits have largely been lifted on campaign contributions, many major donors are currently intent on keeping their identities secret — and using tax-exempt \" fronts \" for their donations is one way to accomplish this, points out the kansas city star. Keeping donor identities hidden is the \" next frontier \" for conservatives, said columbia university election law professor richard briffault.",

He focused on europe's struggles with immigration and youth unemployment. Among the highlights: \" we cannot allow the mediterranean to become a vast cemetery, \" he says of immigrants who have died trying to reach european shores — including over 3,000 who didn't survive journeys to italy in old boats. \" the great ideas which once inspired europe seem to have lost their attraction, only to be replaced by the bureaucratic technicalities of its institutions, \" he says. Yet he also warned of capitalism, saying that \" men and women risk being reduced to mere cogs in a machine that treats them as items of consumption to be exploited. \" his solution for rampant youth unemployment: \" the time has come to promote policies that create employment \" by \"joining market flexibility with the need for stability and security \" for employees. The visit was only francis'second inside of europe ( the muslim-majority nation of albania was first ) and marked his shortest trip abroad at barely four hours. Strasbourg residents were able to see his talk on a big screen in the city's cathedral, but not all were thrilled with the arrangement: \" he knows what he is doing but we would have liked him to be here, \" says a worshipper.",

            "Polish military experts planning to examine the site where a nazi \" gold train \" may have gone missing during world war ii have urged authorities to first clear the thickly forested area in case it contains booby traps or volatile weapons. New theories that the train may contain dangerous cargo have surfaced in recent days as the wooded foothills of the owl mountains have become the center of fevered attention for history buffs, treasure hunters and tourism promoters. Authorities in the lower silesia region have warned from the outset of the purported discovery of the legendary treasure train that if it does exist, it may have been fixed with explosives or mounted guns to protect its cargo. The british tabloid newspaper daily mail added to the fears of what might be discovered in the excavation when it published an article tuesday quoting unidentified sources familiar with the recent find as speculating that the train might have been carrying the bodies",

        "summary": "Wall street was in full panic mode today, as a drastic sell-off saw the dow off nearly 1,000 points just one hour before the close, marketwatch reports. A quick rebound followed, however, to less severe numbers. The dow finished down 348 points at 10,520; nasdaq fell 83 points to 2,320; and the s&p fell 38 to 1,128. For many traders, the chaotic freefall recalled the worst days of trading in 2008, when the wounds of the financial crisis were still fresh. This time, however, the us economy seemed not to play a major role. Instead, fears of the financial state of europe, driven by greece's continuing debt problems, drove investors out of stocks and risky bonds and into safe bets like treasuries and gold, notes the wall street journal. The sell-off was exacerbated by software at trading firms that automatically sells to stem losses if the indices fall below certain points. Despite the semi-automatic nature of the stock rout, the nyse stressed that no errors in its system played a role in the crazy plunge.",

        "summary": "With pollution levels in pockets of india and china reaching deadly levels, innovators around the world are designing and engineering ways to fight the war on smog. One device, a 23-foot-tall wind-powered air purifier called the smog free tower, sucks in air from its surroundings and filters out tiny pollution particles that might otherwise find a home in our lungs. Designed by dutch artist daan roosegaarde in 2015, it was installed in beijing in 2016 and found to be not all that helpful in a test conducted by the china forum of environmental journalists. But a scientist has conducted new tests on the tower, now installed in a field in tianjin, and says that it actually outperforms previous findings, capturing up to 70 % of pm10 and 25 % of pm2.5 ( two pollution particles ), reports fast company. Roosegaarde says that while the tower only has a limited impact on the air 65 feet around it ( when filtered air is combined with surrounding air, the effect is air containing 45 % less pm10, per the new test ), the smog-fighting tower could still provide relief and become part of a longer-term solution. Under the larger smog free project, he's also designing bicycles that spit out positively charged ions that capture pollutants, reports digital trends. Roosegaarde says his team is building a prototype and hopes to develop a partnership between the netherlands and china to install the bikes into local bike-sharing programs such as mobike. ( california is home to eight of the 10 us cities with the worst air pollution. )",

        "summary": "Bad news for honda cr-v owners: gas may be leaking into your vehicle's oil supply, which can cause engine performance issues and stalling, according to consumer reports. The magazine started looking into the issue after nine of its members reported problems — which affects 2017 and 2018 crvs with the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine — discovering that dozens of more complaints about the suv had been made to the national highway traffic safety administration and hundreds more on online forums. A honda rep says the company is \" investigating the situation and developing a remedy, \" which it \" hopes \" will be available by mid-november. Once the repair is ready, it will be covered by the warranty. The engine issue is most prevalent in cold-weather areas and during short trips and low-speed driving. Honda, which doesn't consider it to be a safety issue so won't issue a recall, hasn't said how many vehicles may be affected. The company's spokesman told cr that the \" condition is not as widespread as some internet chatter may imply. \" nonetheless, says the magazine's jake fisher, \" it does happen, and when it happens, it should be addressed. \" this year, honda has recalled hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including cr-vs, in china due to a similar issue, reuters reports. The cr-v is one of the best-selling suvs, per forbes, with some 30,000 per month being sold in the us. If you're experiencing engine problems with your cr-v, contact the nhtsa at 888-327-4236 or safecar.gov, and contact honda at 800-999-1009.",

That means honda sells 1,000 cr-v's every day. At an average sticker price of around $ 28,000, with a few options added on, that translates to $ 28 million earned by honda every day of the year, from just one model. If we do the math, this means the cr-v's annual sales clear $ 10 billion! together with the accord and civic, which both sell in similar numbers, the cr-v is one of honda's bread and butter models and therefore matters. So an all-new model is a big thing for honda.

In contrast with other common tests ( colonoscopies, mris ) there are no pain or risks involved. And the once-pricey machines have, over the past several decades, become much less expensive. Modern healthcare in october put the average cost of a cardiac ultrasound machine at $ 140,000, which it sees fueling their popularity in doctors ' offices and clinics \" that still get the majority of their reimbursement from fee-for-service medicine. \" but as one tokyo doctor with ties to university of pennsylvania's business school puts it, \" one of the things about the us health care system is that it defies the laws of economics, and of gravity. Once the price is high, it just stays there. \" to wit, the test now costs $ 50 to $ 88 in japan, which sets the allowable prices. But one new jersey 76-year-old tells the times that his two recent scans ( one done near his home, one in boston ) cost $ 5,500 and $ 1,400, respectively. Medicare has tried to keep costs down by setting the payment for echocardiograms performed in doctors ' offices at just $ 92. As a result, more scans are happening in outpatient hospital settings, where the allowable medicare fee is higher.

        "summary": "Despite years of political instability in thailand, one thing has remained constant in the country's government for more than 70 years: the monarchy, led by beloved king bhumibol adulyadej. The king's visage adorns thailand's money, posters of him hang everywhere, and a tribute to him plays before every movie shown in theaters. But the king has been in poor health for a long time, and now he has failed to stabilize after a medical procedure on saturday, npr reports. The 88-year-old's kidneys are reportedly not functioning properly, the ap reports. The issue of succession is a tricky one, as the crown prince isn't as well respected as his father. Thailand's royalty is protected by very stringent anti-defamation laws, which make it illegal to speak ill of the king or the royal family. This generally hasn't been an issue, as the current king is well-loved and has been around as long as most people can remember. But the looming specter of a transition has clearly spooked the country, as the thai stock market dropped nearly 3 % on monday, and the thai baht also fell to a 2-month low against the us dollar, according to sky news.",

Most notably: the terrorists appear to have caught on. Aware that the nsa geolocates cell phones, militants will now carry extra sim cards, or worse, pass cell phones to civilians, says the drone pilot, who's a joint special operations command member. He says he's participated in strikes where the target's phone was found, but someone else was killed. \" people get hung up that there's a targeted list of people, \" he says. \" it's really like we're targeting a cellphone. \" but greenwald does describe him as \" adamant \" that the tactic has eliminated actual terrorists. Greenwald is largely being touted as the face of first look media, a new venture from ebay mogul pierre omidyar, a strategy that the daily beast worries could prove problematic given greenwald's aggressive style. In announcing the intercept, first look made clear that the greenwald vehicle would be \" the first of what will eventually be a family of digital magazines. \"",

The stats and polling analysis website, which tweeted it will have more on the site about its election predictions later wednesday, places clinton with a 79 % chance of winning the presidency in november, while trump can only claim a 20 % chance. \" we're kind of at halftime of the election right now, and she's taking a seven-point, maybe a 10-point lead, \" silver told stephanopoulos. \" there's a lot of football left to be played, but she's ahead in almost every poll, every swing state, every national poll. \" silver noted that no candidate has thrown away a lead as large as the one clinton currently enjoys since michael dukakis in 1988, though he also acknowledged \" it's been a crazy year, politically. \" and that lead, per a recent ballotpedia poll of seven swing states, shows clinton beating trump in all seven, with her lead ranging from 4 to 17 percentage points. Interestingly, when similarly matched up against ohio gov. John kasich and house speaker paul ryan, clinton didn't do as well, with kasich beating her in five states and ryan pulling ahead in three. Silver — who shot to fame after correctly calling all 50 states in the 2012 election — has faced criticism, along with many others, for initially downplaying trump's chances at even becoming the gop nominee ( he gave trump a 2 % chance in august ), though he's since admitted he \" acted like a pundit and screwed up. \" but he told stephanopoulos his first impression \" wasn't based on looking at polls \" and \" one big lesson of [ trump's ] campaign is don't try and out-think the polls and try and out-think the american public. \" \" he did a great job of appealing to the 40 % of the gop he had to win … the primary, \" silver added. \" a lot different than winning 51 % of 100 %. \" ( last year silver said polls were in bad shape. )",

Sloan claims shatner actually admitted to being his father in 1984 during a meeting on the set of tj hooker, tmz reports. Shatner denies it, and sloan has no proof the meeting ever happened. In 2011, sloan started using the name peter shatner online and for a radio show he hosts, leading to allegations from shatner's camp — which points out that \" many people over the years … have claimed to be his children \" — that sloan is just after some easy fame and money, according to the new york post. But sloan says it's not about the money, he just wants to bond with his dad. \"i am william shatner's son, and i just wish he would acknowledge me, \" he tells the post.

The deal settles the two largest lawsuits uber faced, thought it still faces similar suits in several other states, including arizona and florida. In a concession touted by the plaintiffs, uber will allow drivers to put signs in their cars saying \" tips are not included \" in the price of a ride and would be appreciated. \" by uber making clear to riders that tips are not included, we believe that many riders will now tip their uber drivers because riders have been under the impression from uber's prior communications that tips are included in the fares, \" says an attorney for the plaintiffs, per re/code. Uber also agreed to improve its systems for communicating with drivers about their ratings and why they're terminated, to allow arbitration in disputes with drivers, and to help start drivers associations in both states. Uber ceo travis kalanick said in a blog post that \" we haven't always done a good job working with drivers, \" especially on the issues of deactivation and appeal. Classifying its workers as employees could have increased uber's operating expenses significantly and would go against its business model and identity.",

The ss city of cairo was carrying 100 tons of silver rupees from india in november 1942 when it was hit by a torpedo from a german u-boat and sank nearly 17,000 feet to the bottom of the atlantic, reports cnn. Underwater recovery company deep ocean search, working under a contract from the british government, brought up coins worth millions from the record-breaking depth. The 100 tons would be worth about $ 50 million today, and the salvage team's leader tells the bbc a \" large percentage \" of the coins were reclaimed. The haul, recovered in 2013 but only disclosed now, was melted and sold, with the proceeds split between the company and britain's treasury. The wreck, which sits more than 4,000 feet deeper than the titanic, is also the grave of six people who died in the sinking. The u-boat captain waited 20 minutes before firing a second torpedo, giving around 300 passengers and crew time to board lifeboats. But 104 survivors died in the weeks before the lifeboats were spotted, the telegraph reports, with one lifeboat ending up off south america after 51 days; only two people aboard it were still alive. After the ship went down, the german captain told people in the lifeboats, \" goodnight, sorry for sinking you. \" before salvage divers left the wreck for the final time, they left a plaque in memory of the dead reading, \" we came here with respect, \" reports the bbc.

Rocky allen, 28, accused of stealing fentanyl citrate in january from swedish medical center and switching the fentanyl-filled syringe with others, was indicted by a federal grand jury in february, and up to 3,000 patients have been offered free testing for hiv and two forms of hepatitis, cbs denver reports. \" everyone is scared as hell, \" james avery, a lawyer representing ex-patients at hospitals in four states where allen had worked, tells the post. A statement wednesday from colorado's health department said 1,000 or so of the possibly affected patients hadn't completed testing, but it said there was no evidence so far of disease transmission. Avery, however, tells cbs two of his clients have tested positive for hepatitis b ( allen tested negative for hepatitis b and c ). Allen had a spotty record before swedish: he'd reportedly been fired from four other hospitals and court-martialed in 2011 for swiping fentanyl while in the navy ( his public defender tells the new york daily news allen suffers from ptsd and started using drugs in afghanistan ). \" how could these people not know that he was a problem? \" the dad of a former teen patient tells cbs. The hospital itself was found in april by state health officials to have been lacking in its drug auditing procedures. Hospitals where allen previously worked in arizona, california, and washington are also offering testing to patients. Allen has pleaded not guilty to charges including tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by deceit; if convicted after the trial cnn says is set for august, he may see up to 14 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 500,000.

        "summary": "A new paper says dozens — and by one account about four thousand — us mines exploded during the vietnam war for a pretty strange reason, atlas obscura reports. Published in space weather, the paper concludes that a 1972 solar storm triggered the mines: \" i was completely taken aback \" by the solar event's power, says co-author delores knipp. She and her team found declassified us navy documents that blamed powerful solar activity for the detonations off the coast of north vietnam near hai phong port, per popular mechanics. They also dug up little-known scientific reports around the world saying power grids were affected, satellites damaged, and air force sensors fooled into turning on as if a nuclear bomb had gone off, per scientific american. Four solar flares erupted in early august 1972, the third being a coronal mass ejection — a huge emission of radiation particles and high-energy plasma hurling electromagnetic pulses into space. In a quick 15 hours the pulses slammed into earth and set off the mines, which were built to detect magnetic fields from passing ships, per a press release. On the upside, it inspired the navy to make mines more resistant to solar flares. Today it reminds us to guard earth's infrastructure against such storms, which knipp says occur about every 70 years. The worst on record was the carrington event of 1859: \" it's our poster child of storms, \" says knipp. \" if a storm that bad were to appear again, then we would really have a lot of problems. \" ( a 2012 solar blast nearly sent earth to the stone age. )",

The development comes after us intelligence suggested that the plane got shot down with a russian-supplied missile system fired from rebel territory. \" the government of ukraine officially states that the terrorists, with the help of russia, are trying to destroy evidence of international crimes, \" says the ukraine statement, as per the guardian.

But after the city immediately found dead rats in 80 % of burrows where dry ice was used — according to cbs boston — the method spread to new york city and then chicago. Experts say the dry ice method is more humane than traditional rat poison, cbs chicago reports. It also leaves the dead rats to decompose out of sight underground. Besides being cheaper than traditional rat poison — chicago is getting its dry ice for 50 cents per pound — its use doesn't pose any threat to humans or other animals in city parks. \" i am glad they are trying something new that's not toxic, \" a photographer who watched a hawk die after it ate rat poison tells the new york daily news.

        "summary": "In about 10 seconds, the words \" why, \" \" how, \" and \" no \" are going to escape from your lips, and we apologize in advance for that. But those are likely the same words that researchers for sca, a swedish global hygiene company, uttered as they compiled results from their 2014 \" hygiene matters \" survey, which asked 13,000 people from 13 countries ( including 1,058 people from the us ) about their bathroom habits at work. Some of the findings, according to the sca press release: a good number need their communications fix in the can: 25 % of americans head to the stalls to text, while a slightly lower number ( 23 % ) go to make a phone call. Some of the more furtive bathroom activities revealed in the survey include smoking ( 5 % ) and sleeping ( 5 %, with more men than women admitting to restroom naptime ). We do have to give a slow clap to the 7 % who manage to exercise in the restroom. And, somehow, eating ( 8 % ) also found its way onto the list. \" the workplace restroom is a personal sanctuary and safe place, \" as sca puts it, which led to 10 % of respondents copping to a good cry there ( 6 % of men, 14 % of women ); 23 % of women head there to \" deal with the frustration of everyday work life \" ( compared to 17 % of men ), while more of the guys ( 21 % ) \" [ use ] the space to spend a moment alone or get space from colleagues \" ( only 18 % of the women do ). Our initial repulsion to eating in the lavatory may be derived from the fact that the survey found 10 % of americans only \" sometimes \" wash their hands after taking care of business; 1 % say they never do. More than 40 % of the us respondents also say they don't clean their hands at all after getting to work. The good, not-nearly-as-disturbing news: the us leads all countries surveyed in general satisfaction with workplace washrooms ( 87 % approve ), with 13 % claiming they'd rather use their employer's bathroom than the one they have at home. China, italy, and russia are apparently the least thrilled with their bathroom conditions at work. Hope employees at this company can complete their bathroom workout in six minutes or less!",

        "summary": "After farmers feeding raw and rotting meat to pigs caused a massive outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001, the european union banned the use of swill — or human food waste — for feeding pigs, modern farmer reports. This has turned out to be a bad decision for both the environment and the pigs themselves, according to a university of cambridge study published in food policy. A press release on the study states the eu produces 21.5 million tons of pork every year. Since farmers are no longer feeding swill to their pigs, their food has to be grown somewhere — and that somewhere is increasingly the amazon rainforest. The study estimates returning pigs to a swill-based diet would save 1.8 million hectares of land — 250,000 of them in the amazon. Furthermore, the study found a return to swill would be a boon to the eu pork industry by cutting the land necessary to raise pigs by more than 21 % and the cost of feeding them by 50 %. And — surprisingly — swill is a more natural diet for pigs than the soybeans and grains they're getting now, modern farmer notes. \" pigs are omnivorous animals, \" the study's lead researcher says in the press release. \" in the wild they would eat anything they could forage for, from vegetable matter to other animal carcasses, and they have been fed food waste since they were domesticated by humans 10,000 years ago. \" the study advocates for the eu to follow the lead of east asian countries, which heat swill until it's safe for pigs to eat. That would also solve the problem of what to do with the human food waste currently piling up. ( this woman faces jail because she gave water to thirsty pigs. )",

Food wastes have a long history as a source of environmentally benign animal feed, but their inclusion in feed is currently banned in the eu because of disease control concerns. A number of east asian states have in the last 20 years, however, introduced regulated, centralised systems for safely recycling food wastes into animal feed.

Even small amounts of the chemical distorts olfactory signals and blocks the usual wine scents from reaching the brain, reports science. Unfortunately, the brain is left with what it interprets as a musty odor, for reasons that are still unclear. \" it's quite an elegant piece of research, \" one scientist not affiliated with the study ( on both newts and humans ) tells australia's abc news. \" it just shows how complex the olfactory system is. \" the discovery could have odor-blocking applications for the cosmetics and hospital industries.

            "News in science corked wine confuses smell receptors mixed signals rather than having an intrinsically bad odour, the chemical that makes wine smell ' corked ' is preventing normal smell signals from reaching the brain, finds a japanese study. The discovery, made in newts, also fits with smell tests done on human volunteers, according to a report in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. The effect of tca ( 2,4,6-tricholoroanisole ), the chemical culprit in corking, on smell receptors was being investigated by dr hiroko takeuchi and professor takashi kurahashi and colleagues of osaka university, japan.

        "summary": "A surge of optimism followed by something more grim: the seven brief satellite calls made saturday that were suspected to have been made by a missing argentine submarine may have originated elsewhere. The argentine navy on sunday said its analysis was still underway but that it had no \" clear evidence \" the calls were placed from the sub, reports the new york times, which notes the san juan missed its scheduled arrival at its home port sunday. A naval commander says the signals were so \" intermittent and weak, \" per nbc news, that \" they could not help determine a point on the map to help the search \" for the vessel, which has 44 aboard. Further, the us satellite phone company iridium says the iridium phone that's within the vessel seems to have not been used since wednesday. Iridium has reportedly placed repeated calls to the sub's phone that haven't gotten through; argentine officials haven't discussed whether additional satellite phones are available to the crew. And while seven countries are involved in the search via sea and air, that effort has been impeded by weather: waves hitting up to 22 feet, thunderstorms, and strong winds that npr reports could last for two days. The times looks at potential scenarios: if the sub sank due to, say, a fire that did not kill the crew, it says the oxygen would last \" several \" days; cnn reports a higher count of seven to 10 days of oxygen. That's assuming it sank on the continental shelf; if it went down in the far deeper parts of the atlantic ocean, the pressure could essentially crush the sub. If it's on the surface and manages to survive the storm, the crew would have 25 days of food and water.",

        "summary": "Long before osama bin laden was america's most reviled terrorist, he was the quiet boy of a rich saudi family, \" a gentle, enthusiastic young man of few words who didn't raise his voice while talking, \" according to a former saudi intelligence chief. Born in 1954, bin laden was one of 54 children and grew up in mansions littered with crystal chandeliers, gold statues, and italian tapestries, reports the la times. As a 10-year-old, he reportedly inherited $ 300 million after his father died in a plane crash. Bin laden was a tireless reader of islamic literature whose path to militant islam began as a teen in the 1970s, when he got caught up in the fundamentalist movement then sweeping saudi arabia, reports the ap. He began to grow more radical in the next decade, after joining the afghan war against the soviets, where he was able to use his family's money to help the mujahedeen fighters. But what ap calls the \" seminal moment \" happened in 1990, when us troops landed in saudi arabia to drive iraqi forces out of the tiny, oil-rich country of kuwait. When bin laden criticized riyadh's close alliance with washington — bin laden had offered to pull together an army of afghan war vets to protect saudi arabia, an offer that was refused by the royal family — he was stripped of his saudi citizenship in 1994. The intelligence chief then describes \" radical changes in his personality, \" from a \" gentle man interested in helping muslims into a person who believed that he would be able to amass and command an army to liberate kuwait. \" things escalated from there; click for more.",

The former reporter and editor for abc news, cnnmoney, the new york post, and many others died friday from prostate cancer at the age of 66. But before he did, he took the opportunity to write his own obituary, which he opens by letting everyone know he's \" glad to be done with the damn disease. \" mooney also expressed an unexpected desire for a man looking back on his life: wishing he had worked more. \" i wish i had done more work as a news reporter, \" he writes. \" written better stories. Made more and better contacts. Skipped some of the easier pieces and done more in-depth stories. Spent more time on foreign stories. Been a better editor. \" he says he loved the job and the people he met doing it, including his wife ( \" i regret i won't be there to comfort her as she did me in those final foggy hours \" ). He got to have an audience and a byline. And with his final blog post, he got both one last time. Mooney's closing message: \" in lieu of flowers, donate to a favorite cause. Mine was doctors without borders. Or just buy a round. \"",
