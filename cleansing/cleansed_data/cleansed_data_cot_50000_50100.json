' continuing to advance a narrative of moral equivalency between racists and those opposed to racism, so as not to tick off his white supremacist supporters, \" naacp official sherrilyn ifill tweeted. Richard cohen, head of the south poverty law center, said white people think \" they're the ones being targeted for racism and a lot of these people are trump supporters so when the president makes a comment like this with ' all types ' it's hard not to be suspicious. \" meanwhile, white nationalist jason kessler — who organized last year's charlottesville demonstration — was refused a permit there this year but has been allowed to hold a rally sunday across the street from the white house, reuters reports.",

The des moines register reports that the bush campaign has canceled $ 3 million in tv ads in iowa and south carolina and is using the money to send dozens of staffers to those states and to new hampshire and nevada to contact voters directly. Sources tell politico that campaign manager danny diaz told dozens of campaign workers in florida that \" damn near everybody \" — including himself — would soon be leaving for early-voting states. Bush was at a campaign event in south carolina on wednesday night, and cnn reports that he downplayed the strategy change. \" we have a super pac that is advertising on television at a rate that is comparable to any other campaign, if not more, \" he said. \" and we are reallocating our resources to voter contact and a ground game that will be second to none. It already is. Having the best organization on the ground is how you win. \" bush's chief strategist tells the register that far from giving up in iowa, the candidate will now have \" the largest paid ground operation in the first four states \" — and will have more to spend on tv alternatives like digital ads and ads on conservative radio shows. The register notes that since the pro-bush super pac right to rise has booked $ 3.9 million in ads in iowa alone, iowans will still be seeing plenty of jeb ads.",

The move will double the staffer presence in new hampshire to more than 40. The dramatic spending shift comes as bush redoubles his efforts in new hampshire, where the former florida governor is locked in a battle with other establishment favorites for top billing in a state that traditionally favors moderate candidates.

So the aurora shooter in colorado gets checked, and is cleared. The tucson shooter gets checked and gets cleared. Aaron alexis goes through the federal and state check and gets cleared. \" elsewhere on the sunday dial, also as per politico: joe manchin on whether he would renew his failed gun control effort: \" not unless there's a movement. I ' m not gonna go out there and just beat the drum for the sake of beating the drum. There has to be people willing to move off the position they've taken. \" henry kissenger on syria: \" there could be quite a good outcome because if we get the chemical weapons, it then becomes a basis for a transition in syria that leads to relative peace. Then at the end of the day, however tortuously we arrived at this conclusion, it will have served the interest of the world. \" nancy pelosi on gop demands for spending cuts: \" the cupboard is bare. There's no more cuts to make. We all want to reduce the deficit. Put everything on the table, review it, but you cannot have any more cuts just for the sake of cuts. Right now you're taking trophies. \" claire mccaskill on a potential government shutdown: \" i don't think in america we should throw tantrums when we lose elections and threaten to shut down the government and refuse to pay the bills.

Live science reports the 49-year-old woman went to the er with shortness of breath and chest pains that worsened when she would lie down. Doctors thought she was just having a panic attack and sent her home. But her symptoms continued, and she went to a different er a week later. This time doctors found fluid around her heart and a defect on the wall of her aorta. They admitted her for treatment. The fluid around her heart had to be drained every few days because it kept building up, and the defect on her aorta appeared to be growing. Doctors decided to operate on the woman and discovered a \" black, sharp object \" that \" appeared to be a quill \" stuck in her aorta. Tests confirmed it was a porcupine quill. That's when the woman revealed her dog had a run-in with a porcupine a few weeks before her symptoms started. She must have accidentally eaten one of the quills while removing them from her dog. The quill then poked through her esophagus and into her aorta. \" sharp foreign body ingestion is extremely rare but poses devastating complications and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with otherwise unexplained chest pain, \" a report published recently in the journal of the american academy of physician assistants concluded.",

Commissioner kevin mcaleenan said the referrals were suspended after president trump issued an executive order last week halting the practice of separating families that cross the border illegally. The trump administration's zero tolerance policy, in which anyone who crosses the border illegally is prosecuted, is still in effect, but mcaleenan said parents can't currently be prosecuted since they can no longer be separated from their children. He said he is working on a plan to resume referrals of parents. After his comments, white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders quickly reiterated the halting of referrals for prosecution is only temporary, the ap reports. She also spoke at the press briefing about the executive order, noting that it \" will only last a short amount of time because we ' ll run out of space, we're going to run out of resources in order to keep people together, \" cnn reports. She said the administration is calling on congress to change immigration laws and has asked the pentagon to provide space for families who cross the border without documentation. Meanwhile, trump on monday called for ending due process for those who cross the border illegally, politico reports. He said the us should implement a \" nice, simple system \" in which anyone in the country illegally is sent back over the border without appearing before a judge; at the press briefing, sanders defended that idea: \" virtually all americans agree that it makes no sense that an illegal alien sets one foot on american soil and then they would go through a three- to five-year judicial process to be removed from the country.... Just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean you aren't receiving due process. \"",

        "summary": "In the new atlantic cover story, one of the nation's most prominent black voices provides a lengthy assessment of the nation's first black president. The 17,000-word piece by ta-nehisi coates makes clear that coates considers obama a man worthy of high esteem. After noting that obama's rise to national prominence began with his 2004 speech at the democratic national convention, coates writes: \" over the next 12 years, i came to regard obama as a skilled politician, a deeply moral human being, and one of the greatest presidents in american history. \" he adds that obama was \" the most agile interpreter and navigator of the color line i had ever seen, \" able to connect to black people while not alienating white people. That was due in part to his own upbringing with a kansas-born white mother. Obama recalls that in the 2008 race, he gave himself maybe a 25 % chance of winning — but he never doubted his ability to win over white voters. Why? \" obama was able to offer white america... Something very few african americans could — trust, \" writes coates. But he adds that obama had something of a blind spot here as well. As he tells npr, he thinks the president \" deeply underestimated the force of white supremacy in american life. \" in the atlantic piece, he takes issue with obama's \" overriding trust in color-blind policy and his embrace of ' personal responsibility ' rhetoric when speaking to african-americans, \" which coates views as insensitive to the realities of many black youth. But the overall tone is deep respect for what obama was able to accomplish despite overt obstructionism. His \" victories in 2008 and 2012 were dismissed by some of his critics as merely symbolic for african americans, \" writes coates. \" but there is nothing ' mere ' about symbols. \" click to read the full piece.",

            "\"they're a rotten crowd, \" i shouted across the lawn. \"you're worth the whole damn bunch put together. \" — f. Scott fitzgerald, the great gatsby i. \"love will make you do wrong \" in the waning days of president barack obama's administration, he and his wife, michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late october, friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the democratic presidential nominee, hillary clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of virginia and pennsylvania showed clinton with solid advantages. The formidable gop strongholds of georgia and texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in orlando on october 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers — the gap band's \"outstanding \" — was older than she was. \"this is classic! \" he said. Then he flashed the smile that had launched america's first",

Some 43,000 candidates are running for more than 17,500 seats, al-jazeera reports. Meanwhile, clashes between protesters and government forces continue: one reporter saw \" tens of tanks mounted with machine guns \" open fire yesterday in an attempt to end a general strike planned by the opposition. At least 31 people, including five soldiers, were reported killed. Government forces also reportedly burned down at least 178 stores to get revenge on those who shut down their shops in observance of the strike, which is \" part of our desperate action to get the attention of the international community to look at us, \" said an activist. The opposition hopes to keep the strike in force until the regime pulls the army out of cities and releases thousands of detainees, and ap reports that it is apparently being widely observed in certain areas, with most shops and schools closed today in the city of homs and parts of the southern province of daraa. But the violence continues, with at least five killed in northern syria today, activists tell haaretz.",

The livers, ovaries, and skin of the fugu, or blowfish, contain tetrodotoxin, a nerve poison that authorities say can cause a \" rapid and violent \" death after a single bite, reports the bbc. Incorrectly prepared fugu kills several people in japan every year. Regional heath officials say the supermarket sold five packages of assorted fugu meat, all of which could have been contaminated by the liver, the ap reports. Asahi shimbun reports that after the emergency broadcast, which urged citizens who had bought the packages to return them to the super tatsuya supermarket, all five packages were accounted for. Four were returned unopened and the supermarket president says it was contacted by a fifth person who had consumed the fugu but had suffered no ill effects. \" i ' m very sorry, \" says the supermarket president, who has promised not to sell fugu again.

Her client was a father charged with eight counts of incestuous rape that allegedly occurred over a six-year period; he \" had absolutely no real defense other than ' i did not do it. ' \" his daughter, on the other hand, had given a \" compelling interview \" to police, explaining in detail what had allegedly occurred. There was just one thing that nagged at mcculloch: \" the use of certain words, phrases, and descriptions of how she felt which seemed beyond her years. \" then her client mentioned his daughter's favorite book ( which he was unfamiliar with ): fifty shades of grey. An instructing solicitor on the case who also had not previously read it picked up a copy and uncovered \" too many striking similarities \" between the girl's statement and the novel. In all, the team discovered 17 examples that \" appeared to have been lifted from the book, \" per a more technical description of the case. Mcculloch analyzed the passages and the girl's interview as part of her cross-examination preparations. On the trial's third day, the girl took the stand, and mcculloch began \" gently. \" just seven minutes later — during which mcculloch brought up those striking similarities — \" we were finished. \" the girl admitted she had made up the allegations to teach her \" strict \" father a lesson. The prosecutor re-examined the girl and she confirmed that it had all been a lie. An immediate acquittal followed. ( this fifty shades \" re-enactment \" landed a student in jail. )",

The 642-foot-long vessel was halved earlier this month so that a new 49-foot-long segment can be added, usa today reports. The new and improved version of the ship will feature more restaurants and cabins, a larger pool area, and upgraded spa, fitness, and entertainment areas. \" a rarely performed feat of maritime architecture, this type of lengthening has never before been employed for the extension of a luxury cruise ship, \" says silversea in a press release. More than 500 workers will be involved in the process, which is happening at an italy shipyard and expected to take 450,000 worker hours and use 846 tons of steel, 360,892 feet of cabling, and 26,247 feet of piping. It will also cost $ 100 million, travel + leisure reports — a lot less than the $ 1 billion or more an entirely new ship can cost. Wexas travel reports that 10 decks had to be cut through before the ship's two halves could be pulled apart to make room for the new section. The spirit, which will have a 12 % expanded passenger capacity after the renovation, will sail its first post-expansion cruise out of italy starting may 6.

Just weeks after boston university researchers announced ccl11 proteins in the brain could indicate cte in living patients, researchers in chicago say they identified cte in a retired nfl player before he died by detecting different proteins. Initially, they performed brain exams on 14 former nfl players in 2012 while all were living. Over damaged neural cells, they found clumps of tau proteins — which are believed to kill brain cells, per abc news — with a \" specific topographic signature \" doctors believed indicated a cte finding, lead author bennet omalu tells cnn. Their suspicion was confirmed when former minnesota vikings linebacker fred mcneill, who played football for 22 years but suffered only one reported concussion, died in 2015, allowing doctors to formally diagnose cte during an autopsy, reports the chicago tribune. Mcneill's wife later told researchers he'd started having trouble with simple motor skills two years after his brain was initially scanned. He was soon unable to feed himself and suffered from als, slurred speech, progressive dysphagia, and other health issues at his time of death, researchers write in the neurosurgery journal. Though more work is needed to confirm the link between tau proteins and cte, omalu is optimistic and hopes a commercial test for cte might be available in \" less than five years. \" ( here's what aaron hernandez's brain revealed. )",

But in his business dealings — which involved such diverse fields as real estate, credit card services, and water pumps — the candidate seemed to benefit from his father's political power and worked with people who turned out to be criminals, the washington post reports. Bush's business outlook in his early years was \" a little bit of damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead, \" says a professor who wrote about him. \" his judgment on who to associate with is lacking. \" unlike his father and brother george, who each made fortunes as young men, jeb jumped from one business venture to another, at times with unsavory characters. When jeb's dad was vice-president, jeb lobbied the federal government for the owner of a miami health-maintenance organization who was later charged with $ 200 million in medicare fraud and fled the us. In another case, jeb pitched water pumps in nigeria for a florida company while bush sr. Was president; the company was later found guilty of falsifying claims that cost the us government $ 7.5 million in damages. In all, five of jeb's associates have been convicted. \" at the time, i didn't feel i was doing business with a crook, \" he told the miami herald after the medicare case. \" unfortunately, i didn't give it a whole lot of thought. \" today, his camp says a few dubious characters took advantage of jeb's naiveté, but \" he has always operated with the highest level of integrity throughout his business career. \" read more at the post.",

        "summary": "It's common knowledge that a healthy person shouldn't sit around all day, but new research on running is emphasizing the opposite danger. Running too much can be just as bad for you as being sedentary, the study suggests. Researchers tracked some 1,100 healthy runners and 413 sedentary folks over a period of more than 12 years, healthday reports via medical xpress. People ranged in age from 20 to 95. The risk of dying during the study turned out to be approximately the same among heavy runners — those who ran quickly more than three days a week for a total of more than four hours — and sedentary people who rarely exercised, time reports. The best plan, according to the study, was to run lightly: the group that had the best results ran at a slow-ish pace ( about 5mph ) less than three times each week, going for an hour to 2.4 hours total. Even a group that ran a bit more often and longer saw a slight increase in death risk, time notes. The findings could perhaps relate to cardiovascular problems previously observed in the most die-hard runners and cyclists. \" if you want to do something good for yourself, you don't have to be extreme, \" says a study author. But another researcher points to a number of possible flaws in the findings, including the fact that the hardest-running group was quite small.

But how much exercise is enough? that's a hotly debated question for which experts still don't have a satisfactory answer. But given that most of us are starting from a sedentary position, the assumption has long been the more the better. But in a report published monday in the journal of the american college of cardiology researchers from denmark say that people who push their bodies too hard may essentially undo the benefit of exercise. Those who ran at a fast pace more than four hours a week for more than three days a week had about the same risk of dying during the study's 12-year follow up as those who were sedentary and hardly exercised at all. The link held even after the researchers accounted for potentially confounding factors such as age, sex, whether the participants had a history of heart disease or diabetes, or whether they smoked and drank alcohol.

One study found that patients who had niacin added to their cholesterol treatments saw their diabetes risk spike 32 % over four years, nbc news reports. That's on top of already recognized side effects like stomach ulcers, heartburn, and diarrhea. \" i think we've wasted a lot of money, caused a certain amount of harm, \" by prescribing niacin, one cardiologist said; from 2002 to 2009, niacin prescriptions tripled to 700,000 a month in the us, with sales hitting about $ 800 million a year. Cardiologists had, however, already begun shying away from the drug in light of earlier research — a 2011 study, for example, indicated that it may increase certain stroke risks. But the mayo clinic still recommends niacin, and many doctors agree, dr. Harlan krumholz at the new york times reports. Some doctors point out that the studies focused on high-risk patients, and that niacin could be useful for other patients.",

Some 500,000 to 2 million are affected by a condition that leaves them unable to leave the house — or even their rooms — for years at a time. It's called hikikomori, a word that has been commonplace in japan since the 1990s, though a few cases have also been seen in the us and other countries. \" if you ask people in japan about hikikomori, almost everyone will say, ' i know somebody like that, ' \" a psychologist said in the japan times last year. It's considered by many to be one of the country's top health issues, but what is going on, and whether those considered to be hikikomori are living with a mental illness, remains unclear, the wall street journal reports. Treatment of the condition, which often affects young men, has been elusive. Every prefecture is legally required to have a treatment center, but few hikikomori actually visit them, and even when they do, few receive successful care. Now, international researchers are trying to understand the condition in the city of fukuoka. As it stands, just half of hikikomori would likely receive a psychiatric diagnosis in the us, but a us researcher working with the fukuoka team developed new criteria for the condition in 2010, the journal notes. Experts are using that criteria to help develop a better understanding of the situation in a country where, the times noted, mental illness remains highly stigmatized.

            "A group of activists is calling for the removal of a statue on the grounds of the alabama capitol honoring a 19th century doctor who experimented on slaves. Alabama state senator hank sanders and other members of the group save ourselves movement for justice and democracy held a press conference yesterday calling for the removal of the statue of dr. J. Marion sims. The statue honors sims as the \" father of modern gynecology \". In his research, sims conducted experimental surgery without anesthesia on enslaved african-american women. Those treatments led to the basis of modern vaginal surgery. A local activist was arrested last month on criminal trespassing charges after performing a skit in front of the statue on confederate memorial day. Also last month, new york city officials relocated a statue of sims from central park to the cemetery where sims is buried.",

        "summary": "News that might interest those whose favorite pantry staples are ketchup and mac and cheese: kraft foods group inc. And h.j. Heinz co. Have announced they will merge in a deal that will create the kraft heinz co. — the third largest food and beverage company on the continent and one that will be no. 5 in the world. Reuters reports heinz shareholders will own 51 % of the new company to kraft shareholders's 49 %. The wall street journal explains the environment for the deal: one in which big-name makers of packaged, processed foods are struggling. To wit, bloomberg business notes that kraft's recent history involves a 2012 spinoff from mondelez international ( which retained kraft's snack foods ) and subsequent difficultly in \" [ reigniting ] sales growth \"; top execs have exited since december. The deal will see warren buffett's berkshire hathaway and brazilian private-equity firm 3g capital acquire kraft and merge it with heinz, which the two purchased in 2013. If 3g capital isn't known to you... It probably actually is: it acquired burger king in 2010, and, through burger king, tim hortons last year. The journal describes 3g as \" an acquisitive firm known for buying consumer companies it considers bloated and aggressively slashing costs. \" the ap reports the boards of both companies have unanimously approved the deal, which is slated to close in the second half of the year. It still needs approval from kraft shareholders, who will receive stock in the combined company and a special cash dividend of approximately $ 10 billion, or $ 16.50 per share.",

        "summary": "The california prison system illegally had dozens of women sterilized, possibly without their consent, according to a new report from the state auditor. Of the 144 inmates given tubal ligations from fiscal years 2005-06 to 2012-13, at least 39 were done without lawful consent, with physicians either failing to sign forms confirming that patients understood and consented to the procedures, failing to wait the requisite number of days to perform the procedure, or both, according to the center for investigative reporting. The \" true number \" might be even higher, the report adds, because auditors found seven cases in which health records had been lost entirely. The procedures were performed at hospitals, not at the prisons, and the federal receiver's office, which oversees medical care in the state's prisons, says it had no legal duty to ensure consent procedures were followed. \" that is a ludicrous argument, \" one state senator says, according to the desert sun. \" it made me sick to my stomach. \" the audit recommends that the doctors involved be reported to the state licensing board, the la times reports; officials say they ' ll follow all recommendations. Pending legislation would prohibit prison sterilizations altogether unless they are medically necessary. The audit came in response to an earlier investigation from the cir that found that the procedures were all carried out without getting the necessary clearance from a state panel of medical experts.

But the other side of the wind never saw the light of day, and it has since become a bit of an obsession for movie buffs, who \" consider it the most famous movie never released, \" the new york times reports. Now, after decades of attempts by others to grab rights to the film, la production company royal road entertainment says it has an agreement to buy those rights — and producers plan to have the film ready for screening by may 6, which would be welles ' 100th birthday. As for the plot? it \" ( quite fittingly ) tells the story of a director attempting to finish a masterpiece while clashing with the hollywood system, \" according to the hollywood reporter. Welles ran into problems, including financing struggles ( he took on tv roles to help and also gathered investors ) and even the islamic revolution in iran, the republican reports. One of the aforementioned investors was mehdi bushehri, the brother-in-law of the shah of iran, and when he and welles fought over spending, bushehri took control of the 1,083 negative reels. The reels then stayed stashed in a paris-area warehouse for years ( and were lost briefly when the storage company went bankrupt last summer ). But welles did manage to get a 45-minute edited work print to california in 1975. Now royal road — which had to negotiate for the rights with welles'daughter, his longtime companion, and a production company — will assemble the film from the negative reels with the help of peter bogdanovich, who stars in it, as well as notes welles left behind.

Lynne disanto of box elder shared a meme sept. 7 depicting stick-figure protesters being hit by an suv. It was posted less than a month after a driver hit counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in charlottesville, virginia, killing a woman. Disanto told the rapid city journal she should have taken that into consideration, and doesn't condone protesters being hit by vehicles. The journal reports the image, which was taken down tuesday, bore three phrases: \" all lives splatter, \" \" nobody cares about your protest \" and \" keep your ( expletive ) out of the road. \" disanto tacked on her own comment: \" i think this is a movement we can all support. #alllivessplatter. \" she tells the journal that she's \" sorry if people took offense to it, \" because in her view, it wasn't offensive. \" i perceived it differently. I perceived it as encouraging people to stay out of the street. \" keller williams realty black hills, the real estate company that apparently employed disanto, posted on facebook she's no longer with the firm. House majority leader lee qualm tells the ap the incident won't affect disanto's position as house majority whip.",

        "summary": "If you were planning to see kevin smith's yoga hosers this weekend, keep in mind that critics almost universally hate it. The movie has a low 22 % rating at rotten tomatoes, though audiences are much kinder, at 63 %. The movie is actually a family affair: smith's daughter stars alongside johnny depp's daughter, and both sets of parents have roles. Here's what critics are saying: \" i don't give a s --- about the audience anymore, \" smith said at the sundance film festival. His proof is this movie, writes aa dowd at av club. Lily-rose depp and harley quinn smith make it \" possible to see why the writer-director thought their chemistry would be enough to carry a movie. \" but \" yoga hosers isn't really a movie. … it's a corny canuck joke, told for 88 surreally unfunny minutes. \" \" some of mr. Smith's prior work made me laugh so hard that i cried; yoga hosers made me want to cry for different reasons, \" writes glenn kenny at the new york times. \" it all seems like something that was hatched during a particularly neuron-impaired free-association game. \" and johnny depp comes across as \" more disturbingly peculiar than funny. \" lily-rose depp \" demonstrates a charismatic presence that jumps off the screen, \" but \" the entire film has the strange feel of watching an elaborately produced home movie to be played at a holiday party rather than a movie theater, \" writes katie walsh at the los angeles times. It also boasts \" a clearly first-draft script, terrible editing, and continuity errors. \" \" to shackle two lovely and promising teenage actresses to material this dreadful could be reasonably construed as an awfully expensive form of child abuse, \" as justin chang puts it at variety. The plot, centering on \" manitoban nazis who take the form of sodomy-inclined sausages, \" seems \" to have been written down on index cards and pulled randomly out of a toque. \" \" even fans who've stuck with smith for two decades may draw the line at this outing, \" writes john defore at the hollywood reporter.",

        "summary": "A good samaritan who lost both her legs while helping a crashed motorist now has one less expense to worry about. Certified prosthetist joshua ryder of island coast orthopedics in lee county, fla., has offered to donate two prosthetic legs to 30-year-old danielle hagmann as soon as she's ready, reports the news-press. Hagmann, who has five children and no health insurance, lost both her legs in an accident sunday. While she was assisting at the scene of a crash, a car struck the crashed vehicle, pinning hagmann against a guardrail. At lee memorial hospital, she had one leg amputated just above the knee and the other at mid-thigh. But, according to ryder, that's no reason hagmann shouldn't be up and walking within a year. Once hagmann is properly healed, a \" shrink sock \" can be used to shape her limbs, he says. At that point, he can begin to build two custom artificial limbs, which would normally cost between $ 13,000 and $ 85,000, ryder says. He expects hagmann — who must wait for an investigation report before seeking treatment funds through auto insurance — could be using the prosthetics to get around within a year. Hagmann's father says he's thankful for donations like ryder's that have flooded in since sunday, including to two gofundme pages. A church group in missouri has also offered to pay for a powered wheelchair, per the news-press. \" we intend to reach out and contact all of those [ who ] made an offer, \" says hagmann's dad.",

The academy's new guidelines for dealing with earwax, the first in almost a decade, stress that the wax is as beneficial as nose mucus or eyelashes and should be left alone as much as possible. While it might seem icky, earwax traps dirt, dust, and other stuff that might get into our ears; the wax is slowly pushed outward by new skin growth and jaw movement and washed away with normal bathing, reports reuters and cnn. That means there's no reason to get rid of earwax with cotton swabs, your finger, or any other tool. Doing so is actually a really bad idea. You might \" push the wax in further, and there also is the potential for damage to the ear drum, \" says dr. Seth schwartz, who helped draft the new guidelines. You might also scratch the ear canal, which \" can lead to pain and infection, \" he says. \" wiping away any excess wax when it comes to the outside of the ear is enough to keep it clean. \" doctors say you should seek medical help if your ear feels full, painful, itchy, or if you're experiencing hearing loss, drainage, ringing in the ears, or bleeding, rather than using a cotton swab to poke around. In fact, they say you shouldn't put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear — including ear candles, which are supposed to remove wax with heat, though there's no evidence they really work, per quartz.

        "summary": "As the boston marathon bombing investigation continues, the fbi is really zeroing in on dead suspect tamerlan tsarnaev's six-month trip to russia last year, the new york times reports. The elder of the tsarnaev brothers visited two predominantly muslim republics in the country's north caucasus region — chechnya and dagestan — both of which are home to strong militant separatist movements. Russia had warned the fbi that tsarnaev was a \" follower of radical islam \" back in 2011, but law enforcement officials did not deem him a security risk; now some members of congress are unhappy at the way the tip was handled in advance of tsarnaev's overseas trip, considering he may have had connections to extremist groups in the area. It was after that trip that he started posting jihadist videos. As federal investigators rush to review the trip ( which tsarnaev's father says was simply to renew his son's russian passport ) and any extremists tsarnaev may have connected with in russia, one former senior fbi official calls it \" a key thread for investigators and the intelligence community to pull on. \" but at the time, the fbi never followed up on tsarnaev after he returned to the us, because it did not have the legal authority to do so after uncovering nothing of note in its initial investigation. The fbi investigation did, however, prevent tsarnaev from becoming a us citizen; the department of homeland security opted to hold his petition for further review. Sources tell fox news that investigators are looking into possible connections between tsarnaev and the caucasus emirate, a separatist and extremist islamic group whose chechen leader is known as \" russia's osama bin laden. \" and today on meet the press, rep. Mike rogers, chair of the house intelligence committee, said tsarnaev may have made the russia trip under an alias.",

The u.n.'s al qaeda sanctions committee has also cited umarov for his alleged connections with al qaeda and other extremist groups. The investigation is based on the contents of tsarnaev's youtube channel and his trip to russia in the first half of 2012, which included stops in dagestan and chechnya.

The investigation is based on the contents of tsarnaev's youtube channel and his trip to russia in the first half of 2012, which included stops in dagestan and chechnya.

The idea is that when a smartcar senses an imminent collision, the sound system sends out a burst of \" pink noise \" inside the car. That causes a muscle inside the ear to contract and thus protect the eardrum from the louder noise of the crash about to come, explains ieee spectrum. Mercedes-benz is marketing it as \" pre-safe sound \" in its newest e-class fleet. When a car crashes, the decibel level can easily reach 145, which is enough to damage the human ear. And that doesn't count the noise of the airbag deploying, which is even higher at around 165 decibels. The so-called pink noise is a safe 80 decibels, and it's enough to trigger what's known as the \" acoustic reflex \" to protect the ear. \" hearing loss is far from the worst damage a person can suffer from a car accident, but this is a cheap and simple way to reduce some of the human impact of road trauma, and a very cool idea, \" writes a blogger at new atlas. Normally, the acoustic reflex takes about one-tenth of a second to kick in after a noise, not enough time to protect the ear from an instantaneous loud boom. The idea here is to trigger it early and safely. \" a frequency spectrum known in physics as pink noise is ideally suited for this purpose, \" explains mercedes in its own post on the feature. \" it sounds like a bit like diffuse traffic noise, the breaking of waves or a waterfall. \" it's promising, but we ' ll have to wait for crash data to see whether it works as advertised, notes a post at bgr.

In the most recent incident, an 18-year-old truck driver was burned in the cab of his truck in an indian-controlled part of kashmir oct. 9 because he was suspected of transporting beef; he died of his injuries sunday. The teen was actually carrying coal, the los angeles times reports. Hindu militants are suspected in the gasoline bomb attack — hindus consider cows sacred for religious reasons, while muslims eat beef. Two thousand demonstrators flooded the streets in kashmir monday to protest the attack, and violent clashes broke out between them and security forces. A curfew has been instituted. The first recent murder took place late last month when a muslim man in india's uttar pradesh state was lynched by a mob over rumors ( apparently untrue ) that he'd eaten beef. Then, last week, a muslim man was killed by members of a radical hindu group because he had allegedly smuggled cattle from another indian state. Also today, hindu militants threw ink on a muslim lawmaker who recently served beef at a party he hosted. They reportedly shouted, \" india will not tolerate any disrespect to cows. \" nine people have been arrested in connection to the latest death, the ap reports.",

Archbishop silvano tomasi told the committee that 848 priests who abused children have been defrocked over the last decade and another 2,572 have received lesser punishments like a lifetime of penance and prayers, reports the wall street journal. He said around 3,400 credible cases of abuse have been referred to the vatican since 2004. After the committee grilled him on the vatican's record, the archbishop insisted that there is no \" climate of impunity \" in the church and the vatican is working hard to prevent further abuse, voice of america reports. He said the vatican's fight against sexual abuse over the last decade could even be \" something worth probably looking at for good practices other institutions and states could copy. \" the un committee is monitoring implementation of the un treaty against torture and while tomasi said the vatican was only obliged to abide by the treaty inside its own tiny territory, he acknowledged that sexual abuse could be considered torture, the ap notes.

        "summary": "The official illness tally from the royal caribbean cruise ship that returned to new jersey yesterday, two days ahead of schedule: 630 passengers and 54 employees. That's a 20-year cruise ship record, according to cdc data, and passengers tell cnn the true number is probably much higher, since some sick people didn't bother going to the infirmary — or purposely hid their illness to avoid being quarantined. Royal caribbean itself suspects the true number could be as high as 900, the new york daily news reports. Here are the worst details passengers related — warning, do not read while eating: one passenger says that when she arrived at the infirmary, sick people were throwing up in buckets, bags, and basically everywhere, and she had to wait three hours to be seen. Another says the infirmary was so crowded that sick people were cramming the stairwells nearby. \" people were puking into their barf bags while waiting, \" he says. ( a different passenger estimates that, at one point, there were at least 200 people in the infirmary; she chose to disembark at a port and go to a pharmacy instead, she tells the los angeles times. ) another passenger gets even more explicit: on the second night of the cruise, \" i was in the dining room and a woman was vomiting into her napkin, \" she says. \" there were people walking around in their pajamas with vomit and diarrhea on them. People were barfing all over the place. \" \" another passenger we became friends with said he went into the men's room and someone had gotten sick right in the floor and he stepped in it. It was bad, \" a passenger tells reuters. Another tells cbs news, \" the sick were in the hot tubs and the pools so people were getting sick that way by being near other people.

Bikers are shown dragging the body of one man onto the patio; another biker is seen leaving the patio with his face and chest covered in blood. Lawyers for both biker clubs say they did not release the video to the media. The waco police department likewise denies doing so, saying it remains under a gag order. The individuals who made the video public could be \" subject to ethical and legal issues, \" the department says, while police and prosecutors tell abc news that the leak could affect the pending cases. Waco police detained 239 people in the aftermath of the shooting. Of those, 177 were arrested on charges of engaging in organized criminal activity, though none were ever indicted. A grand jury is now considering their cases.",

The incursion began overnight, with troops pressing from the capital into rebel-held northern territory. France also announced yesterday that it was boosting its troop presence from 800 to 2,500, another sign that it's leading an offensive that was originally to be led by mali's african neighbors. West african troops are set to arrive within a week, france's prime minister said yesterday. \" france is in the vanguard, but within a week african forces will start to deploy on the ground, \" he said, according to al-jazeera. Germany is providing military aircraft to transport those african troops, along with $ 1.3 million in humanitarian aid. The us has offered to help as well, though leon panetta said it won't send troops — direct military aid to mali's coup-installed government is illegal, the washington post points out. The militants, meanwhile, have actually seized more territory despite the assault, with their fighters embedding themselves in the civilian population, a french military spokesman said. Today they also attacked a bp natural gas field in neighboring algeria, kidnapping eight people.",

        "summary": "Ukraine's interim president gave pro-russia militants occupying government buildings in slaviansk and other eastern ukraine areas until this morning to get out, or be forced out by the ukrainian military — and the deadline has passed without the militants leaving. So far, oleksandr turchinov has not sent in the army, but clashes between ukrainian forces and pro-russia gunmen on the outskirts of the city left at least one ukrainian dead yesterday, the bbc reports. Today, at least 100 pro-russia separatists attacked a police station in another eastern ukraine city, reuters reports. At yesterday's emergency un security council meeting, russia's ambassador urged the ukrainian government to \" start a genuine dialogue \" with protesters in eastern ukraine rather than using force, while ukraine's ambassador accused russia of being behind the \" separatist operation \" in the first place. If kiev follows through on its threat to bring in the military, russia, which has 40,000 troops on ukraine's eastern border, could push back; the us has compared the events in eastern ukraine to the ones that led up to russia's annexation of crimea. But the wall street journal reports that turchinov also said today he's open to holding a referendum on the possibility of giving certain regions more autonomy, which is one of the rebels'demands.",

She was, for the record, and her situation isn't particularly complicated.
