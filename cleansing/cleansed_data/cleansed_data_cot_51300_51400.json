        "summary": "Arizona's new law banning abortions beginning at what the state defines as 20 weeks of pregnancy is constitutional, a us district judge has ruled, setting the stage for the law to go into effect this week. The new law may force some pregnant women to opt for an abortion earlier, but the measure is constitutional because it doesn't ban abortions outright, determined judge james teilborg. He also said the state provided \" substantial and well-documented \" evidence that a fetus can feel pain by at least 20 weeks gestation, reports ap. The ban is set to go into effect for all women except in cases of medical emergencies on thursday. The new york-based center for reproductive rights has filed a notice that it plans to appeal the decision to the 9th us circuit court of appeals, but it's not clear if that will hold up the law. The law will complicate \" fetal defect \" cases in which a number of babies with fatal problems must now be carried to term but will likely die in minutes or days after birth, reports the arizona republic. The new law forbids doctors from aborting most fetuses with a gestational age of 20 weeks or older, even in situations where the doctor discovers the fetus has such a defect. But the law defines gestational age as beginning with the first day of a woman's last period, which means most fetuses will typically have an actual gestational age of 18 weeks when abortions can no longer be performed. That's about the time ultrasound tests are conducted to detect abnormalities, notes the republic.",

            "Under a new arizona abortion law that takes effect thursday, more babies with fatal fetal defects are expected to be carried to term, even though they will die within minutes, hours or days. But more will also be done to help their families get through the trauma of losing a child. House bill 2036 forbids doctors from aborting most fetuses with a gestational age of 20 weeks or older, even in situations where the doctor discovers the fetus has a fatal defect. The law also defines gestational age as beginning on the first day of the woman's last period, meaning abortions are actually banned starting at 18 weeks of pregnancy -- typically about the same time a doctor would perform ultrasounds where most abnormalities are detected. Eight other states also ban abortions after 20 weeks, but arizona is the only one with a law that actually pushes the ban back to 18 weeks into the pregnancy. According to state records, women in arizona terminate about 100 pregnancies a year after 20 weeks, but it's unclear how many of those are because of a problem with the pregnancy. The new law requires doctors to offer information about perinatal hospice services to women considering abortion at any stage of their pregnancy because of a fatal fetal abnormality. It also requires the state to maintain a website list of organizations that provide services.",
            "Arizona's ban on abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy is poised to take effect this week as scheduled after a federal judge ruled monday that the new law is constitutional. U.s. District judge james teilborg said the statute may prompt a few pregnant women who are considering abortion to make the decision earlier. But he said the law is constitutional because it doesn't prohibit any women from making the decision to end their pregnancies. The judge also wrote that the state provided \" substantial and well-documented \" evidence that an unborn child has the capacity to feel pain during an abortion by at least 20 weeks. Republican gov. Jan brewer signed the measure into law in april, making arizona one of 10 states to enact types of 20-week bans. Arizona's ban, set to take effect thursday, prohibits abortions starting at 20 weeks of pregnancy except in medical emergencies. That is a change from the state's current ban at viability, which is the ability to survive outside the womb and which generally is considered to be about 24 weeks. A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. The new york-based center for reproductive rights and another group filed a notice that they would be appealing teilborg's decision to the 9th u.s. Circuit court of appeals. \" today's decision casts aside decades of legal precedent,"

        "summary": "For anyone who carefully tracks bitcoin, tuesday brought the good with the bad. On a positive note, the cryptocurrency's value topped $ 9,000, up from a weekend low of $ 7,335, reports cnbc. On a more dour note comes the news that child abuse photos are lurking within its blockchain. The guardian offers a primer on the technology: the blockchain is the open-source ledger that keeps track of every bitcoin trade; it has the ability to store additional data, say, a note or file on what the transaction was for. Fortune says \" benign \" messages are also present, and it gives the example of a nelson mandela tribute ( indeed, the study found six wedding-related images ). But german researchers discovered there are more than financial notes and sweet memories being parked within the blockchain. They looked at the 1,600 files that have been uploaded to it and found eight were sexual in nature. One they suspect may depict child abuse; two compiled 247 links to child abuse content ( fortune reports such links were identified as far back as 2013, but this is \" perhaps the first time \" such content has been quantified ). And that \" endangers the multi-billion dollar markets powering cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, \" say the researchers. Their reasoning is simple: if bitcoin contains content that is illegal to possess, then it's possible that downloading and storing the bitcoin's blockchain is \" illegal to possess for all users. \" but fortune reports people don't seem spooked: it notes bitcoin hit $ 9,000 as the reports on the study were coming out.

        "summary": "Having their tonsils or appendix removed might result in an unexpected benefit for young women who hope to become pregnant someday: new research suggests they might be more fertile as a result. A 15-year study of half a million british women finds that a woman who has undergone a tonsillectomy or appendectomy has a 49 % and 34 % higher chance of getting pregnant, respectively, than a woman with her appendix and tonsils intact, reports the telegraph. A woman who's had both procedures has a 43 % higher chance of getting pregnant. One of the researchers says the study \" confirms beyond doubt that removal of inflamed organs or organs likely to suffer from repeated inflammation, in women, improves their chances of pregnancy \" rather than reduces those chances, as some doctors believe. It isn't clear why the procedures are linked to increased fertility — doctors previously suggested scar tissue around the fallopian tubes after an appendectomy reduced the chance of pregnancy — but it may simply be that women who have more sex are more likely to develop an infection. However, inflammation in the body can affect a woman's ovaries and womb, per the bbc, and it's possible that \" the removal of these tissues makes an alteration to their immune system \" that affects reproduction, says a scientist not involved in the study. \" if true, this may ultimately give doctors and scientists some new ideas for novel drugs or therapies to enhance women's fertility. \" the researchers stress they're not advocating that otherwise healthy women have the procedures, notes cnn. ( this procedure may double a woman's chance of conception. )",

            "We live in an era of edited selfies and ever-evolving standards of beauty. The advent and popularity of image-based social media have put photoshop and filters in everyone's arsenal. A few swipes on snapchat can give your selfie a crown of flowers or puppy ears. A little adjusting on facetune can smoothen out skin, and make teeth look whiter and eyes and lips bigger. A quick share on instagram, and the likes and comments start rolling in. These filters and edits have become the norm, altering people's perception of beauty worldwide.",
            "Snapchat and instagram filters are influencing how young people think about beauty. Alarmingly, more people are requesting plastic surgery to look better in selfies, according to the american academy of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery. And in one disturbing emerging phenomenon, dubbed \" snapchat dysmorphia, \" some patients are getting plastic surgery to look more like their filtered selfies. According to boston university researchers, digital filters are likely contributing to a rise in body dysmorphia, where people are overly anxious about their appearance. Instagram and snapchat filters are the new celebrity photo, offering up unrealistic standards of beauty that might trigger people to feel unhappy with the way they look in real life.

        "summary": "The baltic sea's trove of shipwrecks has preserved all kinds of history — much of it about war — and recently sparked fears of a fresh conflict in europe. Bordered by scandinavia, finland, the baltics, the north european plain, and accessible by russia, one sliver of the sea contains about 1,000 known shipwreck objects, maritime expert thomas dehling tells deutsche welle. He's referring to what slumbers in 6,000-square-miles of \" german waters, \" which he says represent not even a tenth of the full sea. \" many of the objects aren't large shipwrecks, but much smaller, or partially submerged [ ones ], \" he says. \" we still find 10 to 15 objects every year that we didn't know about before. \" most are from world war i and ii, but not all: a swedish three-masted warship called the mars went down in 1564 while battling the danes and may have been cursed by its own cannons, national geographic reported last year. Discovered in 2011, the warship sank when its cannons overheated and exploded during battle; legend says it was cursed because swedish kings repurposed church bells to build the cannons. In another baltic find, 168 bottles of perfectly preserved 19th-century french champagne were discovered on a sunken schooner near finland, smithsonian reports. \" it was incredible, \" says a scientist of the bubbly that later sold for up to $ 100,000 a bottle. Then last year, sweden saw its cold war fears revived — and concerns about modern russia heightened — when said it spotted a foreign sub in its waters. Sweden now says a russian sub may have indeed been found in the baltic... But the wreckage is thought to be that of a wwi vessel that likely went down almost 100 years ago.

This particular note is made of a thin plastic and designed to last more than twice as long as its paper counterpart. It features the queen on the front and winston churchill on the back, and it goes into circulation in september. The current five-pound paper note will remain in use for another year. Next up comes up a 10-pound plastic note featuring jane austen in 2017 and a 20-pound note featuring painter jmw turner by 2020. The unveiling comes ahead of britain's crucial vote on whether to exit the european union, and bloomberg notes that both sides of the debate have claimed none other than churchill to be in their camp. Asked on thursday about how churchill might view the question, bank of england gov. Mark carney opted to play it safe. \"it's not for me to make any inference about that, \" he said.",

        "summary": "Amazon has an open secret that few pay heed to: a \" nearly invisible workforce \" that works to get consumers their packages on demand, per gizmodo. Bryan menegus dives into the company's flex program, responsible for the firm's \" last-mile \" service, which involves getting ordered goods to a customer from the last local shipment site on the delivery chain. But while the driving program is described online by amazon as letting those interested \" be your own boss, set your own schedule, and have more time to pursue your goals and dreams, \" menegus — who chatted with 15 current or ex-drivers from nine states and two countries, as well as with three contractors from local courier companies tied to amazon — instead paints it as an exploitive system that considers its drivers \" utterly expendable \" and offers them little recourse to address issues or unfair practices. What he found is that getting into the flex program can be simple: entry criteria are \" modest \" ( e.g., being over 21, having a smartphone with the flex app ), as is training. One uk driver says: \" honestly, it seems they take on anyone. \" but once on board, drivers say they face faulty data systems, altercations between drivers vying for prime routes ( and high-tech cheating to claim those routes ), and a lack of support from \" hot-headed warehouse managers \" who take a \" customer is always right \" attitude. And one labor attorney thinks not everything is on the up-and-up when it comes to how the company handles its drivers: considering them contractors, but treating them like employees, with all of the responsibility and few benefits. \" i think it's breaking the law in a pretty widespread way, \" she says. More on the flex program, part of the \" constantly shifting, secretive nature of amazon, \" here.",

Only 68 defendants were actually in court, the ap reports. Most of the rest are being tried in absentia, though some jailed brotherhood honchos, including badie, were kept out of court for security reasons. Also absent: many defense lawyers, who are boycotting the trial in protest of yesterday's sentencing; the judge who handed out those death sentences is presiding today. By law the lawyers ' absence should have halted the trial, but the judge forged ahead. \" this judge smashed the rock of justice with his own hands, \" one said. \" he is inventing new law. \" the 683 are accused of killing two policemen, though according to the bbc no one was actually reported killed in the minya attack — which followed police raids that killed almost 1,000 protesters in cairo.",

Officials at the los angeles zoo tell the los angeles times they've recruited the lapd to help look for a most unusual sort of trespasser: a man caught on tape scaling a barrier and slapping one of two hippos in the pen below. The now-viral video, recorded from the other side of the enclosure by what sounds to be a young woman, shows the man slowly climbing over a railing, then reaching down to slap the butt of 4-year-old rosie, who appeared to be snacking alongside her mother, mara. Mara looks up briefly, and the person shooting the video can be heard giggling as the man lifts his arms up in an apparent victory stretch and runs off. But zoo officials warn that what happened was anything but funny. \" any unauthorized interaction with an animal is unsafe for the animal and potentially unsafe for the patron, \" a zoo spokeswoman says, noting something like this also breaks down the animals'trust that zookeepers have worked so hard to instill. The bbc notes hippos are responsible for more human deaths in africa than any other big animal. The suspect could be hit with a misdemeanor charge or other infraction — california law bars anyone from climbing into zoo enclosures — but the case is being investigated as a trespassing violation, not an animal cruelty one, as the animals didn't seem particularly fazed by the incident.",

        "summary": "Politico is out with a damning report about the obama administration's dealings with iran last year in the lead-up to a nuclear arms accord. The story by josh meyer alleges that former president obama gave up more than he acknowledged publicly, particularly in regard to a prisoner swap ahead of the deal. The obama white house released seven prisoners it characterized as non-dangerous businessmen, neglecting to mention that three of them had been deemed a threat to national security by the president's own justice department. ( they'd been accused of illegally shipping us macroelectronics to tehran for use in surface-to-air and cruise missiles. ) what's more, politico found that the us also quietly dropped criminal cases against 14 fugitives, including seyed abolfazl shahab jamili, who allegedly procured thousands of parts with nuclear applications for iran by way of china. \" they didn't just dismiss a bunch of innocent business guys, \" one former federal law enforcement supervisor tells politico. \" and then they didn't give a full story of it. \" in fact, meyer writes, the white house actions \" derailed \" its own successful investigations into iran's proliferation network, angering justice department prosecutors. A senior obama official acknowledges that anger but says such compromises are necessary and pale in comparison to the greater good of a nuclear deal. Here's one sample of early reaction, from the conservative hot air site: \" barack obama and john kerry desperately needed a win on foreign policy in 2015-6 after seeing its'smart power ' approach turn the middle east and caucasus into flames, \" writes ed morrissey. \" they didn't care if it was a short-term win that sacrificed long-term national security. \" read the full politico piece here.",

        "summary": "Scientists are now saying there may have been \" a more colorful jurassic world than we previously imagined, \" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in china's hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \" exquisitely preserved, \" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal nature communications documenting the find explains that \" caihong \" means \" rainbow \" in mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; national geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? they used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in caihong were long and flat like pancakes — similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the pantone wheel caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \" rainbow glimmer. \" study co-author xing zu tells national geographic that caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \" glide \" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, discover notes.

            "Sudoku puzzles can be brainteasers, but one man's brain had an unusual response to solving the numerical grid puzzles: he developed seizures. The 25-year-old german man didn't always react this way to sudoku, according to a new report of his case. His problems began after he was trapped in an avalanche during a ski trip. The young man, a physical education student, had been skiing with a friend in november 2008 when an avalanche occurred on the mountain. The avalanche buried the man in the snow and knocked him unconscious, according to the case report. But he was fortunate to have been skiing with a buddy who was a paramedic, and his friend rescued him and started cpr immediately, said dr. Berend feddersen, a neurologist at the university of munich in germany, and the lead author of the case report published today ( oct. 19 ) in",

        "summary": "Good news for the fair-skinned among us: scientists in massachusetts have developed a drug that darkens and protects human skin without the damaging effects of ultraviolet ( uv ) light. Dr. David fisher, a researcher at massachusetts general hospital, tells the bbc the drug initiates a series of chemical reactions that enables skin to produce sun-blocking dark melanin without exposure to dangerous uv light — which initiates the same chemical reactions, but only after damaging the skin. \" under the microscope it's the real melanin, \" fisher says. \"it really is activating the production of pigment in a uv-independent fashion. \" the drug could be a good thing even for people who don't crave a tan: dark pigment provides a protective barrier against uv radiation, reducing the risk of skin cancer. In an interview with stat, fisher says the next step will be to test the drug's safety, with the first test subjects most likely being \" individuals who are at the highest risk for developing skin cancer. \" if further tests prove successful the new drug could prove to be a substitute for other self-tanning activities, like lotions, which essentially paint the skin but provide no melanin protection, and tanning beds, which expose the skin to harmful uv rays and can thus be risky. Still, according to science news, the drug would not, on its own, be considered a substitute for sunscreen, which blocks uv rays but has the counteractive effect of leaving skin pale and vulnerable. Ideally, dr. Fisher says, the drug would be combined with sunscreen in a single product.",

        "summary": "Winter storm hercules continues to flex its muscles, dumping well over a foot of snow in places, sparking states of emergency, and bringing with it freezing temperatures and the threat of hypothermia. Experts warn that even shoveling your driveway can be dangerous. The latest: it seems the warning of up to a foot of snow might have been wishful thinking for some: nearly two feet fell in some areas, including 21 inches in boxford, mass. ( that's about 30 miles north of boston ), and 18 inches near both gurnee, ill., and rochester, ny, as of early this morning, weather underground and the ap report. Nbc news notes winter weather and wind chill warnings have been in effect in at least 22 states, affecting more than 100 million people from chicago through the new york tri-state area into new england. Both new york and new jersey have declared states of emergency. Along with the 2,000 flights cancelled yesterday, another 1,350 have been grounded today, according to nbc news. Jfk airport this morning suspended flights because of zero visibility; boston's logan is effectively non-operational as well. A meteorologist told nbc that some areas in the midwest could see chilling temperatures not recorded since the mid-1980s. \" people that are vulnerable are really going to be hurting, \" added one. The cold could be bad news for road crews and homeowners: snow-melting salt stops working between 10 and 20 degrees. And a second icy wave is coming, expected to hit the midwest on sunday and monday then move east. It's going to be seriously cold, with an expected high in chicago on monday of -8. Plenty of kids are getting an extended holiday today, with schools, including all public schools in boston and new york city, closed throughout the region. But pennsylvania saw a storm-related tragedy: a salt yard worker prepping for the storm was killed when a 100-foot pile of rock salt buried him.",

The change will officially take place in january, when the new name will start appearing on napkins, boxes, and signs at its u.s. Stores. The name change will eventually be adopted by international stores. Dunkin ' has more than 12,500 restaurants globally. The 68-year-old chain says its new logo will still have the familiar rounded font and orange-and-pink color scheme that the company has used since 1973. Canton, massachusetts-based dunkin'says the name change is one of several things it's doing to stay relevant to younger customers. It's also simplifying its menu and adding dedicated mobile ordering lanes.",
            "Just call it dunkin '. Starting in january, dunkin'donuts will drop the \" donuts \" from ads, packages and signage at new and remodeled stores, as well as its social media accounts. The makeover is part of dunkin ' brand's efforts to relabel itself as a \" beverage-led \" company that focuses on coffees, teas, speedy service and to-go food including - — but not limited to — doughnuts. Dunkin'says that beverages, especially coffee, make up 60 % of the company's us sales. \" our new branding is one of many things we are doing as part of our blueprint for growth to modernize the dunkin ' experience for our customer, \" said dunkin ' brands ( dnkn ) ceo david hoffmann in a statement tuesday. The company said last year that it was considering the change. It tested out a store in pasadena, california, that used the shorter name. The company later unveiled another store in massachusetts that adopted the \" dunkin ' \" moniker as well. That store also included digital kiosks, an expanded grab &amp; go section and a drive-thru that let customers cut the line if they ordered ahead on the app. Dunkin ' also has plans to get bigger. Executives reiterated on a conference call tuesday that the company plans to open 1,000 new us stores by the end of 2020."

        "summary": "Thousands of inmates will soon be moved out of solitary confinement in california, after years of court battles and hunger strikes against the controversial practice. The state's decision was revealed in a legal settlement filed today — which still must be accepted by the court — with a group of inmates who have been isolated at pelican bay state prison for 10 years or more, the los angeles times reports. The settlement applies to a class-action federal lawsuit covering almost 3,000 inmates, a lawsuit originally filed in 2009 by todd ashker and danny troxell, two murderers serving sentences in pelican bay. California has agreed to stop using solitary confinement as a means of controlling prison gangs; instead, the most dangerous prisoners will be held in a group setting and will have many of the same privileges as other inmates. As the ap notes, california's previously unlimited isolation of gang leaders had been used to keep hundreds of prisoners segregated ( often in soundproofed, windowless cells of just 80 square feet, for all but an hour and a half per day, with no access to visitors, communication, or even reading materials ) for 10 years or more. Now, california will release many of the affected prisoners back into the general prison population and will limit the amount of time prisoners can spend in isolation. New \" restrictive custody units \" will be used for inmates who commit new crimes while in prison, refuse to participate in rehab, or who may be in danger from other inmates, but those units will allow prisoners more personal contact and other privileges. The union that represents most prison guards has expressed safety concerns, with the spokesperson noting that the state could \" return to the prison environment of the ' 70s and ' 80s, when inmate-on-inmate homicides were at the highest levels and staff were killed. \"",

        "summary": "We humans consume a lot of antidepressants, and that means birds inadvertently do the same while feeding at sewage plants. Now researchers in the uk suggest that it's taking a toll on the birds ' libidos, making them — or at least the females — less attractive to prospective mates. In their study, researchers at the university of york focused on starlings in captivity. They fed the birds worms laced with prozac, on par with what their counterparts in the wild might pick up while eating worms and insects at sewage plants, and then watched what happened. Dosed males didn't change much, but dosed females suddenly seemed less attractive to the boys. Male starlings sang less frequently to them and treated them more aggressively — pecking, tugging at feathers — than is typical in the wooing phase. It's \" the first evidence that low concentrations of an antidepressant can disrupt the courtship of songbirds, \" says study co-author kathryn arnold in a release. \" we're definitely not saying that it's bad to take antidepressants, but certainly there is a greater need for new technologies to clean out sewage, \" she elaborates to the washington post. Presumably, the same type of behavior occurs in the wild, but researchers note that it's hard to replicate for a not-so-great reason: wild birds are dining not just on prozac but on a whole cocktail of pharmaceuticals, and the study adds to evidence that growing concentrations of them \" can alter important traits related to individual fitness and population dynamics, \" per the study.

        "summary": "While investigating samples of toxic levels of heavy metals found in sperm whales, researchers stumbled upon a surprising discovery: all of today's sperm whales appear to have descended from the same female, reports hakai magazine. They've named her eve and say she lived between 10,000 and 80,000 years ago. In the journal molecular ecology, the researchers explain that the genetic diversity of the whales, one of the planet's largest animals, turns out to be even lower than previously thought. The key was locked away in the species ' mitochondrial dna, a type of dna passed down through the generations from mothers, not fathers. Conducting genetic tests on 542 samples collected over the past six years by ocean alliance and comparing them to another 1,000 whales analyzed in the past 15 years, they found that a single female whale left her thumbprint on all of them. Which doesn't quite make sense given that mothers tend to dominate certain areas without moving around, so the spread of one set of genes across the globe would be unusual. Somewhere along the line one mother whale and her descendants were able to out-compete all other females alive at the time — perhaps there was a sudden global population decline, or female whale behavior was dramatically different then — and their genetic lineage took off. One drawback is that this lack of diversity makes the whales more susceptible to things such as climate change, notes smithsonian, suggesting that \" today's moms will need to get out more for the sake of their species. \" ( check out what one diver was sprayed with when encountering a diving sperm whale. )",

            "There's no denying that sperm whales are amazing. As some of earth's largest mammals, they have the largest brain of any creature on the planet and can weigh up to 45 tons. But it turns out that the most impressive secrets of these huge animals are found in something much smaller: their dna. As john r. Platt writes for hakai magazine, modern sperm whales seem to have all descended from a single female. A new study published in the journal molecular ecology reveals that deep within sperm whale's mitochondrial dna — genes passed on from mother to child — lie connections to a single, \"eve \" -like whale. The researchers analyzed mitochondrial dna from 1,633 whales and found low genetic diversity. But that was no surprise: past research has demonstrated that many of what scientists call \"megafauna \" ( really big animals ) aren't that genetically diverse. In 2002, for example, researchers found that killer whales lack diversity in their genes despite their large population size — likely due to some past event that once dramatically reduced their population. It turns out that other species lack diversity, too, because of everything from preferences for the same breeding grounds to loyalty to a certain kind of food.

            "The interplay of natural selection and genetic drift, influenced by geographic isolation, mating systems and population size, determines patterns of genetic diversity within species. The sperm whale provides an interesting example of a long‐lived species with few geographic barriers to dispersal. Worldwide mtdna diversity is relatively low, but highly structured among geographic regions and social groups, attributed to female philopatry. However, it is unclear whether this female philopatry is due to geographic regions or social groups, or how this might vary on a worldwide scale. To answer these questions, we combined mtdna information for 1091 previously published samples with 542 newly obtained dna profiles ( 394‐bp mtdna, sex, 13 microsatellites ) including the previously unsampled indian ocean, and social group information for 541 individuals. We found low mtdna diversity ( π = 0.430 % ) reflecting an expansion event <80 000 years bp, but strong differentiation by ocean, among regions within some oceans, and among social groups. In comparison, microsatellite differentiation was low at all levels, presumably due to male‐mediated gene flow. A hierarchical amova showed that regions were important for explaining mtdna variance in the indian ocean, but not pacific, with social group sampling in the atlantic too limited to include in analyses. Social groups were important in partitioning mtdna and microsatellite variance within both oceans. Therefore, both geographic philopatry and"

            "There's no denying that sperm whales are amazing. As some of earth's largest mammals, they have the largest brain of any creature on the planet and can weigh up to 45 tons. But it turns out that the most impressive secrets of these huge animals are found in something much smaller: their dna. As john r. Platt writes for hakai magazine, modern sperm whales seem to have all descended from a single female.

        "summary": "The discovery of 12 thai boys and their coach still alive after 10 days trapped in a flooded cave has brought massive relief to their families and an anxious nation — but the military warns that their ordeal could be only just beginning. The group, discovered by two british divers late monday, are on a dry rock ledge around 2.5 miles from the mouth of the cave, and the thai military says it could be months before it can get them out, unless the boys learn to dive, the bbc reports. The cave in northern thailand often remains flooded until the end of the rainy season in september or october, meaning the youth soccer team and their coach may need to have food and other supplies sent in for the next four months. Experts warn that it could be very difficult to get the boys, ages 11 to 16, to safety through miles of dark, narrow, flooded tunnels. \" trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy, \" us national cave rescue commission coordinator anmar mirza tells the ap. Thai officials say they're committed to \" 100 % safety \" and will continue to explore their options, including draining water from the cave system and searching for shafts that could provide an alternative escape route. Officials say the boys are hungry and weak but in stable medical condition with only minor injuries. They have been provided with high-protein liquid food and will be given more supplies and visited by doctors in the days to come.",

        "summary": "An estimated 8 % to 13 % of pregnant woman are on antidepressants, and not without warning: the fda in 2005 amended antidepressants ' labels to indicate that babies born to moms taking them could suffer an increased risk of heart defects. But causation hadn't been proven, and the latest study on the topic indicates those warnings may be baseless. The latest study, published in the new england journal of medicine, followed 949,504 pregnant women, 64,389 ( 6.8 % ) of whom used antidepressants during the first trimester — the period of the most rapid cell division, when the risk of developing such defects is highest, webmd explains. What krista huybrechts of brigham and women's hospital did differently: she and her team took into consideration factors that could lead to heart defects, like the mother's age and whether she had diabetes. The boston herald reports that among babies whose mothers did not take antidepressants, 72.3 per 10,000 were born with a cardiac defect, compared with 90.1 per 10,000 infants whose mothers did. After controlling for risk factors, \" there is no evidence to support a substantial increased risk of cardiac malformations overall, \" says huybrechts. Still, she cautions that antidepressant use during pregnancy poses a \" whole range of other potential adverse outcomes. \" to wit, one expert pointed to \" serious flaws \" with the study. For one, it didn't flag miscarriages, which are linked to antidepressants. \" it may be that the most severely affected pregnancies are miscarrying, \" he noted.",

Under the plan, the rate will rise from $ 9 to $ 10.50 in july 2016, then tick up annually to $ 12, $ 13.25, $ 14.25, and $ 15. Businesses with 25 or fewer workers will get an extra year to phase it in. Though a handful of other cities have voted for a $ 15 rate, including seattle, los angeles is the biggest city to do so. The move doesn't become official until the city attorney's office drafts an ordinance and sends it back to council members for their approval, but once it does, it's going to affect a lot of people, notes the new york times. The newspaper cites one study showing that about 40 % of workers in the city make less than $ 15 an hour. The city's chamber of commerce predicts layoffs as a result. \" it's simple math, \" says one official. \" there is simply not enough room, enough margin in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus percent increase in labor costs over a short period of time. \" but one longtime mcdonald's worker, a mother of two now making $ 9.05 an hour, tells the guardian that the move is overdue. \"my life would be completely different if i were paid $ 15 an hour, \" she says. \" i could afford groceries without needing food stamps, my family could stop sharing our apartment with renters for extra money, and i'd be able to provide my daughters with some security. \"",

Smuggling is on the rise into india, one of the world's biggest buyers of gold, after the government raised import duty to a record 10 percent and slapped restrictions which have shrivelled supplies into the domestic market. The jet airways plane had arrived at kolkata's international airport from patna on a domestic flight, but normally operates between the gold trading hub of dubai and mumbai, home to india's largest gold market. It was undergoing routine cleaning when maintenance staff discovered the two small tins. \"there was a bomb scare immediately when the bags were spotted in two separate toilets at round 1 a.m., but later we found they contained 12 pieces of gold bars in each, \" additional commissioner of customs at the airport, rameshwar meena, told reuters. \"the gold bars are from dubai for sure. The flight had come from patna to kolkata last, but its basic route is dubai-mumbai. \" the bars weigh 1 kg ( 2.2 pounds ) and are about the same size as a portable smart phone. Meena said the haul was worth 73.68 million rupees ( $ 1.18 million ).

            "Kolkata, india, nov 20 ( reuters ) - two lunch boxes hidden in the toilets of a jet airways plane triggered first a bomb scare and then a smuggling probe as the tins were found to contain 12 gold bars each, a senior customs official said on wednesday. Smuggling is on the rise into india, one of the world's biggest buyers of gold, after the government raised import duty to a record 10 percent and slapped restrictions which have shrivelled supplies into the domestic market. The jet airways plane had arrived at kolkata's international airport from patna on a domestic flight, but normally operates between the gold trading hub of dubai and mumbai, home to india's largest gold market. It was undergoing routine cleaning when maintenance staff discovered the two small tins. \"there was a bomb scare immediately when the bags were spotted in two separate toilets at round 1 a.m., but later we found they contained 12 pieces of gold bars in each, \" additional commissioner of customs at the airport, rameshwar meena, told reuters. \"the gold bars are from dubai for sure. The flight had come from patna to kolkata last, but its basic route is dubai-mumbai. \" the bars weigh 1 kg ( 2.2 pounds ) and are about the same size as a portable smart phone. Meena said the haul was worth 73.68 million rupees ( $ 1.18 million ). Customs officials said there had been five cases over two months involving a total 100 kg. \"we feel that what we catch is less than 10 percent or so and there are so many groups operating, it is impossible for us to keep a check, \" said an official at the revenue intelligence department, who asked not to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media.

        "summary": "A british teenager accused of wasting police time with a complaint about her ex-boyfriend was murdered by the same man less than six months later, prosecutors say. Shana grice, 19, was found dead with her throat cut in her brighton home in august last year, the independent reports. In march, she had been charged with \" having caused wasteful employment of police by making a false report \" after she accused 27-year-old michael lane of assaulting her but failed to tell officers that they had an on-and-off relationship. A month before that report, she had complained to police that lane was stalking her and left a note on her new boyfriend's car saying, \" shana will always cheat on you. \" lane is now on trial for the murder. The jury was told last week that the month before the killing, he received a caution from police after stealing a key and letting himself into grice's home to watch her sleep, the bbc reports. A few days later, she told police that lane was following her, but the incident was classed as \" low risk. \" prosecutors say lane was obsessed with grice and became murderous after she decided to go back to another ex-boyfriend. He denies killing her, though he has admitted fitting a tracking device to her car. He told the court that he found her body after entering grice's home through the open front door, then fled in panic and went home to shower instead of calling police. ( a tennessee woman found her ex hiding under her bed. )",

        "summary": "Robert wang has a simple goal: \" an instant pot in every kitchen. \" and cbc reports the canadian inventor is poised to make significant strides toward that goal this black friday. Wang invented the instant pot in 2008 after getting laid off from his software engineering job, according to nbc news. The device is essentially an electric pressure cooker that also serves as a rice cooker, steamer, slow cooker, and more. It has sensors to prevent burning and make sure everything's cooking properly and bluetooth for remote monitoring. Now, seven years after the instant pot hit the market, wang has a legitimate phenomenon on his hands, selling nearly 250,000 units on amazon's prime day. \" to sell 250,000 units in 24 hours is close to a miracle, \" wang tells cbc. \" it's like that saying about when the time for an idea has arrived, nothing can stop it. \" and the instant pot's popularity is still growing. It's predicted it will be amazon's biggest seller during the company's black friday sales event in the us and canada this week. Wang thinks he ' ll move 500,000 units on amazon alone. He chalks the instant pot's popularity up to people's growing desire to make healthy, home-cooked food while avoiding fast food — and because \" everything is better with bluetooth. \" the inquirer states the instant pot's biggest innovation is \" taking the fear out of pressure-cooking. \" whatever the reason for its popularity, instant pot owners are fanatical. The instant pot community on facebook has 750,000 members, and a chef who teaches an instant pot cooking class describes some fans as \" cult-like worshippers. \" but they probably said the same thing about all those people buying tickle-me elmos.",

Shape shifting lizard! \" another message read, \" bernie for president, \" referring to democratic candidate bernie sanders. Another sign said: \" work is canceled. Go back home. \" the signs appear to be ones used by the texas department of transportation. Txdot told dallas-fort worth broadcaster krld that there's no humor in what the hackers did.

The same roadside sign has now been changed twice in less than 48 hours. The sign, located along westbound interstate-30 at cockrell hill road in dallas, was first changed over the long memorial day weekend. The new message read \"party hardy yall! \" that prompted a swift response from txdot officials on monday. \"it has been removed, \" said txdot spokesman tony hartzel. \"and the contractor has taken steps to secure the sign. \" i don't think @txdot really meant to send this msg to drivers off i30 today in dallas. 🤔.

( published tuesday, may 31, 2016 ) someone altered three texas department of transportation electronic road signs over the holiday weekend and made their political preferences known to the world. The portable signs — which typically display messages like \" exit closed \" or \" lanes shift ahead \" — read \" bernie for president \" and \" donald trump is a shape-shifting lizard \" during the morning commute tuesday. Workers with txdot began turning the signs off shortly before 6 a.m. All the signs were found in west dallas. The \" trump \" sign greeted drivers headed west on interstate 30 as they approach the cockrell hill road exit. The \" bernie \" sign was positioned nearby on westmoreland road beneath i-30. A third sign that read \" work is canceled — go back home \" was later found on westmoreland road, just north of i-30. Txdot"

Rescuers say the call came in about 45 minutes after the collapse. \" there was a large pile of ice and rock that came down, \" says the county rep. \" in many ways, it was similar to an avalanche. \" a day earlier, a visitor to the caves, popular among hikers and only accessible by a narrow, 26-mile road, captured a partial collapse on video, but no one was injured in that case. Authorities have long considered the caves to be dangerous, particularly in warm weather — temps hit 80 degrees in the area yesterday — and signs warn of the risky conditions. They were installed after the last death at the caves, that of an 11-year-old girl hit by falling ice in 2010.",

            "Posted: tuesday, august 16, 2011 it may be the first-ever case of its kind: a diner was kicked out of a restaurant not for something she did, but apparently for something she said online. The social media smackdown happened at the down house restaurant in the heights, located at 1801 yale street. The down house owner chris cusack said the customer called the bartender a \" twerp \" on twitter, and the manager showed her the door. One of the restaurant's managers, who wasn't working that night, read the \" twerp \" comment on twitter. He called the bar and asked to speak to the customer. Over the phone, he asked her to leave. \" any business is allowed to set the tone of their establishment, \" cusack said. \" if you go to someone's house and start calling them names, i wouldn't really expect to stay too much longer after that. \" the kicked-out customer is allison hiromi. On her twitter page, she described herself as opinionated, extroverted and feisty. After being ask to leave the restaurant, she tweeted: \" left down house in tears after the gm called up and asked the bartender to hand me the phone. He proceeded to curse at me and ask me to leave. \" a lot"

Scientists, following up research showing tiny particles of plastic in everything from bottled water to salt, say they've found \" the first evidence for microplastics inside humans. \" all stool samples taken from eight participants of a small study by environment agency austria were found to contain plastic particles ranging in size from.002 to.02 inches, with 20 particles per 10 grams of excrement on average, report the new york times and guardian. Up to nine varieties of plastic were identified, with types used in bottles and caps ( polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate ) appearing the most often. The participants were as varied. Hailing from eight countries including the uk, japan, and russia, all ate food wrapped in plastic or drank from plastic bottles. Six consumed sea fish. This suggests plastic contamination during food processing or packaging and \" indicates a high likelihood that also many other people involuntarily ingest microplastics, \" philipp schwabl, lead author of the study yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, tells live science. Indeed, study authors say \" more than 50 % of the world population might have microplastics in their stools, \" per the guardian. While further research will explore what this means for human health, researchers say microplastics could transmit toxic chemicals and pathogens and affect the digestive system's immune response. \" the smallest microplastic particles are capable of entering the bloodstream, the lymphatic system, and may even reach the liver, \" says schwabl, mentioning particular concerns for people with gastrointestinal diseases.

Rodman's visit, the first since early 2014, comes at a time of growing us-north korea tensions. \" i know the trump administration has been trying half-heartedly to start a dialogue with the north koreans, \" analyst joel wit tells the los angeles times. \" it would be strange to use dennis rodman as an intermediary, \" he says, \" but under the trump administration a lot of things are possible that wouldn't have been with other administrations. \" when rodman suggested in 2014 that trump was interested in visiting pyongyang, trump tweeted: \" dennis rodman was either drunk or on drugs ( delusional ) when he said i wanted to go to north korea with him.

        "summary": "Over the next two days, washington will be a study in contrasts. Today, president obama and two key advisers will push for a diplomatic means of avoiding a nuclear iran; tomorrow, in a controversial speech to congress, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu will push back against the plan, the new york times reports. To set the scene: netanyahu left tel aviv yesterday for what he called \" a fateful, even historic, mission \" for which he is \" an emissary of all israel's citizens, even those who do not agree with me, and of the entire jewish people, \" reuters reports. His speech will likely call for boosted sanctions against iran, but obama has suggested he would veto any bill giving congress a chance to legislate on the matter. This weekend, netanyahu offered conciliatory words, saying he \" respected \" obama and that \" strength will prevail over differences of opinion. \" obama will meet reuters for an interview this afternoon, while national security adviser susan rice and un ambassador samantha power speak to the american israel public affairs committee, a group netanyahu will also address, the times reports. The paper sees the meetings as a chance for the administration to reaffirm its support for israel. Indeed, john kerry yesterday noted on abc's this week that netanyahu \" is welcome to speak in the united states, obviously. And we have a closer relationship with israel right now in terms of security than at any time in history, \" reuters reports. Kerry tomorrow will join international officials in switzerland as they look to outline an iranian deal by the month's end, the washington post reports. Kerry has been working closely — too closely, according to some iranian lawmakers — with iran's foreign minister to hammer out a deal, the times reports. \" he has made a huge investment of his time and energy in the talks, and his personal, hands-on involvement in recent months has been crucial to building momentum toward a deal, \" says an analyst. But some worry that iran could read kerry's \" eagerness \" as an opening to seek more concessions. Meanwhile, the un's nuclear agency says iran is coming up short on providing essential information, reuters reports. \" the ( iaea ) is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in iran is in peaceful activities, \" the agency's chief says.",

He married a 25-year-old lebanese model, while still married to estrada and welcomed his two youngest children with the young woman. Estrada's argument in court claimed that she needed to meet \" reasonable needs \" in the settlement including 1.2 million pounds per year just for clothes. More specifically, the ex-pirelli calendar girl requested more than $ 141,000 for haute couture dresses, $ 51,000 for fur coats and $ 27,000 for shoes each year, as well as five cars and wealthy homes in both london and beverly hills. Her initial request was for a settlement",
            "Christina estrada celebrated \"making history \" on friday when the former pirelli model won £ 75 million in cash and assets from her billionaire ex-husband, securing the largest \"needs award \" ever granted by an english court. Walid juffali, a saudi businessman who divorced ms estrada in 2013, was given three weeks to pay £ 53.5 million. He will also have to deliver a lamborghini to his former wife within a fortnight or hand over another £ 140,000. The total settlement - including assets worth a further £ 22 million - still represents less than half of the £ 196.5 million that ms estrada had requested. Her lawyers acknowledged that she had enjoyed an \"extraordinary and exorbitant life \" during her marriage to the saudi billionaire and this was \"reflected if not replicated \" in the high court judgment.",

Her lawyers said the total settlement, taking into account her assets, was about £ 75m, a figure that included a cash payment of £ 53m. In a statement, estrada said: \"i am very grateful for today's ruling. I have lived in the united kingdom since 1988 and am thankful for access to the british courts. I never wanted to be here. I always wanted to resolve the matter amicably. This process has been incredibly bruising and distressing. Walid and i were happily married for 12 years and have a beautiful daughter together.
