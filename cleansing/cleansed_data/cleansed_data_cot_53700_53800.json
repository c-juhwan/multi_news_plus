        "summary": "A disability rights organization that often takes hollywood to task for casting able-bodied actors to play the physically challenged is slamming the upcoming movie blind. The ruderman family foundation faulted alec baldwin's portrayal as a novelist who loses his sight in a car crash, reports the los angeles times. Calling the casting of a blind character by an able-bodied actor \" crip-face, \" president jay ruderman draws a direct parallel to blackface. Baldwin's casting \" is just the latest example of treating disability as a costume, \" he says in a statement. \" we no longer find it acceptable for white actors to portray black characters. Disability as a costume needs to also become universally unacceptable. \" neither baldwin nor director michael mailer have commented. Blind co-stars demi moore as a married socialite who falls for baldwin after she begins reading to him as part of community service. Vertical entertainment released the trailer wednesday, notes variety, and the film is set for release on july 14. Last july, the ruderman foundation released a report showing that although disabled people comprise 20 % of the us population, some 95 % of disabled roles on tv go to able-bodied actors. Marlee matlin later told a ruderman-organized conference, \" there is something wrong with this picture, \" she said, per the times. \" we as an industry keep talking about diversity … but, sadly, when we start speaking about diversity, disability seems to be left out far too often. \" ( one very real struggle for baldwin: lyme disease. )",

            "The upcoming film \"blind, \" starring alec baldwin as a novelist who loses his sight in a car crash, has drawn criticism for casting an able-bodied actor as the blind lead. The ruderman family foundation, a leading organization advocating for disability rights, spoke out against the film, accusing it of \"crip-face \" — a comparison to blackface — in having baldwin portray the main role. The private philanthropic group is known for advocating on behalf of casting disabled actors. \"alec baldwin in 'blind ' is just the latest example of treating disability as a costume, \" jay ruderman, the foundation's president, said in a statement to the l.a.

Disability as a costume needs to also become universally unacceptable. \" last summer, the foundation released findings that reveal although those with disabilities represent almost 20 % of the country's population, 95 % of disabled characters on television are played by able-bodied performers. The ruderman family also criticized the 2016 romantic drama \"me before you \" for casting sam claflin as a young banker who was left paralyzed from an accident. The trailer for \"blind \" was released wednesday, and co-stars demi moore as a married socialite who cares for baldwin's character as part of a plea bargain. The two develop a love affair, leaving moore's character to choose between baldwin's and her husband. The film, directed by michael mailer, premiered at the woodstock film festival on oct. 13.

        "summary": "The st. Louis suburb of ferguson, mo., was the scene of another evening of rioting and unrest last night as largely young, black crowds faced off against a mostly white police force that reportedly responded with tear gas, reports the los angeles times. But the family of slain teenager michael brown, 18, asked the community to remain peaceful so that no more lives will be lost. \" no violence, just justice, \" his mother told reporters. While some demonstrators got down on their knees with their hands raised in symbolic surrender, others shouted, \" we will stay out here as long as you are! \" some of the police did not appear to respond to the taunts, while others were caught on camera calling the protesters \" animals, \" reports cnn. Two very different stories have emerged surrounding the shooting of brown, who was set to start technical college yesterday, two days after he was killed, reports cnn in another review of the details. While the police report suggests brown, who'd been walking with a friend in the street, attacked an officer in his police car and tried to take his gun when the officer told him to use the sidewalk, witnesses say the officer fired after a verbal altercation and that as brown turned away and fled he was shot once, then at least twice more after he put his hands in the air. Police have not disputed that brown was unarmed. The police officer who shot him, a six-year veteran of the force, is on paid administrative leave. Usa today reports that one of brown's last facebook posts included the words: \" if i leave this earth today, at least youll know i care about others more then i cared about my damn self. \" the fbi, meanwhile, has taken over the investigation.",

After failing what cohen's character called a pedophile detector test, moore walked off the fake interview set. Moore, a republican, lost a special election for u.s. Senate last year to democrat doug jones.

Cohen posed as an israeli anti-terrorism expert col. Erran morad, who was interviewing moore when he mentioned a new piece of technology -- a device that detects",

He and another financial trader, mohammad esmaeel qasemi, were hanged after the iranian supreme court upheld the convictions, the los angeles times reports. A third person, who also was convicted, has an appeal pending. According to state media reports, mazloumin, 58, amassed two tons of gold coins. He was reportedly arrested in july and later tried by a special court recently set up to adjudicate suspected financial crimes. Several other people, often in televised trials, have also been convicted and sentenced to death, according to reports. Earlier this year, financial traders in iran did \"brisk business, \" per the times, as financial mismanagement by the government and renewed us sanctions decimated the iranian rial and many people traded their cash for dollars or gold. The iranian government blamed traders for the currency crisis and shortages of basic items, such as medicine and diapers, leading to police raids and the establishment of the special courts for economic crimes. Amnesty international tells the bbc that the resulting executions are \"horrific, \" saying that international law forbids the death penalty for \"non-lethal crimes, such as financial corruption. \" ( iran warns of \" war situation \" amid renewed sanctions. )",

The 35-year-old, who lives in suburban georgia, told the sponsor that because of the party, she had lost custody of the teen and another four children — ages 4, 6, 8, and 10 — who were with their father that night, usa today reports. Lenhardt was charged on monday with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, reports augusta crime. Lenhardt also told her sponsor that she woke up the night of the party to find her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend having sex with her. He is not being charged because she \" refuses to discuss the case, \" a police spokesman tells the new york daily news. According to the arrest report, lenhardt's sponsor said she was put in touch with her by a friend who went to the same sex-addiction group at a local church. A source tells the daily news that lenhardt, a former sunday school teacher who was raised in the mormon church, didn't start drinking until last fall when she separated from her husband, an iraq vet who came back with ptsd and anger issues. \" people who have never drunk a day in their life tend not to know how to handle their alcohol, \" the source says.",

Data has revealed that the cumulative amount of radioactive particles released into the atmosphere had reached levels that apply to a level 7 incident, reports the ap. So what is that estimate? according to two estimates, the equivalent of about 500,000 terabecquerels of radiation from iodine-131 has been released. The level 7 threshold is \" several tens of thousands of terabecquerels. \" but all 7s are not created alike: the wall street journal notes that officials were careful to say this this is still not a chernobyl-size disaster. \" the amount of released radiation is about a tenth of chernobyl \" — about 5.2 million terabecquerels — said a rep for japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency. But it could still top chernobyl in one regard: tepco today warned that the plant continues to release radioactive materials, and that the total levels emitted could eventually top those released by chernobyl. Level 7 also indicates widespread effects on the environment and health: the telegraph noted that japan's safety commission now says radiation in excess of the amount considered safe for humans during an entire year has been found as far as 37 miles from the plant; the evacuation zone is only 18 miles.

The decision was made after japan's nuclear safety body determined that at one point after the march 11 earthquake, the plant was releasing 10,000 terabecquerels of iodine-131 for several hours; level 7 accidents are defined as releasing tens of thousands of terabecquerels. \"the ines [ international nuclear and radiological event scale ] rating itself is not an indicator of a daily phenomena but the assessment after careful consideration and calculation on the event that happened in the past, \" ken morita of japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency ( nisa ) tells time.

The new york times has a different estimate, citing executives involved in the deal: olbermann must stay off tv for six to nine months, and can't talk about his departure, although he can work on the internet or in radio. His exit comes after years of behind-the-scenes conflict at msnbc, the times reports, noting that jeff zucker was one step away from firing him during his campaign contributions brouhaha in november. The usually prolific olbermann has tweeted only once since his departure, and the message — apparently since removed — read \"watchthisspace mlb.com baseball nerd blog returns 2/14. \" of course, that sparked all sorts of speculation that olbermann may return to his sports roots.

A large us expedition called wissard, led by a professor at montana state university, has unearthed a thriving ecosystem of micro-organisms after drilling through the thick ice to reach subglacial lake whillans in january of 2013, according to a university news release. Considered one of the planet's final frontiers, the subglacial environments below antarctic ice sheets have long been suspected to harbor life of some kind. Many of the micro-organisms found are single-celled organisms, called archaea, that survive by converting ammonium and methane into energy in a harsh environment similar to those found elsewhere in our solar system, such as on jupiter's moon europa. That has led scientists to wonder whether primitive ( but hearty ) life thrives there as well, forbes reports. \" it's the first definitive evidence that there's not only life, but active ecosystems underneath the antarctic ice sheet, something that we have been guessing about for decades, \" the lead author says. \" with this paper, we pound the table and say, ' yes, we were right.

            "Subglacial aquatic environments over the last several decades, by using ground penetrating radar and other remote sensing tools, scientists have discovered that under the massive antarctic ice sheets there lies a vast hydrological system of liquid water. This water exists because geothermal heat flow from below, coupled with pressure, movement, and the insulating nature of the ice sheet above, is great enough to maintain some areas at the base of the ice sheet above the freezing point, even in the extreme cold of antarctica. In topographic depressions there are hundreds of lakes, both large and small; some are isolated, but many are interconnected by water channels and large areas of saturated sediments, the water eventually running out into the southern ocean as the ice sheet becomes a floating ice shelf.

Special drilling and extraction techniques allowed scientists to tap into an active ecosystem half a mile below the surface of the west antarctic ice sheet, where life was found in a lake untouched by sunlight or wind for millions of years. The discovery raises the obvious question of what other extreme environments might be able to harbor life on our planet, or beyond. A team led by montana state university professor john priscu brought up samples from below the ice that contained single-celled microbes called archaea, which convert ammonium and methane into energy to survive and grow. \"we were able to prove unequivocally to the world that antarctica is not a dead continent, \" priscu said in a release. Similar expeditions have found sub-ice environments teeming with bacteria in recent years, but questions have been raised about possible contamination in the drilling process.

Wissard in order to explore one of these hydrological systems at the margin of the west antarctic ice sheet, we have organized an interdisciplinary project to access the subglacial environment. The whillans ice stream subglacial access research drilling project ( wissard ) is",
            "Tomorrow's edition of the journal nature will include a paper documenting the existence of microorganisms living far beneath antarctic ice. Special drilling and extraction techniques allowed scientists to tap into an active ecosystem half a mile below the surface of the west antarctic ice sheet, where life was found in a lake untouched by sunlight or wind for millions of years. The discovery raises the obvious question of what other extreme environments might be able to harbor life on our planet, or beyond. A team led by montana state university professor john priscu brought up samples from below the ice that contained single-celled microbes called archaea, which convert ammonium and methane into energy to survive and grow. \"we were able to prove unequivocally to the world that antarctica is not a dead continent, \" priscu said in a release. Similar expeditions have found sub-ice environments teeming with bacteria in recent years, but questions have been raised about possible contamination in the drilling process. The paper's lead author brent christner says with this latest effort",

Humanitarian coordinator for iraq, said that in the worst case scenario, some 1 million civilians could flee the city with 700,000 of them requiring shelter — overwhelming emergency sites that currently only have the capacity to hold 60,000 people. \" our capacity to support 700,000 people in the short-term — we couldn't do it.

The virus spreads through bodily fluids such as vomit and diarrhea; it's infectious when the victim shows symptoms and remains so after the patient's death. Many have contracted ebola by preparing a corpse for burial. Up to 60 % of patients will bleed from the eyes and skin. There is no cure, and antivirals aren't effective.

Weinstein, facing dozens of accusations of sexual assault and harassment, apparently believes the emails will exonerate him, the hollywood reporter notes. He has been fighting for months to get the emails, and dershowitz filed a declaration supporting the effort in delaware bankruptcy court on thursday. Weinstein's lawyer has \" a constitutional right to these materials while there are ongoing criminal investigations in order to present prosecutors with exculpatory information that could persuade them not to bring charges, \" dershowitz said in the filing, per deadline. He also stated that if weinstein — who's being investigated by authorities in two countries — is charged with a crime, \" he would of course have a constitutional right to all of his emails and other exculpatory materials. \" ( ashley judd is suing the disgraced producer for allegedly \" torpedoing \" her career after she rejected his advances. )",

        "summary": "Despite efforts to reclassify marijuana down to a schedule ii ( read: less dangerous ) drug, there are some people who still insist on its dangers — and new research may back those theories up. Scientists at king's college london have discovered that smoking potent, or \" skunklike, \" cannabis was tied to almost a quarter of all new psychosis cases they studied, the bbc reports. The study published in the lancet compared 410 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 who had experienced \" first-episode psychosis \" with 370 healthy patients. The results suggest that the development of psychosis — i.e., delusions and hallucinations — is three times greater for skunk smokers than for nonusers, and up to five times higher if they smoked it every day. Hashish, a milder form of cannabis that contains much less thc than the skunk variety, isn't linked to any increased risk for psychosis. English experts say that skunk cannabis is widespread, with one doctor telling the bbc, \" in london, it's very difficult to find anything else. \" anecdotal stories that back up the study's warnings are worrisome. One woman tells the bbc that, after smoking skunk pot, she \" went from someone who had never experienced any mental health issues whatsoever to an absolute wreck. \" a recovering addict who's now a drug counselor tells sky news that skunk is the \" incredible hulk of cannabis [ and is ] absolutely decimating young people's lives. \" still, despite the warnings, study researchers point out that, according to a 2010 study in the lancet, the three most harmful drugs are alcohol, crack cocaine, and heroin; cannabis falls at no. 8, notes channel 4 news. ( it's not the first time suspicions have been raised linking skunk cannabis to psychosis. )",

The international longshore and warehouse union is holding a drawing for 2,400 part-time jobs loading and unloading shipping containers at ports in the los angeles area, the los angeles times reports. While these part-time positions don't come with guaranteed hours or benefits, they do come with the possibility of getting promoted to full-time, unionized longshoreman — a position that had an average salary of $ 161,000 per year in 2016. It's not a sure thing and it can be a long wait — some workers have been stuck as part-timers for 13 years — but one woman who applied for the lottery calls it a \" once in a lifetime opportunity. \" the ilwu hasn't held this kind of drawing since 2004, the long beach press telegram reports. Back then, more than 250,000 people entered the lottery; up to a million may enter this time around. The times says it shows \" how desperate \" americans are to even get a shot at a \" stable, high-paying career working with their hands. \" that shot doesn't come without risks. The average part-time longshoreman earned just $ 31,000 in 2016. And while the ilwu says it's holding the drawing to avoid labor shortages at ports, according to the journal of commerce, some long-time part-timers warn of days on end without a shift and a tough lifestyle. The deadline for the entry into the drawing was earlier this month; the drawing is scheduled for feb. 6.",

It's a discovery, per recent coverage by news.com.au, that solved \" one of the biggest maritime mysteries. \" also, says archaeologist dieter noli, it's the oldest shipwreck ever found in sub-saharan africa. And there's treasure as well: included in the find were some 2,000 gold coins from spain and portugal, according to gainesville news. Upon unearthing the site of the shipwreck, per cnn, workers found pieces of metal, wood, and what looked like pipes. Not sure what they had found, they called in noli. \" it just looked like a disturbed beach, \" he told cnn earlier this month, \" but lying on it were bits and pieces. \" among those were a centuries-old musket and an elephant tusk. \" i thought, ' oh, no no, this is definitely a shipwreck, ' \" noli says. Ultimately, in addition to the gold, workers recovered cannons ( the pipes ), navigational instruments, tons of copper ingots, swords, and a lot more — some 5,438 artifacts. Not much of the actual structure of the ship remains. But archaeologists have matched the cargo with that of the bom jesus ( which means the \" good jesus \" ) based on details found in a 16th-century book that lists the ship as lost. The stretch of coastline is known for storms.

        "summary": "The hostility toward women gamers that was laid bare in 2014 during the gamergate controversy extends to the stereotype that female gamers are inferior to their male counterparts. So researchers at the university of california, davis, decided to track thousands of players in two multiplayer online role-playing games and compare just how quickly the players advanced to higher levels. And as cuihua \"cindy \" shen, an assistant professor of communication, reports in the journal of computer-mediated communication, when controlling for factors such as time devoted to playing, character choice, and membership in a player's guild, \" the gender differences disappear. \" in fact, she goes on to write for the conversation, \" women advanced at least as fast as men did. \" shen says the findings confirm certain differences in style of play, such as that men tend to focus on competing and gaining in-game status while women tend to play more socially and help others. But in terms of the bottom line: advancing to a higher level, the difference was nil among the 11,000 gamers they analyzed playing everquest ii and chevalier's romance iii. Aside from one study in 2009, vocativ reports that this is the first to figure out how to go about testing gender differences in gaming performance outside of a lab. Why does it matter? nearly half the gaming population is now female, yet they are represented at even lower numbers in stem fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. \" the stereotype that women are worse players at games could contribute to a self-fulfilling prophecy, \" shen says.

The daily dot reports yandy.com, a retail site known for its sexy costumes, yanked one based on the hulu series the handmaid's tale after \" confusion and disgust \" was the main reaction to it online. The costume, labeled \" yandy brave red maiden costume \" and listing for $ 64.95, consisted of a short red dress, matching red cape, and white bonnet. The sultry-looking blonde model sporting the costume wore black high heels. The accompanying description: \" an upsetting dystopian future has emerged where women no longer have a say. However, we say be bold and speak your mind in this exclusive brave red maiden costume. \" this all prompted an outcry on twitter, namely because the concept behind the hulu show, based on the margaret atwood novel, revolves around handmaidens who are raped and forced to carry pregnancies to term for elite families. Others tried to make light of it, noting that knockoffs of the handmaiden costumes are often worn at protests advocating for women's rights. And that seems to have been yandy's original intent, at least according to a statement it put out after the pushback started. \" it has become obvious that our … [ costume ] is being seen as a symbol of women's oppression, rather than an expression of women's empowerment, \" it said, adding that the costume has been pulled.",

            "Retail site yandy.com on thursday removed a sexy handmaid costume, inspired by the handmaid's tale, following outcry on social media. The halloween costume, which referred to both the dystopian margaret atwood novel and hulu series, was depicted as a bright red mini dress and cape with high heels.

The red cloaks and white bonnets worn by handmaids ( aka the fertile women in the fictional gilead who are subjected to ritualized rape and forced pregnancy ) in the handmaid's tale have been adopted as symbols of feminism. Most recently, women wore outfits inspired by the narrative to protest the confirmation of supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh. But the \"brave red maiden costume \" was much more revealing.

        "summary": "Nasa is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \" it's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star, \" says nicola fox of the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the telegraph: \" we will finally touch the sun. \" the nuts and bolts: the mission: the 10-foot probe will launch in july or august of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports cnn. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: the probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at nasa that touts \" humanity's first visit to a star. \" the heat: the probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees fahrenheit, reports orlando's wkmg. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: the probe's name has been changed to the parker solar probe to honor astrophysicist eugene parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in june, is a professor emeritus at the university of chicago, and the guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \" crazy. \" a first: this is the first time nasa has named a mission after a living scientist. \" i ' m certainly greatly honored, \" said the man himself, per space.com. Two puzzles: scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \" how is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the... Corona so much hotter than the solar surface? \" ( it's 3 million degrees fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees fahrenheit. ) why it matters: generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \" the more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen, \" writes loren grush at the verge.",

Doug powell of the aptly-named barfblog.com starts with a few foods he would never eat: sprouts: they can carry salmonella, listeria, and e. Coli, and require warm moisture to grow — just like bacteria. Raw shellfish: no matter how fancy the restaurant, don't risk it. Why? raw waste is in the water they call home. Raw milk: sure, people say unpasteurized milk is healthy and boosts the immune system. But the cdc says it also contains salmonella, listeria, campylobacter, and brucella. And a few general tips: take your meat's temperature: the trick is to insert the thermometer in sideways, and you ' ll want to hit a balmy 160 degrees. For fans of medium-rare burgers, food safety news has a not-so-gentle reminder about the dangers of salmonella. Don't trust sliced cantaloupes: the melon's soft, rough skin love bacteria and washing doesn't improve matters. And bacteria on the rind can get on the yummy interior when the melon is cut. The solution? store sliced melon in the fridge. Stay cool: keep your picnic foods in a cooler, not in the summer sun.

        "summary": "For your average big city mayor, admitting that you bought illegal drugs while in office would be the most damaging thing to happen in a day — but rob ford's not your average mayor. Soon after a press conference in which the crack-smoking, binge-drinking toronto mayor claimed his closet was empty of skeletons, a judge released evidence from witnesses — mainly ford staffers — who alleged he had abused drugs including cocaine and oxycontin, partied with prostitutes at city hall, racially abused a taxi driver, and attacked several staff members, reports the globe and mail, the toronto star, and the national post. Among the partially redacted allegations included in a huge police dossier on ford's activities: ford staffers worried about how their boss often drove drunk, sometimes in school zones. One staffer told police he was in the car with ford when the mayor downed a 12-ounce bottle of vodka in a few swigs, chasing it with gatorade. He says ford was frequently so drunk he was \" rambling and incoherent \" — and he and other junior staff members were often sent to buy alcohol. Staff members told police that some women came to the mayor's office saying ford had told them they could have a job after they smoked joints with him outside of bars. St. Patrick's day last year appears to have been a wild night even by rob ford standards, the police documents reveal. During celebrations, staffers say ford drank heavily from a bottle of vodka and was seen at city hall with a woman believed to be an escort. Against staffers ' advice, ford — who talked about \" going out then getting laid \" — then took a taxi to a bar, calling the driver a \" paki \" and throwing a handful of business cards at him. He later moved on to a second bar, where a waiter says he saw ford and an unknown woman apparently snorting cocaine. After an intoxicated ford stormed the dance floor, he was asked to leave. He then returned to city hall, where he continued to drink, attacked two staffers, and made lewd remarks to a female security guard before staffers managed to get him into a taxi home, according to witness statements. Upon arrival at the residence, a staffer who accompanied ford says the drunken mayor got in his own car and sped off. Toronto's city council has voted 37 to 5 to ask ford to step down, at least temporarily, but the increasingly isolated mayor is adamant about staying on. Meanwhile, ford motor co. Has told the mayor and his supporters to stop using its logo on t-shirts and other items, reports the",

            "Ford motor co., the second-largest u.s. Automaker, said it will protect its ford script and oval logo from use by supporters of embattled toronto mayor rob ford. Rob ford, 44, yesterday signed shirts emblazoned with �ford nation� incorporating the automaker�s logo at a united way charity event, the national post newspaper reported. The mayor said for the first time wednesday he bought illegal drugs while in office after admitting last week to using crack cocaine and being drunk in public. �ford did not grant permission for use of its logo, � jay cooney, a company spokesman, said wednesday by telephone. �we view it as an unauthorized use of our trademark and have asked it to be stopped.� ford reclaimed control of its blue oval logo last year after using it and other assets as collateral to borrow $ 23.4 billion in 2006 which allowed the company to weather the global financial crisis. The dearborn-based company regained control after moody�s investors service became the second major ratings company to upgrade the carmaker to investment grade. Rob ford�s revelation wednesday that he purchased illegal drugs while in office came amid questioning at a city hall meeting in which a majority of city councilors asked him to take a leave of absence to address his �challenges.� ford rose 2.3 percent to $ 17.10 at the close in new york.

To boardwine, however, and now according to a virginia court, he's entitled to see his young son, cnn reports. The virginia court of appeals'decision yesterday came down to semantics: in its judgment, the use of a turkey baster, which how bruce inseminated herself with boardwine's sperm in 2010, isn't enough to keep him out of the picture as the dad, per a virginia reproduction statute, the washington post reports. Bruce contended that because the couple never had sex and instead used \" noncoital reproductive technology, \" she was entitled to sole parenthood, per cnn. The court disagreed, writing in its decision: \" the plain meaning of the term ' medical technology'does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster. \" after making the conception plan, the couple's friendship started going south in october 2010 ( a few months into the pregnancy ) when they disagreed over baby names. She didn't call him when the baby was born, but when he found out, he started visiting. Bruce says those visits were \" strained, \" however, and she asked him to stop coming, which is when he sued for parental rights. Boardwine concedes the two agreed bruce would be the main parent, but he says they also agreed he could see the child as he pleased — all conditions they never agreed to in writing. The court awarded him joint legal custody and visitation. ( a twist in a similar case: a kansas sperm donor was forced to pay child support. )",

        "summary": "Moses farrow, brother to dylan farrow and adopted son of woody allen, minces no words when it comes to his sister's allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of their father: \" of course woody did not molest my sister, \" moses, 36, tells people. \" she loved him and looked forward to seeing him when he would visit. She never hid from him until our mother succeeded in creating the atmosphere of fear and hate towards him. \" he goes on to say that on the day in question, everyone who was in the house was in public, and neither woody nor dylan ever went off privately. \" i don't know if my sister really believes she was molested or is trying to please her mother, \" moses says, claiming that mia farrow often hit him when he was a child and went into rages if she was not obeyed. Moses is now estranged from his mother and many of his siblings, but is close to allen and his wife, moses ' adopted half-sister soon-yi previn. Moses calls the whole fiasco mia's \" vengeful way to pay [ allen ] back for falling in love with soon-yi. \" in a piece written last month, allen documentarian robert b. Weide noted that while moses, 15 at the time dylan accused allen, initially refused contact with his father, he recently told weide he's now \" finally seeing the reality \" of what happened and used the term \" brainwashing. \" dylan was quick to respond to her brother's public change of heart: she tells people, \" my brother is dead to me, \" adding, \" my mother never coached me. She never planted false memories in my brain. My memories are mine. I remember them. \" she also denies her mother hit anyone. Moses isn't the only one publicly doubting dylan's story: stephen king made waves monday when he responded to a new inquiry piece on the allegations by saying, \" boy, i ' m stumped on that one. I don't like to think it's true, and there's an element of palpable bitchery there, but... \" of course, salon reports, he followed that up with a tweet: \" have no opinion on the accusations; hope they're not true.

The washington post notes it's not exactly clear what a \" shoe camera \" is, but the man apparently was able to attach some kind of photographic device to his shoe and was testing it at home when the battery exploded, injuring his foot, officer david dexheimer tells the journal. After getting treatment for the minor burns he received from the mini-blast, the man confessed his unsavory intentions to a clergyman, who encouraged him to turn himself in to police, dexheimer says. There's a wisconsin law on the books that outlaws anyone from purposely installing a device to photograph or otherwise record under a person's clothes without that person's consent, but the man in this case caught a lucky break: per madison police chief mike koval's daily \" significant calls \" blog, \" the subject was counseled on his actions and released from the scene as no illicit video had been taken. \" koval notes there is an ongoing investigation, however.

Susan originally said only that her husband showed no alarm or discomfort, and she was awaiting the military's decision on the cause of death.

But while blue writes that it's \" hard not to feel a little bit sorry \" for watson, whom she calls \" less an arrogant bigot than an enthusiastic if misguided old man, \" adam rutherford says in the guardian that \" no one is interested in his racist, sexist views \" and that \" it turns out that just like dna, people are messy, complex, and sometimes full of hideous errors. \" meanwhile, his nobel is expected to net between $ 2.5 million and $ 3.5 million when it's up for auction on thursday, according to a christie's statement.

The news came just as avery was pursuing a $ 36 million civil lawsuit against a former prosecutor and sheriff, having recently been acquitted of a sexual assault for which he spent 18 years in prison. \" there are 36 million reasons why they should be doing this to him, \" davey quoted avery's brother as saying in a 2005 new york times article. It caught the eye of two graduate student filmmakers, who would spend the next decade creating making a murderer. The series has forced manitowoc to relive its darkest history and has left the county transformed, davey writes at the times following a return visit. While the county tourism office used to field calls about jogging paths and beaches, callers now question why the office would want to draw visitors to such a town. The local police and sheriff's departments, city hall, and even the manitowoc county historical society are forced to listen to \" yelling, cussing, and swearing, \" says an official. As for manitowoc residents, \" the talkative, curious people i had come upon a decade earlier … avoided any talk about making a murderer, or simply spotted my notebook and walked away, \" writes davey. One, however, said she was fearful of a rally in support of avery, scheduled for friday, per wbay. Even avery's mother, who ardently defends her son, says the calls for interviews are overwhelming. \" i ' m too old for this, \" she says. \" it's too much. \" read davey's full piece here.",

How much of a factor depends on the baby's age: the study found that 74 % of the younger infants who died ( ages newborn to 3 months ) were sharing a bed with another person or animal, while 39 % of the older infants ( ages 4 months to 1 year ) were surrounded by blankets, pillows, stuffed animals, or other objects.

Trending chart as thousands sought to protest president trump's chief strategist. Time twitter is demanding the nation #stoppresidentbannon. As confusion and anger swirled over president trump's executive order to restrict people from seven muslim-majority countries from entering the united states, the president signed another order giving chief strategist steve bannon a seat on the national security council. The #stoppresidentbannon hashtag exploded sunday as users deplored the ex-breitbart news chief's increased influence in the white house. Bannon — who was considered a controversial choice for chief strategist because of breitbart's tendency to share views many perceive as racist, sexist and anti-semitic — can now regularly attend meetings that deal with policy issues affecting national security. What twitter is saying: since when does the breitbart guy know more about national security than the joint chiefs and the cia? never! #stoppresidentbannon — ed turner ( @papabear7533 ) january 29, 2017 i wouldn't trust steve bannon to run the tilt-a-whirl, let alone the country i live in and love. #stoppresidentbannon — john pavlovitz ( @johnpavlovitz ) january 29, 2017 we know who's really in charge.

Other highlights in his interview with italy's corriere della sera, as per the ap: he's been the subject of comic-book-inspired street art and a fan recently offered him an imitation oscar, but francis isn't digging the whole superpope thing. \" i don't like ideological interpretations, this type of mythology of pope francis.
