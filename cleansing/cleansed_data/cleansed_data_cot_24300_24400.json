        "summary": "So long, tobacco: there's a new most-prized currency in america's prisons, at least according to a university of arizona phd candidate in sociology: ramen. Michael gibson-light's new study is the culmination of a year's worth of interviews with about 60 inmates at an unnamed \" male state prison in the us sunbelt, \" per a press release. The upshot: where cigarettes were once king, \" soup is money in here, \" as one convict says. But the reason behind the shift is essentially hunger. Gibson-light explains that in the early 2000s, a new vendor began supplying the food to the prison he studied in a bid to cut costs. He was told the price per meal was slashed from $ 2 to $ 1.25 as a result — and both quality and quantity took a hit. Specifically, three hot meals a day were no more. Weekday lunches are now cold, and on the weekends only two meals are served; all portion sizes were shrunk. With inmates working and exercising throughout the day, calories — and edible ones at that — became precious. The guardian reports an ominous anecdote from gibson-light: corrections officers suggested he not eat the prison food, so as to avoid any potential food poisoning. The most popular forms of currency don't change \" unless there's some drastic change to the value in people using it, \" says gibson-light, which signals to him how much food services has degraded. In terms of value, at the prison studied, ramen cost 59 cents a pack but was worth a lot more. One telling example: five hand-rolled cigarettes, worth $ 2, can be bought for just one package of ramen. ( the justice department, meanwhile, is phasing out privately run prisons. )",

        "summary": "Arkansas today issued its first gay-marriage licenses thanks to a rather bold deputy clerk in training, the arkansas times reports. The day after a judge struck down a state ban on gay marriage, about 50 couples arrived at the eureka springs courthouse this morning — and were told by the deputy county clerk that she wouldn't give out licenses because the county clerk was away. Apparently, she had called an attorney general for an opinion and, not hearing back, made the decision to shut down the courthouse, adds the times. Police even asked everyone to leave. But minutes later, deputy clerk in training jane osborne reopened the doors and said she was \" happy to do it. \" the first to marry were jennifer rambo, 26, and kristin seaton, 27, who'd slept outside the courthouse overnight in their ford focus and woke up every half hour so they wouldn't miss the opening. Rambo's reaction when the license was issued, according to the ap: \" thank god. \" formidable forces had opposed them, including a state law banning same-sex marriage and a 2004 constitutional amendment that passed with 75 % approval, arkansas news notes. But \" the fact that amendment 83 was popular with voters does not protect it from constitutional scrutiny, \" wrote county circuit judge chris piazza in his ruling.

The latest incident to make headlines comes from cannes, where four police officers surrounded a muslim woman and forced her to remove a veiled tunic on the beach, reports the telegraph. Images show her removing the garment ( she was clothed underneath it ) and apparently getting a ticket. Also in cannes, a woman with a tunic and headscarf was fined for not wearing \" an outfit respecting good morals and secularism, \" reports afp, which saw the ticket. Amid all this, sales of burkinis are on the rise, with non-muslim women apparently buying them in solidarity. See the bbc and france24. The burkini ban goes before france's highest administrative court on thursday, reports the times of israel.

After connecting with the couple through a surrogacy agency in california, jessica allen, 31, was implanted with an embryo in april 2016, reports abc news. Six weeks later, allen was told she was expecting twins and assumed the embryo had split in two. But that wasn't in fact the case. A month after allen gave birth in december, a dna test showed one of the two babies had developed from the embryo, while the other was allen's biological child, reports the new york post. \" we were floored, \" says allen, who, in a rare case of superfetation, had become pregnant while already pregnant, per abc. A doctor tells live science that fewer than a dozen cases of superfetation are recorded in medical literature. Though more cases may go unreported or even unnoticed, superfetation is extremely uncommon because, for one thing, a woman usually stops ovulating when pregnant. After allen was implanted with the embryo, however, her ovaries released another egg that was fertilized. Allen had no contact with the two infants immediately after birth, but she says she knew they weren't twins when she saw a photo showing \" one was much lighter than the other, \" per abc; allen is white, while her husband is black. The post describes the complicated legal battle that followed before the couple gained custody of their son in february. They now describe him as an unexpected treasure.

The world war ii movie about the evacuation of allied troops from the city in france boasts a 92 % score from critics on rotten tomatoes, along with a 90 % score from audiences. Director christopher nolan in particular is winning praise for the film, whose stars include tom hardy, kenneth branagh, and mark rylance. Some samples: kenneth turan, los angeles times: the film's greatest accomplishment \" is to make us feel an almost literal fusion with its story. It's not so much that we've seen a splendid movie, though we have, but as if we've been taken inside a historic event, become wholly immersed in something real and alive. \" chris klimek, npr: the cinematography is spectacular, writes klimek. \" subjects as ordinary as the foamy, mashed potato-like sand on the beach take on a hypnotic effect. \" which prompts a related question: \" is it ethical to make a war movie this beautiful? \" calvin wilson, st. Louis post-dispatch: \" seldom has a film so eloquently captured the craziness, brutality, and arbitrariness of war, \" he writes. Dunkirk \" just might be nolan's masterpiece. \" david edelstein, vulture: if all the praise is too much, edelstein provides some relief, complaining that nolan's \" cavalry-is-coming cliff-hangers are eye-rollers — overlong, corny, and clunkily edited. \" and, he adds, \" when the structure of dunkirk becomes visible, when it stands as a mathematical demonstration of brave individual choices lining up in a tidy row, you might realize that you've been had. \"",

According to a study published in jama network open, the former results in \"significantly greater drug effects, cognitive and psychomotor impairment, and higher blood thc concentrations \" than the latter. And just how did the researchers with johns hopkins behavioral pharmacology research unit make this determination? seventeen participants volunteered to get stoned for science, live science reports. During six 8.5-hour sessions, the participants, who had used pot but not in the previous 30 days before the study began, smoked or vaped marijuana with 0mg, 10mg, or 25mg of thc. After consuming the weed, the participants filled out a questionnaire about their degree of intoxication and then went through a bunch of physical and cognitive test ( \"the apex of weed-enabled fun, \" live science quips ). People can use the study's findings to settle on an appropriate dose for their method of ingestion, michael lynch director of the pittsburgh poison center, tells nbc. \"people often create an equivalency between vaping and smoking, assuming that if you're using the same amount of the drug the effects will be similar, \" he says. \" … the effects aren't the same, and the same dose could lead to more negative or adverse effects. \" those include dry mouth, irritated eyes, memory impairment, and trouble performing routine tasks. As for why vaping results in a stronger high, one researcher thinks it's because there's no combustion so none of the pot is destroyed. As vaping marijuana becomes more popular, so do vape cartridges, which are akin to e-cigarettes. But buyer beware. Marijuana business daily reports that counterfeit, \"potentially unsafe \" vape cartridges are becoming more and more common, especially in unlicensed shops and states where pot is illegal.",

Usa today notes that such events are very few and far between in the us, and it describes traders as \" standing around looking at blank trading terminals. \" it's the day of computer headaches: a glitch grounded all united flights for two hours this morning.

Big names like james patterson won't suffer, nor will romance, sci-fi, and commercial fiction writers, all of whom have adapted to lower prices or have enough of an audience to do well no matter where they're sold.

In 2010, cafeteria staff had a meeting with school administrators to discuss the possibility that williams was mismanaging money, but concerns were dismissed and police were not contacted. ( the school system says the meeting was about other concerns, not money. ) in october 2017, administrators discovered irregularities, contacted law enforcement, and started an investigation that revealed hundreds of unauthorized purchases made from an account williams had controlled and supervised. The probe found that williams allegedly made unapproved debit card charges from the account at amazon, walmart, grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, resorts, and other stores, as well as used the card to pay her utility and tax bills; she also allegedly wrote unapproved checks from the account and took money from cafeteria money deposits, wsls reports. She allegedly did so by falsifying audit reports, inflating numbers in order to take funds from the government's free and reduced lunch program, and taking money from student meal plans. In announcing the allegations, the radford city commonwealth's attorney called out the ignored 2010 warning as well as \" negligent record management, lackadaisical security measures, and careless accounting efforts. \" in a statement, the school says it is \" taking all reasonable steps to recover the funds misappropriated by our former employee and...

The ruling mandates that on the 26th of each month until june 2016, all dent county courthouse and judicial building flags be lowered to \" below half-staff, \" the salem news reports.

Van der merwe and his surgical team at tygerberg hospital in cape town, south africa, recently completed their second successful penile transplant — this time on a 40-year-old man who lost his penis 17 years ago during a botched circumcision ritual. The team performed the world's first penile transplant in 2014. The unnamed patient is doing well and should have complete sexual and urinary function within six months. It's said he got \" quite emotional \" when he saw his new penis, the international business times reports. \" for these men the penis defines manhood and the loss of this organ causes tremendous emotional and psychological distress‚ \" times live quotes dr. Amir zarrabi as saying. The world has seen only three penile transplants — one was performed last year in boston, upi notes — but there's a big need for the surgery in south africa, where it's estimated there are up to 250 penile amputations every year due to traditional circumcision rituals. As an initiation rite, young men are circumcised with a spear tip then sent into the wilderness for weeks, during which time infection often sets in. The transplant procedure requires reconnecting tiny blood vessels, nerves, muscles, and the urethra and making sure blood can flow for erections. It's complicated by cost, a lack of donors, and the need to use medical tattooing to match skin tones. Doctors are trying to figure out how to reduce the cost while increasing donors.

The kennebec journal digs into how those two facts came to be, and presents a picture of a man who wasn't the woodsman you might expect: he didn't hunt, fish, forage for food, or grow it. In fact, he says he never even built a fire, fearing the smoke would give him away. ( he did, however, have a propane stove. ) a former member of maine's warden service says these choices were conscious ones: \" he had a very well-thought-out plan, how to survive in extreme conditions, and i think it's extraordinary. \" in lieu of fires, he likely stayed warm by using a number of sleeping bags, elevated off the ground. Those sleeping bags, along with the propane stove and everything else in his possession, with the exception of his glasses, were stolen from area camps, reports the bangor daily news. His camp featured a makeshift landfill, an overturned bucket he used as a chair, and a transistor radio that he used to listen to a rock station and rush limbaugh.

Disney is banning the device — generally a pole with a camera stuck on the end of it — at all its theme parks because of safety concerns, reports the orlando sentinel. Just this week, someone pulled one out on a roller coaster at disney california adventure park, even though the sticks had been previously banned from rides. The stunt caused the coaster to shut down for an hour. Disney is joining a trend in banning selfie sticks, which already are outlawed at many renowned museums both in the us and abroad and at some big-league sporting events, reports usa today. Part of the reason is so nobody's view gets obstructed during the grand pose. Starting tuesday, selfie sticks will be confiscated at the gate from disney visitors, who will be allowed to pick them up later if they wish.",

Ron wright of the reynoldsburg police department, which is investigating hughes'death. Coroner's office records show syringes laced with fentanyl and a plastic bag with cocaine residue were found at hughes ' home, where he died. In addition, an open package of fentanyl was found in hughes ' living room, as well as closed packs of fentanyl, lsd, and heroin — all from the police department's evidence room, wright tells wcmh. Hughes had just been appointed police chief in march, after the previous chief stepped down due to \" irreconcilable differences \" with kirkersville's mayor. Meanwhile, an advocate probe shortly after hughes was named chief revealed \" a history of being on the wrong side of the law and multiple issues while employed at other law enforcement agencies, \" including a disorderly conduct charge at a fast-food eatery and an alleged relationship he had with a female inmate after she was released from jail. Wright says if it's definitively determined hughes took the drugs out of the evidence room himself, there won't be anyone to charge. He's hoping to get the ohio attorney general's office to step in and look further into the case. \" it's kind of gone beyond our level, \" he says. \" we think the state should probably intervene. \" hughes, 35, was married with three young kids, the new york post notes.",

        "summary": "Even as the election outcome intensifies america's abortion debate, a comprehensive new survey finds the annual number of abortions in the us has dropped to well under 1 million, the lowest level since 1974, reports the ap. The report, which counted 926,200 abortions in 2014, was released tuesday by the guttmacher institute, which supports abortion rights. The total from 2014 represented a drop of 12.5 % from guttmacher's 2011 data showing 1.06 million abortions that year. The decrease was spread nationwide; in only six states did abortions increase over the three-year span. The abortion rate of 14.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in 2014 was the lowest rate since abortion was legalized nationally in 1973. The number of abortions in the us rose steadily after the supreme court's roe v. Wade decision, reaching a peak of 1.6 million in 1990 before starting a decline. Guttmacher researchers say the latest phase of the decline was likely the result of increased availability of affordable, long-lasting contraceptives and the surge of abortion restrictions in many states that have forced some clinics to close and hindered many women's access to the procedure. According to the report, the number of abortion clinics nationwide declined by 6 % from 839 in 2011 to 788 in 2014. Planned parenthood, a major supplier of contraceptives, provided more than one-third of the nation's abortions in 2014. Republicans are now seeking to halt its federal funding.",

A roundup of reactions: politico describes mcmaster, author of a 1997 book on america's mishandling of the vietnam war, as \" one of the military's leading warrior-scholars \" and predicts that he will help trump build bridges with gop defense hawks like john mccain, who praised mcmaster on monday as \" a man of genuine intellect, character, and ability. \" retired lt.

Cosmopolitan rounds up eight things to know about mcmaster, including the fact that he \" is known for standing up for his beliefs \" and was chosen as one of time's \" 100 most influential people \" in 2014.

Sentenced to life in prison, montoya served more than 13 years before his conviction was overturned and he was released in 2014. Now montoya, 31, has filed a $ 30 million federal lawsuit against denver and police officers that were involved, saying his civil rights were violated, the denver post reports. There was no physical evidence tying montoya to the murder of 29-year-old emily johnson, according to the lawsuit. And despite denying involvement 65 times during a 2½-hour interrogation, the lawsuit alleges, authorities used \" false evidence ploy, manipulation, minimization, threats, false promises, and other coercive tactics \" to finally secure a confession from montoya, ultimately leading to the teen's conviction. At the trial, the post reported at the time, the jury foreman said jurors didn't buy montoya's alibi that he was at his girlfriend's house when johnson was fatally beaten by assailants who showed up at her home to steal her lexus. And they believed the testimony of montoya's cellmate, who said the teen told him about the attack. While the lawsuit claims montoya had no involvement in the murder or car theft, he does admit to being in the lexus for a 20-minute joyride later in the day and not telling police. Upon his release in 2014, he pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact, for which he was sentenced to time served. At that time, per cbs, montoya's pro bono lawyer claimed he was \" falsely accused and wrongfully convicted. \" the da disagreed, saying montoya declined a plea deal in 2000 and took his chances with a jury trial.

How users would listen to their tunes, alerts, and alarms: via third-party bluetooth headsets or with lightning-based headphones, per macworld. The japanese blog adds that the new iphone would come bundled with lightning earpods. This would effectively force makers of third-party 3.5mm headphones to include lightning adapters with their product or make them \" lightning port only \" to be licensed to work with apple products, forbes notes. Moving to this new standard would increase licensing and revenue potential for apple, help the company lock users into its \" ecosystem \" with sales of lightning headphones, and let apple develop \" smart \" earphones and headphones that could be used for a variety of applications, gordon kelly writes for forbes. But gizmodo uk says if the rumors pan out, it would herald an age of \" super-slim smartphones gone mad, \" noting that it would \" save only a measly 1mm of pocket space, \" may negatively affect battery size, and force those with noncompatible headphones to pay for a converter. \" apple's always been unafraid of forcing change on a sometimes-unprepared industry, \" gizmodo notes. \" we may all be forced to keep up. \" ( it ' ll be interesting to see if the iphone 7's sales will beat the last major round. )",

        "summary": "The financing of the wolf of wall street was \" a case of life imitating art, \" prosecutors say — with shady malaysian officials standing in for leonardo dicaprio's stock-swindling character. On wednesday, the justice department accused malaysian officials of plundering more than $ 3.5 billion from the country's 1mdb economic development fund and using the proceeds to finance the hollywood movie and pay off gambling debts, as well as to buy luxury us real estate, hotels, a $ 35 million jet, and art, including works by vincent van gogh and claude monet, nbc news reports. The feds, who accuse officials of defrauding the malaysian people \" on an enormous scale, \" are trying to seize around $ 1 billion in assets that were bought using money laundered through american banks. \" in seeking to seize these forfeited items, the department of justice is sending a message that we will not allow the united states to become a playground for the corrupt, \" says eileen decker, the us attorney in los angeles, per the ap. \" and we will not allow it to be a platform for money laundering or a place to hide and invest in stolen riches. \" a civil lawsuit has been filed but not criminal charges. The wall street journal notes that the case, which is the largest ever handled by the justice department's anti-corruption unit, is likely to cause a confrontation between the us and malaysian governments, especially since sources say the \" malaysian official 1 \" referred to 32 times in the complaint is none other than malaysian prime minister najib razak.

        "summary": "When you think about dangerous things your young child might accidentally ingest, pills, marbles, and common household cleaners probably come to mind. But a new study out of ohio's nationwide children's hospital suggests pot should be added to the list. Researchers found that more kids are being exposed to marijuana — by the age of 5, they report in clinical pediatrics. Between 2006 and 2013, the marijuana exposure rate rose 147.5 % among kids 5 and under, according to a press release — and it rose nearly 610 % during that period in states that legalized medical marijuana before the year 2000 ( by our count, five ). During the 2000 to 2013 period, there were 1,969 marijuana exposures reported among this group to poison control centers; that's an average exposure rate of 5.90 per million children, with the 2013 rate at just above 10 per million. While that's modest, and while most consequences were minor, 17 kids experienced comas and 10 had seizures. Of the children exposed, nearly 78 % were under three, with the average age being 1.81. Three-quarters of the exposures happened via ingestion ( 15 % were via inhalation ) — likely due to the popularity of pot brownies, cookies, and candy, which the study calls \" attractive \" to young children. \" very young children explore their environments by putting items in their mouths, \" notes one co-author. Researchers are particularly concerned about how quickly the rate of exposure rises when states legalize pot — nearly 16 % per year in states where legalization occurred between 2000 and 2013, with a bigger increase in the first year of legalization. \" with more states likely to legalize marijuana, \" the study says, pot products should be covered by the same protection requirements as medication and household chemicals — think childproof containers.

Officials say the soldier drove a jeep toward the joint security area — the only portion of the dmz where south and north korean troops stand face-to-face — but was forced to make a run for it when a wheel came loose, the bbc reports; the ap describes one of the car's wheels as falling in a ditch. He \" continued fleeing south across the line as he was fired upon by other soldiers from north korea, \" according to the us-led united nations command. South korean troops crawled to rescue the man after he took cover behind a building on their side. Military officials say the man was in critical condition tuesday after surgery to remove five bullets. Doctors say he has injuries to his internal organs and may have another two bullets inside him but they believe his life can be saved. About 40 rounds were reportedly fired in total. This was the first shooting in the joint security area since a soviet citizen defected to the south korean side in 1984. South korean defense minister song young-moo told lawmakers tuesday that this was the first time north korean soldiers have fired into the southern sector of the jsa, marking a possible violation of the armistice agreement.

Green river killer gary ridgway pleaded guilty to killing 48 women ( a 49th victim was ided in 2011 ), but he tells komo's charlie harger the true number could be closer to 80. The story of how the five months of interviews came to be is pretty fascinating: harger met an air force criminal investigator named rob fitzgerald, who has dedicated his weekends for much of the past five years to searching for remains of ridgway's female victims — largely prostitutes, runaways, and drug addicts. And it turns out he has an unlikely assistant in his quest: ridgway. The two speak as many as four times a week, with ridgway calling from the walla walla prison in which he's spending the rest of his life, providing details on possible \" dump sites. \" harger, shocked to hear ridgway was talking, managed to get to him as well. Ridgway reiterated to harger that his goal is to help: he says at least 20 bodies are still out there, and he wants to help police find them. Harger's not so sure about that, though; he notes that for all of ridgway's assistance, fitzgerald has yet to find any remains ( ridgway apparently attributes that to decomposition or animals ). Harger theorizes that ridgway may just be attempting to \" up his count, \" and notes that he complained that ted bundy is a household name, and he isn't.

The 8.5-mile-long tunnel connects the asian and european sides of istanbul, with 4,593 feet of it running under the bosporus, the strait that connects the black sea to the sea of marmara and cleaves the city in two. Turkish officials say that at more than 60 yards deep, it is the deepest submerged railway tunnel of its type in the world, and al jazeera reports it was built to weather a 9.0-magnitude earthquake. And with the ability to handle 1.5 million daily travelers, the independent reports that it's expected to do wonders for the notoriously traffic-ridden city. But not all of turkey's people think it's a project worth celebrating. Many have argued the \" lavish \" project, oked by prime minister recep tayyip erdogan, then mayor of istanbul, is unnecessary. And then there were the delays, and erdogan's reaction to them: the project began in 2005; a scheduled 2009 completion date came and went, in part due to important archaeological finds, including a 4th-century byzantine port, reports the ap. This was ergodan's rather unwelcome reaction to the discovery: \" first [ they said ] there was archaeological stuff, then it was clay pots, then this, then that. Is any of this stuff more important than people? \" ( israel uncovered a tunnel of a very different nature this month. )",

The lawsuit hinges on voskerician's agreement to sell zuckerberg rights to land beside zuckerberg's home in palo alto, calif., as the internet mogul was snapping up $ 39 million in neighboring properties. Zuckerberg bought the rights, but voskerician's lawsuit claims that zuckerberg reneged on his promise to introduce the developer to silicon valley bigwigs associated with apple, facebook, and google, the new york times reported in march. Zuckerberg's private eye allegedly harassed voskerician friend james sagorac while investigating the suit: \" i feel that my family and my girlfriend have been contacted in an effort to slander me and to intimidate me from testifying in this case, \" says sagorac in a court filing. Sagorac's role: he claims to have fielded a $ 4.3 million offer for the property, which voskerician sold to zuckerberg at a \" discount \" price of $ 1.7 million.

            "Two tourists received an unfriendly welcome to san francisco when, in a bizarre incident, they were shot with blow darts while walking along the golden gate bridge, authorities said. A man flagged down a california highway patrol officer friday afternoon to report that he had been hit in the thigh by a long metal dart, which went through his jeans and pierced his skin, chp spokesman andrew barclay said. The dart was nearly five inches long — one end had a white plastic cap and the other was sharpened to a point — and appeared to have been fired from a blow gun, barclay said. The man had removed the dart, but the officer called an ambulance out of precaution, he said. As the officer was speaking with the man, a woman approached them to report that she too had been hit in the kneecap by a dart. \" i've never heard of something like this, \" barclay said. \" it seems very random, and it doesn't appear that either of the victims was targeted for any reason specifically.... Neither of them had had any arguments. \" authorities believe the darts may have been fired out of a car passing by because of the location of the victims ' wounds. The two had been walking southbound on the east sidewalk of the bridge toward vista point",

        "summary": "Just last month, penn state shut down a fraternity for three years over findings of sexual harassment and hazing. Now a former member of that frat, kappa delta rho, has filed a lawsuit against the fraternity and penn state saying he approached school officials in april 2014 about the abuse and saw his efforts ignored, usa today reports. Only when he talked to college police this year did the school bother to investigate, he says. In the suit, 21-year-old james vivenzio claims that during hazing he was burned with cigarettes and endured lineups that included \" force-feeding bucketfuls of liquor mixed with urine, vomit, hot sauce and other liquid and semi-solid ingredients. \" he also played physically risky \" gladiator \" games and downed booze until he threw up, the suit says. But school officials say they \" strongly dispute \" vivenzio's version of events, the ap reports. Penn state's side: vivenzio was unwilling to file a complaint, provide documents, talk to campus cops, or take part in a \" formal disciplinary process... Despite repeated encouragement from university staff. \" the university adds that vivenzio didn't show them a private facebook page with photos of naked, unconscious women that fueled the abuse scandal; police did that earlier this year, the school says. Also today, kappa delta rho's national office kicked out 38 members from the penn state chapter for violating fraternity values in the scandal. But that won't affect the students'status at penn state, the ap notes, and the post-gazette reports that school officials won't say whether any students have been sanctioned. ( read about nasty comments that surfaced on the frat's facebook page. )",

        "summary": "Days after samsung recalled its galaxy note 7 smartphones because they were catching fire, some stores in the us were still selling them, the new york times reports. According to the wall street journal, the us consumer product safety commission didn't even issue a statement on the hazardous phones until sept. 9 — one week after samsung's recall — and didn't issue its own official recall notice until thursday. Experts say that in its haste to recall the note 7, which was being called the \" most impressive smartphone ever \" when it was released last month, samsung botched the execution, especially in the us where it failed to coordinate with the cpsc the recall of 2.5 million phones in 10 countries — the largest recall in smartphone history — has already cost samsung up to $ 14 billion in market value and could set it back years in the credibility department. \"samsung cannot afford to lose an inch of competitive ground to apple in its home us market, \" one expert says. The official cpsc recall comes just one day before the apple iphone 7 is being released, cnn reports. The cpsc is asking that all 1 million note 7s sold in the us be turned off immediately. There have been 26 reports of burns and 55 reports of property damage from the exploding phones in the us alone. And thanks to samsung's questionable execution of its recall, delivery of safer replacement phones to us customers could be delayed.",

        "summary": "Four young men who were repeatedly raped by their catechism teacher have received one of the catholic church's biggest-ever settlements with abuse victims. The new york diocese of brooklyn says the men, who were abused between the ages of 8 and 12 and are now ages 19 to 21, will receive $ 6.875 million each under the terms of the settlement, nbc news reports. Angelo serrano, former director of religious education at st. Lucy's-st. Patrick's church, was arrested in 2009 after one of the boys told his mother about the abuse. The 67-year-old is currently serving a 15-year sentence. Lawyers for the victims say other boys were severely abused, but \" the statute of limitations prevents their claims from being brought. \" after the victims sued, the diocese argued that it shouldn't be held responsible for the abuse because serrano was officially a volunteer, not an employee, even though he received a stipend from the church, the new york times reports. A judge, however, found that priests and parish workers ignored signs of abuse, including the fact that serrano regularly had young boys sleep over at his apartment. In a deposition, father stephen lynch admitted that he had seen serrano inappropriately embrace an 8- or 9-year-old boy and kiss him on the lips. \" these were egregious incidences of sexual abuse, \" attorney ben rabinowitz tells the new york post. \" and this all happened after the priests were taught to recognize the signs of abuse. \"",

Serrano kiss an 8- or 9-year-old boy on the mouth and inappropriately embrace the boy. A church secretary, beatrice ponnelle, who shared an office with mr. Serrano, also testified about questionable behavior.

In 2015, a german court ruled in their favor, saying the girl's contract with facebook passed to her parents when she died, according to the country's inheritance laws. But on wednesday a berlin appeals court overturned this ruling, reports reuters, saying that the right to private telecommunications ( not just of the daughter but of the people she was chatting with ) trumps the right to inheritance. It adds that the contract between facebook and the girl was terminated upon her death, so it could not be passed on posthumously. The parents wanted to be able to read the girl's chat messages and posts to investigate whether she'd been the target of bullying, reports the bbc. Facebook declined their request, arguing for the privacy rights of the teen's contacts. The guardian reports the unnamed girl had reportedly provided her mother with her password when she was 14, but her account was upon her death converted to a \" memorialized \" one, which blocks all login attempts and allows loved ones to post their goodbyes. Facebook wouldn't reveal which of her facebook friends requested the account be memorialized; that person would have had to submit proof of her death. The parents could appeal this week's verdict.

Marko cheseto, 35, finished 613th overall out of nearly 53,000 runners at the new york city marathon on nov. 4, the anchorage daily news reports. Two days later, he became a us citizen. Cheseto, who's from kenya, went to anchorage in 2008 on an athletic scholarship, quickly earning honors in track and cross-country. Grieving the death of another anchorage runner from kenya, cheseto disappeared in the woods near campus in november 2011, his senior year of school. Temperatures dipped to the single digits, and it snowed more than a foot. On the third day he was missing, cheseto stumbled back with his shoes frozen to his feet, resulting in amputations. Fitted with a pair of running blades, cheseto began running again 18 months later. He graduated from college, got married, and had three children. He remained in anchorage until his move to orlando, fla., earlier this year to work and train at prosthetic &amp; orthotic associates. Cheseto finished the marathon last week in 2 hours, 52 minutes, 33 seconds — about 10 minutes off the world record for a double-leg amputee. \" i was happy with my time, \" cheseto said. \" my biggest challenge was going over the bridges, and sharp inclines. \" cheseto said one of his goals \" is to run with elites in one of the major marathons. \" \" the ultimate goal is to break the overall world record and finish a marathon in less than two hours, \" stan patterson, poa's head prosthetist, notes. \" we believe that marko is the man to do it. \" ( a double amputee conquered everest. )",

King albert i had set off on a solo climb amid the area's 600-foot-tall peaks on the 17th, having instructed his valet to wait in the car, reports the washington post. Alone, the king fell to his death. Conspiracy theories have lived on in the eight decades since: with no witnesses to the 58-year-old's fall, \" ' mise-en-scène'scenarios \" abounded, explains the study, published in forensic science international: genetics. Some insisted the king was murdered in another location, with his body either placed at marche-les-dames later or never traveling there at all. Forensic geneticist maarten larmuseau's research kills those potential plotlines, explains a press release. He found two living and willing relatives — a former prime minister of bulgaria from albert's father's side and a german baroness from his mother's — and compared their dna to that on some of the bloody leaves. The y-chromosome and mitochondrial genome comparison provided \" strong evidence that king albert i was indeed the donor of the blood stains. \" larmuseau calls his study \" one of the last possibilities to gather additional data.... The story that the dead body of the king has never been in marche-les-dames or was only placed there at night has now become very improbable.

        "summary": "Yesterday's surprising deal on climate change between the us and china came about after a personal letter from president obama to his chinese counterpart last spring, reports the guardian. But while xi jinping will presumably face no substantive opposition from chinese lawmakers on the goals to cut carbon emissions, president obama is in a much different boat, writes alan yuhas in a separate guardian piece. It's true that this isn't a formal treaty and thus doesn't require senate approval, but that doesn't mean mitch mcconnell and other republicans are powerless. The president may have authority over the epa, but it's congress that has authority over the money it gets. \" when the next bill containing the epa's budget — or the next omnibus piece of legislation to keep the entire government running — comes round, republicans can attach provisions called ' riders'that would undermine, defund, and restrict parts of the climate plan, \" writes yuhas. As he and the los angeles times point out, that could force obama to choose between signing legislation that undermines his own agenda or vetoing it and triggering a government shutdown. Republicans have plenty of other legislative tricks at their disposal, and it's safe bet they ' ll use them: as lots of stories point out, oklahoma republican jim inhofe is taking over the senate's environmental panel, and he's the author of a book called the greatest hoax: how the global warming conspiracy threatens your future.",

            "Obama's agreement with china does not need senate approval but the republican majorities in both houses have an array of tactics to frustrate it while chinese apparatchiks will, presumably unquestioningly, jump to realize president xi jinping's order to reduce carbon emissions in an ambitious deal with the united states, barack obama will come home to a newly elected congress that will probably tell him to neuter his climate change agenda or be prepared for the kind of knock-down, drag-out fight that could potentially end with a government shutdown. Republicans, led by presumptive new senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell, of coal-loving kentucky, have already criticized the beijing agreement. But what can mcconnell and the gop really do to stop it? the deal is not a formal treaty, so obama will not need the senate to approve it.

            "Obama's agreement with china does not need senate approval but the republican majorities in both houses have an array of tactics to frustrate it while chinese apparatchiks will, presumably unquestioningly, jump to realize president xi jinping's order to reduce carbon emissions in an ambitious deal with the united states, barack obama will come home to a newly elected congress that will probably tell him to neuter his climate change agenda or be prepared for the kind of knock-down, drag-out fight that could potentially end with a government shutdown. Republicans, led by presumptive new senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell, of coal-loving kentucky, have already criticized the beijing agreement. But what can mcconnell and the gop really do to stop it? the deal is not a formal treaty, so obama will not need the senate to approve it.

Mountaintop mining involves blasting the top off mountains to get at the coal underneath, but the resulting rubble wreaks havoc on the streams and valleys below. The obama administration has been taking a critical look at the practice. Arch coal got permission from the bush administration in 2007 to go ahead with its spruce mine no. 1, but the project's been hung up in court challenges ever since. It vows to appeal, notes the wall street journal: \" we remain shocked and dismayed at epa's continued onslaught with respect to this validly issued permit, \" says a company spokeswoman, who warns that it means the loss of 250 future jobs. Expect a big pushpack from the state's lawmakers as well.",

The final epa decision document withdrawing the clean water act section 404 permit is available here. Epa has also now posted some appendices to that document, including a response to comments. Epa officials this morning were alerting west virginia's congressional delegation to their action, and undoubtedly preparing for a huge backlash from the mining industry and its friends among coalfield political leaders. In making its decision to veto the u.s.

The epa said thursday it revoked the permit, issued by the army corps of engineers in 2007, because it concluded new scientific research on mountaintop-removal mining since then indicated the potential harm to streams and watershed areas surrounding the spruce project could be significant.

Lithomancy, or predicting the future with little stones. Pebbles uncovered at gegharot are smooth, rounded, and have a wide color palette from green and red to white, dark gray, and black. How they were used is unknown. Aleuromancy, or divination by flour. The fort's east citadel includes an installation for flour grinding; the basin was likely used to bake dough balls. Perhaps people used stamp seals to punch shapes in the dough for divination, smith says. The shrines were likely used for only 100 years before gegharot's society was wiped out by military conflicts in the region, armenpress reports.",

            "The advent of the late bronze age ( ca. 1500 – 1250 b.c.e. ) on the tsaghkahovit plain in central armenia witnessed the establishment of a series of hilltop fortresses following a 900-year hiatus in regional occupation. These new settlements testify to the emergence of a south caucasian political tradition founded on the regularization of radical inequality, centralizing practices of economic redistribution, and new institutions of rule. However, the discovery of three shrines and associated assemblages at gegharot, one of the primary fortress sites, also suggests that divinatory practices were critical to the emergent principles of regional sovereignty. In this article, we present the evidence for esoteric rituals — particularly osteomancy, lithomancy, and aleuromancy — within the shrines at gegharot, situating them within the available comparanda from the caucasus and adjacent near east. We further examine how divination — a technique for mitigating risks posed by unsettled presents and uncertain futures —",

Researchers say they've identified a mouse-related retrovirus in the vast majority of patients, and they think that drugs currently used to treat hiv ( an unrelated retrovirus ) might help, reports the wall street journal. The study is anything but a slam dunk, notes the los angeles times, and a co-author says the results \" raise as many questions as they answer. \" but a spate of government studies already underway could settle many of those questions within the year — including whether it might someday be possible to develop a standard test for the ailment.",

Sheriff's deputies with canine units have been spotted picking up items and bagging them in the courtland area where police first encountered chambers ( who, cnn notes, was not on fire when they found her on saturday night, as has been widely reported ). But the clue that could crack the case may already be in authorities ' hands: chambers ' cellphone, cnn reports. Police say the 19-year-old received a call before she left her house that evening and that the phone may be \" the key to everything, \" according to john champion, the district attorney for mississippi's 17th circuit. Police obtained warrants wednesday to retrieve records from google and chambers ' cellphone provider, then circumvented a password and started poring over her texts and data. Police have also been talking to \" many, many people, \" including those who say they were at a party with chambers, and champion confirms chambers herself spoke to one of the firefighters who found her, though he didn't reveal what she said. He simply tells cnn, \" it has certainly given us a lead we're following up on. \" surveillance video captures chambers at a gas station shortly before the incident; she was a regular there, and the clerk says he did find it odd that she bought $ 14 worth of gas, rather than her usual $ 5. \" i asked her about it, and she said she was going somewhere, \" he said. \" she was quiet that day, real quiet. \" police are imploring the public to help, and a \" justice for jessica \" facebook page and #jessicachambers twitter hashtag have emerged to get the case in the public eye, al.com reports.

Dyne suh, a 26-year-old law clerk, had booked tami barker's mountain cabin in big bear, california, for a skiing weekend with friends in february, but barker canceled the reservation by text message minutes before they arrived, stating: \"i wouldn't rent it to u if u were the last person on earth�? and \"one word says it all. Asian�?. This is the first time an airbnb host has been penalized for racial discrimination under a landmark agreement between the san francisco-headquartered accommodation marketplace and the california department of fair employment and housing ( dfeh ), announced earlier this year. The agreement allows the regulator to test and penalize airbnb hosts for racial bias. Airbnb gives in to regulator's demand to test for racial discrimination by hosts read more in addition to paying monetary damages and taking a college-level course in asian american studies, barker must agree to comply with anti-discrimination laws, make a personal apology to suh, participate in a community education panel and volunteer",
            "25-year-old law student dyne suh booked a cabin on airbnb in running springs, california, near big bear lake, for her and her fiancé on president's day weekend. She says that she had booked the property about a month before her trip, and then corresponded with the owner to ask if she could add two more people to the reservation, and was told that was fine. But as she and her friends approached the area on a night of heavy snow on february 17, she reached out again to the owner, who swiftly canceled her stay and plainly told her it was because she was asian. When suh protested and told her she would have her kicked off the airbnb platform for racism, the woman replied \" go ahead \" and \" this is why we have trump. \" ktla was the first to report the story, although they waited two months to do so for reasons that aren't entirely clear. Suh happened to see the ktla crew in big bear the night of the incident, reporting on the snow storm, just as she and her friends were hunting for a new place to stay, and she gave the tearful on-camera interview you see above. \" for me personally, to now have someone say something racist to me and say it's because of trump, it"

A 7-week-old baby died the day the campaign was launched, the ninth infant to die in the city while sleeping with a parent in a year, according to the milwaukee journal sentinel. But angry campaign critics say sleeping together in a family bed is a natural situation practiced throughout the world, including in nations with lower infant death rates, and is generally safe, unless a parent is drunk or on drugs. The mayor, \" unable to impact a failing school system or fix high unemployment, latched on to the first headline-grabbing distraction that came along, \" carped the third coast digest.

Nine years later, a judge has dismissed her $ 500,000 lawsuit against the university, the syracuse post-standard reports. According to the new york times, habitzreuther, now 60, enrolled at cornell in 2005 but was suspended the following year when her german shepherd shandor bit another student during an exam for an ear infection. In its decision to suspend her, a faculty board said habitzreuther failed to disclose shandor's behavioral issues, including previous attacks, and recommended the dog be put down. In the words of the times, cornell wanted habitzreuther to \" put aside her affections in the name of medicine and safety. \" the post-standard reports habitzreuther was suspended for two years before finally being expelled in 2009. In justifying her expulsion, the board chided habitzreuther for refusing to take responsibility for what happened and worried it was an \" early sign of professional recklessness, \" according to the times. In her lawsuit, habitzreuther claimed she was misled by cornell, costing her hundreds of thousands of dollars while she waited to rejoin the university. But last week, a judge found cornell was within its rights to expel her. During the years-long legal proceedings, habitzreuther got her veterinary degree elsewhere and settled with the student who was bit for an undisclosed sum. At some point, shandor, whom habitzreuther had always described as a \" playful puppy, \" was euthanized.",

U.s. District judge gary sharpe last week dismissed karen habitzreuther's lawsuit against cornell, rejecting her claim that cornell breached its contract with her by expelling her in 2009. Habitzreuther, 60, of virginia, was a second-year student in cornell's college of veterinary medicine in july 2006 when her german shepherd, shandor, developed an ear infection. Habitzreuther told cornell the dog was \" a playful puppy who was very protective... A traditional alpha male, \" according to sharpe's decision. But she failed to tell anyone that the dog had bitten people before, sharpe wrote in his decision. Shandor was being examined by a student in cornell's community practice service clinic on july 11, 2006, when the dog bit a fourth-year student who was examining him, court papers said. After the incident, cornell officials contended the dog had \" dominance-aggressive behavior \" and a \" dangerous nature, \" court papers said.

        "summary": "An inmate considered dangerous is on the loose in new mexico after a surprisingly easy escape: authorities say duwin perez-cordova hopped on a bus at the metropolitan detention center in bernalillo and then was released in downtown albuquerque. It appears that the 27-year-old, who was accused in a december shooting, posed as another inmate, reports the albuquerque journal. The newspaper cites court documents alleging that perez-cordova \" utilized another inmate's identifiers \" — he apparently took a cellmate's wrist band — before boarding the release bus about 2am sunday. Jail officials didn't realize the mistake until about three hours after perez-cordova was dropped off. He had been in custody since december, when authorities say he shot a man at a car wash, reports kob4. Perez-cordova's criminal history also includes drug and burglary charges. \"he is considered violent, and we're asking people to not approach him if they do see him, \" says a jail spokesperson. The facility is investigating the lapse — staffers are supposed to check more than wrist bands before allowing inmates to go free.",

Sanchez is facing assisting escape and conspiracy charges. According to court documents he was released monday because probable cause was not found.

The photo, taken in september, showed young alan kurdi's body washed up on the shores of turkey. According to the bbc, mufawaka alabash and asem alfrhad, both syrians, were found guilty of refugee smuggling in turkey and were sentenced to more than four years in jail on friday. They were in charge of a rubber raft that flipped on its journey from turkey to greece, killing five people, including alan, his mother, and his 5-year-old brother. Both alabash and alfrhad faced up to 35 years in prison but were found not guilty of causing death through deliberate negligence. Some have criticized their sentence as being too lenient, while others say focusing on two low-level refugee smugglers won't do anything to stem the waves of migrants risking their lives to flee to europe. Alan's hometown in syria was bombed daily; his family was hoping to make it to relatives in canada, cnn reports. A member of human rights watch called the photo of alan's body the \" biggest indictment of collective failure. \" more than 400 migrants have died trying to reach europe this year alone.",
