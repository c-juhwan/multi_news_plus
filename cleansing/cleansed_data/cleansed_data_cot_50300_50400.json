Per her complaint, calgaro says a nonprofit helped her daughter ( whom she still refers to as her \" son \" ) receive a \" letter of emancipation \" unbeknownst to her; her child subsequently began receiving \" dangerous hormonal drugs \" to transition, per a facebook post. \" why wasn't i even notified? \" she said as she started to cry. Meanwhile, the june 2015 emancipation document reviewed by nbc states calgaro didn't want to have \" any contact \" with her child, who had been living apart from calgaro and self-supported financially for the prior six months. A press release from a law firm repping calgaro says the teen \" has been handled by the defendants as an emancipated minor despite no court action to that effect. \" but nbc notes minnesota has no legal emancipation process; rather, the state simply allows for kids living apart from parents and taking care of their own finances to make their own medical decisions. Per the twin cities pioneer press, calgaro says she's not against the gender change, but she wants \" him to slow down. \" transgender advocates have framed calgaro's use of \" son \" and male pronouns as \" not only insensitive but also really harmful. \" ( the supreme court will hear a teen transgender case. )",

Last month, indian troops confronted chinese workers trying to extend a road in a contested area known as the doklam plateau at the point where china, india, and indian ally bhutan meet. Both bhutan and china have a claim to the area because of an ambiguous 1890 border agreement. China has vowed to avoid talks until indian forces withdraw, but india isn't backing down, bringing the two countries, both of which have nuclear weapons, \" near the brink of conflict, \" reports the new york times. The latest: the advantage: experts say china has the upper hand because of the strength of its armed forces, per bloomberg. And it apparently knows it. Addressing india, chinese foreign minister wang yi says the solution is \" very simple. That is, behave yourself and humbly retreat. \" the road ahead: a scholar at the american foreign policy council sees similarities between this border dispute and another that led to war between china and india in 1962. He tells the times that while a negotiated settlement is most likely, war is possible. Veiled threats: editorials appearing in chinese state-owned media have stressed china's victory in the 1962 sino-indian war. One published in the global times notes india \" will suffer greater losses than in 1962 if it incites military conflicts. \" india's response: while new delhi is holding strong, the times of india notes \" the stridency of chinese rhetoric has been progressively matched by an equally conciliatory tone by india. \" ' chicken neck ': india's problem is that an armed conflict could result in china taking control of a strip of land near the disputed area, which connects india to its northern territories. The times notes the loss of this land, known as the \" chicken neck, \" would mean \" cutting off 45 million indians and an area the size of the united kingdom. \" suspected us involvement: an editorial in china's global times suggests washington is \" instigating a military clash between china and india, from which they can seek strategic benefits at no cost to themselves, \" per the times of india.

That's the takeaway from a new study, based on surveys of more than 30,000 americans gathered over 40 years, published in the journal social psychological and personality science. After previous research found more wealth wasn't actually associated with greater happiness, lead author amy muise began to wonder if the same was true for sex, \" an aspect of life that is thought to be associated with greater happiness, \" she says, per time. However, researchers found that while couples who have sex once a week are happier than those who have sex less often, \" having sex more frequently than once a week was not associated with greater well-being. \" the findings held regardless of gender, age, or the length of a relationship. The study found couples who had sex less than once a month and those who knocked boots once a week reported a difference in life satisfaction that was even greater than that reported by couples who earn $ 15,000 to $ 25,000 annually and those who earn $ 50,000 to $ 75,000, according to a release. Muise isn't sure why having sex once a week seems to be ideal, but it may \" be the frequency that people feel is enough to maintain their intimate connection, \" she says. The \" big problem \" one researcher not involved found with the study is that it identifies correlation, not causation. \" people are basically having as much sex as they want, and for some reason... [ those who do it ] about once a week seem to be happier, \" george loewenstein tells the guardian ( see his sex research here ).

I looked at the shape of it, and thought:'this isn't looking good. ' \" the human head inside is just the latest body part to wash ashore in recent weeks. Dna tests confirmed two pairs of human feet found on the same beach — also wrapped and weighed down with rocks — came from a russian couple, reported missing from their vegetable farm on fiji's main island of viti levu on june 16, reports the telegraph. A vehicle belonging to yuri shipulin and nataliya gerasimova — who moved to fiji in 2011, per the guardian — was found at natadola beach shortly after their disappearance with the keys in the ignition. Police believe a chainsaw was also missing from their farm. A friend says shipulin, a former pilot in the russian air force, was owed up to $ 200,000 from several failed businesses on the island; a cyclone that damaged the couple's farm in february apparently pushed them deeper into financial turmoil. \" yuri would give you the shirt off his back, he was too trusting and he was taken to the cleaners by unscrupulous people, \" the friend says. \" it was his first time off the block in paradise and he was living lavishly and burning the candle at both ends. \" divers have begun a search of the beach, which could take weeks, per the fiji sun.

The students ' legal reps will argue that north carolina's law contradicts the 26th amendment, which states that a voter's rights \" shall not be denied or abridged... On account of age. \" the amendment also made 18-year-olds eligible to vote. North carolina's law invalidated student id cards at the polls and eliminated same-day registration, among other things. Critics say the state's gop-controlled general assembly passed hb 589 to disenfranchise voters likely to support democrats, like students and minority members. But supporters say it's a fraud-prevention effort that's even more fair because it's being rolled out gradually; they also say minority turnout didn't decline in last year's primaries. \" there was no voter suppression, \" a gop state senator told wral. \" actually we had some good turnouts for a primary election. \" the law followed swiftly after the supreme court nixed a key provision of the 1965 voting rights act last year, the guardian notes. That provision had forced nine states, north carolina included, to get federal approval before altering voting rules.",

Vigil organizers say in a press release that the town is forking over \" $ 46,000 to kill 100 deer on as little as two-acre parcels \" and has hired out-of-state sharpshooters to handle the job. The goal was to squash the number of car-deer collisions, but organizers say that hasn't happened, kmox reports. Per the town's deer management reporting, 30 verified car-deer collisions occurred in 2014, compared with 38 in 2013; a 2014 report compiled by town and country notes that 87 deer were \" harvested \" over eight days in january of that year. Resident barbara ann hughes — who has organized the vigil — argues in the release that \" biologists on the national level have studied the issue and concur that lethal methods of deer management are not effective in an urban setting. \" but newser did find one study published in 2008 in human-wildlife conflicts that reviewed suburban sharpshooting management programs in iowa city, iowa; princeton, nj; and solon, ohio.

        "summary": "The price of a postage stamp will soon go back down from 49 cents, thanks to a us appeals court. The us postal service instituted a 3-cent increase — its biggest in 11 years — in january of last year in an emergency measure, arguing that it had lost billions in the recession and badly needed to make up for the loss. Regulators agreed, but said usps could only recoup about $ 3 billion from the move — and that limit will be hit this summer. The postal service had filed a legal challenge to fight to make the increase permanent, but the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit disagreed, the washington post reports. It is not clear when, exactly, the roll-back will occur, but no new stamps need to be printed: the usps never made 49-cent stamps, but simply sold its \" forever \" stamps for 49 cents instead of 46 cents. The court noted that the reasoning for the rate increase was \" extraordinary financial circumstances, \" and those circumstances are no longer extraordinary. The economic situation today, post-recession, is \" the new normal, \" and the usps has to make it work, the court said. The bulk mailing industry had legally challenged the rate increase, and an industry rep praised the decision: \" stamps should be forever, but not surcharges. \" interestingly, when the ap reported the court's friday move, it framed it as a loss for the bulk mail industry, since the court did uphold the temporary rate hike — a 4.3 % increase that came on top of the typical 1.7 % for inflation — it just didn't agree with the idea of making it permanent. As for when the higher rate will end, the ap says \" later this year. \"",

But for debra milke, her freedom \" is bittersweet, \" she says. \" this is not happiness. \" after 22 years on death row, milke was cleared of murder charges earlier this week related to the death of her 4-year-old son, who was shot by milke's roommate and another man in 1989. She was originally convicted of conspiring to murder her son based on the testimony of detective armando saldate, who had a history of lying under oath. \" i had absolutely nothing to do with the brutal murder of my son, christopher, and i did not give a confession to mr. Saldate, \" an emotional milke, 51, said in her first comments yesterday, per the guardian. \" i always believed this day would come. I just didn't think it would have to take 25 years, three months, and 14 days to rectify such a blatant miscarriage of justice. \" \" i live with an abiding sense of loss and a chunk of my heart is gone, \" she continued. \" but christopher's spirit is with me always, which is a comfort to the remaining pieces of my broken heart. \" milke's lawyer says there is still a question of motive for christopher's killers, james styers and roger scott, now on death row. One theory, however, is that styers killed milke's son because he wanted a romantic relationship with milke, who was about to move out. Though the guardian notes milke will not be retried, a prosecutor says he could secure another conviction with new witnesses who could testify to incriminating comments milke made, the ap reports. When asked why bullets in her purse matched the caliber used to kill her son, milke said she put them there when she found them in styers ' laundry. \" clearly, i forgot they were in my purse, \" she said. Milke is now pressing for a law forcing police to record all interrogations.",

Said yesterday that it won't place as much emphasis on medical debt when calculating consumers ' fico scores and will turn a blind eye to other debts that have been paid or settled through a collection agency. The new scoring system, which will be in place this fall, follows negotiations with the consumer financial protection bureau on ways to boost consumer lending. According to a commonwealth fund report cited in the journal, 41 % of us adults had a hard time coming up with funds to pay medical bills in 2012. Those who only have medical debt on their credit report could see an instant 25-point jump in their fico score, according to cnn. The changes also mean that people who pay off their debts in collections won't be stuck with a seven-year black mark on their report like they have been. Vantagescore — which manages the popular scoring model created by the experian, transunion, and equifax credit bureaus — says fico's move is \" a competitive response \" to similar score-boosting changes it made last year, notes housing wire.",

The first, in a necropolis southwest of cairo, has the name of a queen presumed to be pharaoh neferefre's wife written on the wall, afp reports via raw story; her name was previously not known. Identified as khentakawess ( or really khentakawess iii, since there were two before her ), on the tomb walls she's also called \" the wife of the king \" and \" the mother of the king, \" perhaps because she was believed to have been married to pharaoh neferefre and mother to pharaoh menkahur, an archaeologist tells fox news latino. The discovery, dating back some 4,500 years, sheds light on \" the fifth dynasty, which, along with the fourth dynasty, witnessed the construction of the first pyramids, \" an egyptian official says. The other find is a symbolic burial site for osiris, once egypt's supreme deity of the afterlife and the underworld, reports australia's news network ( which has photos and diagrams ). The 25th dynasty burial site, dating to about 700bc, was likely used for rituals that linked the ruling pharaohs to osiris ' powers. Located on luxor's west bank at the al-gorna necropolis, it was modeled on an actual royal tomb with several chambers; it includes a funerary complex with a carving of osiris and an adjacent room with a relief of knife-wielding demons, perhaps there for protection. The site was discovered by archaeologist philippe virey back in the 1880s, al arabiya reports, but only now are its main rooms excavated.

The most recent incident: two old time magazine covers ( one turned out to be a hoax from the 1970s ) handed to him by deputy national security adviser kt mcfarland, both of which apparently sent him into a frenzy about climate change and the hypocritical media before his staff could calm him down. That hoax cover was described by a white house official to politico as \" fake but accurate. \" the site notes that the flow of information given to past presidents has typically been tightly reined in, but trump prefers a \" free flow of ideas \" and content from \" both official and unofficial channels. \" because he apparently goes on the internet only rarely himself, whenever he becomes outraged over an article, his aides reportedly have to \" scramble in a game of cat-and-mouse \" to figure out who showed him the story. Chief of staff reince priebus and rob porter, the white house staff secretary, have now put the kibosh on anyone sneaking over to the president with clippings or printouts and now have a system in place to monitor what he sees — a system that one source tells politico is likely being ignored.

On the other hand, insurance companies have been more willing to cover the expenses associated with transition under this language, because treatment for a disorder is considered medically necessary, rather than cosmetic. The new manual will diagnose transgender people with \"gender dysphoria, \" which communicates the emotional distress that can result from \"a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender. \" this will allow for affirmative treatment and transition care without the stigma of disorder.

Homosexuality was similarly declassified as a mental disorder in 1973. Until now, the term \"gender identity disorder \" has been used to diagnose people who are transgender. For conservatives, this has provided rhetorical carte blanche to describe the entire trans committee as disordered, delusional, and mentally ill. In some cases, this diagnosis has even been used to discriminate against trans people, with claims that they are unfit parents or employees, as examples. On the other hand, insurance companies have been more willing to cover the expenses associated with transition under this language, because treatment for a disorder is considered medically necessary, rather than cosmetic. The new manual will diagnose transgender people with \"gender dysphoria, \" which communicates the emotional distress that can result from \"a marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender. \" this will allow for affirmative treatment and transition care without the stigma of disorder. Earlier this year, the apa also released new health guidelines"

The screenwriter and director of the hit film zero dark thirty are accused of bribing cia officials to receive sensitive information, according to cia documents obtained by vice. The inspector general's office found that the film — which depicts the search for osama bin laden and the navy seal raid that killed him — was at least partially padded with information obtained under dubious means. Screenwriter mark boal and director kathryn bigelow — who did not have security clearances, according to vanity fair — allegedly used gifts and promises of premiere tickets to get inside information from the government officers. A female officer upon whom jessica chastain's character was based received an eight-hour shopping trip, according to the report, and other cia officers allegedly received dinners at expensive restaurants and room service at fancy hotels. The hollywood big shots are also accused of overstating the value of some of the bribes, with an alleged \" several hundred dollar \" bottle of tequila actually being worth less than $ 200. \" black tahitian pearl earrings, \" meanwhile, were actually fake pearls painted black and mounted to cheap metal posts.

            "On april 21, 2011, mark boal called the cia to tell them he was going to afghanistan. The previous year, the screenwriter had been at a dinner when cia director leon panetta asked boal to alert the agency if he ever traveled to the country. At the time, boal was working on a movie called tora bora, about the cia's failure to capture osama bin laden in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The title referred to the region in eastern afghanistan where the us felt it had let bin laden slip through its fingers during a battle in december 2001. But less than two weeks after boal made the call, a team of navy seals raided the al qaeda leader's compound in pakistan and killed him. Boal would not be going to afghanistan after all. Instead, he stopped writing the script for tora bora and began writing a different screenplay about what one lawmaker called \" the most classified mission in history \" — the killing of bin laden. That movie, which boal would work on with director kathryn bigelow, would become the 2012 oscar-winning film zero dark thirty. And the cia would play a huge role in the creation of the script. * * * the previously undisclosed",

A newly released ethics report from the agency's inspector general will likely revive the issue — specifically in the agency's accusation that in order to obtain information, the film's creators bribed several c.i.a.

            "On april 21, 2011, mark boal called the cia to tell them he was going to afghanistan. The previous year, the screenwriter had been at a dinner when cia director leon panetta asked boal to alert the agency if he ever traveled to the country. At the time, boal was working on a movie called tora bora, about the cia's failure to capture osama bin laden in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The title referred to the region in eastern afghanistan where the us felt it had let bin laden slip through its fingers during a battle in december 2001. But less than two weeks after boal made the call, a team of navy seals raided the al qaeda leader's compound in pakistan and killed him. Boal would not be going to afghanistan after all. Instead, he stopped writing the script for tora bora and began writing a different screenplay about what one lawmaker called \" the most classified mission in history \" — the killing of bin laden. That movie, which boal would work on with director kathryn bigelow, would become the 2012 oscar-winning film zero dark thirty. And the cia would play a huge role in the creation of the script. * * * the previously undisclosed",

            "For years, a political storm has raged over the c.i.a.'s role in the production of zero dark thirty, the oscar-winning film about the 2011 raid that killed osama bin laden that several politicians accused of promoting enhanced interrogation and endangering the lives of the real people involved in the raid. A newly released ethics report from the agency's inspector general will likely revive the issue — specifically in the agency's accusation that in order to obtain information, the film's creators bribed several c.i.a.

High court judge helen cull on wednesday ordered the conservative national party to pay the detroit rapper's publisher $ 415,000 plus interest, the ap reports. The party ran a tv ad 186 times that used the song \" eminem esque \" during its successful 2014 election campaign before pulling the ad off the air. In her 132-page ruling, cull said \" eminem esque \" reproduced the essence of \" lose yourself \" and that it was no coincidence the composer of \" eminem esque \" had the music to the original in front of him when he wrote his song. The judge based the amount of the award on a hypothetical license fee the party might have paid to use eminem's song. Cull also noted that eminem publisher eight mile style rarely oks the use of \" lose yourself \" in ads. She stopped short of awarding additional damages, saying the party had only used the song after receiving expert advice it could do so and hadn't acted recklessly. The odd case had featured moments such as gowned lawyers listening studiously to profanity-laced rap. \" we think it's a very strong judgment, and a cautionary tale for people who make or use soundalikes around the world, \" says an eight mile style lawyer. National party president peter goodfellow said in a statement he was disappointed with the ruling and that the party purchased the music in good faith from an australia-based library that bought it from a us supplier; the party has filed a claim against the track's suppliers and licensers. An eight mile style rep says he hasn't discussed the ruling with eminem, aka marshall mathers iii.",

In a memo to staff, espn president john skipper called the layoffs \" a necessary component of managing change. \" espn's problem is that while it's losing subscribers, it's also paying billions for the rights to broadcast pro and college sports — and those rights are only getting more expensive. The network currently pays $ 15.2 billion to the nfl, $ 12 billion to the nba, and $ 7.3 billion for the college football playoffs, just as a start. Deadspin argues wednesday's layoffs aren't really meant to be a permanent fix for espn's problems but to act as \" symbolic sacrifices \" to buy \" a little more slack from investors. \" this past quarter, espn parent company disney blamed the network for the entirety of the 11 % decline in its cable network division's operating income.",

Bank of america, for instance, suggested its junior workers take at least four weekend days off each month, and goldman sachs put together a quality-of-life task force and told its own junior employees to use saturdays for r&r only, per reuters. Now goldman sachs is taking work-life balance a step further, recommending that interns don't stay at their desks past midnight or come in before 7am — a relatively easier 17-hour workday, the guardian reports. These guidelines were put out there \" to improve the overall work experience of our interns, \" a company spokesman tells the paper. Goldman sachs, which reuters notes has 2,900 interns this summer, has taken other steps — including hiring more interns and offering pay hikes and mentoring programs — to make work more conducive to having a life, the washington post notes. And that's basically what ceo lloyd blankfein said shortly after erhardt's death, telling the younger set in his firm: \" you have to have interests away from the narrow thing of what you do. You have to be somebody who somebody else wants to talk to. \" it seems like a good start, but a recent memo sent to interns by a second-year barclays analyst went viral because of what the wall street journal calls its \" dubious pointers \" on how to succeed on wall street ( i.e., prepare to work like a dog ).

        "summary": "Synthetic fleece is great — until you consider the fact that every time it's washed, it releases thousands of microfibers into the environment. Microscopic plastic fibers may now be one of the most common types of plastic debris found in samples from the environment, including animals, ecologist and evolutionary biologist chelsea rochman tells npr, and that means we humans are likely eating the synthetic fibers without realizing it. Previous studies have found microfibers in table salt and fish; last year, alternet explained that marine life is particularly prone to ingesting microfibers because they go from the washing machine through the sewage system and into various waterways. Microfibers are, it turns out, more pervasive in the environment than even microbeads — which were banned in the us in 2015 over similar problems. In 2011, one ecologist found that 85 % of human debris on shorelines around the world is synthetic microfiber. Now, outdoor outfitting company patagonia — which often uses microfiber in its products — is also looking into the problem, and has found that a polyester fleece jacket shed as many as 2 grams of microfibers ( that's an amount weighing more than a paperclip ) each time it's washed, and even more when washed in a top-loader. The next question: are these microfibers harmful to wildlife and humans? the answer is not yet clear, but one conservationist says he's not waiting to find out; he recommends washing your microfleece as little as possible. The guardian reported last year that there are also a few ideas floating around for products that would trap microfibers in the washing machine rather than allowing them down the drain. ( this microfiber fabric generates its own electricity. )",

        "summary": "North korea formerly threatened to cancel the long-awaited family reunions between the two koreas if south korea went ahead with its annual joint military drills with the us. But as it stands, both events are happening simultaneously. As the six-day reunion continued today, the military drills began, the bbc reports; they will continue until april 18, and involve roughly 12,500 us troops. As always, washington and seoul insist they are simply defensive, while pyongyang calls them \" exercises of war. \" even so, the rhetoric has been pretty low-key this year compared to last, when north korea repeatedly threatened to attack south korean and us targets over the drills. The guardian reports that us officials have suggested things will be a little more low-key on their end as well: no aircraft carriers or strategic bombers are to factor into the war games. Some believe north korea's reaction to the drills will shed light on whether tensions between the two koreas are truly thawing, as the family reunions and other recent developments suggest they may be. \" as of now, there are no unusual movements from north korea, \" said a south korean defense ministry spokesperson today. \" we will only take action against north korea if it makes provocations or denunciations. \" experts say that, for pyongyang, keeping calm is all about money. Specifically, the north would like the south to restart tours to the north's mount kumgang resort that, in the past, provided the north with an important source of income; the south put an end to the tours in 2008 after a female tourist was killed by north korean security.",

But archaeologists studying a famous trove of terracotta figures dug up in china now suggest that the first contact with the west occurred much earlier than thought — some 1,500 years before polo's arrival, reports the bbc. Their theory is that those terracotta figures were inspired by greek art, and that a greek sculptor may have actually helped create them around 300 bc. For one thing, there's nothing in earlier chinese art like these life-sized statues. \"i imagine that a greek sculptor may have been at the site to train the locals, \" says historian lukas nickel of the university of vienna. But more than that, researchers have turned up european dna from skeletons at a nearby site in northern china. The dna find suggests westerners were living there under the dynasty of qin shi huang, the \" first emperor \" who commissioned the so-called terracotta army for his tomb. \" we now have evidence that close contact existed between the first emperor's china and the west before the formal opening of the silk road, \" says an archaeologist on the project. \" this is far earlier than we formerly thought. \" an ongoing study of the tomb has also revealed the remains of what could be the emperor's sons, reports national geographic. Experts say the remains — including a skull pierced by a crossbow bolt — match an account of one of the emperor's sons murdering his brothers to seize control after his father's death in 210 bc.

Analysts say many of the increases — which the journal notes are on list prices, before the rebates and discounts manufacturers often provide — hover around 10 %. Per reuters, pfizer alone, which puts out viagra and the pain drug lyrica, among others, raised the prices of 105 drugs at the start of 2016, some by as much as 20 %, according to stats put together by info services firm wolters kluwer. ( pfizer confirmed some of the price increases to reuters, but a rep said he couldn't immediately speak to all the reported hikes. ) the journal points out that it's not odd for pharma companies to hike prices right around the new year — but notes that it's somewhat unusual for this to take place now in the current climate, when doctors, patients, and the likes of hillary clinton and bernie sanders have been promising to put a stop to rampant increases. The ceo of healthpartners, a minnesota nonprofit health-care provider, tells the journal that such hikes \" are becoming increasingly intolerable for consumers, health plans, doctors and hospitals. \" but the ceo of acorda therapeutics, which makes a drug that helps ms patients walk, tells the paper that cost increases are \" our way of insuring that we can survive and develop these programs and bring these new innovative drugs to market. \" ( a pill for hepatitis costs 250 times more in the us than in india. )",

There are a handful of inmates on utah's death row who can already choose firing squad as their execution method because they were sentenced before 2004, when the state took that option away. The last prisoner to be executed by firing squad was ronnie lee gardner in 2010. Randy gardner told nbc news that his brother — who was sentenced to death for killing a lawyer in court while facing charges for a previous murder — opted to be shot by his executioners because he believed it would stir opposition to capital punishment. \" it's not humane at all, \" randy gardner said of firing squads. \" i got to see the four bullet wounds in my brother's chest after the execution and",

Paul ray, r-clearfield, which would bring the firing squad back as a backup method of execution, should the primary method of lethal injection be unavailable. More: 3 inmates in utah say they want to die by firing squad the bill now goes to gov. Gary herbert for his signature or veto. In a statement to fox 13, the governor's office said: \"as a general practice, gov. Herbert does not commit to action on a bill until he has reviewed the final version that has passed both the house and the senate. He is, however, willing to discuss the principles by which he evaluates legislation. \"in the state of utah, aggravated murder is a crime punishable by death. This is a sentence that was determined to be appropriate for crimes where a life was taken in an especially heinous and aggravated manner and was enacted by our legislature with the support of their constituents. Accordingly, in those cases, as a state, we ask a jury to make the difficult decision to impose the death sentence."

Than any other automaker. \" earlier in the day, trump tweeted that \"ford has abruptly killed a plan to sell a chinese-made small vehicle in the u.s. Because of the prospect of higher u.s. Tariffs.... This car can now be built in the u.s.a. And ford will pay no tariffs! \" in fact, on aug. 31, ford canceled plans to import compact focus actives that were made in china because of the high tariff costs. But that just meant the car will not be sold in the u.s. At all, since ford saw it as a niche vehicle. The cars will continue to be sold elsewhere around the world. \"this is further evidence that neither the president nor his trade representatives have any clue of the complexities of global supply chains, \" jon gabrielsen, a market economist who specializes in the auto industry, told the",

The weather channel reports that a bunch of new classifications have been added to the atlas ( the first fully web-based version ) for the first time in three decades, including the volutus \" roll cloud \" and aforementioned asperitas, as well as human-created cloud types like contrails ( the condensation trails left in the wake of airplanes ). There's even a new \" accessory \" cloud known as the flumen ( aka \" beaver's tail \" ), which sometimes follows along with a convective storm, a wmo press release notes. The science behind the atlas's cloud classifications, which live science calls \" not for the faint of heart, \" is a sophisticated one. The 10 cornerstone clouds, referred to as \" genera, \" are the ones you've likely heard of — stratus and cumulus, among others. Then the classification gets more granular with \" species, \" which break down the genera clouds further based on shapes, and from there to \" varieties, \" which indicate transparency and arrangement. The recent additions fall under the species category; there's also a new \" supplementary features \" section of \" unusual parts \" — such as the aforementioned asperitas, a wavy look to a cloud's underside — and five \" special \" clouds, including the contrail and clouds formed by waterfall mist. \" few natural phenomena \" are as inspiring as clouds, wmo secretary-general petteri taalas notes. ( shifting cloud patterns are worrisome. )",

Ars technica reports that health authorities do know the bacterium at play — mycobacterium ulcerans — and have recorded its rise from 47 infections in victoria state in 2014 to 159 so far this year, reports australia's abc news. The infections do occur elsewhere in the world — generally in developing nations like uganda, nigeria, and liberia — but a microbiologist terms the situation in victoria an \" epidemic. \" the organism comes from the same family of bacteria as leprosy and tuberculosis, and the age reports that some scientists think possums and mosquitoes may be vectors. But that's just a theory at this point, and no prevention strategies have been developed. Antibiotics can typically successfully treat the infection, which most commonly occurs on the arms or legs, but it's a gruesome-looking, gangrene-like experience ( see photos here if you can stomach them ). 9news shares the case of 13-year-old ella crofts, who developed the infection in one of her knees in april. At first it just felt sore; ultimately, much of the kneecap had turned into an open sore. She had to undergo three surgeries to excise dead skin, and she's still walking with a limp. \" we call it the zombie leg, \" her mother says.

        "summary": "Remaking ghostbusters was never going to be easy. Luckily, an all-female cast wasn't afraid to answer the call. While audiences — who may or may not have read the hate blanketing the web — give this summer's reboot a 44 % approval rating on rotten tomatoes, most critics are counting it as a win. Here's what they're saying. \" get over it, fanboy. \" this new ghostbusters is \" a fun, true-blue update of a classic, \" writes colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune. The visuals are much improved over 1984 and \" the comedy is as rich as [ director ] paul feig … can get without an r rating. \" covert adds kate mckinnon \" walks away with the film; her flawless reaction shots off to the side always eclipse the main gag. \" less scary than the original, ghostbusters is \" goofy summer fun \" that benefits from kristen wiig and melissa mccarthy's \" natural give-and-take comic chemistry, \" writes andrew lapin at npr. But \" the real star \" is mckinnon, who \" resembles nothing if not a young bill murray. \" however, awkward plotting and editing knock the movie down a peg. Peter rainer wasn't impressed. \" the character comedy quickly gets trampled by the effects ( in this case, not special ), \" he writes at christian science monitor. Leslie jones \" has a few funny freestyle moments, as does mckinnon, \" but most of the cast has \" been far funnier. \" meanwhile, chris hemsworth plays \" the male bimbo — a sex role-reversal joke that never takes off. The whole movie never takes off. \" ann hornaday doesn't agree. \" sunny, slimy, and profoundly silly, the new, lady-centric reboot of ghostbusters immediately silences the backlash, \" she writes at the washington post. It \" seems engineered to remind viewers of what it was meant to be all along: neither a workhorse for arguments about gender politics nor a trojan horse for desecrating precious generational shibboleths, but simply an easygoing, enjoyable family comedy. \" ( check out what bill murray had to say about the movie. )",

        "summary": "Us attorney preet bharara has won a massive victory in his quest to get rid of what he calls a \" cauldron of corruption \" in new york's state capital. Sheldon silver, the former longtime new york state assembly speaker, has been found guilty of federal corruption charges and faces many years in prison, reports the new york times, which calls the democrat \" one of the most feared politicians \" in the state. After nearly three days of deliberation, a jury found the 71-year-old guilty of abusing his powers over the state budget by taking part in two schemes that made him around $ 4 million, wall street journal reports. He will automatically be kicked out of the assembly after nearly 40 years as a member and more than 20 as speaker. In one scheme, silver directed state funds to a cancer researcher who ensured silver won hefty referral fees from a law firm he sent patients to, the new york daily news reports. In the second, silver negotiated tax breaks for a developer that sent its business to another law firm that paid him referral fees, the journal reports. The payments were discovered when an anti-corruption committee scrutinized his outside income. Silver was found guilty on seven counts and could face a sentence of up to 120 years in federal prison, reports the times, which notes that a prosecutor described his conduct as government not \" by the people or for the people, \" but \" by sheldon silver for sheldon silver. \" ( after less than two hours of deliberations, a \" stressed out \" juror asked to go home. )",

        "summary": "Two chimpanzees being used for mobility research at stony brook university in new york will not be released to a sanctuary because a state supreme court judge has dismissed the lawsuit seeking to grant them personhood. The reason comes down to legal precedent: a higher court ruled last year that another chimpanzee, tommy, is property, not a person, reports the ap. In may, a lawyer had argued in court for the nonhuman rights project that 8-year-old chimps hercules and leo are \" autonomous and self-determining beings \" that deserve similar rights as humans. He presented hundreds of pages of opinions from a range of experts like zoologists and biologists who all felt similarly: cognitively, chimps are an advanced species. In a somewhat sympathetic 33-page decision, state supreme court justice barbara jaffe called the effort to extend rights to chimps \" understandable \" and noted such a suit may one day succeed, giving the reasoning that \" legal person \" and \" human being \" aren't necessarily synonymous, reports nbc news. But she added: \" the past mistreatment of humans, whether slaves, women, indigenous people or others, as property, does not, however, serve as a legal predicate or appropriate analogy for extending to nonhumans the status of legal personhood. \" the group plans to appeal the decision, reports the wall street journal, which notes that more lawsuits are likely to be filed on behalf of animals held in captivity. Hercules and leo have been held by stony brook since 2010. ( see why this grandma is suing seaworld. )",

Today, burnt orange report received the photo at right, taken in front of a home in northwest austin. The resident, a republican, lynched an empty chair from a tree in his yard, which one can easily interpret to represent a racially motivated act of violence against the president. Now, one could easily argue \"it's just a chair, what's the big deal? that's not racist! \" however, in light of clint eastwood's speech at the republican national convention, in which he had a largely one-sided conversation with an empty chair he pretended was barack obama, this imagery is now associated with the president. The image of the chair is associated with the president. Now, lynch that chair from a tree, and you've got a pretty awful racist sentiment calling for lynching the first african-american president! lynching was a horrific and commonplace act in",

In no way have we suggested the latter, \" obama said. That statement runs contrary to what obama's own deputy campaign manager stephanie cutter said in july, when she told reporters that romney either lied to the american people or committed a felony. \"either mitt romney, through his own words and his own signature, was misrepresenting his position at bain to the sec, which is a felony, \" cutter said on a conference call."

            "President obama defended his campaign's incessant attacks on mitt romney over the issue of the gop nominee's tax returns. \" if you want to be president of the united states, your life's an open book when it comes to things like your finances, \" obama said in a surprise appearance in the white house briefing room. \" this is pretty standard stuff, \" obama said. \" i don't think we're being mean. \" \" it's what the american people expect, \" he added. Romney has so far refused to release any more than one year's worth of tax returns — in contrast to long-standing disclosure traditions dating back to romney's own father in 1968. \" i think the idea that this is somehow exceptional, that there should be a rationale or a justification for doing more than the very bare minimum has it backwards, \" obama said. \" the assumption should be you do what previous presidential candidates have done dating back decades. \" obama also denied that his campaign has charged that romney is doing something illegal — in contrast to some of the rhetoric of his campaign aides. \" there's a difference between playing by the same sets of rules and doing something illegal. In no way have we suggested the latter, \" obama said. That statement runs contrary to what obama's own deputy campaign manager stephanie cutter said in july, when she told reporters that romney either lied to the american people or committed a felony. \"either mitt romney, through his own words and his own signature, was misrepresenting his position at bain to the sec, which is a felony, \" cutter said on a conference call."

Per mexico news daily, lucero priscila garza campos, 24, had been taking avitia cobrax for a month before she went to the doctor to complain of severe headaches. She was admitted and diagnosed with cerebral edema. Two days later, she experienced cardiac arrest and went into a coma. Garza was taken off life support later that week when her doctors declared her brain dead. Her doctors say the pills, marketed as a natural weight loss remedy, were a major contributor to her death. The drug's social media pages and stores have since been taken down. Garza found avitia cobrax online while looking for a natural remedy to help lose weight gained during her pregnancy with her now 1-year-old daughter, reports the independent. She spent $ 65 on the pills and lost 15 pounds over 10 days. Marketing descriptions claim that the product uses heat to \"reduce the percentage of body fat without reducing muscle. \" two drugs using similar ingredients were banned by state health agency cofepris, which is investigating whether the same manufacturer is rebranding the drug under new names. Following garza's death, the agency warned against the dangers of drugs sold online, tweeting ( translated ), \" medicines sold online and on the street are a risk to your #health.

Researchers at an australian museum have brewed what might be the \" world's oldest beer, \" using yeast salvaged from a bottle that spent nearly two centuries on the seafloor, they say in a press release. The bottle came from the sydney cove, which sank off the australian mainland in 1790 and was salvaged in the 1990s, reports ctv news. Samples of the beer were decanted at the time of the salvaging, and they sat mostly forgotten until david thurrowgood began working at tasmania's queen victoria museum a year-and-a-half ago. He and his team say they were able to isolate live yeast in the old beer, one they say is genetically distinct from more modern yeast species. \" i thought we might be able to culture that yeast and recreate beer that hasn't been on the planet for 220 years, \" he tells the australian broadcasting corporation. The result, brewed in accordance with an 18th-century recipe, is preservation ale. The discovery isn't a slam dunk: some scientists are skeptical that yeast could live that long and suggest it might have been contaminated, perhaps in the last 20 years or so after the bottle was decanted. Researchers hope to disprove the naysayers by retrieving more bottles from the wreck and repeating the results. So how does the new-old beer taste? it has a \" distinctly light and fresh flavor, \" say the researchers. \" i f i was trying to craft beer at a pub, i'd be very happy with it, \" one tells mashable.

When looking at 378,881 children ages 4 to 17 at some point between 1997 to 2011, they found that preschool and elementary school-age children born in august were 1.65 times more likely to be diagnosed with adhd and 1.73 times more likely to be put on medication than kids born in september — who, because of school cutoff dates similar to those in the us, tend to be nearly a year older than their august counterparts. ( the discrepancy did not exist in older kids, which researchers write may imply that \" increasing age and maturity lessens the impact of birth month on adhd diagnoses. \" ) the findings add to previous work on adhd in the us and canada finding that a child's age within a grade plays a role in adhd diagnosis, lead author dr. Mu-hong chen tells live science. He calls it reduced neurocognitive maturity, something that is particularly pronounced when comparing the youngest and oldest kids within a grade. Globally, the number of kids diagnosed with adhd has risen dramatically, researchers note in a press release, saying, \" our findings emphasize the importance of considering the age of a child within a grade when diagnosing adhd and prescribing medication to treat adhd. \" ( more than one in 10 kids in the us have been diagnosed with adhd. )",
