But japan's national science museum has managed to capture the footage, and it's headed for the small screen on the country's public television. Then, on jan. 27, the discovery channel will unveil the video of the creature \" with razor-toothed suckers and eyes the size of dinner plates. \" that's not totally an exaggeration. The giant squid is believed to have inspired centuries of legends among sailors. The squid in question is about 10 feet long — though scientists say it would have been 26 feet long had it not been missing two arms — and was taped some 2,000 feet underwater in the north pacific. It took experts some 400 hours squeezed into a submersible to get the footage, afp reports. \" it was shining and so beautiful, \" says a researcher of the silvery, black-eyed squid. \" i was so thrilled when i saw it firsthand. \"",

            "Giant squid filmed in pacific depths: japan scientists tokyo — scientists and broadcasters said monday they have captured footage of an elusive giant squid roaming the depths of the pacific ocean, showing it in its natural habitat for the first time ever. Japan's national science museum succeeded in filming the deep-sea creature at a depth of more than half a kilometre ( a third of a mile ) after teaming up with japanese public broadcaster nhk and the us discovery channel. The massive invertebrate is the stuff of legend, with sightings of a huge ocean-dwelling beast reported by sailors for centuries. The creature is thought to be the genesis of the nordic legend of kraken, a sea monster believed to have attacked ships in waters off scandinavia over the last millennium. Modern-day scientists on their own moby dick-style search used a submersible to descend to the dark and cold depths of the northern pacific ocean, where at around 630 metres ( 2,066 feet ) they managed to film a three-metre specimen.

        "summary": "Donald trump has made two more key picks for his administration: he's chosen gop sen. Jeff sessions of alabama for attorney general and republican congressman mike pompeo of kansas to lead the cia, reports politico. Both will require senate confirmation, and the ap notes that sessions could run into trouble because he has been by dogged by accusations of racism over the years. More coverage on that and more: when the 69-year-old sessions was up for a federal judgeship in 1986, four different lawyers testified that he made racist comments. One black prosecutor accused sessions of calling him \" boy \" and of joking that he thought the kkk was fine \" until i found out they smoked pot. \" sessions, who also allegedly called the naacp \" un-american, \" didn't get the post. See cnn. In a \" 10 things to know \" post about sessions, the washington post notes that he was in 2014 called \" amnesty's worst enemy \" by the national review for his hardline positions on immigration. See the full list here. A take from politico: sessions \" is well-regarded by his republican colleagues, although his breed of hardline conservatism falls outside the gop mainstream. He is opposed to creating a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and a vocal critic of marijuana legalization, though he worked with the obama administration and democrats on legislation supported by civil rights groups that reduced the sentencing disparity for cocaine possession. \" sessions was trump's first supporter in the senate, and he played down trump's comments in the infamous access hollywood leaked tape, notes the huffington post. Sessions ' official senate bio is here. Pompeo, 52, \" is considered a serious if rather hawkish member of the republican national security establishment. \" more background at the hill. The new york times notes that he gained national prominence as a member of the house intelligence committee when he criticized hillary clinton over the 2012 benghazi attack. He's also been among those most outspoken against president obama's nuclear deal with iran, notes mcclatchy. Pompeo's official bio is here.",

( credit: ap images ) on tuesday, elizabeth rosenthal of the new york times tweeted out, \"british royal born in fanciest ward: $ 15000. Average us birth: billed $ 30,000; paid $ 18,000. What's wrong here? \" rosenthal has her numbers right — and to answer her question, what's wrong is that the u.s. System of medical care charges patients on a fee-for-service basis without giving consumers transparent pricing information. Worse yet, americans don't even receive particularly high-quality maternal care in exchange for their outsized medical bills. Rosenthal's tweet leads to a detailed analysis she did for the new york times in june. She found that hospitals charge about $ 30,000 for a vaginal delivery and newborn care, and c-sections cost closer to $ 50,000. Insurers only pay $ 18,000 to $ 28,000 on average for those services — and out-of-pocket costs for women with insurance, which used to be almost nothing, have risen to an average of $ 3,400 today: the biggest reason for this disparity is the american medical culture, in which doctors have a perverse incentive to perform as many procedures as possible since they can bill for each test and treatment. Patients don't know the size of the bill they're in for until they get it because the cost of u.s. Health care is largely opaque. So it's not surprising that many doctors perform unnecessary procedures on pregnant women. For instance, the american academy of family physicians released a list of 90 most common unnecessary procedures that includes expensive c-section deliveries for healthy women before 39 weeks of pregnancy. Consumer groups point out that the rates of these c-sections have skyrocketed without many discernible health benefits, as have ultrasounds after 24 weeks of pregnancy, and early epidurals. Technological advancements exacerbate the costs of unnecessary procedures like those by raising the cost of the underlying treatments. In fact, progress in technology has accounted for at least half of the rise in national health care spending in the last 70 years. That's not to say technology isn't critical for better medical care. But when it's used for the purpose of wrangling extra fees from patients, it only drives up costs, and c-sections for women who don't need them are good"

Police say they have determined that a man whose body was found outside the alaska city was murdered in anchorage, making it a record 35 homicides for the year, with almost three weeks to go, ktoo reports. The previous record was set last year, which had 34 homicides, way over what police said is the usual range of 12 to 24 killings per year. Before 2016, the year with the most homicides in anchorage was 1995, with 29. Anchorage police chief justin doll told reporters this week that most of the cases involved victims and suspects who knew each other, and were often \" involved in criminal activity together. \" some 23 of the cases have been closed, meaning a suspect has been charged or the killing was deemed justified.

Generally speaking, this year's homicides have not been random, anchorage police chief justin doll in an interview monday afternoon. The victims and suspects often know each other. They are \" frequently involved in criminal activity together, \" often illegal drug activity, doll said. Some of the homicide victims in 2017 were killed by someone they knew intimately, such as brandy sullivan, whose estranged husband was charged with her death, and brittanymae haag, whose boyfriend was charged with hers. In february, three people died as a result of an apartment fire in spenard, which was later determined to be arson. Another victim was a 2-year-old girl who police say died of extreme malnutrition in may, and whose mother has been charged with homicide.

That would bring the city to a record number of homicides in a calendar year. The body of anchorage man weston gladney, 36, was found in the jim creek recreation area of butte, in the matanuska-susitna borough, on dec. 2. \" investigation by troopers has determined that the homicide occurred in anchorage, \" alaska state troopers spokesman tim despain said. \" at this time there is no additional information available for release in regards to this ongoing investigation. \" gladney's killing was the 35th homicide in anchorage in 2017, police said – a new record. In 2016, there were a total of 34 homicides in the city, which also set a record. Twenty-three of this year's homicides are closed cases, which means that either a suspect has been charged or a decision has been made not to file charges, such as in cases of self-defense, according to police spokeswoman renee oistad. Generally speaking, this year's homicides have not been random, anchorage police chief justin doll in an interview monday afternoon. The victims and suspects often know each other. They are \" frequently involved in criminal activity together, \" often illegal drug activity, doll said. Some of the homicide victims in 2017 were killed by someone they knew intimately, such as brandy sullivan, whose estranged husband was charged with her death, and brittanymae haag, whose boyfriend was charged with hers. In february, three people died as a result of an apartment fire in spenard, which was later determined to be arson. Another victim was a 2-year-old girl who police say died of extreme malnutrition in may, and whose mother has been charged with homicide. On sept. 12, three people were fatally shot at a spenard gold shop by a man who police say got into a fight with the store owner. In late august, a 91-year-old man shot and killed his wife. All charges against him"

A spokesperson for gosar — who is currently trying to impeach an epa administrator — tells politico other legislators are interested in joining the boycott, but he was unable to give any names. Rep. John fleming of louisiana tells usa today he plans to attend the address but hopes the pope will use his time to re-emphasize the evils of abortion instead of wasting time on climate change. Politico reports the \" vast majority \" of the world's scientists say the earth is getting warmer mostly due to human activity.",

The baltimore-area girl, identified in court as jane doe, communicated with several men via xbox live and social media. Earlier this month, she went missing, and a few days later, microsoft produced a chilling transcript from one of her conversations with another contact, in which she said she was \" going to live with some guy. \" she typed: \" im scared he said he was gonna kidnap me. \" after she was found, she said she had been raped twice. Jane doe's ipod touch helped investigators track her down via what police called \" digital forensics, \" officials said, as the perry hall patch reports. Apple told authorities where the ipod had been used recently, including at a home in north carolina. Further investigation there directed searchers to another home, where they found the girl a few days after she'd gone missing. Now, victor yanez arroyo, 32, has been charged with kidnapping and rape, among other charges. So should we further crack down on kids ' internet use? not necessarily, an expert tells ars technica. \" more of crime, and of social life in general, is moving online. But that increase does not necessarily translate to increased risk. In fact, the internet may increase the likelihood of some of these criminal acts being detected, \" he says.",

That started a battle on land and sea between the military and the rebels, with a naval blockade fending off rebel reinforcements, reuters reports. A mnlf spokesman described the turmoil as government forces attacking a peaceful march through the city. Houses were set on fire, and firefighters were unable to reach them thanks to sniper fire. The predominantly christian port city is home to 800,000 people, and about 500 elite us anti-terrorism troops. Philippine authorities say around 200 people are trapped in four militant-occupied neighborhoods. \" it doesn't appear that they are being treated as hostages, because they are free to move about, \" the interior minister tells the new york times.",

But get this: officials are aiming to change the rules to make it officially ok for a male administrator to paddle a girl. The current policy in the district is that \" corporal punishment shall be administered only by an employee who is the same sex as the student. \" but now springtown high school is in trouble, not, some administrators believe, because a man paddled 15-year-old taylor santos, but because the old \" same gender \" policy is too limiting, reports the los angeles times. The superintendent of the district is trying to change the policy, and the first discussion was scheduled for last night. The district, which carries out the most spankings of any in the dallas-fort worth area, last got into trouble when a coach so severely paddled a 12-year-old boy that it left the kid with a large bruise, convincing officials to limit meting about corporal punishment to administrators. Taylor's mom didn't object to her daughter being paddled for sharing homework, but was furious it was done by a man. Another mother said it was \" creepy. \"",

Then they turned up thousands of miles away in australia. \"i couldn't believe what i was seeing, \" researcher stephan getzin tells the new york times. Fairy circles are grassless circles — often large enough to park a minivan in — arranged in a honeycomb pattern with about 30 feet of space in between each, smithsonian magazine reports. Explanations for their existence in namibia ranged from underground gas to dragons, but scientists have largely settled on two causes: termites or \" self-organization. \" getzin, who wrote a paper on the namibian fairy circles in 2014, argues for the self-organization of plants to take advantage of scarce water as the cause of fairy circles. \"such phenomena are explained with lots of theory and formulas and math, \" getzin tells the times. His paper got the attention of an environmental manager in australia, who sent images of similar circles in the australian outback. \" we couldn't believe it — the namibia fairy circles are supposed to be the only ones in the world, \" getzin tells smithsonian magazine. Getzin believes the australian fairy circles, which don't sync up with local termite activity, strengthen the self-organization theory. But there's still no proof. Luckily, it now appears there are likely even more fairy circles out there to study. \" it's a matter of searching, \" getzin says.",

Suni, who was brought to kenya from a czech zoo in 2009 to take part in a last-ditch breeding program to save the species, was found dead by park rangers. The cause of death is unclear, but authorities don't believe poaching was involved. Suni's father died of natural causes at the same age. But while poaching wasn't involved in this death, it was demand for rhino horn that reduced the species from more than 2,000 as recently as 1960 to today's handful of survivors, the telegraph reports. \" suni was one of the last two breeding males in the world and no northern white rhinos are known to have survived in the wild, \" the ol pejeta conservancy said in a statement. \" consequently the species now stands at the brink of complete extinction, a sorry testament to the greed of the human race.

Suni, a 34-year-old northern white, and the first of his species to be born in captivity, was found dead on friday by rangers at the ol pejeta conservancy near nairobi. While there are thousands of southern white rhinos in the plains of sub-saharan africa, decades of rampant poaching has meant the northern white rhino is close to extinction. Suni was one of the last two breeding males in the world as no northern white rhinos are believed to have survived in the wild. Though the conservancy said suni was not poached,"

A new book titled hood ( object lessons ) by alison kinney looks at the garment's history, from torturers to medieval clerics to red riding hood — and its odd rise to popularity among members of the ku klux klan, the smithsonian reports. Seems that during reconstruction ( 1865-1877 ), klansmen wore everything from huge animal horns to polka-dotted paper hats to pillow cases and flour sacks. \" they imitated french accents or barnyard animals; they played guitars to serenade victims, \" writes kinney, as excerpted in the new republic. \" many early klansman also wore blackface, simultaneously scapegoating and mocking their victims. \" the variety of disguises enabled southern leaders to deny the existence of a coordinated kkk, kinney says. When reconstruction ended — allowing white men to take power and pass jim crow laws — many of them quit the klan and committed lynchings without any disguise. Then came dw griffith's wildly popular 1915 film the birth of a nation, which lionized the klan and dressed them in white hoods and robes ( perhaps influenced by freemason outfits or garments worn by holy week penitents in europe ). Soon a wily salesman benefited by selling the kkk white hoods and robes; the kkk then mass-produced them and boosted sales with a mail-order catalogue. \" the hoods made klan membership cool, \" writes kinney; \" they helped rebrand the klan as a popular, patriotic, money-making, white clubhouse movement. \" ( a former klan leader is hosting an mlk event. )",

In the wake of the supreme court ruling this summer, lawyers for the plaintiffs in multiple same-sex marriage cases — who mostly worked pro bono — are using a 1976 law that allows them to collect \" reasonable attorney's fees \" from local governments should they win their case. \"some of the tactics the state used were unnecessarily dragging out the time spent and the cost of the litigation. You have government officials who knew very well where this was headed and nonetheless defended these discriminatory laws, \" one lawyer tells al jazeera. \"it's the price governments pay for defending bigotry, \" says another. Seven states have already paid attorneys more than $ 3.5 million in total, and at least four other states could be on the hook for nearly $ 5 million in fees, al jazeera reports. Texas, which appealed after one of its own judges ruled its same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, is refusing to pay the requested $ 741,000 in legal fees, according to the houston press. But experts believe the state will likely be forced to pay in the end. \" the attorney's fees provision is there to protect people who go to court who try and vindicate constitutional rights and are successful, \" says one such expert. \"this is exactly what congress created this law for, \" adds another. \"it's a recognition that people need lawyers to fight the government, which has lots of lawyers, when they feel their civil rights are being violated.

        "summary": "If isis wants to infiltrate mecca and medina ( muhammad's burial location ), it may have to find another way in other than crossing the iraqi border. Since september, saudi arabia has quietly been erecting a 600-mile east-west barrier between itself and its northern neighbor, the christian science monitor reports. The main purpose of the barrier — what the telegraph has already dubbed \" saudi arabia's ' great wall ' \" — is to keep isis away, especially from the saudi holy sites of mecca and medina, both of which the insurgents have apparently set their sights on, reports upi. The isis suicide attack last week along the border that killed three saudi guards was apparently an attempt to breach the wall. Although the cost of the structure has not been revealed, it appears to be a hefty investment: the fence-and-ditch blockade will consist of steep, hard-to-climb sand embankments and five layers of razor-wire fencing, as well as underground sensors that set off a silent alarm, the telegraph reports. Per the csm, the structure will also boast 40 watchtowers manned by border guards, 240 rapid-response vehicles, and seven radar-equipped command centers said to be able to scan for objects up to 22 miles away. Although saudi arabia isn't usually on the short list of the areas isis wants to take over to create an islamist state — al arabiya mentions iraq, syria, jordan, kuwait, lebanon, israel, and palestine as the group's main goals — the kingdom's alliances with the west, specifically participation in airstrikes against isis in syria, have apparently made it a prime target as well, reuters reports.",

But just after cox got there, the police arrived. According to cbs boston, the 17-year-old didn't end up in hot water with police — though they initially lumped her with a group of underage kids who were told they may have to appear in court for drinking, she ultimately didn't have to, and an officer acknowledged, in writing, that she had not been drinking and didn't have any alcohol on her. But her massachusetts high school reacted a little differently. North andover high told the senior honor student she had violated the district's zero-tolerance alcohol and drug policy, and as a result, she lost her role as captain of the volleyball team and was suspended for five games. \" if a kid asks for help from a friend, you don't want that kid to say ' i ' m sorry i can't help you. I might end up in trouble at school, ' \" says an attorney who is helping the cox family appeal to the school to reverse the punishment; erin's teammates ' parents have also started a petition on her behalf. A lawyer for the school explains to the boston herald that once the police became involved, the school didn't have many options. But, as the atlantic wire notes, the school's policy doesn't make it clear which rule cox was violating, and seems to give school officials an out. Though the policy is pretty clear that consuming alcohol is not ok, it says students linked to such activity may \" be subject to investigation if that is deemed appropriate by the administration. \"",

That's when, serenaded by his pal david hall's a cappella version of the rock song \" wiggle it, just a little bit, \" taylor wedged his back against another rock, put his legs against the delicate sculpture, and pushed. In a few seconds, the ancient tourist attraction tumbled to the ground. Hall memorialized the act on video -- as well as the laughter and high fives that followed -- and then posted the minute-long act to facebook. \" we have now modified goblin valley, a new goblin valley exists, \" hall can be heard saying. \" that's crazy that it was held up just by that little bit of dirt. Some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way. So it's all about saving lives here at goblin valley. Saving lives. That's what we're all about. \" a few days later, hall told kutv that the goblin had been unstable. \" that wasn't going to last very long at all, \" he told the cnn affiliate. \" one gust of wind and a family's dead. \" asked if he would do it again, he said, \" absolutely, absolutely. \" \" it didn't look like a stiff wind to me, \"",

            "A camouflage-clad florida dance troupe desperate to make it to a live tv talent show set off a rush-hour terror scare when they ditched their cars in merciless lincoln tunnel traffic and tried to sprint through the tube. The fbi-nypd joint terrorism task force was called in — and a massive contingent of heavily armed cops surrounded the harmless performers, who stood teary-eyed in their showy costumes as hundreds of angry drivers were stuck in the snarl. \"they drew their guns on us at first, \" said landon burse, 24, the group's executive director who arranged the appearance on bet's \"106 &amp; park \" segment \"wild on wednesday. \" \"it was terrifying. I was crying, \" said eternity odom, 16, one of the four girls who perform in the group. The tunnel was closed for 45 minutes before cops realized the eight-member team was headed to the studio on west 57th street. They eventually offered them a police escort to make the show. But it was too late — the hard-headed producers of the live talent show told them not to bother, sending them in a trail of tears back down the new jersey turnpike. The group, called \"club envy, \" had set out from jacksonville about 24 hours earlier with stardust in their eyes as they hit i-95 for the 1,158 mile trip north — a trip for",

Filipino jennifer laude, 26, who was born jeffrey, was found oct. 11 outside a former us navy base northwest of manila, and 19-year-old pfc. Joseph scott pemberton has been accused of killing her, the ap reports. The new york times adds that laude's neck was broken. Back in october, a friend of laude's testified during a philippine senate hearing that pemberton met the two of them at a bar on the night of the murder, and he \" thought we were real women. \" the friend said the trio went to the motel where laude was eventually found, and she left laude and pemberton alone in the room. The murder has aggravated ties between the us and the philippines, reuters reports; the two just signed a military agreement in april allowing the us to build military facilities and station military ships, planes, and equipment in the philippines. Pemberton has not been seen in public yet, and some of laude's loved ones have questioned whether he's still in the country. The prosecution head urged them to come to the arraignment, at which pemberton must appear. Since late october, he's reportedly been detained at a us facility near the main philippine army base in manila, but there has been debate between the us and the philippines over where american military suspects should be held. The trial court is expected to issue an arrest warrant and an order to place him in jail within a week.",

The uss theodore roosevelt will join other us ships in the area while roughly eight iranian vessels, possibly carrying arms, may be steaming toward yemen. Navy officials revealed the move anonymously and said the roosevelt would be a deterrent, not an offensive weapon. Publicly, a pentagon spokesman denied that the roosevelt and its accompanying cruiser, uss normandy, were there to intercept arms, reuters reports. The us navy said it was beefing up its yemen presence simply to \" ensure the vital shipping lanes in the region remain open and safe. \" the move comes as saudi arabia and its allies are trying to crush the houthi rebels, who grabbed yemen's capital city of sanaa last year and seized power in northern provinces. The west says iran is shipping arms to the houthis, which tehran denies. Meanwhile, the us is giving intelligence and logistical backing to sunni airstrikes in yemen; one such attack targeting a scud missile base in sanaa just killed dozens and wounded 300, yemeni officials told al jazeera today. Yemen, the poorest country in the middle east, is said to be near collapse. All of this while the us and six other nations are trying to wrap up a controversial deal to curb iran's nuclear program.

Health officials told al jazeera on monday that more than 300 people were wounded when warplanes reportedly struck a scud missile base in faj attan, a district in western sanaa, that sparked a series of explosions. Thick black smoke billowed into the sky as scores of nearby houses and vehicles were destroyed leaving the streets littered with debris. Who are the houthis? - the houthis belong to the zaydi community, a shia sect that makes up about a third of yemen's population. - they launched a rebellion in 2004 in their stronghold northern region of saada. - their initial demand was an end to political and economic marginalisation in the north. - another objective was allegedly to restore the rule of shia imams, who ruled yemen for nearly 1,000",

Two economists pored over surveys about well-being and found that in most places, married people are happier — even when controlling for their happiness-level before marriage, the new york times reports. ( where it's not true: sub-saharan africa, south asia, and latin america. ) what's more, those who consider their spouse their best friend are roughly twice as satisfied. Even people who live together without marriage derive about 75 % of that benefit, the huffington post reports. \" we do think it's more about that social relationship than the legal status, \" says a study co-author. \" marriage, in a sense, is a super friendship. \" marital friendship is most beneficial during mid-life, when family and career dole out the worst stress: \" one hypothesis... Is that the social support provided by a spouse helps ease the stresses of middle age, \" the wall street journal quotes the authors as saying. Women apparently derive more happiness than men from marrying their best friend, but are less likely to consider a spouse their best friend. In one reaction to the study, an author who advocates for the single life says \" the people who got married chose to marry \" and perhaps the researchers overlooked \" people like me who are single at heart. \" but the study does compare the never-married to those who at least tried marriage, huffpo notes, and found the latter \" happier on average. \" ( another study finds that marital problems don't go away. )",

Public documents obtained by the electronic frontier foundation show seven inmates were handed a combined 20 years in solitary confinement for the clip, which shows inmates rapping, beatboxing, and dancing in a cell. Filmed in 2014 and posted to worldstarhiphop.com, the video became a key part of their sentencing, as prison officials pointed out the use of gang signs, a cellphone to film the clip, and social media to make it public, the new york daily news reports. The inmates also lost visitation hours and other privileges. \" south carolina becomes the poster child for abuse of solitary confinement \" with the move, says dave maass, an investigative researcher with the eef. The digital rights group has set its sights on the state before: back in february, the eff found the south carolina department of corrections doled out stints in solitary confinement to hundreds of inmates caught using facebook — including 37 years to an inmate who posted to the site 38 times, though such punishments are often shortened, per buzzfeed. The scdc's director said severe punishments for the use of contraband cellphones and social media were warranted, noting a corrections officer \" was shot six times in his home due to an attempted contract killing via a contraband cellphone. \" still, the scdc in february revised its policy, saying it wouldn't let an inmate stay in solitary for more than 60 days. In explaining the length of the latest punishments, a rep says they are justified because the inmates \" are gang members and a continued threat to safety. \" ( here's how solitary confinement breaks the mind. )",

It was like time stood still. \" as silence fell, ryan began to hear \" the hideous things next door, \" the quieting whimpers, \" but i couldn't get in to help. \" twenty-six people died in the first car, along with 26 others in four coordinated bomb attacks across london in what are now known as the 7/7 attacks — the worst terrorist act in britain since 1988. On today's 10th anniversary, citizens stood in silence at 11: 30am local time, remembering the three bombings on london's tube and one on a bus in tavistock square. Commuters are sharing tributes on twitter using the hashtag #walktogether, reports the guardian. Prime minister david cameron, london mayor boris johnson, and prince andrew were among those to gather for a memorial service at st. Paul's cathedral, along with survivors and relatives of victims. Elsewhere, people gathered at the key bombing sites. In addition to the 52 dead, 700 were injured and some 4,000 were affected by the blasts, per the telegraph. Hundreds, if not thousands, suffered mental health problems as a result, including ryan, who was diagnosed with ptsd two years ago. She witnessed terror, but \" on that day on the train, i didn't see one selfish person, \" she says. \" it was at once the awful side of humanity, but also the magical side. \"",

        "summary": "Baby humpback whales \" whisper \" to their mothers, according to a paper published tuesday in functional ecology. And that could speak volumes about the intelligence of these aquatic giants. Npr reports scientists — for the first time ever — attached recording devices directly to humpback calves. \" it's like a squeaky sound, and some of them are really like grunting sounds, \" researcher simone videsen describes the results. The sounds are a lot different — and a lot quieter — than the songs sung by adult humpbacks. Scientists originally thought calves made noise when they wanted food, but that appears to not be the case, according to science. Researchers now theorize baby humpbacks whisper to help their moms keep track of them while the family is on the move. Mother humpback whales will occasionally whisper back to their calves despite being capable of making much louder noises, seeker reports. It's possible the calves themselves are also physically capable of making louder noises. This suggests to researchers the whales are whispering to avoid being detected by predators — such as killer whales, which videsen says \" can use these sounds... Like homing cues \" — or by male humpback whales that would break up the family. If that's the case, it could be evidence of high intelligence in humpbacks. \"it can only make you happy to hear these sounds, \" videsen says. Npr has a recording of the whispers. ( meanwhile, a new habit of humpback whales is puzzling researchers. )",

        "summary": "A texas teacher has filed a suit against her school district and two district officials, claiming she's been discriminated against for one reason: \" plaintiff is lesbian/gay and was born that way. \" the teacher, per the new york times, is 31-year-old stacy bailey, who alleges in her complaint ( seen on buzzfeed ) that her troubles started after an introductory slideshow last august to her new fourth-grade students at arlington's charlotte anderson elementary school. Included in the slides, per a release, were pics of her best friend, parents — and julie vazquez, who bailey noted was her future wife ( the two married in march ). Soon after, bailey was told by the principal a parent had complained about her \" homosexual agenda, \" both for her presentation and for talking about the artist jasper johns and his partner, robert rauschenberg. Bailey's suit alleges that parent recruited others to complain about her. In september, bailey — who's twice won teacher of the year during her 10 years with the mansfield independent school district — was placed on paid leave, the release notes; in october, she was asked to resign and refused. In april, bailey's contract was renewed, but in a may 1 letter, the school district reassigned her to a high school, spurring her suit. Mansfield isd, meanwhile, says in a statement bailey's \" open sexual orientation \" was never an issue until \" her actions in the classroom changed, \" noting bailey may have broken district rules that \" teachers shall not use the classroom to transmit personal belief regarding political or sectarian issues. \" vazquez calls the whole thing \" mind-boggling. \" \" our family has a right to talk about our family just the same as any other family, \" she tells the times. Bailey's suit seeks reinstatement at her old school, a jury trial, and possible damages.",

The little boy, identified by people as elijah orejuela, died sunday after two days on life support; his sister, elyssa orejuela, died the same day a worker at om baby found them both in the deep end of the pool at the day care facility, which was run out of a home in west knoxville. \" it is with much heartbreak that i tell you that elijah has gone to be with his sister, \" the twins ' mother, identified by fox news as registered nurse amelia wieand, wrote on facebook tuesday. \" they were formed in my womb and grew together. She was his other half. They were soulmates. \" per the sentinel, om baby is registered to a jen salley, though she's said not to own the home where the day care was located. A care.com listing that's since been deleted showed that salley, who also offered swimming lessons and was reportedly certified in cpr and first aid, had been offering child care since 2010. People reports om baby had had complaints lodged against it in the past — including that there were too many kids in the home, per tennessee department of human services records cited by the sentinel — and two months ago it was told to cease operations due to not being licensed. It's not yet clear whether criminal charges will be filed in the twins'deaths. A gofundme set up for the family has so far raised more than $ 35,000 for medical bills and funeral expenses, and wieand noted on facebook that elijah's organs had been donated \" to prevent another family from suffering this immeasurable pain. \"",

In fact, the paleontologists who found it say it's the biggest ever found and thus the biggest creature ever to have walked the earth, reports the bbc. Let us count the ways: based on its ginormous thigh bones, they estimate that it was 65 feet tall, 130 feet long, and weighed about 85 tons, reports the telegraph. That would make it about 8 tons heavier than the previous no. 1, argentinosaurus, though at least one expert cautions that a lot of guesswork goes into such claims. \" it's like two trucks with a trailer each, one in front of the other, and the weight of 14 elephants together, \" says the lead argentinian paleontologist on the dig, as quoted in the guardian. \" this is a real paleontological treasure. \" the creature, which doesn't have a name yet, is thought to be a new species of titanosaur within the larger sauropod group. The herbivore roamed the patagonia region of argentina about 100 million years ago. A dinosaur expert at london's natural history museum notes that estimating size from bones is a tricky thing, and \" ideally we'd need much more material of these supersized animals to determine just how big they really got. \" ( click to read about another newly found dinosaur dubbed \" pinocchio rex. )",

Instead of positioning resistance as the new coachella, heineken takes a more measured approach. Ahead of the operation, it filmed six people stating strongly held beliefs — that men are oppressed, that the fight for feminism is far from over; that climate change is real or \"piffle \"; that transgender people need a voice; that \"transgender \" is nonsense semantics.

Created by publicis london, it's being billed as the antidote to pepsi's obtusely pop-candy take on our messy political reality. Instead of positioning resistance as the new coachella, heineken takes a more measured approach. Ahead of the operation, it filmed six people stating strongly held beliefs — that men are oppressed, that the fight for feminism is far from over; that climate change is real or \"piffle \"; that transgender people need a voice; that \"transgender \" is nonsense semantics. Those unwitting candidates were then paired with their opposites and sent together",
            "This is how it's done. This week, heineken released its new ad, \"worlds apart, \" as part of their campaign called #openyourworld. The ad features pairs of people who have some diametrically opposed views on climate change, transgender rights, and feminism. When the pairs first meet, they don't know they have these differences. The question this experiment aims to answer is, \"can two strangers with opposing views prove that there's more that unites than divides us? \" after completing a few tasks and conversing a bit, the pair is shown videos, where each sees the other take a side on a topic. Once they've both seen the videos, they have two choices: walk away, or talk about it over",

As for his take on an economy that \" kills, \" francis says that rather than marxism, \" there is nothing in the exhortation that cannot be found in the social doctrine of the church. \" mediaite has more on limbaugh et al. Other highlights from francis ' interview: on'trickle-down theories ' of economics: they \" assume that economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and social inclusiveness in the world. The promise was that when the glass was full, it would overflow, benefiting the poor. But what happens instead, is that when the glass is full, it magically gets bigger, ( and ) nothing ever comes out for the poor. \" on an embarrassed mother holding a hungry, crying child: \" i said to her: madam, i think the child's hungry. ' yes, it's probably time,'she replied. ' please give it something to eat! ' i said. She was shy and didn't want to breastfeed in public, while the pope was passing. I wish to say the same to humanity: give people something to eat! that woman had milk to give to her child; we have enough food in the world to feed everyone. \"",

Acting on a tip that a child had been left alone at home in rural chatsworth, officers discovered that while an adult was home, an 8-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy had been living inside improvised cages made of beds, wooden railings, hinges, and zip ties, reports nbc news. The children's mother, 34-year-old stephanie stone, and a 49-year-old woman named wanda redfern were arrested. \" some parts of the home where the two cage apparatus ' were less than what anyone would want to live in, \" says a local fbi official. The children were placed into the custody of the department of family and children's services, which had been working on the family's case until closing it in june, wtvc reports. According to nbc news, both children appeared to be in decent condition. More arrests are still possible in the case.",

The vanity fair reporter talking to talese says the author became clearly \" agitated \" as he went on. \" i would like to ask [ spacey ] how it feels to lose a lifetime of success and hard work all because of 10 minutes of indiscretion 10 years or more ago. \" then came the odd comparison to the dalai lama. \" you know something, all of us in this room at one time or another did something we're ashamed of, \" he said. \" the dalai lama has done something he's ashamed of.

Soon, people will mostly go there to party. Despite protests from relatives of those imprisoned at the site, montenegro's government has approved a plan to transform the fortress on the small island of mamula, at the entrance to boka bay, into a luxury hotel with a \" party ambiance. \" initially built at the end of 19th century to stop the approach of enemy ships, the fortress was used as a concentration camp during both world wars before becoming a prison, reports forbes. Today, it's a popular tourist attraction, with visitors raving about the \" stunning views \" and \" chilling beauty \" — facets developers will now take advantage of. An artist's rendering of mamula resort shows the fortress will keep its round shape, and a memorial room and museum will also be built to comply with the site's status as \" a monument of culture. \" and while the government says the plans will \" ( maintain ) the character of cultural heritage throughout the entire period of the lease, \" a woman whose mother was imprisoned at campo mamula says the hotel will \" ruin every memory of mamula and what it really was. \" indeed, the developer tells the balkan insight the site will be \" the best hotel on the mediterranean, \" and the government argues the hotel will help boost the local and national economy. It will include a spa, wine bar, dance floor, restaurant, and staff and guest accommodations. ( only one mass escape occurred from a death camp, and the last surviivor recently died. )",

The house and senate both approved the pacts with south korea, colombia, and panama. While the latin american pacts may have little impact, the south korean deal could create as many 280,000 american jobs and boost exports by $ 12 billion, the washington post reports. Farm exports are expected to get a major boost from the south korean deal, but labor groups opposed to the pact warned that the deal could wipe out american jobs in the textile, manufacturing, and electronics industries. Obama is expected to unveil further east asian trade deals this fall, although the pacts have been scaled back considerably. \" right from the start obama has been very reluctant to do any trade liberalization at all.

            "Congress resoundingly approved long-stalled trade agreements with south korea, colombia and panama late wednesday, authorizing the most significant expansion of trade relations in nearly two decades. While the deals with colombia and panama are likely to have limited economic impact, the agreement with south korea is designed to break down barriers between the united states and the world's 15th-largest economy. The south korea deal has the potential to create as many as 280,000 american jobs, according to a recent assessment by the staff of the u.s.

Several major labor unions have warned that any gains will come at the cost of layoffs among american workers because of heightened competition from south korean imports. The south korea deal is widely hailed as the most consequential trade pact since the north american free trade agreement was ratified in 1994. The house approved all three deals and was quickly followed by the senate. Final approval of the agreements represents a victory for the obama administration and congressional leaders in both parties, who have touted the trade pacts as a means to jump-start the flagging economy without additional government spending.

The new rule, which went into effect last week, requires airlines to give customers a full refund, without additional fees, if the customer requests one within 24 hours of booking a flight, usa today explains. That may sound innocent, but spirit insists that it's \" costing customers millions, \" arguing that it will lead to unfilled seats on flights, forcing the airline to spread the resulting costs to other customers. But dot chief ray lahood isn't buying it. \" this is just another example of the disrespect with which too many airlines treat their passengers, \" he said. Spirit has also railed against a rule requiring it to include taxes and fees in advertised ticket prices.",

In what politico calls a \" rare occurrence, \" each of the four dissenters penned their own dissent. Here's what they wrote: john roberts: \" if you are among the many americans — of whatever sexual orientation — who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the constitution. It had nothing to do with it. \" antonin scalia: \" i write separately to call attention to this court's threat to american democracy.... It is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage. It is of overwhelming importance, however, who it is that rules me. Today's decree says that my ruler, and the ruler of 320 million americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the supreme court.... This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, always accompanied ( as it is today ) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the people of the most important liberty they asserted in the declaration of independence and won in the revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves. \" clarence thomas: \" slaves did not lose their dignity ( any more than they lost their humanity ) because the government allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in internment camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government denies them those benefits. The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it away. The majority's musings are thus deeply misguided, but at least those musings can have no effect on the dignity of the persons the majority demeans. \" samuel alito: \" today's decision will also have a fundamental effect on this court and its ability to uphold the rule of law. If a bare majority of justices can invent a new right and impose that right on the rest of the country, the only real limit on what future majorities will be able to do is their own sense of what those with political power and cultural influence are willing to tolerate. Even enthusiastic supporters of same-sex marriage should worry about the scope of the power that today's majority claims.
