On thursday, jeff bezos of amazon tweeted his plan to commit $ 2 billion to what he's calling the bezos day one fund, cnbc reports. The money will be divided between the day 1 family fund, geared toward helping homeless families, and the day 1 academies fund, which will open and operate \" full-scholarship, montessori-inspired preschools in under-served communities, \" according to bezos'tweet. Going by wednesday's closing price of $ 1,990 per share, bezos will need to gift about 1 million shares of amazon stock to meet the $ 2 billion commitment, forbes reports, adding that he would be left with some 78 million shares of the company he founded. Cnbc notes that critics have been calling on bezos, who has a net worth of about $ 150 billion, to be more philanthropic. While he and his family have given tens of millions of dollars to other causes, the bezos day one fund will be \" by far \" bezos ' biggest act of philanthropy, per forbes. Still, not everyone is impressed. Some people are using the announcement to take shots at bezos over low pay and working conditions at amazon. \" pay your employees a living wage.

Among the report's suggestions, as per the la times: altering military installations in coastal areas that may be affected by flooding. Preparing for more humanitarian missions as natural disasters grow increasingly destructive. Ensuring that us military equipment will function in harsh weather conditions. The report also calls for broader changes in strategic thinking about regions like africa and the middle east, where food shortage and drought could trigger unrest. This isn't the first us military report to note a link between climate change and national security, the post adds: the navy released one in 2010, and hagel released one last year about a strategy for the arctic.

        "summary": "A bizarre lawsuit out of indianapolis revolves around life at the office and body odor. As indystar reports, the mess began when workers in the city's magistrate court complained about a co-worker's chronic body odor. That prompted amber bridges, as part of her role as lead staff, to place air fresheners around the office. Soon, others did the same, and the co-worker with the body-odor problem eventually complained to human resources. Bridges then got fired, the explanation being that she had created a hostile work environment. Now she is suing the city, arguing that her firing violates the american with disabilities act. The lawsuit makes a two-part argument: the co-worker's body odor is a protected disability, and, thus, bridges cannot be fired because of her association with the co-worker. The case hinges on a part of the ada that states \" persons discriminated against because they have a known association or relationship with a disabled individual also are protected. \" the reason for the body odor is not specified, but an employment attorney not connected to the case tells indystar that body odor can indeed qualify as a disability under certain circumstances. Attorneys for bridges and the city declined to comment, but the lawsuit says the city's \" conduct was outrageous and malicious, was intended to injure bridges, and was done with reckless indifference to bridges ' protected civil rights, entitling her to an award of punitive damages, \" per the indychannel.",

What do you do? well, at the 2012 democratic national convention, the chairman used a practice common at all levels of government: a voice vote. It's a simple process: voters simply say \" yea \" or \" nay, \" and a chairman judges by response. There's just one problem: voice votes are great at determining who's the loudest, but lousy at determining majority opinion, a new study concludes. Researchers ran a series of test votes, and found that unless one side had at least a 60 % majority, it was impossible to determine the winner. What's more \" the vote is very, very biased toward loud voices, \" lead researcher ingo titze says. The findings suggest it takes at least 40 normal voices to balance out one loud one if trying to establish a two-thirds majority, according to phys.org. That's what the dnc was trying to do, and the result was a disaster; after three utterly inconclusive votes, chair antonio villaraigosa simply said the measure passed. \" in a house like that, i don't think there is an alternative, \" titze tells inside science. \" you can't pass out pieces of paper to 5,000 to 10,000 people. \"",

        "summary": "A doubly tragic end to the story of the michigan mom who declined cancer treatment in an attempt to save her baby's life: that baby, life lynn deklyen, died wednesday night. Her mother, carrie deklyen, died within days of giving birth to life lynn at 24 weeks gestation on sept. 6. Carrie deklyen, 37, found out she was pregnant soon after finding out she had an aggressive form of brain cancer, but she declined to take part in a clinical trial that could have extended her life because it would have required her to terminate the pregnancy. She delivered via cesarean section at the earliest time a baby is considered viable for life; carrie deklyen was unconscious at the time and was taken off life support a day later, the detroit free press reports; she died on sept. 9. Life lynn's dad, nick deklyen, told followers of the couple's facebook page thursday of the baby's death, the detroit news reports. \" it is with great sadness and [ an ] absolutely broken heart that i tell you life lynn passed away last night, \" he posted on the cure 4 carrie page. \" carrie is now rocking her baby girl. I have no explanation of why this happened, but i do know jesus loves us and someday we will know why. The grief we feel is almost unbearable, please be praying for our family. \" nick deklyen told the detroit news wednesday that life lynn almost died on the day of carrie's funeral, sept. 12, and that on that day doctors asked if he wanted to hold her one last time and he said no because he refused to give up. In recent days, updates posted on the facebook page indicated life lynn was having a \" rough time \" with low oxygen levels and blood pressure problems, but they then noted her oxygen levels \" shot up \" after nick held her wednesday, possibly as a result of his touch. She leaves behind five siblings ages 2 to 18.",

            "What we know: - a truck drove into a crowd of people on the busy stockholm shopping street drottninggatan just before 15: 00 on friday. - four people were killed and at least 15 injured. - police could not confirm reports of shots being fired near the åhlens city department store or in the city's fridhemsplan district. - police have said they have arrested a person in märsta, north of stockholm, who could be linked to the attack. They have confirmed that the person matches an image released by police earlier on friday, but declined to release more details. - swedish brewery company spendrups, which owns the truck, said it had been stolen earlier in the day. - the city's subway system has resumed after being shut down, but some stations remain closed. Stockholm's central railway station was evacuated earlier in the day. -",
            "With the swedish pm saying the incident is being treated as an attack, here's some background on the isis extremist threat in sweden. Isis propaganda has for months continued inciting terror attacks in europe, the us, australia and other countries supporting military operations against its fighters. An issue of its rumiyah magazine issued in october contained lengthy instructions on how to carry out knife attacks, including what weapon to use, deadly places to strike a blow and ways to overcome \"discomfort \" at the thought of such slaughter. The next issue of the propaganda magazine, released in multiple languages in november, advised jihadis to launch vehicle attacks in an article citing the nice lorry attack that killed 86 people as a \"superb demonstration \". \"having a secondary weapon, such as a gun or a knife, is also a great way to combine a vehicle attack with other forms, \" it"

Variety reports that millie bobby brown, who plays eleven in the netflix series stranger things, has either deactivated or deleted her @milliebbrown twitter account, and it may be linked to a proliferation of memes painting the 14-year-old actress as being anti-gay ( the bbc notes it's not clear the trolling was the cause of the account vanishing ). Twitter users have been taking advantage of meme generators to take selfies and other pictures of brown and include homophobic slurs alongside them, making it appear as if she's anti-gay. The wrap notes that a #takedownmilliebobbybrown hashtag also started making the rounds late last year and came back in full force at the beginning of june, which is pride month. But there are some who say the memes started as an inside joke within the lgbt community. \" the joke here seems to be that it's so wildly out of character and unbelievable for millie bobby brown to act violently or intolerantly, that presenting her as such makes people laugh, \" vulture notes. In reality, brown has been a vocal advocate for gay rights ( she wore an lgbt pin to the 2017 mtv movie and tv awards ) and also has stood up against cyberbullying via her @milliestopshate handle. ( for those who are already missing millie online, that account is still up and running. ) she's not the first female actress to defect from social media: leslie jones, daisy ridley, and, most recently, kelly marie tran of star wars, have all left due to various forms of online harassment.",

Researchers looked at how ultragenyx's drug, ux007, affected 75 patients, including 29 from a previous ux007 phase 2 trial showing that ux007-treated patients had fewer illness-related visits to the hospital and fewer days in the hospital per year.

Everyone is speculating about what was behind the move — but \" the unbelievable thing is that there actually is no 'cause ' for this — no single thing, nothing, \" says one colleague. \" it was just a lot of accumulated backbiting. \" she and arthur sulzberger jr. Didn't get along even before she became executive editor, sources say, and things only got worse after. Particularly problematic: abramson's contentious relationship with new ceo mark thompson as well as the deputy who would eventually replace her, dean baquet. At the new yorker, ken auletta thinks pay disparity was the big reason — abramson recently learned her pay and pension benefits were less than those of bill keller, whom she replaced as both managing editor and, later, executive editor. \" she confronted the top brass, \" and they didn't react well, says a source. But the times itself denies that; a spokesperson tells politico, \" jill's total compensation as executive editor was not less than bill keller's, so that is just incorrect. \" david carr and ravi somaiya covered the story for the times, and they also cite \" serious tension \" between abramson and sulzberger and \" clashes \" with baquet, particularly over hiring decisions. But don't expect any official word from either abramson or the times; the article reports that a settlement prevents both sides from talking. A running theme through many articles on the matter is that abramson was disliked for being \" pushy. \" ruchika tulshyan addresses that in forbes, noting, \" that word — loaded and undeniably gendered — speaks to the deeper issues women face when they demand anything. \" at the new republic, rebecca traister notes that it's possible abramson was fired for performance issues — there have been rumblings that she was — but even so, the way it played out was \" harsh and humiliating, \" and it \" made me hope that eventually we will learn that she was stealing from the company cash register, \" traister writes. \" because that's pretty much the only crime i can think of that would merit as swift and brutal an exit. \"",

        "summary": "Archaeologists in jerusalem say they've made a first-of-its kind discovery: the seal of an ancient israelite king — one that may have been made by his own hand. Researchers digging in old jerusalem think the seal impression, or bulla, comes from king hezekiah, who ruled in the 8th century bc, reports the times of israel. The find is significant in part because it's the first such seal from an israelite king found by archaeologists, notes cnn. While similar seals featuring the king's name can be found on the antiquities market, only this one has the authenticity of scientists behind it. It's also notable because hezekiah himself was \" one of the most famous of the israelite kings \" given how he \" rooted out idol worship, spruced up the decrepit temple, and centralized power, \" according to livescience. The seal is just half-an-inch wide, suggesting it was made by the king's ring. \" it's hard to believe that anyone else had the permission to use the seal, \" says eilat mazar of the university of hebrew, who led the excavations. \" therefore, it's very reasonable to assume we are talking about an impression made by the king himself. \" the seal was actually found in an ancient dump in 2009, but it wasn't until this year that a researcher deciphered its inscription to reveal the royal origins, notes the times of israel. Early in his reign, hezekiah used a symbol of a creature with its arms outstretched, but the arms of the \" two-winged sun \" on this seal are facing downward. That suggests it came later in his reign as a nod to mortality after he survived a scare with a mortal illness, say the researchers, per livescience.

So say german researchers who conclude that \" darkness increases freedom from constraints, which in turn promotes creativity, \" reports pacific standard, picking up on a study in the journal of environmental psychology. The researchers put test subjects in rooms with dim, normal, and bright lighting and found that the first group performed best on problems that required outside-the-box thinking. Now the tricky part: once you generate that amazing idea, it's best to turn the lights back on. It seems that analytical thinking — which you ' ll need to implement your brainstorm — doesn't do so well in the dark. And finally, if you can't control the dimness of light in your room, just think about being in the dark for about five minutes before tackling your problem, suggest the researchers.

One such time, according to recent research, is when you need to think creatively. \"darkness increases freedom from constraints, which in turn promotes creativity, \" report anna steidle of the university of stuttgart and lioba werth of the university of hohenheim. A dimly lit environment, they explain in the journal of environmental psychology, \"elicits a feeling of freedom, self-determination, and reduced inhibition, \" all of which encourage innovative thinking. Steidle and werth describe six experiments which provide evidence for their thesis. The key one featured 114 german undergraduates, who were seated in groups of two or three in a small room designed to simulate an office. Merely priming the idea of darkness — taking five minutes to describe an experience of literally being in the dark, and recalling how it felt — is sufficient to boost creativity. The room was lit by a fixture hanging from the ceiling directly above the desk. The amount of illumination varied, with some groups receiving only 150 lux ( dim light ), others 500 lux ( the recommended lighting level for an office ), and still others 1,500 lux ( bright light ). After acclimating themselves for approximately 15 minutes, participants went to work on what the researchers describe as \"four creative insight problems typically used",

We expected that darkness would offer individuals freedom from constraints, enabling a global and explorative processing style, which in turn facilitates creativity. First, four studies demonstrated that both priming darkness and actual dim illumination improved creative performance. The priming studies revealed that the effect can occur outside of people's awareness and independent of differences in visibility.

As expected, perceived freedom from constraints mediated the effect of dim illumination on creativity.

        "summary": "Sheryl sandberg credits mark zuckerberg with helping her survive after husband dave goldberg's death in 2015 from a heart attack, a fact she recently revealed in an interview to promote her new book, option b: facing adversity, building resilience, and finding joy, released monday by knopf. Now that the book is out, the reviews are trickling in for the tome, which the facebook coo co-wrote with adam grant, a wharton psychologist. The book combines sandberg's personal narrative with data culled by grant about the strength that people summon to overcome devastating events and rediscover their happiness. Some thoughts from around the internet: jenny anderson, who lost her own brother in 2014, describes sandberg's book as being \" as much a guide for the bereaved as a handbook on how to be human \" that's \" packed with wisdom. \" anderson also talks on quartz about the three ps that can stifle someone's journey through tremendous grief — personalization, pervasiveness, and permanence — as well as sandberg's take on \" all the friends who don't know what the hell to say or do. \" in the new york times, caitlin flanagan notes that sandberg not only discovers \" comfort for herself, \" she's got some to offer her readers, too. Flanagan calls option b a \" remarkable achievement: generous, honest, almost unbearably poignant \" — including the exact words she said to break the news about her husband's death to her children. Sandberg \" followed the oldest data set in the world, the one that says: the children are young, and you must keep going, \" flanagan writes. Rebecca ruiz writes for mashable that she wept while reading sandberg's intimate revelations, and she wants others to \" suspend your skepticism \" of sandberg and read the book, too — despite what ruiz calls the \" glaring blindspots \" from her first book, lean in. Although some may think sandberg isn't relatable, ruiz notes that sandberg emerged from her own personal hell because she felt she could be a \" conduit \" to help others through their own grief. Ruiz also discloses the meaning behind the book's title. Option b is a book of \" radical vulnerability, \" writes leigh buchanan for inc., focusing on the practical advice, \" devastating \" data, and \" multiplier effect of poverty, inequality, and isolation on loss. \" buchanan also covers how sandberg, the consummate professional, handled eventually returning to work, complete with all of her doubts about her performance.

        "summary": "Since launching in 1994, snopes has managed to outlast the majority of web dinosaurs founded in the internet's salad days. But legal woes and company infighting threaten to take down the fact-checking site after more than 20 years of internet sleuthing, reports poynter. The company posted a plea to its readers monday, writing that it was in danger of \"closing its doors \" due to a vendor that is holding the site and its advertising revenue \"hostage. \" the open letter reminds users of the importance of fact-checking in the era of #fakenews and links to a gofundme campaign started by founder and ceo david mikkelson that asks for a suggested donation of $ 10. The viral campaign has raised nearly half of its $ 500,000 goal from thousands of patrons in its first nine hours. While snopes ' letter doesn't go into specifics about the mysterious vendor and its legal woes, the atlantic offers a deep dive into the drama that landed mikkelson's parent company, bardav, into this position. Married founders barbara and david mikkelson divorced in 2015, the same summer the couple joined forces with san diego startup proper media to help modernize the site's ancient backend and provide other services. A year later, barbara ended up selling her 50 % bardav stake to be split between proper media's owners. But a messy dispute prompted david mikkelson to sever ties with proper media. He claims that though the company's contract has been terminated, it \"continues to insert [ its ] own ads and has been withholding the advertising revenue from us. \" meanwhile, proper media's complaint claims otherwise, and its lawyer snapped back at mikkelson's campaign by asserting that proper media \"is a 50 % co-owner of bardav. \" ( this story on how the debunking site began is worth a read. )",

Sky news describes lionel barthelemy, 31, as the boy's stepfather but also as the boyfriend ( not husband ) of sabrina bonner, 25. Whatever the relationship, bonner is accused of going to visit barthelemy in prison with the boy; the man was serving a three-year sentence for domestic abuse. The two used trash bags to cover up the windows in the meeting room before barthelemy allegedly raped the boy. The international business times says bonner allegedly blindfolded the boy, made him kneel on a chair, and held his arms down during the attack. Barthelemy confessed to the rape, but said bonner encouraged it. Bonner is also accused of sexually assaulting the boy, now eight, at other times, recording those attacks, and giving the imprisoned barthelemy the recordings; in one case, afp reports, barthelemy allegedly listened to an assault from his cell on a mobile phone. But bonner says those incidents, as well as the prison rape, were carried out only because barthelemy threatened to hurt her if she didn't do what he wanted. At issue in the trial is why the visit was not supervised, as it should have been; a solicitor representing the boy may take action against the jail next. He also says bonner brought the boy back to the prison after the alleged rape, \" knowing perfectly well that it was going to happen again. \"",

Friends of egyptian suspects react as they listen to the judge's verdict at a court room during a case against foreign non-governmental organisations ( ngos ) in cairo june 4, 2013. Reuters/asmaa waguih judge makram awad gave five-year sentences in absentia to at least 15 u.s. Citizens who left egypt last year. He sentenced an american who stayed behind to two years in prison and gave the same sentence to a german woman. U.s. Secretary of state john kerry harshly criticized the decision, calling it \"incompatible with the transition to democracy \" and a violation of the government's commitment to support civil society as it emerges from years of authoritarian rule by close u.s. Ally former president",

Present at tuesday's hearing was american robert becker, who received a two-year sentence.

The verdict read out by judge makram",

        "summary": "New zealand home prices are among the highest in the world, and it's finally had enough. The country's plan to make the real estate market more affordable for locals: bar foreigners from buying homes there ( with very few exceptions ) in an attempt to drive the housing supply up. Stuff.co.nz reports parliament passed the overseas investment amendment bill on wednesday 63-57, with david parker, associate minister of finance, telling the body, per the guardian: \" we should not be tenants in our own land. \" stats show just 25 % of adult kiwis own their own home, and homelessness is a big problem. Last quarter, between 2 % to 3 % of homes scooped up in new zealand were purchased by foreign buyers, who mostly come from china, as well as australia, hong kong, the uk, and the us. Thanks to free-trade rules, buyers from singapore and neighboring australia are the only exemptions from the new law. But not everyone thinks this plan will lead to more affordable housing for the average kiwi. One economist says the land that overseas investors might buy wouldn't necessarily be used to build public or more affordable housing; a finance rep for the opposition national party, meanwhile, calls the new law \" xenophobic. \" at least one big name pre-circumvented the rule: it was announced last year that silicon valley bigwig peter thiel was granted new zealand citizenship in 2011, despite having spent less than two weeks in the country. \" that won't happen in the future, \" parker warned others who might be thinking of the same scheme.

An initial challenge will be training health care workers in providing cbt-i, and also convincing insurance providers to cover it. But the therapy itself takes work, too. Fox notes that it goes well beyond sleep hygiene; one particularly challenging step involves sleep restriction, where insomniacs don't allow themselves to get into bed until a certain number of hours before their alarm is set so that they go to bed exhausted and begin to associate their bed with sleep instead of tossing and turning.

Then kim jong un followed up by calling trump a \" mentally deranged us dotard, \" and trump capped that off with a new warning friday, tweeting that kim \" will be tested like never before! \" but the north this week also suggested a move that goes beyond words — and could lead to a \" lot of dead fish \": detonating a nuclear bomb a few hundred miles over the pacific ocean, per reuters. North korean foreign minister ri yong ho dropped hints on a south korean news channel ( his own apparent musings, not official word from kim ) that the north may conduct \" a historic aboveground test of a hydrogen bomb over the pacific ocean, \" per the wall street journal. Yang uk, a korea defense and security forum researcher, tells reuters that north korea \" may be bluffing \" — or seeking an excuse, like trump's words, for a test. The last time a nation experimented with an atmospheric detonation was in 1980, when china did so. Mit professor vipin narang says such a move would be \" provocative \" and, if anything goes awry, a possibly \" world-changing event. \" radioactive fallout would be a danger — though narang says it may not be so bad if the detonation took place high enough — as would the effects of electromagnetic pulses. A us missile analyst tells the journal north korea could also pack a hydrogen bomb on a ship and set it off in the sea. ( here's what \" dotard \" means. )",

So say researchers out of king's college london in the journal jama psychiatry after studying both identical and fraternal twins. In fact, hundreds of genes could contribute to the development of autism, although because genes interact with the environment, that doesn't totally preclude the possibility that environmental factors are at play as well. \" our findings suggest environmental factors are smaller, which is important because some parents are concerned whether things like high pollution might be causing autism, \" one researcher tells the bbc. \" the main consensus now is that the rise in diagnosis has more to do with increased awareness of the condition. \" for the study, researchers used data from the population-based \" twins early development study, \" looking at twins born in england and wales between 1994 and 1996.

The raids foiled a plot involving a man believed to be australia's most senior islamic state member who called contacts in australia and asked them to carry out a campaign of random public beheadings in sydney and brisbane, the abc understands. Mohammad ali baryalei, a former kings cross bouncer and part-time actor, is understood to have made the instruction to kidnap people in brisbane and sydney and have them executed on camera.

Australia is concerned over the number of its citizens believed to be fighting overseas with militant groups, including a suicide bomber who killed three people in baghdad in july and two men shown in images on social media holding the severed heads of syrian soldiers. More than 800 police were involved in the pre-dawn security operation in sydney and brisbane, which was described as the largest in australian history and resulted in the detention of 15 people, police",

However, \" the nursery is so close to shore waters that the heavy traffic could be keeping away the shark's predators, \" says a researcher. More research is needed to determine why the sand tiger sharks — listed as \" vulnerable \" and \" critically endangered \" in other parts of the world — are drawn to great south bay, but \" this habitat must provide food sources as well as protection from their predators, \" the researcher adds. \" as long as such key components are met, the sharks will likely continue to return. \" only a few nurseries for sand tiger sharks have been found, including one off massachusetts, per cbs new york.

        "summary": "An amazon employee emailed hundreds of fellow amazonians — including ceo jeff bezos — before leaping from a building at company headquarters in seattle monday morning. The man survived the jump, which police believe was a suicide attempt. A source tells bloomberg that the man, one of 20,000 workers in multiple buildings at the amazon campus, had asked to be transferred to a different department but had instead been placed on an employee improvement plan, which the source says tends to be a first step toward firing. The man, whose role with the company has not been disclosed, made it clear that he was unhappy with the company's handling of the transfer request and hinted that he would harm himself, the source says. A police spokesman tells the seattle post-intelligencer that the man jumped from a pedestal four stories up on the 12-story building, but he fell just 20 feet to a balcony. \" our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover, \" amazon said in a statement to business insider. \" he's receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process. \" ( after an unflattering new york times article last year, bezos denied that he had created a \" soulless, dystopian workplace where no fun is had and no laughter heard. \" )",

A study published in plos one conducted three separate experiments in which some of the subjects had eaten breakfast before heading to the lab, while others hadn't dined since the night before. In the first experiment, based on the iowa gambling task, participants picked cards from four decks, with each card having a certain monetary value; cards in decks a and b had higher individual values than those in decks c and d, but decks a and b also had higher \" penalty \" cards that forced subjects to give money back. Interestingly, hungry subjects seemed better able to pick up on the pattern of long-term rewards over short-term gains. In two other experiments ( one asked questions like \" would you prefer 27 euros today, or 50 euros in 21 days? \" ), hungry subjects \" were better able to resist [ hypothetical ] choices that brought immediate rewards but were ultimately disadvantageous \" than their well-fed counterparts. Researchers admit that more research is needed to see if other emotions come into play during the decision-making process, but they write in the report, \" hunger and appetite... Do not necessarily make people more impulsive, but rather make them rely more on gut feeling, which benefits complex decisions with uncertain outcomes.

Instead of focusing on books, the staffer wanted \"to think big. \" so the school system's development director pitched the most ambitious plan that came to mind, a proposal to obviate the need for high school textbooks that had been shelved two years earlier because nobody — not the cash-strapped school system, not the",
            "For generations the residents of breezy point, queens, have clung to their emerald roots. The gated community they called the irish riviera — or to those who prefer the language of the old world, \"cois farraige, \" gaelic for \"beside the sea \" — has remained one of the most proudly irish communities in america. So when hurricane sandy tore through the coastal enclave, sparking one of the most destructive residential fires in new york city's history and leaving behind hundreds of charred or flooded houses, all that love for the homeland was suddenly reciprocated, roaring back from across the atlantic. Breezy point has become something of a popular cause in ireland, its plight an urgent topic in newspaper headlines and radio dispatches more than three months after the storm. Gaelic rock stars threw fund-raisers, irish companies sent money and other donations, the country's consulate bused thousands of volunteers through breezy point's gates for \"irish days of action \" and pop stars made pilgrimages, including the irish tenors, who serenaded local residents over a christmas lunch and bade them \"the luck of the irish. \" \"it has become a huge irish-american issue, \" said aine sheridan, 53, the executive producer of the adrian flannelly show on the irish radio network usa, which has covered the recovery of breezy point and the city's"

Charges of fleeing an officer were dropped today against 24-year-old dajuawn wallace after his predicament began gaining widespread coverage, reports the detroit free press. Back in february, a campus officer at saginaw valley state university turned on his lights to make wallace pull over, and wallace drove about another mile and a half so he could do so in a well-lit parking lot. \" i live in detroit, and i know some people who were robbed by fake police officers, \" he tells mlive. \" i was taught to find a well-lit area to pull over in. \" he didn't speed up as he drove to a sam's club parking lot, and he says he rolled down his windows to signal to the officer that he intended to pull over. The officer saw things differently, however. \" the driver made no attempt to pull over and stop, \" he wrote. \" i observed the driver stick his hands out of the window a couple of times. I did not see the driver throw anything from the vehicle, though it was dark and the road was poorly lit. \" the officer pulled wallace over because he thought, incorrectly, that his car was the one spotted driving on a campus sidewalk. Wallace, who had been out getting medicine for his girlfriend, is studying for his master's degree at svsu, and the school president said today that \" we will try to use this as an opportunity to learn and better serve our students and the entire svsu community. \" he plans to meet with wallace personally.",

        "summary": "After the plan sparked controversy, divine child high school says it will no longer force \" modesty ponchos \" on girls who attend prom on may 12 in a dress that doesn't meet the catholic school's dress code, the ap reports. The plan made headlines after the ponchos were put on display at the dearborn, mich., school along with notes that read, \" if your dress does not meet our formal dance dress requirements - no problem! we've got you covered - literally. This is our modesty poncho, which you ' ll be given at the door.: ) \" the school's prom formal dress policy includes detailed requirements banning \" plunging necklines, \" \" plunging back openings, \" \" exposed cleavage, \" \" visible midriffs, \" \" cutouts beneath the traditional bra line, \" and slits that go higher than an inch above the knee joint, among other things. Those requirements will apparently still be in effect. Students and their parents are required to sign off on the requirements and acknowledge that if their dress doesn't meet them, they may be forced to change or sent home. The detroit free press reports that many criticized the ponchos on social media, with one student saying the school forces modesty ponchos on larger-breasted girls who wear something \" even a little low \" cut: \" they basically body shame girls if they're bigger than a b cup, \" the post reads. \" it's a method of shaming,... And degrading to females, \" adds an anonymous parent who spoke to fox 2 detroit. The teacher at the school who came up with the poncho idea says it \" was really intended as a deterrent and a lighthearted one at that. \" after rescinding the poncho idea, the principal said the school will instead encourage students \" to tailor their outfits or provide their own wraps or shawls that would meet our requirements, \" and said the school may provide wraps and shawls at prom.",

Bureaucrats in the country's treasury board and department of finance have been left with little to no internet access since the beginning of the year because of compromised computers, reports the new york times. The hackers targeted financial information, but authorities believe the attack was thwarted before sensitive information like the nation's budget could be stolen. The hackers gained access to government networks by hijacking the computers of senior bureaucrats and sending out infected files. They also cracked into the records of canada's house of commons, targeting the records of lawmakers with large chinese populations in their constituencies, ctv reports. Beijing officials deny there was any link to china's government. \" what you mentioned is purely fictitious and has an ulterior motive, \" a foreign ministry spokesman told a press briefing.",

        "summary": "Immigration officials sent 368,644 people packing in the last fiscal year, a 10 % drop from the record 409,849 deported in 2012, the government announced last week. It's the lowest figure ever recorded under president obama, who has seen deportations rise every year he's been in office, according to the arizona republic. Immigrations and customs enforcement says it's been deporting fewer people because it's focusing on the more labor-intense task of kicking out serious criminals, and because it's been catching more central american border crossers, who take longer to deport than mexicans. Ice says that 98 % of those 368,644 were either criminals, had just crossed the border, or were repeat immigration violators. But immigration hawks say criminals should actually be easier to deport, and think obama is purposely directing the agency to deport less. Immigration advocates, meanwhile, say the deportations are still tearing families apart — the new york times last weekend ran a piece on the issue, highlighting one case of a man being hauled away from his girlfriend and the children he had helped raise as part of street sweeps in new orleans. Obama administration officials told the paper that their hands are in part tied by a congressional requirement that it detain at least 30,000 people a day.",

The latest number includes 34,868 people deported by immigration and customs enforcement's operations in arizona, a nearly 12 percent drop from the year before. The decrease comes as obama has been under growing pressure from immigration advocates and some members of congress to ease up on record deportations. At the same time, the president has been trying to avoid appearing lax on enforcement in order to persuade congress to pass reforms that include a pathway to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally. Immigrant advocates say, however, that the decrease isn't enough and vow to continue fighting deportations, while enforcement proponents say obama's administration should be deporting more people, not fewer. One of the reasons immigration and customs enforcement deported fewer people in 2013 is that the agency is focusing more attention on catching and removing serious criminals, whose cases take more time, ice officials said. An increase in the percentage of central americans being apprehended at the border after crossing illegally also has reduced overall deportation numbers because they take more time to deport than mexicans, ice officials said.

        "summary": "After an elle fashion editor tweeted about switching seats at new york fashion week so that she and other editors wouldn't have to sit by tiffany trump, whoopi goldberg has come to the first daughter's defense. \" you know what, tiffany, \" goldberg said on the view wednesday, \" i ' m coming to sit with you. Because nobody is talking politics. You're looking at fashion! she doesn't want to talk about her dad, she's looking at the fashion. \" goldberg added that refusing to sit by tiffany trump — and then publicizing it — is different than boycotting ivanka trump's fashion line, since money is involved in the latter venture. The elle editors ' move, though, was simply \" mean, \" goldberg said. \" i don't want to talk about your dad, but girl, i will sit next to you, because i've been there, where people say, ' ooh, we're not going to sit next to you. ' \" tiffany trump — who was shown sitting by herself at fashion week in pictures circulated on twitter — responded to goldberg with a tweet of her own. \" thank you @whoopigoldberg i'd love to sit with you too! \" she wrote alongside a beaming emoji wednesday. The controversy may have been overblown — trump friend andrew warren posted a picture to instagram tuesday of himself sitting next to tiffany trump at the show in question, which was on monday night for designer phillip plein, and insisted the seats next to tiffany had simply been reserved for plein's family members. But both the aforementioned elle editor and the editor of fashionista.com claimed on twitter that no one wanted to sit next to trump; the elle editor who posted has since turned her twitter account to protected, but people reports that her tweet said guests were \" fleeing \" their trump-adjacent seats.",

The floor the electrician was working on doesn't have windows yet, though barriers had been erected to keep workers away from the edge. It doesn't appear the electrician was wearing a required safety harness when he fell, and the construction management company says there was no electrical work that should have taken him close to the edge. The man landed on a white hatchback that appeared to have out-of-state plates. \" [ the driver ] is not injured, \" a fire department spokesperson tells the times. \" she is scared. \" workers had put the top on the 73rd and final floor of the 1,100-foot-tall building just four days before the accident.

But investigators say she did it by robbing the small city blind. Crundwell, dixon's finance chief since the early ' 80s, has been arrested and accused of embezzling more than $ 30 million over the last six years alone — more than $ 2,000 for each of its 15,700 residents, the wall street journal notes. The city, best known as the boyhood home of ronald reagan, only has a budget of some $ 8 million a year. Crundwell spent huge sums on her two horse farms and on luxuries including a $ 2.1 million top-end mobile home, reports the chicago tribune. She was busted after she took a few months off to operate the horse business, and an employee filling in noticed some suspicious bank statements. \" i was sick to my stomach, and i kept hoping that there really wasn't anything going on, \" says dixon's mayor. The town has suffered through major budget cuts in recent years which crundwell blamed on the state.

Opening later this month, it will display 80 \" disgusting \" foods from around the world like japanese cod sperm, mexican tree-ant larvae, chinese mouse wine — and classic american fare like twinkies and root beer, the washington post reports. \" if you give root beer to a european, they're gonna spit it out and say'this tastes like toothpaste, it's disgusting, ' \" says museum founder samuel west, known for his museum of failure. \" i want people to question what they find disgusting and realize that disgust is always in the eye of the beholder. \" even rotting food like fermented shark meat from iceland can appeal to the right person, he points out. Which raises the question: why do we feel disgust? \" the original evolutionary function of disgust is to protect us from dangerous, toxic foods, but disgust becomes so much bigger than that, \" he tells vox. Indeed, some visitors may be grossed out by foie gras — which requires ducks to be force-fed until their livers are vastly swollen — for purely moral reasons. Others might reconsider their diet of environmentally unsustainable meat, says west, though he's neither vegan nor vegetarian himself. Either way, people can smell, taste, and occasionally touch the museum's food, per the local. But beware balut, the boiled philippine dish that includes a partly developed duck fetus and amniotic fluid. West tried it: \" i vomited, \" he says. The museum will run from october 31 to the end of january. ( elsewhere in sweden, a girl found an ancient sword in a lake. )",

But on wednesday, the white house announced that us troops will remain in the country, the new york times reports. Trump had said tuesday that since \" we were very successful against isis, \" it was \" time to come back home. \" but in wednesday's statement, press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said that while \" the military mission to eradicate isis in syria is coming to a rapid end, with isis being almost completely destroyed, \" the us and its partners \" remain committed to eliminating the small isis presence in syria that our forces have not already eradicated. \" a senior administration official tells reuters that in a national security council meeting tuesday, trump agreed to keep troops in syria longer, but not much longer. The washington post, also citing a senior administration official, reports that on tuesday trump instructed military leaders to get ready to pull troops from syria, though a timetable was not set; nbc news also cites a senior official who said trump only \" reluctantly \" agreed to let troops remain for now. Reuters ' unnamed official predicted troops would only stay for a year or less. In the times ' view, it seems that trump's top military advisers have convinced him that keeping the 2,000 american forces still in syria is integral to ensuring isis doesn't regain its foothold there. But the post takes a slightly different tack, reporting that it appears trump is still determined not to leave the ongoing military presence in syria that top military advisers think is necessary. Trump surprised his advisers last week with a public statement that us troops would leave syria \" like, very soon, \" and during the tuesday news conference, he said that he recently told king salman of saudi arabia that if the king wanted us troops \" to stay, maybe you're going to have to pay. \"",

In a washington post column, seth masket calls the netflix series \" the worst show about american politics.

The truth, which the west wing got correct: \" there are lots of smart people in washington and they're all working against one another. \" more examples: congressional leaders do not \" hand-pick presidential nominees \"; there is no \" secret shortlist of potential presidential candidates \" ( it's pretty easy to figure out who might be running in a given year ); the solicitor general would not be an awesome presidential candidate; etc., etc., etc. \" at the end of the day, house of cards is a show about mean people doing mean things, and it does that well, \" masket writes. \" but if you want to understand american politics, watch just about anything else. \" and he's not the only one piling on: in usa today, michael wolff says the third season \" is no good... No, no, not just no good, but incompetent, a shambles, lost. \" it's turned kevin spacey's underwood from a schemer \" deliciously and joyously without moral restraint or qualms \" into, well, west wing's \" striving liberal public servant \" jed bartlet.

Feinstein won over just 22 voters from a 360-member board, but her campaign manager says he's confident she ' ll have the support of californians. \" while 217 delegates expressed their view on saturday, senator feinstein won by 2.1 million votes and earned 70 % of the democratic vote in the california primary election, carrying every county by double digits over her opponent, \" millman said in a statement referring to feinstein's win over de león. The two democrats will duke it out come november thanks to california's primary system, which sends the two top candidates from the primary election in terms of votes to the general election, regardless of party.",

Scientists tested the chemicals against human breast cancer cells and found that all eight of them were indeed endocrine disruptor chemicals ( edcs ) and displayed levels of estrogen-like properties and/or testosterone-inhibiting properties — meaning they could play a part in stimulating mammary gland conditions in a prepubescent male body. And many of those chemicals are also in at least 65 other essential oils, the lead author says, which is particularly concerning since the fda does not regulate essential oils and no prescription is required to buy them. They're currently popular for use in everything from cleaning products to toiletries to alternative health treatments. The study authors say essential oils should be used with caution, but science alert notes that there is, so far, limited research on these effects and the latest findings have not yet been peer-reviewed.

            "A small-town elementary school in north texas has ended an unusual tradition — birthday spankings — after parent complaints. For the past eight years, ktvt-tv ( channel 11 ) reports, students have been called to principal bridget williams ' office at alvord elementary school, 50 miles northwest of fort worth, on their birthdays to receive a spank for each year. They also get candy and a special pencil. In april, after two complaints about the practice, williams sent a letter home to parents saying that they could opt their children out of the spankings by sending a handwritten note to the school. The letter noted that students at the wise county school always had the option of getting a hug or a high five instead, but that only a handful made that choice. \" when we celebrate each child and their special day all parties are in the main office in front of the camera, \" the letter read. \" there are no off camera celebrations and there are always other adults in the office celebrating with us all. \"",
