        "summary": "Arkansas is preparing to execute seven death row inmates in 11 days because it wants to carry out the sentences before its supply of an execution drug expires may 1. Judge kristine baker, who was appointed to us district court for the eastern district of arkansas by president barack obama, will consider the legality of the state's aggressive plan this week, the ap reports. Since joining the court in 2012, she has made key rulings on abortion and gay marriage, but she hasn't handled a death penalty case of this magnitude. Baker must rule whether the plan to execute seven prisoners from april 17 through april 27 would violate their rights to meaningful counsel and access to the courts. Gov. Asa hutchinson, a republican, has been targeted by anti-death penalty activists, with protesters holding nightly vigils outside his mansion in little rock, the los angeles times reports. \" this many executions just creates a huge, huge risk for a botched execution, which will lead to suffering, \" says furonda brasfield of the arkansas coalition to abolish the death penalty. \" it's truly unheard of for a state to do this. \" the state is short of witnesses for the executions, and critics such as arkansas democrat-gazette columnist paul greenberg are calling for hutchinson to attend the lethal injections. ( last week, a federal judge blocked an eighth execution. )",

            "The dates with death continue to loom over arkansas. Gov. Asa hutchinson is moving ahead with the state's plan to execute several men in an 11-day window this month, even as a federal court has granted a temporary reprieve to one of the condemned. The state's parole board this week recommended that hutchinson commute the death sentence of jason mcgehee, who had been among the eight men scheduled to die between april 17 and 27, to life in prison without parole. But before hutchinson could announce a decision, a federal judge ruled that mcgehee's execution should be put on hold for at least 30 days. In an effort to act before the state's supply of midazolam, an anesthetic used in the lethal injection cocktail, expires at the end of the month, hutchinson set the execution dates of mcgehee — along with the seven other men — during the final two weeks of april. Now, with the ruling by the federal judge, mcgehee's reprieve expands into may and past the expiration date of the drug. The parole board did not recommend that the sentences of any of the other men be commuted. \"we're pleased. It's an appropriate decision, \" john c. Williams, an assistant federal public defender representing mcgehee, said saturday. Mcgehee has been on death row since 1997. In 1996, mcgehee, 40, along with two other men, kidnapped and killed john melbourne jr., 15, in boone county, about 150 miles north of little rock. Prosecutors said he was the leader, and mcgehee was the only one of the group sentenced to death. This month, josh hendrix, melbourne's younger brother, urged the parole board not to spare mcgehee's life. \"when you have a dog that attacks a child, you put the dog down, \" hendrix said. \"i feel this man is an animal and he should be treated the way he did my brother. \" even with mcgehee's life spared for the moment, no state has executed seven people in such a short span since the supreme court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. The closest was texas, which executed eight men in may and june 1997, according to the nonprofit death penalty information center, which opposes capital punishment. Opponents of the death penalty have assailed the executions as cruel and unusual punishment and have said that the likelihood of a botched executions — in which inmates take a long time to die — increases with so many in such a short time span.

Now the government wants to remedy that, with us attorney general loretta lynch announcing thursday the doj will start compiling self-reported data in 2017 from nearly 180,000 officers in us police departments and law enforcement agencies at the state and federal level, the guardian reports. An online portal will be set up, and each department will be asked to enter each instance of police force used, whether or not it's lethal ( a major difference from previous info-culling ). This, then, includes whenever using force causes serious bodily harm or when a gun is even fired \" at or in the direction of \" a person. The program grew out of an obama commission set up in 2014 to figure out how to salve tense police-community relations, per the new york times. Before the initiative tackles local police departments nationwide, it's going to analyze stats from larger law enforcement agencies such as the fbi, the dea, the us marshals service, and the atf, usa today reports. The times notes some possible issues with the pilot program, including the fingers-crossed hope that law enforcement groups and police departments will actually log all incidents ( the nonlethal reporting part of the program is voluntary ), while civil rights activists want to know what financial repercussions will result if some don't report deaths while in custody, as per a 2014 law passed by congress. \" the initiatives we are announcing today are vital efforts toward increasing transparency and building trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve, \" lynch said in a statement.

        "summary": "Us employers added 148,000 jobs in december, a modest gain but enough to suggest the economy entered the new year with solid momentum, per the ap. The labor department says the unemployment rate remained at 4.1 % for a third straight month, the lowest since 2000. Employers added nearly 2.1 million jobs last year, enough to lower the unemployment rate from 4.7 % a year ago. Still, average job gains have slowed to 171,000 this year from a peak of 250,000 in 2014. That typically happens when the unemployment rate falls to ultra-low levels and fewer people are available to be hired. While modest, the job gains underscore the economy's continued health in its ninth year of recovery. The unemployment rate for african-americans dropped to a record low of 6.8 %. The wall street journal sees the december report as \" uninspiring, \" given that the figure of 148,000 came in below estimates. But in the bigger picture, the newspaper notes that 2.1 million jobs were added in 2017, the seventh straight year of job gains of 2 million or more. This is only the second time that long of a stretch has been recorded, the previous time coming in the 1990s.",

Last month, a longtime adviser told the site that hatch may not offer an answer until october has closed out, but now sources say that answer may not come until december. Although that kind of waffling might frustrate most potential candidates, utah policy notes that romney has the resources to jump right into the fray no matter when hatch makes up his mind. Hatch had said earlier this year he'd step down if he knew an \" outstanding person \" were in the mix to take his place, and a new poll hints that utahans might consider romney to be just that person: the survey commissioned by utah policy and dan jones &amp; associates shows that if romney were to run today against democrat jenny wilson, believed to be the major contender for her party, he would harness 64 % of the vote to wilson's 26 %, with 10 % undecided. His next-closest competition, gop rep. Chris stewart, who's also expressed interest in running, would nab 34 % to wilson's 30 %, with 36 % undecided.

According to china daily, a 61-year-old woman named zhang gave birth via c-section june 27. She's believed to be china's second oldest mother ever, behind only a 62-year-old woman who gave birth last may. Less than a week before zhang had her baby boy, a 54-year-old woman named liu hongmei gave birth to her own baby boy. Both zhang and liu lost their only children — to illness and a traffic accident, respectively — two years ago. Chinese people rely heavily on their children for support, both monetarily and personally, when they get older. But the one-child policy has left an estimated 1 million families childless after their only offspring passed away. For those childless families, including approximately 335,000 women over 49, the future isn't promising. That's why many older couples want the government to fund in vitro fertilization treatments. But officials and doctors aren't eager to do that. One hospital director says older women attempting to have another child face increased risks of miscarriage and birth defects. He also worries about parents trying to raise children while in their 70s. Zhang's was anything but an easy pregnancy and birth — with anesthesia, blood pressure, and bleeding issues following — but both she and her new child appear to be doing well.

Reuters/beawiharta ( indonesia - tags: politics society business telecoms science technology ) washington — barack obama's reelection campaign pioneered a pathway for political campaigns to reach voters through facebook when it released an app that helped supporters target their friends with obama-related material. But as the 2016 presidential campaign approaches, facebook is rolling out a change that will prevent future campaigns from doing this, closing the door on one of the most sophisticated social targeting efforts ever undertaken. \"it's a fairly significant shift, \" said teddy goff, who was obama's digital director in 2012, and oversaw the effort that helped the obama campaign gain a facebook following of 45 million users that year",

        "summary": "A new edward snowden interview hit today, and it's making big waves — especially overseas, thanks to allegations that the nsa is working hand-in-glove with allies around the globe. The interview was conducted anonymously back before snowden revealed his identity, with snowden emailing security expert and sort-of wikileaks ally jacob appelbaum. It was published today in der spiegel. Here are the highlights: on the broadest spying yet: the uk has a system called tempora, which is the first \" full take \" internet buffer that collects and stores all internet traffic that passes through the uk on a three-day basis, he says. \" that's not metadata. ' full take ' means it doesn't miss anything. … even the queen's selfies to the pool boy get logged. \" the program was previously reported by the guardian. On other foreign partners: \" we're in bed together with the germans the same as with most other western countries. For example, we tip them off when someone we want is flying through their airports … and they hand them over to us. They don't ask to justify how we know something, and vice versa. \" on stuxnet: snowden confirms what iran has long alleged and many others had long suspected: that the nsa and israel co-created the super-virus. On metadata: \" the nsa wants to be at the point where at least all of the metadata is permanently stored. In most cases, content isn't as valuable as metadata because you can... Re-fetch content based on the metadata. \" on the nsa's targets: \" they're just owned. … the target's machine doesn't belong to them anymore, it belongs to the us government. \" on the cause for overreach: \" when it is made to appear as though not knowing everything about everyone is an existential crisis, then you feel that bending the rules is okay. \" germany today rushed to spin snowden's reference to it, with angela merkel's government saying that any cooperation with the us was subject to stringent \" legal framework, \" reuters reports. \" in the fight against terrorist threats, we can only protect the population if we cooperate with others, \" a merkel spokesman said, even as opposition leaders hammered merkel over the alleged cooperation.

When asked for more details on his stop-and-frisk proposal, trump explained: \" if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think may have a gun, they will see the person and they ' ll look and they ' ll take the gun away. \" the practice was declared unconstitutional by a federal court in new york and studies have shown it to be biased.

One photo of kim shows an imperfection at the base of his ear, which doctors suggest could be anything from a cyst to a viral infection. North korea has a history of covering up illnesses, but erasing the mark, if it is benign, also serves a purpose. This cosmetic alteration and others like it are likely designed \" to help kim look a bit more handsome than he is in real life, \" lewis says. His ears aren't kim's greatest cause for distress, apparently.

I guess things will settle down a bit and everybody can rest at ease. \" rodman, 56, added: \"i think a lot of people around the world … want me to go just to see if i can do something. \" how nba star dennis rodman came to stand between the world and nuclear war read more the 6ft 7in former sportsman, who calls the north korean dictator \"the marshal \", said it was far-fetched to imagine kim and trump one day sitting down for a beer, but \"a 30-second conversation \" was feasible.

Things went amiss in october 2014, however, when the team decided to test a reset timer on stereo-b designed to keep the craft working when it eventually moved to the opposite side of the sun and lost contact for more than three months. But the test went awry, and stereo-b fell off the radar. The stereo team didn't give up, tapping into the dsn's powerful radio antennas for nine hours a week to reestablish contact.

The freelance photographer was speeding down a new york sidewalk when he ran into kidman as she walked into the carlyle hotel, tmz reports. The gossip site has the incident on video, and kidman can be heard saying she wants the guy's name so she can press charges. She called the cops, who didn't arrest him ( \" an accident's an accident, \" one says ), but did cite him for riding on the sidewalk. Kidman was knocked to the ground but not injured. Tmz describes wu as \" notorious \" and says he's had \" run-ins \" with other stars, and vanity fair points out that in 2010, the boston globe reported he allegedly \" scuffled \" with lady gaga's bodyguard in a parking garage. As for kidman, she showed up at a fashion week event last night, and assured etonline she's \" ok \" but, us reports, a \" bit shaken. \" at the same event, she told e!, \" it was awful, but i got back up, \" and added that the paparazzi can be \" terrifying. And luckily i got up but there will be a time when someone does not. \"",

Germany has announced that the tens of thousands of gay men convicted under paragraph 175 will see that conviction annulled and may receive compensation. The guardian has a timeline of the law, which established homosexuality as a crime: born in 1872, the law was embraced by nazis some 50 years later; the new york times reports 100,000 men were charged under the nazis, with half ending up in prison and as many as 15,000 sent to concentration camps, where a pink triangle was affixed to their uniform. When the war ended, the law did not. More than 50,000 men were convicted under it between 1946 and 1969 when homosexuality was decriminalized, and a few thousand more even after that in west germany. The nazi-era convictions were lifted at the turn of the 21st century, but there was no post-war relief until wednesday's announcement by justice minister heiko maas, which \" amounted to an apology, \" reports the times. He said in part, \" paragraph 175 was from the very beginning unconstitutional. The old convictions are unjust [ and ] do huge injury to the human dignity of each convicted man. \" wednesday brought one more big step forward for gays: italy's parliament voted 372 to 51 to recognize same-sex civil unions, reports the times, which frames italy as having been \" perhaps the most prominent exception \" among the western nations that had already done so.",

        "summary": "The hunger strike underway by graduate students at yale hit the two-week mark earlier this week, wfsb reports. Graduate students ( who also act as instructors ) from eight academic departments that voted to unionize have been protesting in front of yale president peter salovey's office because he won't negotiate with them, and four of those students have been refusing to eat as part of the protest — though nurses made four other hunger strikers quit due to health concerns. ( they were replaced by four others. ) as wfsb notes, the strike on the new haven, conn., campus has gained widespread attention, but neither side appears on the verge of giving in. The new york times explains the background of the protest — the national labor relations board ruled last august that graduate teachers at private universities are employees and can therefore unionize — and notes that salovey is likely stalling until president trump appoints new members to the board, since those members will likely be anti-union and may overturn the ruling. Per jennifer klein at the times, the protest is necessary as universities rely more and more on graduate students \" and other low-paid contingent faculty members \" to teach their students, yet fail to provide those teachers with adequate pay, health care, or other benefits. But at the chronicle of higher education, amy hungerford paints the protesters as \" relatively privileged citizens \" whose strike is misguided.",

A new republic cover story on aging parents has benedikt reflecting on her own situation: she and her husband are 35 and almost 40, with a third child on the way. But with $ 5,000 a month gone to daycare, they can't afford a place with more than one bathroom — even though they are, \" by the standards of most americans, rich. \" if only, she says, \" we had started popping out those kids, oh, say, five years earlier, maybe, by 40, my bedroom and my sons ' bedroom wouldn't be separated by a fake wall. \" and that's just the beginning. The new republic piece, by judith shulevitz, points out the higher risk of genetic mutations in children of older men, not to mention this scary fact: \" a mother who is 35 when her child is born is more likely than not to have died by the time that child is 46. \" delayed parenthood is essentially \" a vast empirical study upon an unthinkably large population \" of multiple generations, shulevitz writes. \" also, \" writes benedikt, \" remember how there was that one kid in your high school class whose parents were sooooo old that it was weird and creepy? that's all of us now. \" click through for her full column.",

Marie collins says the \" last straw \" for her was when the vatican administration ignored a request from the pontifical commission for the protection of minors that it respond to all correspondence from people who've been sexually abused by priests. According to the guardian, collins — who was sexually abused by a priest when she was 13 — says it's hard to believe the vatican truly cares about victims when it can't even bother to reply to their letters. Collins says she does believe pope francis wants to help victims, nbc news reports, but she's upset he's been reducing punishments and granting clemency to abusive priests. She says the pope is too quick to show mercy when it comes to priests sexually abusing children. Last summer, pope francis canceled a tribunal that was supposed to prosecute bishops who protected abusive priests. Collins also accuses the vatican of a \" lack of cooperation \" with the commission that has led to \" constant setbacks. \" \" it is devastating in 2017 to see that these men still can put other concerns before the safety of children and vulnerable adults, \" reuters quotes her as saying.

Many of you remember the \"dumpster dive, \" that was a promo for the station – me standing in a guy's dumpster confronting him about destroying documents that he was ordered to turn over by the colorado attorney general's office. The consumer fraud charges and criminal case against him were the result of a 4 part investigation – i worked very hard to expose this guy – and in the end, i paid a very high price.

In the lawsuit, james long argues that united should have known that calling security to remove david dao, 69, from the overbooked flight would \" require the use of physical force, \" the bbc reports. The complaint also states that although long completed five months of training as a police recruit, the chicago department of aviation failed to provide training on the \" level of force continuum. \" with that training, long \" would not have acted in the manner he did, which resulted in his termination, \" states the lawsuit, which seeks damages and back pay. Dao, who was removed to make space for a united employee on the flight to louisville, ky., suffered a concussion and a broken nose. The doctor, who also lost two front teeth, settled with the airline for an undisclosed sum. Long and three other aviation security officers were fired after the incident. In a separate lawsuit, some 300 aviation security officers are suing chicago and the state of illinois, complaining that they were stripped of their law enforcement officer status after the dao incident, the chicago tribune reports. The officers — who completed police or sheriff's department training and were sworn in as law enforcement officers — argue that while the state has the right to strip the agency of its policing powers, their work history as law enforcement officers shouldn't be expunged.",

Fortunately, ozy has the secrets to making them exactly the way you like, and the site is sharing its findings with the world. It all starts with the nestle toll house cookie recipe; then the tinkering begins. Want gooey cookies? add two extra cups of flour. Chewy? use bread flour rather than all-purpose flour. If you like thicker cookies, you should freeze the batter for between 30 minutes and an hour, thus solidifying the butter. Keeping it chilled for a whole day will offer you richer flavor. And for a crispy-outside, soft-inside experience, try a quarter teaspoon baking powder and an equal amount of baking soda. Click for more tips.

This week's revelation: west fertilizer co. Was a repeat target of thieves stealing anhydrous ammonia and tampering with tank valves, which led to ammonia leaks, reuters reports. Anhydrous ammonia is commonly used to cook methamphetamine. At least 11 burglaries and five ammonia leaks were reported to police over the past 12 years. In 2002, a plant manager told cops that burglars were making off with four to five gallons of anhydrous ammonia every three days. There is no indication that the blast that killed 14 was somehow tied to these thefts — experts say ammonium nitrate is the likely culprit, reports the dallas morning news, and the four tanks that held anhydrous ammonia were still standing after the blast. But it's yet another sign that safety and security were a problem at the plant, which had no security fence, alarm system, or guards. \" regardless of what triggered this specific event, the fact that there were lots of burglaries and that they were after ammonia clearly shows this plant was vulnerable to unwanted intruders or even a terrorist attack, \" says a chemical safety expert.",

But not everyone agrees daum should be slammed — including some observers in china, per the new york times. \" to chinese, it's not sacred and it's not that meaningful, \" one beijing blogger says. Others note the qipao's history ( cnn has more on that ) shows the dress may have been appropriated itself in china: a majority chinese ethnic group appears to have adopted it from a minority one, and it was originally a baggy outfit worn by men; today, the skintight version is mostly worn by waitstaff and flight attendants or to fancy events like weddings. Lam tells buzzfeed he's now being harassed after online sleuths found past tweets in which he used racially tinged language, which he's apologized for. As for daum, she's not backing down. \" i ' m not deleting my post because i've done nothing but show my love for the culture, \" she said in a tweet. \" it's a f --- ing dress.

Speaking on day three of the preliminary hearing regarding private manning, a senior officer in his \" sensitive compartmented information facility \" ( scif ) said it was common for analysts to bring in dvds bought from iraqis. They also stored music and played games on computers used for handling classified information. The disclosure, by captain casey fulton, is the latest to indicate loose controls within the unit where manning, 24, served as an intelligence analyst. It has previously emerged that passwords to secure computers were left on post-it notes stuck on terminals and that there was no system for checking that classified information was not removed from the building. Fulton said she did not know it was wrong for soldiers to store music"

The toughest loss was a bipartisan bill written by eight republicans, seven democrats, and an independent, which fell just six votes short of passing, according to nbc news. The bill — similar to a recent proposal out of the white house — offered dreamers a path to citizenship and provided $ 25 billion for border security and president trump's wall. However, it didn't make the cuts to legal immigration that the white house has pushed for. Ahead of the vote, trump called the bill \" a total catastrophe \" and jeff sessions warned it would \" invite a mad rush of illegality across our borders, \" cnn reports. On the opposite end of the spectrum, a bill written by republican sen.

According to the baltimore sun, the vote on tuesday overrode a veto from maryland's governor. At issue was whether maryland's felons should be able to vote immediately upon release from prison or whether they should have to finish all terms of their sentence first. With the vote, maryland becomes the 14th state to restore voting rights to felons once they're released from prison, mother jones reports. \"these are people living in the community, \" a criminal justice advocate tells frontline. \"they participate in other areas of the social contract. They want to participate in democracy and should have a role in deciding who represents them. \" nearly 6 million us citizens can't vote because they're felons. The fight to restore their voting rights has been mostly split along party lines, with republicans favoring tougher restrictions. Felons are more likely to be black and vote democrat. Supporters of restoring voting rights argue it helps felons reintegrate into society. Most states require felons to finish all terms of their sentence before their voting rights are restored. A dozen states can prevent felons from every voting again, and the trend in recent years has been toward further restrictions on voting rights. But that could be changing, staring with the maryland vote. Three other states are currently considering expanding the voting rights of felons.",

            "Maryland has become the latest state to expand the right to vote to felons who have been released from prison, in the most significant expansion of voting access for ex-offenders in recent years. The state legislature on tuesday voted to overturn gov. Larry hogan's veto of a bill granting expanded access to the ballot. Hogan, a republican, told lawmakers that maryland law at the time of the veto — which restored voting rights once offenders completed all aspects of their sentence, including parole and probation — was more appropriate. Critics, including some ex-offenders, argued that approach amounted to taxation without representation. The new law restores voting rights immediately upon a prisoner's release. \"these are people living in the community, \" said nicole d. Porter, advocacy director at the sentencing project, a nonprofit group that works toward criminal justice reform. \"they participate in other areas of the"

        "summary": "A nigerian air force fighter jet on a mission against boko haram extremists mistakenly bombed a refugee camp on tuesday, killing more than 100 refugees and aid workers, a borno state official said. The state government official, who was helping to coordinate the evacuation of wounded from the remote area by helicopters, spoke to the ap on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. Military commander maj. Gen. Lucky irabor confirmed the accidental bombardment in northeast rann, near the border with cameroon, saying \" some \" civilians were killed. It was believed to be the first time nigeria's military has admitted to making such a mistake. The bbc says at least 50 were killed and more than 100 injured, citing international aid agency msf. The international committee for the red cross said six staff members and volunteers with the nigerian red cross were among the dead and 13 were wounded. Two soldiers were also wounded as well as nigerians working for doctors without borders, irabor said, without giving a precise figure. Doctors without borders said its team based in rann had counted 50 bodies and treated 120 wounded. A statement from spokesperson etienne l ' hermitte in geneva urged authorities to facilitate cross-border land and air evacuations. Irabor said he ordered the mission based on information that boko haram insurgents were gathering in the area, along with geographic coordinates. It was too early to say if a tactical error was made, he said.",

Or word for \" love. \" that's what david good experienced when he found his mother, yarima, in the yanomami tribe in venezuela, the new york post reports. He had long claimed she died in a car crash, because the truth embarrassed him — that his father, kenneth, an anthropology student, had married yarima in 1978 after a series of expeditions to the tribe; she was likely no more than 12 — the tribe also has no numbers. Kenneth's travels back and forth to the us left her vulnerable ( she was brutally gang-raped by 20 to 30 men during one of his absences ), so he got her medical care and moved her to new jersey in 1986 to give birth to david and live a typical american life. Their unusual marriage drew media attention and sparked a bidding war between major hollywood players, but a movie was never made and the romance wouldn't last: yarima said that in new jersey, she missed close human relations, the bbc reports. So she moved back home, leaving david feeling abandoned and ashamed. ( especially horrifying was seeing her photo on a class field trip at the museum of natural history, in a tribal exhibit: \" i just froze, \" he says. \"... I ran to a dark corner and hid for 10 minutes. \" ) he turned to alcohol as a teenager and kept his feelings hidden. But as an adult, he visited yarima's tribe in 2011 — she wept when they met again — and visited again last year, eating grubs and living as the yanomami do. And he wants to keep going. \" it's not like there's closure, \" he says. \" we're at the beginning of our story, in so many ways. \" ( the huffington post has the story of an 85-year-old who just met her half-sister for the first time — after learning about her in an unusual way. )",

        "summary": "The latest release of fbi documents on the investigation of hillary clinton's emails has revealed what donald trump calls \" felony corruption. \" according to the documents, fbi employees told investigators that state department official patrick kennedy had pressured them to change their finding that one of the emails on her private server was classified, reuters reports. Fbi officials said that in a bid to protect clinton, kennedy discussed a \" quid pro quo \" deal in which the state department would allow an increased fbi presence in iraq in return for ruling that the information in the benghazi-related email was unclassified. A roundup of coverage: the fbi and the state department are pushing back against the allegations, saying there was no \" quid pro quo \" and the email remained classified, the washington post reports, though the agencies admit that the email and fbi slots in iraq came up in the same conversation. Politico reports that at a rally in green bay, wis., on monday night, trump called the alleged deal \" felony corruption by any standard \" and called for the resignation of kennedy, who is undersecretary of state for management. Gop rep. Jason chaffetz of utah, chairman of the house oversight committee, tells fox news that there is a \" flashing red light of potential criminality \" in the latest document release, and he believes there will be grounds for at least four hearings on the matter this fall. The new york times reports that despite the email issue and embarrassing wikileaks releases, the clinton campaign is feeling confident enough to make a big push into states such as arizona, missouri, and indiana, as well as diverting money to down-ballot races in a bid to help the democrats recapture the house. According to the latest cbs poll, clinton now has a 9-point lead among likely voters nationwide, with 47 % to 38 % for trump, 8 % for gary johnson, and 3 % for jill stein. A politico poll found that 41 % of voters, including 73 % of republicans, believe the election could be \" stolen \" from trump through fraud.",

Rescue teams from the us are investigating, but the democrat and chronicle reports that larry and jane glazer, both 68, have died. They took off from upstate new york for naples, fla., this morning and soon contacted air traffic control with \" an indication that is not correct in plane, \" according to a recording of their conversation, cnn reports. They asked only to descend to 18,000 feet before radio contact broke off. American fighter jets then followed the unresponsive plane, saying the windows were iced over and the plane's pilot could be seen hunched over, says a norad official. The fighters pulled away when the single-engine turboprop entered cuban airspace and flew aimlessly, crashing in the ocean about 14 miles north of jamaica. \" we are devastated by the tragic and sudden loss of our parents, \" their children say in a statement. \" we understand that there are many questions yet to be answered about today's events, and we too are awaiting answers. \" many such cases result from poor cabin pressurization, killing those on board due to lack of oxygen before the plane goes down, says an aviation expert. Indeed, a tweet from norad says the pilot or pilots may have been incapacitated due to \" hypoxia, \" or lack of oxygen, the bbc reports.",

In july 2011, we committed to holding a minimum of three vigils each week to bear witness of pigs and other farmed animals transported to toronto area slaughterhouses. Qmp has since gone bankrupt in 2014 so we now hold weekly pig save vigils at fearman's \"pork \" inc. Slaughterhouse in burlington. We hold regular toronto cow save vigils, usually on thursday mornings 9-11 am at 1 glen scarlett road, and toronto chicken save vigils, usually thursday evenings 8-10 pm, at 100 ethel avenue.

            "Anita krajnc gives pigs water near a slaughterhouse in burlington. Krajnc now faces a criminal mischief charge from the activity. ( elli garlin ) an animal-rights activist charged with mischief after she gave some water to pigs that were being trucked to a southern ontario slaughterhouse will appear in milton court today to set trial dates. Charges against anita krajnc relate to an incident that occurred on a hot day in june. She says when the truck stopped at a red light in burlington, she used water bottles to give the pigs a drink through slats in the trailer. She calls the charges she's facing outrageous, insisting she did nothing wrong by helping thirsty pigs — but the truck driver said her actions presented a safety hazard. Krajnc said her group stands on a traffic island at appleby line and harvester road once a week to \" bear witness \" to the animals going to slaughter at fearman's pork inc. On june 22, she said, temperatures were high, and her group poured water through the holes. In court documents, halton police refer to it as an \" unknown liquid. \" krajnc said the driver got out and told them to stop, and she quoted a bible verse at him about giving water to the thirsty. \" he said,'they're not humans, you dumb frigging broad",
            "Weekly vigils toronto pig save started in december 2010 as a grassroots, animal rights, vegan group, after an adopted dog, mr. Bean, put us in touch with our community. As i walked with mr. Bean each morning on lake shore we'd see 8 or 9 transport trucks carrying sad and frightened pigs to a nearby downtown slaughterhouse called quality meat packers ( qmp ). In july 2011, we committed to holding a minimum of three vigils each week to bear witness of pigs and other farmed animals transported to toronto area slaughterhouses. Qmp has since gone bankrupt in 2014 so we now hold weekly pig save vigils at fearman's \"pork \" inc. Slaughterhouse in burlington. We hold regular toronto cow save vigils, usually on thursday mornings 9-11 am at 1 glen scarlett road, and toronto chicken save vigils, usually thursday evenings 8-10 pm, at 100 ethel avenue.

A prefecture rep says the private owner, inubosaki marine park, is working to find them a new home. Animal rights centre japan hopes honey, who's been at the aquarium since 2005, can be moved to a sanctuary, fearing recapture if she's returned to her original home off taiji, the pacific coast town known for its annual dolphin slaughter. But local media previously reported that transfer negotiations had abruptly ended, per the guardian. \" they have a responsibility to explain what they intend to do with honey and the other animals, \" one activist says. Others are elevating the case on social media using #savehoney.",

        "summary": "The earth has just given up a very alien secret: scientists are reporting in nature communications that a rock found in a limestone quarry in sweden is the first of its kind to have been discovered on our planet, a \" biscuit-sized \" remnant of a space rock they believe collided with another much larger one, reports afp. We have long uncovered evidence of that larger rock in the form of meteorites known as chondrites. Space.com explains that about 470 million years ago, l-type chondrites began to reach our surface 100 times more frequently than they previously had, indicating that their parent asteroid collided with another around that time. The cosmic-ray exposure age — also 470 million years — of what's been dubbed österplana 65 provides \" very strong empirical evidence \" that the new meteorite was part of that second body, says lead author birger schmitz. Schmitz says öst 65 may be the first ever \" extinct \" meteorite found on earth in that it no longer falls because its parent body has been obliterated by collisions. His 25-year search for meteorites from the ordovician period was getting \" boring, \" he tells the bbc, as his team \" found 50, then 60, then 70 \" l-type chondrites. But in 2011 they uncovered öst 65, which they referred to as \"'the mysterious object ' because it didn't resemble anything. \" after five years of analysis \" we're certain of what it is. \" interesting side note: the 3-inch rock was found in a quarry that produces floor tiles and \" threw out \" the ones that \" had ugly black dots in them \" that is, until the researchers asked it to stop. \" the very first fossil meteorite we found was in one of their dumps, \" says schmitz.

        "summary": "Jordan spieth got more than redemption and a green jacket today. He took his place among the best in the game with a masters victory for the ages. One year after he lost a bid to become the youngest player to win the masters, the 21-year-old texan turned in one of the most dominant wins ever at augusta national. He never let anyone get closer to him than three shots after his record start. Spieth closed with a 2-under 70, missing a 5-foot par putt on the final hole that would have set yet another record. Instead, he tied tiger woods at 18-under 270. For all the talk about the grand slam bid by rory mcilroy and the return of woods, this week was about the arrival of another star. \" it's awfully impressive, \" mcilroy said after finishing fourth. \" it's great to see, great for the game, and i ' m sure there will be many more. \" spieth became the first wire-to-wire winner at the masters since raymond floyd in 1976. He also won for the third time on the pga tour and fifth time worldwide. He will rise to no. 2 in the world, still a ways to go to catch mcilroy at the top. In a weird twist today, tiger woods screamed in pain when hitting a hidden tree root on a shot and later made a gruesome diagnosis: \" a bone kinda popped out, joint went out of place, but i put it back in, \" he told cbs sports ( his description led to plenty of derisive responses on twitter, the ap notes ). Despite the apparent injury, woods said he was proud of his play and finished with a 5-under 283.",

Ended up reading the whole thing like i was watching a movie on twitter. \" a post at new york says the opening line — \" y ' all wanna hear a story about why me &amp; this b ---- here fell out???????? \" — might be \" one of the best first lines in recent literary history. \" but which parts of the crazy narrative about a weekend trip involving a manic depressive boyfriend, an overbearing pimp, prostitution, kidnapping, suicide, and shooting are fact instead of fiction? the washington post has interviewed police investigators and several main subjects ( not counting zola herself, who is presumably bombarded with interview requests from the press, but who wouldn't comment to the post ) to give a detailed account. If you've read the full story — it's here, but note that the language and content is rough — rest assured no one was shot in the face or jumped off a fourth-floor balcony. But the real story is as grim as zola's telling was gripping, involving actual human trafficking, forced prostitution, rape and other forms of physical and psychological assault on what began as a last-minute road trip to tampa to make more money stripping. \" while [ zola's ] story may have seemed ' crazy, ' however, and while [ zola ] herself is hilarious, there's nothing unusual ( or funny ) about its sheer level of violence, \" writes caitlin dewey at the post. \" people think this story is fake, but they need to have an open mind, \" one victim says. \" all that stuff you see on tv, on svu — that's real.

The first official release of obamacare numbers shows that 2.2 million people enrolled in the first three months. Among them, 55 % are ages 45 to 64, 24 % are 18 to 34, and about a third are 55 to 64. Naturally, the obama administration is putting a positive spin on it and republicans are pouncing. Among the reactions: \" we're pleased to see such a strong response and heavy demand, \" said health secretary kathleen sebelius. \" among young adults, the momentum was particularly strong. \" \" there's no way to spin it: youth enrollment has been a bust so far, \" said a spokesman for john boehner. \" when they see that obamacare offers high costs for limited access to doctors... It's no surprise that young people aren't rushing to sign up. \" the numbers don't really mean much, according to a quick denver post analysis. For one thing, it's unclear how many enrollees were uninsured to begin with. And the post notes that with romneycare, \" many people — especially many young people — waited until the last minute to sign up. \" on the plus side, the number of people enrolling jumped 500 % over a single month, and federally run exchanges are now outpacing state exchanges, notes bloomberg.
