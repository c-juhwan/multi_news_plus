Just three weeks ago, in the dead of night on june 3, the mississippi senator's staff sat shaken and dejected, crestfallen at the results of a primary that deprived the six-term incumbent of an electoral majority. With cochran forced into a runoff fight against an aggressive and energetic challenger, a dark mood shadowed his backers in washington and mississippi. Text size - + reset decision day in mississippi play slideshow yet almost immediately, the cochran coalition began bouncing back. Even on that gloomy night of june 3, cochran adviser stuart stevens was insisting to staffers: \"we're going to win. \" one cochran aide paraphrased stevens ' primary-night message: \"we're going to figure this out and it's going to be something you remember for the rest of your",

But, with enough pork and enough targeted ads, it nonetheless looks like his strategy to court black voters to participate in the gop primary saved him from obscurity ( and the tea party ). In the run-up to tuesday night's republican senate primary run-off in mississippi, both \" mainstream \" republicans and a good number of black democrats suddenly began telling us here in jackson that we all needed to bail out cochran, the six-term senator who managed a win over tea party challenger chris mcdaniel.

Turns out that when it comes to post-college earning power, not all degrees are created equal. To find the most useless degrees college students can get with their four years and hundreds of thousands of dollars, we wanted to know which majors offer not only the fewest job opportunities, but those that tend to pay the least. The daily beast considered the following data points, weighted equally, with each degree's numbers compared to the average for each category, to achieve a categorical comparison that accounts for differentiation from the mean. Data are from the u.s. Bureau of labor statistics and payscale: • starting and mid-career salary levels, using the profession most associated with the degree. • the expected change in the total number of jobs from 2008-2018. • the expected percentage change in available jobs from 2008-2018. For informational purposes, in this accompanying gallery, we provide the number of degrees awarded for 2008-2009, the most recent academic year available from the national center for education statistics.

        "summary": "Last summer, four prison inmates organized a hunger strike from their solitary-confinement cells and inspired 30,000 prisoners to join them — a stunning development that says a lot about us prisons, writes benjamin wallace-wells in new york. The four guys — allegedly leaders of white, black, and latino gangs — were eventually force-fed at pelican bay state prison in california but kept on striking. After about two months, down to 65 fellow strikers, they called it quits when state lawmakers offered to hold hearings about conditions in the prison's solitary cells. \" that is a victory, \" said one of the leaders. Indeed, the hearings suggest that reform is in the air, and four other states have stopped allowing prison isolation. But how did an incarceration method that some liken to torture become so widespread? wallace-wells looks back to the 1980s and ' 90s, when crime escalated and california prison gangs rose to prominence along racial lines: black guerrilla family for blacks, aryan brotherhood for whites, and nuestra familia and the mexican mafia for latinos. Authorities reacted by approving the secure housing unit at pelican bay, where 1,100 prisoners are held in nearly as many cells to isolate gang members from one another. But while street crime plummeted, the prisoners still found ways to communicate — like shouting through toilet drains and leaving messages in library books — and reports emerged of prisoners experiencing psychosis in solitary. Ergo the hunger strike, which \" did not necessarily prove that their conditions amounted to torture, \" writes wallace-wells. \" but it did suggest something else: that perhaps human isolation of the kind that pelican bay was built to achieve was impossible. \" click for his full article, or read the nation's report on hunger-striking inmates at a colorado prison.",

        "summary": "Around 2.5 million people aged 65 and older are treated in the er for falls each year, but researchers who took part in a massachusetts general hospital study warn not to automatically assume that \" older \" means they took a tumble because they're feeble, clumsy, or suffering from poor eyesight or dementia. Instead, per the telegraph, there may be a more surprising cause, scientists announced at the infectious diseases society of america's annual meeting: an infection. Urinary tract, bloodstream, and respiratory infections are the most common culprits when infections are involved — all of which can often lead to dizziness, low blood pressure, and other symptoms that may precipitate a fall, a press release notes. The release adds that while it's currently unclear how many falls are actually caused by infection — estimates based on previous research range from 20 % to 45 % — researchers wanted to find out what kinds of infections afflicted those who had fallen because of them. How the study was conducted, per forbes: reviewing the hospital's medical records from 2000 to 2014, researchers whittled its group of subjects down to 161 patients who had suffered a fall and been determined to have a coexisting systemic infection ( cdi ). Of the 161, 44 % had a uti, almost 40 % had a bloodstream infection, and 23 % had a respiratory infection, the release notes; meanwhile, almost 6 % had a heart valve infection. What made the results of the study somewhat surprising: a majority of the subjects ( 56 % ) had few or no common symptoms of an infection, leading to 41 % of them being misdiagnosed initially. And while many warnings are coming out of the study advising caretakers not to make assumptions about their elderly loved ones ' falls, the younger set doesn't get off scot-free: about 20 % of the subjects who fell because of an infection were under the age of 65, the telegraph notes.

Of those, 71 ( 44.1 percent ) had a urinary tract infection, 64 ( 39.8 percent ) had a bloodstream infection, 37 ( 23.0 percent ) had a respiratory infection and 9 ( 5.6 percent ) had an infection of the heart valve. A coexisting infection was not initially suspected in 41 percent of the patients, likely because the majority ( 56 percent ) had only one or none of the common signs of infection such as fever, rapid respiration rate, rapid heart rate, or abnormal white blood cell count. Specifically, only one in five",

University of pennsylvania graduate reginald stewart says he attended a rush party for phi kappa psi when he was a sophomore and was raped afterward by another recruit, reports the philadelphia inquirer.

Stewart, who recalls being too drunk to fight off the attack, says he later needed reconstructive surgery on his rectum, and he claims that gibson gave him the sexually transmitted disease hpv.

The gospel of john, for example, describes the trial as occurring on uneven stone pavement close to a gate, details that jibe with earlier discoveries near the tower.

Whether pontius had his praetorium in a military barracks or herod's palace seems open to dispute.

Netanyahu added that israel is looking for \" a way to meet the operation's objectives without a ground offensive, \" but otherwise is \" ready for a ground operation. \" in other updates: hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said all efforts at a ceasefire have failed, the jerusalem post reports. But another hamas rep told al jazeera that talks were 90 % of the way along. Egypt was trying to broker the ceasefire while hosting an israeli delegation in cairo for the talks, reuters reports. Only 75 rockets landed in israel from gaza today, down from an average of 230 rockets per day, haaretz reports. One rocket barrage hit a house in israel but caused no injuries, reports ynet news, and tel aviv's \" iron dome \" missile defense system repelled two more rockets, reports the jerusalem post. At least 26 people died in gaza from israeli bombardments today, bringing the total to 72 since israel launched operation pillar of defence on wednesday, the bbc reports. With air strikes ongoing, israel also renewed shelling from its warships tonight. Hackers have struck israeli websites more than 44 million times since the latest fighting erupted, nbc news reports. But only one attempt was successful, and that for just 10 minutes, said an israeli official. The us and britain defended israel's right to defend itself, but warned that a ground war would be dangerous for israeli soldiers and gaza civilians, the ap reports. If israel can stop gaza's rocket attacks \" without a ramping up of military activity in gaza, that's preferable, \" said president obama.",

( koin ) — more than 100 protesters took to the streets of burns on saturday to support a pair of oregon ranchers who will return to prison for arsons on federal land — even though the ranchers have publicly said they don't want their help. Supporters of ranchers dwight and steve hammond gathered at the safeway in burns at noon. One speaker said there were attendees from idaho, washington, montana, texas, ohio, michigan and florida in the group. For about 40 minutes, organizers addressed the crowd at the safeway, then began a 1-mile march to the hammonds ' house after singing the star-spangled banner. They stayed a few minutes once they arrived at the house, and continued their march after the hammonds made a brief appearance. Dwight hammond told koin 6 news, \"remember: it's not about me, it's about america and somehow we have to get the wheels back on this wagon because they are flying off. \" at 73, hammond said he feels his upcoming prison term is a life sentence. \"i ' m not very happy about that.

Many were women, \" reports erin gloria ryan at jezebel. Ryan also notes that the song is actually \" an amalgam of several ' pub'songs \" that rugby players from all over the country belt out. Dr. Chris kilmartin, a psych professor at the college, tells ryan, \" if it's rugby culture, it's gotta change. \" ryan also brings up possible first amendment violations, as the school is punishing players for an event that took place off-campus. \" there's no first amendment exception for speech that is simply offensive, even if it repels many, most, or even all who encounter it, \" an attorney for the foundation for individual rights in education tells ryan.

Inmates get a day reduced from their prison time for each day successfully served. It is possible she could get another 30-day reduction for completing a drug rehab program while in prison, he said. The report that portwood definitely will be placed in a prison drug rehab program is not accurate, since that can only be decided once she is in the indiana prison system, he said. It probably will take two weeks before the commitment order is signed by the judge and portwood is transferred from the madison county jail to state",

Again -- after asking an indiana judge to reimpose her sentence, stemming from a december drug arrest.portwood was in court this morning when the judge reimposed the sentence.

Insisting he had no choice but to enforce the terms of amber's plea agreement.portwood's five-year prison sentence was previously stayed on the condition she complete a drug rehabilitation program -- but as we first reported, portwood gave up on the program... And asked to go to prison instead the judge said he would refer amber to the indiana department of corrections therapeutic community program -- an incarceration-based treatment program.portwood will be given credit for time served in jail."

        "summary": "Pieces of what could be the oldest koran known have been rediscovered in a library at the uk's university of birmingham. Mistakenly bound with a koran dating to the late seventh century, two sheets of the muslim holy book had sat in a collection of 3,000 middle eastern texts gathered in iraq in the 1920s before phd researcher alba fedeli recognized their \" startling \" significance, the bbc and reuters report. Radiocarbon dating revealed the fragments, written in ink on sheepskin or goatskin, were created between 568 and 645. At least 1,370 years old, they \" could well take us back to within a few years of the actual founding of islam, \" between 610 and 632, professor david thomas says. That means the individual who transcribed the revelations was likely alive at the time of the prophet muhammad. \" he would have seen him probably, he would maybe have heard him preach. He may have known him personally, \" thomas adds. Passages of the koran — said to have been relayed to muhammad by the angel gabriel — were initially written on parchment, stone, leaves, and even the shoulder blades of camels before a book form was completed around 650. An expert at the british library suggests the manuscript, which contains chapters 18 to 20 in an early form of arabic known as hijazi script, is a \" precious survivor \" of a copy distributed later. \" finding out we had one of the oldest fragments of the koran in the whole world has been fantastically exciting, \" says a university director, adding never \" in our wildest dreams \" did researchers expect the find to be so old. As radiocarbon dating offers a range of dates for several old koran editions, it isn't clear which is truly the oldest. The latest find, however, is among the earliest. The university plans to put the fragments on display in october so all can see what thomas calls a \" treasure that is second to none. \" ( the chattanooga suspect was familiar with the ancient book. )",

At just 120 pounds, his health was in danger. Adrien brody: while playing a man getting psychological treatment in the jacket, he actually asked to get strapped into a straightjacket... And left inside a morgue drawer. Daniel day-lewis: he pretty much always goes too far. For my left foot, he stayed in a wheelchair for the entire shoot and let the crew spoon feed him. For in the name of the father, he lived in an abandoned jail eating prison rations. And so on. Robert de niro: for his role as a criminal in cape fear, de niro actually had a dentist grind his teeth down and make them look severely messed up.

Traficant, who spent 17 years in congress, was expelled in 2002 following his conviction; he was just the second lawmaker since the civil war to be voted out of the body, the ap notes.

        "summary": "Scientists who assumed the infamous ozone hole over antarctica was steadily shrinking received an unpleasant surprise last month: the hole is approaching a size unseen in nine years, popular science reports. According to live science, in october researchers at the german aerospace center recorded the size of the hole in the ozone layer as 10 million square miles — larger than the entirety of north america. That's the biggest it's been since 2006, when it set a record of 10.42 million square miles, popular science reports. That's bad news because the ozone layer protects us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, which live science notes can increase the risk of skin cancer and cataracts. Popular science reports the ozone hole has been slowly repairing itself in the years since the use of ozone-depleting chemicals was reduced. But those chemicals still build up at the earth's poles during the spring and summer — it's currently summer in antarctica — creating a large \" seasonal \" hole every year. Scientists blame \" unusual air currents \" for this year's surprisingly large hole. \" we observed an unusually strong southern flow, which directs warm and ozone-rich air masses from lower latitudes over antarctica, \" live science quotes one researcher. \" the typical polar vortex, which provides isolation for antarctica, could not develop well under these conditions. \" popular science reports studies predict it will take until 2040 or later for the ozone layer to completely patch itself.

        "summary": "Eighty-four gallons of oil may not be a huge amount, but that amount leaking out of the dakota access pipeline in april isn't reassuring those who've long protested it. Per nbc news, the leak was caused by mechanical failure of a surge pump at a pump station in tulare, sd. The spill was reportedly contained by gravel in a containment area; the gravel was carted off to be properly disposed of, officials say. Cnnmoney notes that the \" relatively small \" leak on april 4 was initially reported only on the state's department of environment and natural resources website, until the ap picked up the story wednesday. Per nbc, companies aren't obligated to call in pipeline leaks to the feds unless it's more than five barrels, or around 210 gallons, as long as they take care of the mess asap. \" these kinds of spills do occur, \" says a rep for the nonprofit pipeline safety trust. Standing rock sioux tribal council chair dave archambault ii agrees, noting in a statement that \" this is what we have said all along: oil pipelines leak and spill. \" he adds the pipeline hasn't even started handling its full load, expected to be 470,000 barrels of oil a day between north dakota and illinois. The sioux, who continue to wage legal war against the pipeline, are afraid their main water supply, the missouri river, will be tainted. An environmental scientist with the state agency, however, says there was never any risk to the tribe's water supply — or any public health risk — because the leak happened almost 100 miles from the tribe's drinking-water reservoir. Energy transfer partners, which owns the pipeline, issued a statement that simply said the spill \" stayed in the containment area as designed. \"",

        "summary": "Good news for women who want an epidural in the later stage of childbirth: contrary to popular opinion, a new study finds epidurals do not prolong the second stage of labor. Many obstetricians are hesitant to give epidural anesthesia as a woman gets closer to delivering due to that belief, the new york times reports. As the telegraph explains, the prevailing concern is that women who get an epidural won't be able to tell whether they're pushing effectively. But the study, published in obstetrics &amp; gynecology, found no clinically significant difference in the length of time between full dilation of the cervix and delivery between women who received an epidural versus women who received a placebo. The women were administered one or the other in identical containers, and neither they nor their medical team knew which they got. In the group that received the saline solution, time between full cervical dilation and delivery was 51 minutes; in the epidural group, it was 52 minutes. The study also found almost no difference in the number of cesarean sections, forceps deliveries, episiotomies, \" or any other measure of fetal well-being the researchers investigated \" between the two groups, per a press release. In fact, the only clinically significant difference found was that the women who got an epidural were more satisfied with their pain control. Lifehacker notes that many media outlets are presenting the results of the study as saying epidurals don't prolong labor at all, but it's important to clarify the study only looked at the second stage of labor, or the \" pushing \" stage. All the women involved had epidurals during the first stage of labor ( which involves the cervix dilating and contractions getting stronger ), so this study can't answer the question of whether epidurals increase total time in labor.",

            "Epidural analgesia -- a mix of anesthetics and narcotics delivered by catheter placed close to the nerves of the spine -- is the most effective method of labor pain relief. In widespread use since the 1970s, epidurals have long been thought to slow the second stage of labor -- defined as beginning when the cervix is completely dilated and ending when the baby is delivered. Because a longer duration of this stage of labor is associated with adverse outcomes, obstetricians routinely reduce or discontinue epidural pain management in an effort to expedite this main stage of labor. That practice could be out-of-date and misguided, according to research led by scientists at beth israel deaconess medical center ( bidmc )",

On thursday, he told cnnmoney that for union members, there's another big problem with the deal: much of the $ 16 million the company promised to invest in the plant will be spent on automation, meaning robots will end up doing many of the saved jobs. Jones tells the washington post that workers were \" devastated \" to discover they were losing their jobs after all.

Fueled by a local-television contract that will rake in $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion over 25 years, the team spent $ 147 million saturday to buy zack greinke in a six-year deal, the biggest-ever contract for a right-handed pitcher. And that was before the team signed south korean pitcher ryu hyun-jin to a six-year, $ 36 million deal, reports the ap. \" if the yankees are the evil empire, the dodgers are the death star, \" quips yahoo. But the team's newfound \" death star \" status comes with pressures, like having to win the world series. And new owner guggenheim partners may have overstepped in using money from insurance companies to buy the team for a record-breaking $ 2 billion, reports the new york times. It \" seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen, \" says the times, which notes that insurance money is usually invested in safe and simple assets — not a baseball team, which is \" the ultimate toy for the ultrarich. \"",

For the last two weeks, i've been puzzled by the announcement of a $ 2.15 billion deal to buy the los angeles dodgers by magic johnson and a group of financiers. Of course, johnson got most of the attention. But his celebrity has obscured a drumbeat of questions about the businessmen behind this headline-grabbing sale, which doubled the record for the price tag of an american professional sports team, set by the miami dolphins when it was sold for $ 1.1 billion in 2009. The winning bid was led by mark walter and his firm, guggenheim partners, which most people in sports — and frankly, even on wall street — know very little about.

Blake wentworth, an instructor in the college's south and southeast asian studies department, first filed a defamation suit sept. 20 against nicole hemenway, followed by another suit against phd students erin bennett and kathleen gutierrez on sept. 22, reports the san francisco chronicle. On wednesday, he added the u of california board of regents to the list, lodging a complaint for an unspecified amount in damages for what he says was the school's harassment, discrimination, and retaliation against him, including punishing him for his depression and bipolar disorder. Bennett and gutierrez had filed a complaint with the state's department of fair employment and housing in april 2015, claiming the school let wentworth teach even after they'd reported his unwanted touching and sex references. Hemenway, meanwhile, said wentworth kept calling her \" honey bear \" and hinting they should date when she graduated, the guardian reports. But, per the daily californian, wentworth said in his sept. 22 suit that neither bennett nor gutierrez ever told him his behavior made them uncomfortable, and that both women went after him for sexual harassment only after other academic issues arose that they wanted to deflect. And in his sept. 20 suit, he says hemenway told him via email she didn't find his behavior inappropriate. Meanwhile, wentworth says the sseas head alerted the campus title ix office of bennett's complaint just two days after wentworth suffered a \" major psychological crisis, \" \" [ resurrecting ] bennett's meritless assertions as a pretext to build a file on [ wentworth ] and get rid of a disabled professor. \" wentworth is on paid leave until the case resolves, a campus rep tells the californian.

There's another interesting dynamic at play in that nine-day window, notes al jazeera: some 24 million people, or roughly 18 % of all voters, voted between comey's two letters. Still, some top dems point to the campaign's self-inflicted wounds. \" there is a special place in hell for clinton staff, allegedly including cheryl mills, that okayed the email server setup, \" says a former top aide to harry reid.

While the layoffs have been rumored since last week, microsoft stock dropped slightly thursday when they became a reality, geekwire reports. \" like all companies, we evaluate our business on a regular basis, \" a microsoft spokesperson says. \" this can result in increased investment in some places and, from time to time, redeployment in others. \" layoffs at microsoft aren't unusual at this time of year, what with the company's fiscal year ending june 30. Last july, microsoft laid off nearly 3,000 people from its smartphone and sales teams.",

' \" the psychiatry professor at university of california, irvine, tells the cbc. But when she notices his good behavior, he tells her, \" don't take it seriously. It's just an experiment. \" fallon famously made a discovery about his brain after getting a pet scanner in the late 1980s. Initially he used it to scan the brains of accused murderers before their defense trials ( \" they'd come in tied up in manacles, \" says fallon ) and then noticed certain patterns: areas that lit up in healthy brains were dark in the brains of accused killers. \" so i said, my god, there's something here, \" he says. Then fallon learned about \" nasty \" people in his own family, including a colonial settler convicted of killing his mother and distant cousin lizzie borden, who famously hacked up her stepmother and father in the late 1800s. And when fallon scanned his own brain to help with a 2006 study, vice reported, he saw clear psychopathic markers. \" the parts of the brain that regulate conscience, emotional empathy and inhibition were turned off, \" fallon says. \" this is probably a very dangerous person. \" a non-violent, successful family man, fallon laughed it off, but his wife and colleagues weren't surprised, describing him as emotionally distant, manipulative, and reckless — if often charming. Fallon says he's \" still trying to control \" the darker side, but \" i figure if i tell everybody i have this, then i can't get away with anything more. \" ( fallon will be in a cbc radio series called \" imposters. \" )",

Police are still sorting out the chaotic scene, but at least one gunman opened fire at the sikh temple of wisconsin in oak creek. The first officer on the scene killed the shooter in a gunfight and was hit several times himself, but is expected to live. A police swat team entered before noon and was sweeping the building when an explosion was heard inside. At least 20 to 30 people are reported injured, some critically. The temple president is among the wounded and is undergoing treatment at a hospital. Early reports indicated multiple shooters, but authorities are saying they believe there was just one. \" we have no idea, \" said a temple committee member of the motive. \" it's pretty much a hate crime. It's not an insider. \" wisconsin police say the fbi is handling the investigation and treating it as a domestic terrorism case, the ap reports.",

        "summary": "Norwegians made the news late last year with an innovative proposal to celebrate finland's 100th birthday by gifting their neighboring country the summit of mount halti, which sits on the border of the two scandinavian countries. Most of the mountain is already in finnish territory, the independent reports. While the idea got a lot of viral traction online and popular support in norway, now afp says it won't be happening. The hang-up is a semantic one: article 1 of the norwegian constitution states that the kingdom of norway shall remain \" indivisible and inalienable. \" so no moving borders, no matter how slightly. Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of finland's independence from russia, and gifting mount halti was proposed as a way to mark the auspicious anniversary. Norway, which boasts several hundred mountain peaks, wouldn't miss this one unremarkable summit near the border, supporters argued. Plus, the retired employee of the norwegian mapping authority who first came up with the idea in 1972 calls it \" geophysically illogical \" that though most of the mountain sits in finland, the peak was given to norway. Despite the government's inability to change the borders, norwegian prime minister erna solberg assured her people, \" we will think of another worthy gift to celebrate the occasion of finland centenary. \"",

            "A hope hull man is thanking a postal worker for saving his life following a horrific ordeal that left him lying wounded on the floor of his house for ten days. The man was unable to get help after a terrible fall and found different ways to stay alive until his mail carrier found him. Cissy cartwright, who has been delivering mail in hope hull for more than 20 years, knew something wasn't right when she noticed that one of the residents on her route hadn't checked his mail in several days. Tommy hope, 66, has a long driveway and his home sits back off the road in a secluded rural area so she decided to go back to check on him. Over the years, cartwright has learned the habits of those she delivers to and looks after senior citizens and those who live alone, like hope. She also knew hope suffers from a bad back. When she pulled up, cartwright found hope's front door open and his truck in the front yard with the hood up. She went to the door and called for hope and he yelled back to her for help. She found him on the floor, dehydrated and injured and learned that he'd been there for more than a week. She called 911 and waited with him until an ambulance arrived",

Jasmine turner, the owner of the car, says she was surprised when police called her concerned about the welfare of a child locked inside her car on thursday. Turner told local news station wavy: \" i don't have a baby so i ' m like, 'where'd the child come from? who put the child in my car? ' \" police broke the window anyway, but discovered what had appeared to be a child to the concerned bystander who called 911 was actually no more than a wig and some blankets. Perhaps due to embarrassment, or perhaps due to more pressing business elsewhere, the responding officers reportedly left the scene before turner returned to her car. Turner claims police told her they wouldn't pay for her repairs, which she estimates will cost several hundred dollars. In a classic case of he-said-she-said, the local police department says authorities referred her to the city's risk management division to file a claim for reimbursement.

By newman's wife, joanne woodward, in the late ' 60s for likely around $ 300, reports the wall street journal in an in-depth look at the watch's history. Newman had started racing cars around that time, and the daytona has a stopwatch function that is useful for race-car drivers. Woodward had it engraved on the back with \" drive carefully me. \" phillips says he wore it every day between 1969 and 1984, when he gave it to james cox, then-boyfriend of newman's daughter nell, to thank him for rebuilding the tree house on their connecticut property. Years later, when cox ( who is still friends with nell ) realized how valuable the watch could be, he decided to sell it and give what the journal calls \" a significant portion of the proceeds \" to the charitable foundation nell started after her father's death.",

Michael wade propst initially said someone asked him to fill up the bus with gas, but later admitted he took it overnight from a residence and drove it 14 miles across panama city beach to the walmart. Deputies arrested him. It's not clear why propst took the bus, but it is clear how: the actual 28-year-old driver apparently left the keys inside. ( not surprisingly, he's been suspended, the news herald notes; the local superintendent calls the incident \" a valuable lesson in securing our buses. \" ) as for propst, he's been charged with grand theft of an item worth more than $ 100,000 and felony criminal mischief, reports the jackson county floridian. But a school security officer is nonetheless impressed with the boy's driving skills: \" you have to take a weeklong course to operate a bus like that, \" yet propst managed to drive it on a highway and over a bridge without eliciting any suspicion.

        "summary": "Women who regularly clean at home or professionally are damaging their lungs in a way comparable to smoking a pack of cigarettes every day for 10 to 20 years due to the inhalation of cleaning sprays, according to a recently published study out of norway. \" we feared that such chemicals, by steadily causing a little damage to the airways day after day, year after year, might accelerate the rate of lung function decline that occurs with age, \" study co-author cecile svanes says in a press release. Researchers looked at data from more than 6,200 people over 20 years. They found the amount of air women could forcibly exhale in a second and the amount of air they could forcibly exhale total declined faster in those who cleaned at home or professionally. They also found asthma was 12.3 % to 13.7 % more prevalent in women who cleaned. \" when you think of inhaling small particles from cleaning agents that are meant for cleaning the floor and not your lungs, maybe it is not so surprising, \" study co-author øistein svanes says. Researchers say they believe the reason is the irritation that cleaning chemicals cause to the mucus membranes found in airways. And here's the kicker: \" these chemicals are usually unnecessary; microfiber cloths and water are more than enough for most purposes, \" øistein svanes says. A representative of the british lung association tells the bbc that people should make sure their homes are well ventilated and use liquid cleaners instead of spray cleaners. Oddly, researchers didn't find a similar loss of lung function in men who cleaned. ( meet the last three people to still use an iron lung. )",

At the top of the list would be the 3,000 or so people stuck in shelters on the island, which is still 60 % without power after hurricane maria slammed it in september. Fema would foot the bill for flying those interested to their interim homes. The initiative would be carried out as part of the agency's transitional shelter assistance program, which offers evacuees \" short-term lodging assistance \" after a disaster; florida and new york were selected as destinations due to the existing puerto rican communities there. Cbs news reports this would be the first time fema would attempt this long-distance airlifting effort, or what it calls an \" air bridge. \" that's because the agency typically puts disaster survivors up in local hotels, but all of puerto rico's hotels are full. Once in florida or new york, participants would stay in hotels there for two months, per abc news.

During the two years guthrie lived in what he started calling \" bitch havens, \" he wrote some lyrics about \" old man trump \" that were never published. Among them: i suppose/old man trump knows/just how much/racial hate/he stirred up/in the bloodpot of human hearts/when he drawed/that color line/here at his/eighteen hundred family project...

            "Tokyo ( reuters ) - japan's first annual trade deficit in more than 30 years calls into question how much longer the country can rely on exports to help finance a huge public debt without having to turn to fickle foreign investors. The aftermath of the march earthquake raised fuel import costs while slowing global growth and the yen's strength hit exports, data released on wednesday showed, swinging the 2011 trade balance into deficit. Few analysts expect japan to immediately run a deficit in the current account, which includes trade and returns on the country's huge portfolio of investments abroad. A steady inflow of profits and capital gains from overseas still outweighs the trade deficit. But the trade figures underscore a broader trend of japan's declining global competitive edge and a rapidly ageing population, compounding the immediate problem of increased reliance on fuel imports due to the loss of nuclear power. Only four of the country's 54 nuclear power reactors are running due to public safety fears following the march disaster. \" what it means is that the time when japan runs out of savings --'sayonara net creditor country ' -- that point is coming closer, \" said jesper koll, head of equities research at jpmorgan in japan. \" it means japan becomes dependent on global savings to fund its deficit and either the currency"

            "Tokyo ( reuters ) - japan's first annual trade deficit in more than 30 years calls into question how much longer the country can rely on exports to help finance a huge public debt without having to turn to fickle foreign investors. The aftermath of the march earthquake raised fuel import costs while slowing global growth and the yen's strength hit exports, data released on wednesday showed, swinging the 2011 trade balance into deficit. Few analysts expect japan to immediately run a deficit in the current account, which includes trade and returns on the country's huge portfolio of investments abroad. A steady inflow of profits and capital gains from overseas still outweighs the trade deficit. But the trade figures underscore a broader trend of japan's declining global competitive edge and a rapidly ageing population, compounding the immediate problem of increased reliance on fuel imports due to the loss of nuclear power. Only four of the country's 54 nuclear power reactors are running due to public safety fears following the march disaster. \" what it means is that the time when japan runs out of savings --'sayonara net creditor country ' -- that point is coming closer, \" said jesper koll, head of equities research at jpmorgan in japan. \" it means japan becomes dependent on global savings to fund its deficit and either the currency"

Tesla inc investors gave a rare rebuke to iconoclastic chief executive elon musk on wednesday after he cut off analysts asking about profit potential, sending shares down 5 percent despite promises that production of the troubled model 3 electric car was on track. Tesla's future depends on the model 3 and the company said that it had largely overcome production bottlenecks, with musk vowing a dramatic turnaround that would reverse losses and generate positive cash flow in just a few months. Musk plans to shut down its fremont, california factory for 10 days in the second",
            "Earnings calls are typically a pretty dull affair in which analysts get to ask questions about the company's business and performance. But not for elon musk. The ceo of tesla ( tsla ) hosted the company's latest earnings call wednesday in which he brushed analysts off, told them their questions were boring, and spent a significant amount of time fielding questions from a guy with a youtube channel. Musk is known for his quirks, but investors appeared to be put off. Tesla shares were down nearly 5 % during after-hours trading, despite posting better-than-expected earnings results. Here are the five strangest moments from the call. 1.",

He dismissed a question about gross margins from bernstein senior analyst toni sacconaghi as \" boring. \" instead, musk and other executives answered multiple questions from a tesla enthusiast and youtuber named gali russell. The 25-year-old retail investor tweeted at elon musk on monday, seeking to ask him a \" crowdsourced \" question during wednesday's conference call. Instead of a single question, russell was able to ask several. The stock drop may have become apparent around the time when musk cut off analysts on the call. However, the"

His tv credits ranged from dallas and the waltons to seinfeld and the larry sanders show. Millions knew him as the friendly man with the glasses in tv ads for pathmark. Others remembered him as the foreman in return of the living dead, the boss in the china syndrome or the notorious mr. Teague, the real estate developer who moves the headstones — but not the bodies — in poltergeist. Karen was born jacob karnovsky in wilkes-barres, pennsylvania. He was interested in theater from an early age and, according to his friend leonard maltin, the movie critic, turned down a contract with mgm because he wanted to work on the stage.

        "summary": "Eight years after little ehlena fry was told she couldn't bring her dog wonder to school with her, the supreme court has given her family some measure of vindication. In an 8-0 ruling wednesday, the supreme court instructed a lower court to reconsider its ruling against ehlena and wonder, the detroit free press reports. According to reuters, ehlena, now 13, was born with cerebral palsy. Her pediatrician had said to keep wonder with her at all times. The goldendoodle helped her turn on lights, open doors, go to the bathroom, and more. But her michigan school said ehlena couldn't bring wonder to class, arguing that a human aide could help her with those tasks. The family moved ehlena to a new school district and sued the old district in 2012. Ehlena's old school district argued — and an appeals court agreed in 2015 — that her family needed to go through the individuals with disabilities education act administrative process before it sued under the americans with disabilities act. The supreme court ruled that may not be the case, as ehlena's family appears to be taking issue with access to the school, not her education, usa today reports. The appeals court has now been instructed to look at whether ehlena and her family could make the same complaints if the school was some other kind of public facility and if ehlena was an adult instead of a student. As for wonder, he's now 10 years old and retired as a service dog.",

The story is a strange one: wendell popejoy, 64, shot sheila bonge, 59, in the back of the head on the day after christmas last year, then brought her snowblower back to her home, put her body on a sled, and pushed it down the hill behind his house. Testimony during his trial revealed a neighborhood rift involving bonge, who allegedly would blow snow into popejoy's driveway as well as another couple's driveway in what neighbors said was an attempt to goad them. Popejoy and bonge shared a driveway easement, but bonge believed her boyfriend owned the property used as an easement; she and popejoy were reportedly arguing over the easement when he shot her. \" me and wendell lived in hell, \" his girlfriend told mlive after his sentencing. \" we were caught between a nightmare that was horrible.... There are two sides to every story. \" she says bonge also used to yell at her neighbors and call them names, and that popejoy simply snapped the day he shot her. ( the detroit news reported on the neighborhood animosity in january, telling stories including one 81-year-old's claim that bonge once shouted at her, unprovoked, \" i hope you fall down and break your hip. \" ) but in a victim impact statement read in court monday, her family denied that portrayal of the great-grandmother, woodtv reports. \" no matter how old we are, we need to have a mother to call. Her children no longer have her there, \" said bonge's sister in the statement. \" we will never see her smile or hear her laugh. \" ( this fight between neighbors also turned fatal. )",
