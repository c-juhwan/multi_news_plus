Want your money back? remove the review( s ), the ny post reports. But woe to the reviewer who doesn't remove his complaints — the owners tend to get defensive. When a guest said staff was rude when they asked for ice, the hotel posted a response: \" i know you guys wanted to hang out and get drunk for 2 days... I was so so so sorry that our ice maker and fridge were not working and not accessible. \" despite the hotel's efforts, it still has a poor average rating on yelp.",

Reflux, often called heartburn, occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, causing irritation and damage. Mild reflux is fairly common, but frequent, severe occurrences, known as gerd for gastroesophageal reflux disease, can cause significant discomfort and may require treatment. Many people find relief by using over-the-counter medications called proton pump inhibitors ( ppis ), which reduce acid produced by the stomach. In fact, the u.s. Food and drug administration estimates that 1 in 14 americans have used ppis. After recent evidence linking long-term ppi use to several serious illnesses, including heart disease, kidney disease and dementia, researcher sought to identify how ppis increase risk by studying their effects on blood vessel cells. Now, researchers",

They occur when a blood clot cuts off blood flow to the brain. \" ppis have been associated with unhealthy vascular function, including heart attacks, kidney disease and dementia, \" said dr.

Not to mention that state medical boards are often full of doctors: \" they work very hard to get their medical degrees and they're very, very disinclined to yank the license of another doctor, \" says a medical malpractice lawyer. \" the primary focus is: let's take care of the doctor and help him get through this problem. \" but the rehabilitation programs don't always work, and either way, doctors who commit a crime are getting away with it. \" i had to sit there in front of him, look him in the eye, they made their guilty verdict and that's it, nothing came of it, \" says the woman groped by dhaliwal. \" he should have lost his license a long time ago. \"",

        "summary": "2013 has been a pretty unbelievable year for jorge mario bergoglio, who became pope francis, dominated facebook, and now finds himself time's person of the year. Managing editor nancy gibbs explains how he ended up on the cover after just nine months on the job: because of how he has positioned himself ( \" at the very center of the central conversations of our time, \" from wealth to the role of women to justice ), for his reach in our flattening world ( \" far beyond the boundaries of the catholic church \" ), and for what he has accomplished in such a short time. \" something remarkable: he has not changed the words, but he's changed the music. \" gibbs acknowledges the skeptics ' likely response — that francis faces many obstacles \" in accomplishing much of anything beyond making casual believers feel better about the softer tone coming out of rome while feeling free to ignore the harder substance. \" but the fascination that swirls around him gives him an ability benedict xvi lacked: \" to magnify the message of the church and its power to do great good. \" writes gibbs, \" the heart is a strong muscle; he's proposing a rigorous exercise plan. And in a very short time, a vast, global, ecumenical audience has shown a hunger to follow him. For pulling the papacy out of the palace and into the streets, for committing the world's largest faith to confronting its deepest needs, and for balancing judgment with mercy, pope francis is time's 2013 person of the year \" ( cover story here ).

        "summary": "With the debut of vaping in the us in 2007, there was hope that teens who smoked would replace old-school cigarettes with e-cigarettes, curbing tobacco use. But a new usc study in the journal pediatrics has found teens who never would have smoked regular cigarettes are experimenting with vaping. Another usc study finds older teens who try vaping are six times more likely to try a tobacco-filled cigarette than non-vapers, per a press release. \" e-cigarettes may be recruiting a new group of kids to tobacco use, \" says jessica barrington-trimis, lead author of both studies. While e-cigs may seem safer than tobacco, if they come pumped with nicotine ( some don't ), kids can get addicted. The new york times notes chemicals in the vaping liquid may be harmful; webmd adds long-term effects are unknown. Using participants from usc's children's health study, scientists followed 5,490 teens who graduated high school in select years between 1995 and 2015, asking them via questionnaire about their tobacco use. It's true that rates among southern california teens who said they had smoked over the past 30 days fell significantly from 1995 to 2004 ( 19 % to 9 % ), and slightly more in the decade after that ( a bit less than 8 % by 2014 ). But when teens were asked to include e-cigarettes in their assessments, the smoking rate jumped back up to 14 % in 2014. And that's got scientists worried, especially with the prevalence of e-cigarettes that come in kid-friendly flavors such as cotton candy. \" e-cigarettes may be safer than regular cigarettes for adults who are transitioning from smoking to vaping, but for youth who have never used any other tobacco products, nicotine experimentation could become nicotine addiction, \" barrington-trimis says.",

Jim acosta of cnn has apologized after tweeting \" f --- you \" ( except he spelled it out ) to a critic, reports mediaite. Acosta also maintains that he mistook the person as an old friend, but not everyone is buying that. It all started thursday night when acosta tweeted a complaint that the trump campaign turned up the music so loudly at a trump rally that it was difficult to work — the implication being that it was deliberate. At that point, a former aide for melania trump, justin caporale, mocked acosta with a tweet reading, \" dear diary... \" that's when acosta sent his controversial response — he did so in a private direct message, but caporale then made it public. Acosta also blocked caporale. As online criticism grew, and caporale demanded an apology, acosta responded: \" hey buddy i thought you were an old friend from the campaign days. I ' m so sorry. Hope i didn't offend you. Have a good night and take care. \" as the wrap notes, the apology seems a bit odd given that acosta also blocked caporale, raising the question of why he would block a friend. Neither acosta nor cnn has commented further. ( acosta also once tangled memorably with white house aide stephen miller. )",

The blm stopped rounding up rancher cliven bundy's cattle and returned about 300 head of cattle to the open range to avoid the potential for violence, according to the blm and cnn affiliate ksnv. The old west-style controversy -- centering on a family that has been ranching in nevada since the 1800s -- drew armed militia groups from across the country to the cattleman's side this week, especially after a youtube video captured a tussle teetering on violence between rangers and protesters. The blm said bundy owed about $ 1 million in back fees because his cattle grazed on federal land. On saturday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the blm's cattle gate, according to cnn affiliate klas. Some of them were armed. \" due to escalating tensions, the cattle have been released from the enclosures in order to avoid violence and help restore order, \" the blm said in a prepared statement.

Some 400 cows were gathered during the roundup that began a week ago, short of the blm's goal of 900 cows that it says were trespassing on public land. Bundy didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Gov. Brian sandoval, who had complained about the blm's handling of the roundup, issued a statement praising the agency for its willingness to listen to the state's concerns.",
            "Story highlights authorities end cattle roundup, return livestock for safety reasons troopers reopen northbound interstate 15 about 80 miles outside las vegas \" tensions are still near the boiling point, \" sen. Heller says some supporters of rancher were armed, authorities say a tense, weeklong showdown appeared to end saturday between the federal government and supporters of a nevada cattle rancher battling the bureau of land management ( blm ) over grazing rights on federal land. The blm stopped rounding up rancher cliven bundy's cattle and returned about 300 head of cattle to the open range to avoid the potential for violence, according to the blm and cnn affiliate ksnv. The old west-style controversy -- centering on a family that has been ranching in nevada since the 1800s -- drew armed militia groups from across the country to the cattleman's side this week, especially after a youtube video captured a tussle teetering on violence between rangers and protesters. The blm said bundy owed about $ 1 million in back fees because his cattle grazed on federal land. On saturday, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the blm's cattle gate, according to cnn affiliate klas. Some of them were armed. \" due to escalating tensions, the cattle have been released from the enclosures in order to avoid violence and help restore order, \" the blm said in a prepared statement. Also saturday, supporters of bundy, some of them armed, forced a temporary shutdown of northbound lanes of interstate 15 near his ranch, the nevada highway patrol said. \" based on information about conditions on the ground, and in consultation with law enforcement, we have made a decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public, \" said blm director neil kornze. The highway was reopened early saturday afternoon"

Troops were expected to focus on so-called \" terror tunnels \" used to infiltrate the country. It's not clear whether the ground offensive will be a quick strike or a longer one with the goal of taking control of gaza. An israeli defense official who speculated yesterday about such a move said that a takeover of gaza wouldn't be too much of a challenge, but that any such mission would have to last \" many months \" in order to fully secure the area.

Trump, however, tweeted: \" dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star, or plain star. \" dan scavino, trump's social media director, said the image had been \" lifted from an anti-hillary twitter user where countless images appear. \" trump later issued a statement on his website saying the star is used by \" sheriffs who deal with criminals and criminal behavior \" and that clinton \" is just trying to divert attention from the dishonest behavior of herself and her husband. \" anti-defamation league ceo jonathan greenblatt wasn't buying the \" sheriff's badge \" line, the guardian reports. He told cnn on monday that the trump campaign has had a troubling tone for months.

In another washington post column, anne applebaum writes that it's wrong to call poles \" accomplices \" because after the 1939 invasion of poland, it was germans who created \" a lawless, violent world, one in which anyone could be arbitrarily murdered, any jew could be deported — and any pole who helped a jew could be shot instantly, along with his entire family.

Staring, and occasionally blinking, in slow motion. For four minutes and nine seconds. And that's it ( though she does laugh near the end, prompting one person to comment on youtube, \" 3: 53 melted my heart and make my eyes wet? \" ). At slate, heather schwedel looks at where this fits in to the buzzy \" pivot to video \" that's underway in the media world, with more and more publications dumping journalists and shifting their resources to producing video. Her conclusion: \" this is how backward our world is, now: a video of a hadid doing nothing makes a weird sort of sense. Of course! brilliant! \" schwedel speculates that this started out as an inside joke born from photo-shoot footage, but writes, \" it's just as fun to imagine that the editors at glamour were so devoid of ideas that they asked hadid to sit there and do nothing for a while on camera. \" and she sees the whole thing as reflective of \" how clueless many magazines are about how to produce good videos for the web. \" but, she concedes, maybe this is a \" step up, \" at least compared with the \" glorified slideshows \" that have become a popular approach to creating cheap videos. At man repeller, amelia diamond writes that she did get sucked in by the video, but the credit may not go to hadid. \" could you have watched anyone for this long with the right song? i think maybe i could have.

A new plos study finds that some people with the virus show mild or no symptoms at all — a potential concern for preventing its spread.

At least 28,000 people are known to have been infected during the epidemic, at least 11,000 of whom died. In sukudu, there were 34 known ebola cases, including 28 deaths among 900 residents, reports gizmodo. A year after the worst of the outbreak was over, stanford university researchers tested the blood of 187 people in sukudu who'd lived with or shared a toilet with someone infected with ebola, per a release. They found 14 had ebola antibodies, suggesting they'd previously been infected, while 12 said they didn't recall feeling sick or having a fever. Believing them to be truthful as health workers kept an eye on villagers during the outbreak, researchers now plan to visit other villages \" so we can begin to answer the question of what was the true burden of disease, \" the study author says. \" we expect to find a lot more undocumented survivors. \" it's not clear if asymptomatic patients are contagious. \" they were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea, \" he says. \" it's unclear if they can pass it along sexually. \" ( this ebola-like disease can shut down organs. )",

        "summary": "A new autism study makes what looks to be a significant discovery: the first signs show up as early as two months of age in the form of reduced eye contact by babies, reports the new york times. If the findings hold up, they could provide doctors with the earliest warning yet that a child is developing the disorder — a big deal because research suggests that the earlier treatment begins, the more effective it is. The study \" tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life, \" one of the emory university researchers tells the bbc. \" these are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed. \" the researchers studied two groups of kids from birth to age 2 with sophisticated eye-tracking technology. One of the groups was deemed high risk because of a sibling with autism. The researchers then went back when the kids were 3 and found a clear correlation between those who had been recently diagnosed with autism and their eye contact as babies. The dropoff began between two and six months of age, and the more severe it was, the more severe the case of autism. An autism researcher not involved with the study called it a \" major, major finding. \" the researchers say this isn't something parents would likely be able to notice on their own, notes healthday via us news &amp; report. Nor do they want parents to panic if their child isn't maintaining constant eye contact. But \" if they do have persistent concerns, they should talk to their child's pediatrician, \" adds one.",

What he found there were people dying of thirst in conditions so dire that he risked the trip home, reuters reports. Up to 40,000 refugees remain on mount sinjar, however, surrounded by the extremists who attacked their village and who have a penchant for beheading dissenters. There is little food or water, and though the un has offered to drop supplies, it hasn't been asked to do so by the iraqi government. One witness tells the washington post that 10 children and one elderly woman died yesterday and seven children monday; unicef believes 40 children have died since fleeing their village monday night. \" we need to get them out. If we don't, it would be catastrophic, \" a unicef rep tells the post. Going home would also spell death: \" we would need a miracle to avoid the islamic state's brutality, \" says one resident. There are about 308,000 yazidi in sinjar's district; a minority sect of the kurds, their religion is a combo of ancient zoroastrianism, christianity, and islam. When the islamic state came to sinjar on saturday, 20 yazidi were killed in a failed defense and 30 more died of unknown causes. Many more fled — the us-trained army fell apart and the kurdish pershmerga, mobilized to take their place, ran away \" without shooting a bullet, \" one sinjar resident tells reuters. The christian science monitor has this primer on the yazidi people.",

Yesterday, isight released its own report, saying that a virus it's calling kaptoxa \" has potentially infected a large number of retail information systems \" — and noting that the \" intrusion operators displayed innovation and a high degree of skill, \" particularly in terms of the \" operational sophistication \" of the hack. The journal shares this feature by way of example: the virus focused on stealing data during the peak hours of 10am and 5pm; the data was housed in a target server that the hackers later accessed. The virus attacks point-of-sale systems in a way that is \" new to ecrime, \" subverting traditional efforts to protect consumer data, the report warns, according to nbc. Parts of the code, which is impervious to all known antivirus software, have been online since last spring. It's partly in russian, which us officials think may indicate a link to organized crime in the former soviet union. The finding follows reports of similar breaches at neiman marcus.

        "summary": "Look at a van gogh painting today, and you're not quite getting the full effect. Reports in 2013, as cited in the guardian, revealed that the paintings were fading; studies have found yellows are turning brown. The color red is also posing a problem in works like wheat stack under a cloudy sky, and researchers are now moving closer to finding out why, chemistry world reports. Van gogh often used a pigment known as red lead. The stuff, also called minium, turns whiter when it's exposed to light. Seeking to understand the process, researchers analyzed a tiny dot of paint from the work. The process, which involved shooting x-rays at the paint, showed that the red lead is now covered with what chemistry world calls \" degradation products \" in the form of other chemicals. The researchers found a substance they call the \" missing link \" in the degradation process: it's a mineral lead known as plumbonacrite, hyperallergic reports. Light shining on the plumbonacrite has apparently caused the buildup of other chemicals. Interestingly, as hyperallergic notes, the researchers say plumbonacrite has never before been reported \" in a painting dating from before the mid 20th century. \" of course, the color issues actually make van gogh's work even more impressive, jonathan jones wrote in the guardian: \" in the end, the fact that some of van gogh's colors have changed over the years is simply a homage to his genius. No one, after all, has any complaint about his colors. \" last year, van gogh — or rather, his \" regrown \" ear — made some unusual headlines.",

            "Wichita, kan. ( ap ) — a bag carried to the moon aboard the apollo 11 spacecraft and used for the first sample of lunar material is at the center a legal fight after the government mistakenly sold it during the criminal case against the former director of the kansas cosmosphere and space center. The white bag — which was flown to the moon on apollo 11 in june 1969 and has lunar material embedded in its fabric — is \" a rare artifact, if not a national treasure, \" the government said. The dispute is the latest legal twist in the case of max ary, the founder and longtime director of the cosmosphere in hutchinson who was convicted in november 2005 for stealing and selling museum artifacts. At issue in his prosecution were hundreds of missing space artifacts and memorabilia. Some were on loan from nasa to the cosmosphere. The lunar bag was discovered in 2003 during the execution of a search warrant in a box located in ary's garage. On wednesday, the u.s. Attorney's office asked a federal judge to set aside the final forfeiture order and rescind the bag's sale, saying that the national aeronautics and space administration was not properly notified of its forfeiture because the bag was misidentified. The bag was sold at a government auction on feb. 15, 2015 for $ 995 to nancy",

The men had headed there from the pub around 1am for a \" quiet night \" after picking up a \" few drinks from the petrol station, \" boyle, 33, tells gazettelive in a story spotted by usa today. Friend jamie blyth \" asks if i have my passport handy and comes up with the idea of us going to thailand straight away, \" says boyle. \" then we got into a taxi he'd phoned and — apart from the short delay of picking up jamie's passport — we were off. \" it was \" all a bit rash, \" says boyle, whose luggage consisted of a grocery bag containing a few shirts and some underwear. The men booked two seven-hour flights spanning 6,750 miles, heading for the beachside city of pattaya; they apparently \" knew some guys from school \" in thailand. \" on the way out there we sobered up on the flight and thought ' what have we done! ' \" blyth tells gazettelive. But they made the most of the adventure, which ran through tuesday. It was \" brilliant fun, \" boyle says. \" we went out for meals and to bars and didn't really sleep that much. \" he adds, \" i ' m feeling okay now. \" the guys admit they did face consequences. \" i have fallen behind with a few things at work, \" boyle says.

Maine is one of 19 states where republicans have blocked medicaid expansion available under the aca. The maine legislature has voted repeatedly to expand medicaid only to have gov. Paul lepage veto expansion five times. However, if expansion is approved by voters through a referendum next month, lepage would be unable to veto it. If the referendum passes, approximately 80,000 more maine residents making up to 138 % of the poverty level will be eligible for medicaid. In addition to decreasing the number of uninsured maine residents, supporters of the referendum say it will add jobs and help rural hospitals stay open. Lepage, while attacking maine hospitals for their support of the referendum on friday, said it would take \" resources away from our most vulnerable mainers \" to \" give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to adults who should be working and contributing, \" the press herald reports. Under the aca, at least 90 % of medicaid expansion costs would be covered by the federal government. The other 18 states where medicaid expansion has been blocked are carefully watching what happens in maine.

        "summary": "Tanning beds have long been associated with skin cancer, and now researchers are quantifying just what that costs the us financially. Reporting in the journal of cancer policy, they calculate that in 2015, the direct medical care for skin cancers resulting from tanning bed exposure totals $ 343.1 million. What's more, they figure that early deaths and loss of productivity in these cases add up to a $ 127.3 billion loss over the lifetime of individuals currently diagnosed. But those are just dollar signs: the human toll is large, too, with more than 263,000 cases of skin cancer attributed to tanning beds in 2015 alone. The researchers call tanning beds a \" significant contributor to illness and premature mortality in the us. \" reuters notes that some 30 million americans use tanning beds every year. Tanning beds emit uv-a rays, which damage dna, and uv-b rays, which can burn one's skin and also raise the risk of skin cancer. ( the research did not calculate the medical cost of burns. ) previous research has found that indoor tanning bed exposure in people younger than 35 nearly doubles their risk of melanoma, reports stat news, and americans must now be 18 or older to use them in several states. \" women younger than 30 are six times more likely to develop melanoma if they tan indoors, \" says a university of alabama researcher who wasn't involved in the study. \" even one indoor tanning session can increase users ' risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma by 67 % and basal cell carcinoma by 29 %. \" ( australia has outright banned tanning beds. )",

Choe, the north's vice minister of foreign affairs, slammed pence for comparing north korea to libya in the context of denuclearization. \" i cannot suppress my surprise at such ignorant and stupid remarks gushing out from the mouth of the us vice president, \" she said. Choe — who warned that pyongyang could make the us \" taste an appalling tragedy it has neither experienced nor even imagined \" — was responding to pence's comment to fox news earlier this week, in which he said the clinton and obama administrations had been \" played \" by north korea and it would be a mistake for the koreans to think they could do the same to trump, the ap reports. The bbc notes that choe is one of kim's top aides and her statements will have been sanctioned by the leader. Trump said tuesday that the summit \" may not work out \" for june 12, but he sounded more optimistic wednesday, before choe's remarks were released. \" right now we're looking at it, we're talking about it, and they're talking to us, \" he told fox. \" we have certain conditions.

Robert roberson, who had been scheduled to be executed june 21, was convicted in 2002 of murdering his 2-year-old daughter. According to the ap, roberson's girlfriend says he was angry when he became the sole caregiver of his daughter, nikki. That same day, roberson brought nikki to the hospital with serious head injuries. Doctors thought they looked intentional and called police. Nikki died the following day. While roberson maintains nikki was hurt falling off her bed or from a fever, experts during his trial testified that she died of shaken baby syndrome and that roberson planned to sexually abuse her. But new research shows that what used to be taken as signs of shaken baby syndrome — brain swelling and bleeding behind the eyes and on the brain's surface — can also be caused by short falls or undiagnosed medical conditions. Roberson's lawyers successfully convinced eight of the nine members on the texas court of criminal appeals that roberson had been convicted on \" false, misleading, and scientifically invalid testimony. \" nikki never showed any outward signs, such as an injured neck, of shaken baby syndrome. Roberson's case will now go back to trial. ( this boy died 12 years after being shaken as a baby. )",

            "( cnn ) members of the british royal air force are sending a message to isis in a storied way -- scrawled on the outside of a bomb. \" love from manchester ❤, \" it reads, in all caps. The photo of the message began circulating on social media on thursday. It's unclear when or where the image was created or if the bomb was ever dropped -- but in an email to cnn an raf spokesperson confirmed the photo is \" genuine. \" the raf has taken part in airstrikes against isis targets in iraq and syria. Messages written on bombs are a sort of tradition amongst air crews. Read more",
            "An image has surfaced of a bomb with the words \"love from manchester \" written on it, confirmed to be genuine by the ministry of defence ( although, perhaps because of how outrageous the sentiment seems, it was originally dismissed by many as \"fake news \". ) after the appalling tragedy in my hometown of manchester on monday night, the photograph sickens me. It utterly disrespects the people of my wonderful city by slapping our name on a missile, an instrument for causing death and destruction, mere days after a terrible loss of life occurred where we live. The people of manchester have pulled together in a time of crisis, showing incredible strength in supporting one another, regardless of religion, ethnicity or background. Manchester is grieving. We want healing, not more violence and horror. The words written on the bomb are an unpleasant example of everything that's wrong with our current approach to foreign policy and our penchant for funding chaotic conflicts that further destabilise countries and create the conditions ideal for extremism to flourish. It is the very embodiment of \"an eye for an eye \", which we all know leaves the whole world blind.

Her family knew about his opposition to the marriage but \" never thought he would go that far, \" the bride's father said. At the wedding in bhopal, singh waited the near the stage for an hour before shooting namdeo, and tried to shoot the groom and himself but only grazed himself and injured a guest. The crowd savagely beat singh before police arrived and took him away. Beyond singh's banking career ( described in one report as \" modest \" ), all that's known about him was written on his facebook account: \" interested in.. Women. \"",

The bbc reports that at private hospitals, 85 % of women deliver by cesarean; in public hospitals, it's about half that ( 45 % ). In 2013 npr reported the figure for some private hospitals is 99 %; one doctor npr spoke with could hardly recall the last time he handled a vaginal delivery. The world health organization recommends a 10 % to 15 % rate. In an effort to get closer to that figure, brazil is now making it a little more, well, laborious to have a cesarean. New rules were introduced yesterday, reports afp, and going forward, there's more paperwork. After women are told about the risks ( now required ), they ' ll have to sign a consent form; a doctor will have to fill out a form that asks for the justification of the procedure. But forms may not solve what some women say is the real issue: a lack of beds. Those who want to deliver in a private hospital report that the beds are often completely preassigned to women who've booked a cesarean, forcing them to, in some instances, go to hospital after hospital while in labor. Afp reports doctors play a role, too, with some saying doctors encourage women to take the scheduled route, which helps quash middle-of-the-night working hours.

South korean newspaper joongang ilbo reports by way of an unnamed source that two men were publicly executed earlier this month. It identifies the men as ri yong jin, a high-ranking official in the education ministry, and hwang min, the former agriculture minister. The men's alleged offenses: ri fell asleep while in a meeting with kim and was \" arrested on site and intensively questioned \"; corruption charges followed. In hwang's case, unspecified \" policy proposals he had pushed for were seen as a direct challenge to the kim jong un leadership, \" says the source. While kim is thought to have ordered at least 70 executions since taking power in 2011, bloomberg highlights one difference with the current case: if ri and hwang were in fact put to death, they are the first from outside the workers ' party or the military to have met that fate on kim's orders. The guardian notes the news has not been independently verified, nor has it been announced by the kcna. The south korean newspaper suggests the executions were in part prompted by a high-profile defection and carried out as a way of reasserting control over the country's elite.

Authorities in wisconsin say that his weapon of choice was a circular saw and that the slaying unfolded while the two were part of a crew working atop a home outside the city of river falls on aug. 6. Per the criminal complaint cited by the st. Louis post-dispatch, police say the victim handed navarro the saw moments before navarro sliced valles-flores'throat. Valles-flores then fell onto an adjoining room, where he was discovered dead. A circular saw was found at the scene. In a recorded phone call from jail following his arrest, navarro allegedly said he was being teased by his co-workers prior to the attack and that it made him feel \" really mad inside. \" however, a relative of valles-flores told reporters the two men had known each other for years and would frequently poke fun at one another.

Walmart — which blames a \" rogue employee \" for an order for its clothes found in the rubble of the building collapse — says it has its own safety plan for the 279 factories it uses in bangladesh, and it will quickly deliver results as good as or better than the european plan, the new york times reports. Walmart plans to audit factories for safety and remove them from its suppliers list if hazards are found. But while the european plan is legally binding, walmart's is voluntary, and experts say such plans have a poor record for delivering results. \" without the legally binding contract that the european retailers have signed, it's just putting lipstick on a pig, \" a sociology professor who has been a vocal critic of sweatshops tells the wall street journal. The gap, meanwhile, says it won't sign the european plan unless language is removed that it fears could make it liable in us courts for safety failures at bangladesh factories. The only american firm to have signed the plan so far is pvh, the parent company of calvin klein and tommy hilfiger.",

A witness tells cnn that to get into the enclosure when his mother was distracted, the boy had to \" climb under something, through some bushes and then into the moat. \" he was released from a hospital on saturday night and his parents issued a statement thanking the zoo and saying the boy is \" doing just fine, \" the cincinnati enquirer reports. \" we know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla, \" they said. The bbc notes that a similar incident in britain in 1986 had a happier ending. When a 5-year-old boy fell into a gorilla enclosure on the island of jersey and fractured his skull, a male silverback named jambo stood guard, stroking the boy and keeping other gorillas away until he was rescued.",

The president's personal lawyer made the comments to the new york times on wednesday before elaborating to the washington post. Claiming the conversation occurred \" three to five weeks ago \" then correcting that timeline to june, giuliani said trump had brought up the possibility of a pardon but both giuliani and fellow attorney jay sekulow advised against it, at least before the conclusion of special counsel robert mueller's investigation. \" we sat him down and said you're not considering these other pardons with anybody involved in the investigation, \" giuliani said. That would ostensibly include former national security adviser michael flynn, former campaign adviser george papadopoulos, and campaign aide rick gates, all of whom have pleaded guilty as part of the mueller probe. \" he said yes, absolutely, i understand, \" giuliani continued. \" the real concern is whether mueller would turn any pardon into an obstruction charge. \" still, the president has been publicly praising manafort since his tuesday conviction on eight counts of financial fraud. \" some of the charges they threw against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in washington probably does, \" trump told fox news on thursday, a day after he took to twitter to praise manafort for refusing to \" break \" for prosecutors. \" such respect for a brave man! \" he wrote.",

            "President trump recently asked his lawyers for their advice on the possibility of pardoning paul manafort and other aides accused of crimes, his lawyer said thursday. The subject of pardoning manafort came as trump's former campaign chairman faced multiple charges of bank fraud and tax evasion in an alexandria criminal case, trump attorney rudolph w. Giuliani said in an interview. Trump's lawyers counseled the president against the idea of pardoning anyone linked to the investigation into russia's interference in the 2016 election, according to giuliani, saying trump should at least wait until special counsel robert s. Mueller iii has concluded his probe. Giuliani said the president agreed and did not push the issue further. \"he said yes, \" giuliani said. \"he agreed with us. \" giuliani said trump was seeking advice in the wake of a spate of pardons he granted earlier this summer, including for a woman whom kim kardashian had lobbied the white house to release. Giuliani said he and fellow personal attorney jay sekulow had advised waiting to see whether mueller delivers a damning report that accuses the president of trying to block a federal probe of his campaign's contacts with russians. White house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders told reporters wednesday that she \"wasn't aware \" of any discussions of trump pardoning manafort and that the topic was \"not something that's",
            "On wednesday, several aides dismissed the news about mr. Cohen as just another bad headline lacking the silver bullet that they say the special counsel would need to prove that the president conspired with russian officials. Mr. Trump spent the early hours of wednesday tweeting — he called the convicted mr. Manafort a \"brave man \" who, unlike mr. Cohen, \"refused to 'break ' \" or \"make up stories in order to get a 'deal. \" ' he also monitored headlines, as he did after his news conference with mr. Putin. In the interview with fox news, he asserted that money for the payments to the women had come not from his campaign, but from his own accounts. \"i don't know if you know, \" mr. Trump said during the interview, \"but i tweeted about the payments. But they didn't come out of the campaign. \" campaign finance laws still prohibit mr. Trump from making unreported payments related to the campaign, regardless of where they came from. Neither payment was disclosed to the federal election commission. On air force one on tuesday night on the way back from a rally in west virginia, mr. Trump repeatedly minimized the news, telling aides that the legal developments were not about him, but about mr. Manafort and mr. Cohen. He also groused over the optics of the rally,"

            "President trump recently asked his lawyers for their advice on the possibility of pardoning paul manafort and other aides accused of crimes, his lawyer said thursday. The subject of pardoning manafort came as trump's former campaign chairman faced multiple charges of bank fraud and tax evasion in an alexandria criminal case, trump attorney rudolph w. Giuliani said in an interview. Trump's lawyers counseled the president against the idea of pardoning anyone linked to the investigation into russia's interference in the 2016 election, according to giuliani, saying trump should at least wait until special counsel robert s. Mueller iii has concluded his probe. Giuliani said the president agreed and did not push the issue further. \"he said yes, \" giuliani said. \"he agreed with us. \" giuliani said trump was seeking advice in the wake of a spate of pardons he granted earlier this summer, including for a woman whom kim kardashian had lobbied the white house to release. Giuliani said he and fellow personal attorney jay sekulow had advised waiting to see whether mueller delivers a damning report that accuses the president of trying to block a federal probe of his campaign's contacts with russians. White house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders told reporters wednesday that she \"wasn't aware \" of any discussions of trump pardoning manafort and that the topic was \"not something that's",
            "On wednesday, several aides dismissed the news about mr. Cohen as just another bad headline lacking the silver bullet that they say the special counsel would need to prove that the president conspired with russian officials. Mr. Trump spent the early hours of wednesday tweeting — he called the convicted mr. Manafort a \"brave man \" who, unlike mr. Cohen, \"refused to 'break ' \" or \"make up stories in order to get a 'deal. \" ' he also monitored headlines, as he did after his news conference with mr. Putin. In the interview with fox news, he asserted that money for the payments to the women had come not from his campaign, but from his own accounts. \"i don't know if you know, \" mr. Trump said during the interview, \"but i tweeted about the payments. But they didn't come out of the campaign. \" campaign finance laws still prohibit mr. Trump from making unreported payments related to the campaign, regardless of where they came from. Neither payment was disclosed to the federal election commission. On air force one on tuesday night on the way back from a rally in west virginia, mr. Trump repeatedly minimized the news, telling aides that the legal developments were not about him, but about mr. Manafort and mr. Cohen. He also groused over the optics of the rally,"

As nbc chicago explains, davis served his lengthy prison sentence after being convicted of the 1980 rape and murder of a young girl, but he was released in 2012 after dna evidence overturned the conviction. He had been a free man since — until this week, when he got arrested and charged with the kidnapping and murder of a 19-year-old, reports the sun-times. Police say the victim got into a fight with davis ' nephew during a house party, and the nephew shot him. According to prosecutors, witnesses say the victim was still alive when davis put the teen into his trunk and said he would find a place to dump the body, reports the chicago tribune. He told another witness the next day that he cut the victim's throat, say prosecutors. Both he and his nephew have been charged, and davis is once again behind bars awaiting trial.

        "summary": "Scientists have been concerned for some time about \" phantom menace \" -type superbugs that aren't fazed by meds. The latest cdc data finds that 2 million people a year in the us are infected with bacteria resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 die directly from those infections. And a new report from the cdc and the pew charitable trusts — the first research to quantify this issue, per the washington post — isn't encouraging. A study published tuesday in jama finds nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions ( around 47 million per year ) are given needlessly to people with viruses such as bronchitis and the common cold, as well as for ear and sinus infections and sore throats not caused by bacterial infections — meaning the rx not only won't vanquish their illness, but can potentially build up antibiotic resistance, the st. Louis post-dispatch reports. Besides the drug resistance, overuse can up the risk for drug allergies and even an unpleasant-sounding diarrhea that can be fatal. The researchers analyzed 184,032 outpatient visits to ers and medical clinics in 2010 and 2011 and found that 12.6 % walked out with an antibiotic script, per the pharmacy times. Out of an estimated annual antibiotic-prescription rate of 506 per every 1,000 people, only about 353 of those who received prescriptions should likely have received them. The times notes president obama's initiative to cut down on unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use by 50 % by 2020; researchers say that, based on this study, we ' ll need to slash overall antibiotic use by 15 % to meet that. \" if we continue down the road of inappropriate use we ' ll lose the most powerful tool we have to fight life-threatening infections, \" cdc director tom frieden says. \" losing these antibiotics would undermine our ability to treat patients with deadly infections [ and ] cancer, provide organ transplants, and save victims of burns and trauma. \" ( here's hoping teixobactin can help us out with superbugs. )",

About 50 to 100 marines and army personnel are now at the us embassy in baghdad, and some embassy staff have been moved to other consular offices in iraq and jordan, cnn reports. Meanwhile, us navy ships including the aircraft carrier uss george hw bush have arrived in the persian gulf, nbc news reports. And the wall street journal reports that the us is planning to begin direct talks with iran this week about ways of curbing sunni militants in iraq. In other news: the militants who seized much of western and northern iraq say they've recently executed 1,700 people, the new york times reports. No official confirmation yet, but the islamic state of iraq and syria posted gruesome images of massacre sites on twitter. Most victims are reportedly shiite iraqi soldiers, but sunnis affiliated with the government were among the dead. The grand ayatollah ali al-sistani revised the call to arms he issued friday, apparently concerned about a possible wave of sunni/shiite reprisal killings. He urged iraqis \" to exert the highest level of self-restraint during this tumultuous period. \" militants clashed with security forces near al-khalis, northeast of baghdad, and took over the town of tal afar, near the syrian border. Sunni residents in tal afar say shiite forces bombed their neighborhoods with mortar fire, reuters reports. Two bomb attacks today killed up to 21 people in central baghdad, one in a market full of volunteers assembled to join the fight against militants, the new york times reports.

        "summary": "It might be the strangest advice imaginable for survivors of a nuclear attack: don't use hair conditioner. But it turns out to be sound advice as well, reports live science. The matter came up when guam, under threat of an attack by north korea, recently issued safety guidelines to the public. And there among the usual seek-shelter nuggets was the warning that people should use soap and water to rid themselves of toxic dust but avoid the conditioner. It's all because of how the stuff works, and the upshot it that it could actually cause radioactive particles to bind to your hair. Hair is shaped almost like scales, which can open up and come apart throughout the day. Conditioner uses compounds like silicone and cationic polymers to pull these scales back down and smooth it, one cosmetic chemist tells racked. Conditioner is also oily, and any oily products like lotions or cosmetics are likely to encourage fallout to stick around. So there you have it: wash with soap and shampoo, but let your hair frizz out. Npr also took a look at those safety guidelines and highlights one that would come in handy should doomsday arrive: if you see a flash, get inside anywhere as fast as you can to reduce exposure to fallout, and remove your outer layer of clothing. ( dandruff shampoo could be harming our water. )",

Now researchers at harvard — who've combed through 22 years of data tracking 75,000 nurses in the us — write in the american journal of preventive medicine that rotating night shifts for five or more years results in higher mortality rates in women. Specifically, death from cardiovascular disease is as much as 23 % higher and death from lung cancer is as much as 25 % higher, reports fox news. \" these results add to prior evidence of a potentially detrimental relation of rotating night shift work and health and longevity, \" the lead researcher says. Rotating shift work is defined as working at least three nights a month in addition to working day and evening shifts. And while the researchers acknowledge that more study is needed to learn how a person's individual traits might play a role, people who work rotating night shifts for more than five years do experience an 11 % hike in risk of death from all causes, reports healthday news.

The study, published in the american journal of preventive medicine, found that women working rotating night shifts for five years or more appeared to have a modest increase in all-cause mortality and fatal cardiovascular disease. The study also found that women with 15 years or more of rotating night shift work appeared to have a modest increase in lung cancer mortality, according to a press release. The study focused on nearly 75,000 registered u.s. Nurses, and analyzed 22 years ' worth of follow-up data compiled by the nurses ' health study. Mortality from all causes appeared to be 11 percent higher for with six to 14 years of rotating night shift work, and death from cardiovascular disease appeared to be between 19 and 23 percent higher. While the researchers found no association between rotating shift work and any cancer mortality, they did find a 25 percent increase risk for lung cancer in those who worked a rotating night shift for 15 or more years, according to the news release. \"these results add to prior evidence of a potentially detrimental relation of rotating night shift work and health longevity, \" said eva schernhammer,",

The study defined rotating shift work as at least three nights spent working each month, in addition to days and evenings worked in the month. In the new study, researchers led by dr. Eva schernhammer of harvard medical school tracked 22 years of data from about 75,000 nurses across the united states. While the study couldn't prove cause-and-effect, it found that people who worked rotating night shifts for more than five years had an 11 percent increased risk of death from all causes. The risk of death from heart disease was 19 percent higher among those who worked such shifts for six to 14 years, and 23 percent higher for those who worked such shifts for 15 or more years, schernhammer's group found.

            "While working the night shift has been previously associated with higher risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer, a new study also links it to a higher risk in women for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, as well as lung cancer mortality. The study, published in the american journal of preventive medicine, found that women working rotating night shifts for five years or more appeared to have a modest increase in all-cause mortality and fatal cardiovascular disease. The study also found that women with 15 years or more of rotating night shift work appeared to have a modest increase in lung cancer mortality, according to a press release. The study focused on nearly 75,000 registered u.s. Nurses, and analyzed 22 years ' worth of follow-up data compiled by the nurses ' health study. Mortality from all causes appeared to be 11 percent higher for with six to 14 years of rotating night shift work, and death from cardiovascular disease appeared to be between 19 and 23 percent higher. While the researchers found no association between rotating shift work and any cancer mortality, they did find a 25 percent increase risk for lung cancer in those who worked a rotating night shift for 15 or more years, according to the news release. \"these results add to prior evidence of a potentially detrimental relation of rotating night shift work and health longevity, \" said eva schernhammer,",
            "Monday, jan. 5, 2015 ( healthday news ) -- working rotating night shifts may pose a threat to your health, a new study suggests. The study defined rotating shift work as at least three nights spent working each month, in addition to days and evenings worked in the month. In the new study, researchers led by dr. Eva schernhammer of harvard medical school tracked 22 years of data from about 75,000 nurses across the united states. While the study couldn't prove cause-and-effect, it found that people who worked rotating night shifts for more than five years had an 11 percent increased risk of death from all causes. The risk of death from heart disease was 19 percent higher among those who worked such shifts for six to 14 years, and 23 percent higher for those who worked such shifts for 15 or more years, schernhammer's group found. Nurses who worked rotating night shifts for 15 or more years also had a 25 percent higher risk of death from lung cancer, according to the study.
