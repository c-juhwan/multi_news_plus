In fact, the wearer's vision often continues to deteriorate as they age. Now, however, a team of scientists have developed special contact lenses that they claim can halt the condition if it's caught in childhood. Nearsightedness, more properly known as myopia, is a result of the eye becoming too long. This causes light from distant objects to be focused slightly in front of the retina, instead of right on it. The result is that things that are far away appear out of focus. Glasses and contact lenses bring those objects back into focus, by helping to once again focus light onto the retina. However, according to david troilo, a biomedical scientist at the state university of new york college of optometry, there's a trade-off. He claims that while corrective eyewear does indeed correct myopia by focusing light on the center of the retina, it actually causes a small amount of hyperopia ( farsightedness ) in the peripheral retina. As a nearsighted child grows, says troilo, their eye can actually lengthen even farther in an attempt to compensate for the peripheral hyperopia caused by their eyewear. This",

        "summary": "Last night's ugly, bungled execution of clayton lockett has many wondering about the future of the death penalty in america. By rushing to execute lockett with secretive, untested means, oklahoma \" elevated a convicted murderer to a status he surely did not deserve in life, \" writes andrew cohen at the atlantic. If anyone deserves execution, it was lockett, but now he's a symbol of the failures of the so-called \" machinery of death, \" and of \" feckless judicial review \" from, among other places, the us supreme court. \" we are going to lower the blinds temporarily, \" the warden said as things got ugly, in a line cohen thinks serves as \" an epitaph for this affair. Virtually this entire process was done in the dark, in secret. \" even if you don't feel bad for lockett, his execution violated our legal protections against cruel punishment. \" until those blinds are raised, until this process becomes transparent in oklahoma and everywhere else, it is unworthy of a nation that teaches its children about civilization and a rule of law. \" some other opinions: the worst part is that this was \" entirely predictable, \" writes james downie at the washington post, pointing out that oklahoma had a similar incident earlier this year; witnesses say the condemned man cried out, \" i feel my whole body burning, \" after his injection. That spooked oklahoma into switching to the cocktail used on lockett — but the last time it was used, in florida, the dosage was five times stronger. \" he's dead ain't he? job done, \" writes jeffrey kluger at time, to point out the fundamental absurdity of seeking neat, clean, \" safe \" executions. Plenty of executions have gone wrong even with the right drug cocktail. \" executions have never been — and never will be — foolproof, \" he writes. \" if we do decide to kill, we should not pretend we ' ll ever get it completely right. \" \" this may, in fact, be a turning point, \" writes allahpundit at hot air, because it might \" raise the political cost of executions to prohibitive levels. \" but don't expect the death penalty to go away entirely. \" too many people will read today about what lockett did to his victim and conclude that he got a much better end than she did. \" erick erickson makes much the same point at fox news, describing the grisly death of stephanie neiman, whom lockett and his accomplices beat, shot, and buried alive.

        "summary": "One long weekend. Sixty-four shootings. Six people dead. That was memorial day weekend in chicago, where the new york times sent in journalists to report on gun violence over three heart-breaking days. What they found: little gun control, gangs bent on retaliation, and police so distrusted that most homicides go unsolved in black and latino areas on the west and south sides. Even shooting victims won't cooperate, and parents express relief when their adult children end up behind bars — where life seems safer. \" somehow these streets suck my son in, \" says a woman whose 20-year-old son, a gang member, was shot three times over three years and is now in jail. \" his friends, they're dropping like flies. The boys, the girls, all of them. It's a never-ending cycle. \" weekend shootings stole one life after another — a teenage girl in a jeep, a forklift-operator at a gas station, a young man sitting in his car about to visit his mother — but police are unlikely to make much headway. Despite having identified 1,300 core offenders with data analytics, the chicago tribune reports, the cpd only made arrests in just over 25 % of roughly 470 city homicides in 2015. Meanwhile, efforts to ban handgun ownership in chicago and mandate tougher sentences for illegal gun ownership in illinois have fallen short. At herb harrington's barbershop, it's all fodder for conversation. \" you're talking about poverty and families broken up and people not having opportunity and losing their way, \" says harrington. \" violence is what we talk about in these chairs. We talk about it. We analyze it. But we don't have easy answers. \"",

And at last month's memorial, state corrections officials began returning them to the families. \" those pieces of clothing, they're not pristine, they're dirty, bloodstained, ripped, have bullet holes in them — it's not pretty stuff, \" says the daughter of the only guard killed by inmates. Some 2,000 items were found in a state police barracks in 2010, adds the democrat and chronicle; the state has since indexed them and identified their rightful owners. One guard who recalls inmates beating him until \" i passed out \" was handed his no. 13 badge, its back side still bloody. For some families, the relics offer a chance at closure. Some will hold on to the mementos, others will donate them to museums. But the daughter of one hostage, a guard who was fatally shot in the back by police gunfire that day, has plans for the ill-fitting uniform he was forced to wear: \" i want it destroyed, \" she says.",

Geneva robinson of oklahoma city pleaded guilty to five counts of felony child abuse. The assistant da says robinson's granddaughter spent months living in a \" house of horrors \" in 2014. Robinson would scratch the girl's neck, hit her with a rolling pin, cut her hair while she slept, whip her, burn her, use a dog leash to hang her from the ceiling by her arms, and imply she was going to eat her. She did all this while dressed up as a witch named nelda. A cellphone video shows nelda grabbing the girl while her crying siblings watch, kwtv reports. The girl begs nelda for mercy. Robinson's boyfriend, 33-year-old joshua granger, says nelda was meant to keep the children from misbehaving. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to one count of felony child abuse for dressing up as a demon named coogro and helping robinson. Robinson was arrested in 2014 after bringing the malnourished girl to the hospital. Robinson's own children had also reportedly been abused by the witch, but the victim's father says he didn't think robinson still did the \" nelda thing. \" the 7-year-old victim wrote a letter to robinson forgiving her and saying she was a great grandmother.",

The law requires companies to allow an \" opt out \" option, and prohibits them from misleading consumers with offers of supposedly \" free \" stuff. Though almost anyone with an email address probably applauds balsam's efforts, the foes he's faced in court often accuse him of exploiting anti-spam laws and abusing small claims court. He has also been sued for allegedly violating confidentiality agreements, but he says most companies who sue him are simply retaliating against his lawsuits.

Latinos played a big role in reelecting president obama, comprising 10 % of voters and backing him by 71 %. But if the republicans embrace that bloc by granting amnesty to more than 10 million illegal immigrants, then middle-class, conservative whites are going to freak, jonsson writes. The move would contradict decades of anti-immigration policy and fly in the face of working-class anger over perceived \" handouts \" to illegal immigrants. Nonetheless, conservatives like sean hannity and charles krauthammer are testing the waters by supporting the notion of amnesty with a secured border. For now, latinos remain suspicious of the gop's attitudes, writes jonsson — especially after conservative legislatures in the south and west waged such vocal battles against illegal immigrants.

Per china radio international, zhang and his helpers — cri says three men besides zhang were involved, while time speaks of \" two accomplices \" — took in $ 600,000 a month exporting drugs manufactured in an industrial park in wuhan, hubei province. The bbc notes the drugs were sold in the uk, the us, canada, and australia. Zhang apparently hit upon the idea to create a heisenberg-like drug factory in 2005 after visiting australia and discovering certain psychoactive drugs were hard to come by there. He apparently wanted to please his customers, custom-creating drugs based on their needs by experimenting with various chemical techniques, per cri. Workers were also trained to manufacture the drugs in bulk, and the drugs were said to be sent overseas via western union and via bitcoin transactions. The scheme fell apart in november 2015, when customs officers discovered parcels containing some of zhang's product; his lab was raided in june. Zhang and his workers tried to avoid charges by insisting they were creating the drugs for research purposes, not for consumption. No date has been announced for sentencing.

The spacecraft parts were originally thought to have been left on the moon during the apollo 11 mission, the new york daily news reports. Even the bag they were in is something special: a temporary stowage bag or \" mcdivitt purse, \" a container fitted with pins that attach to sockets on the lunar module that was used to temporarily keep items when there wasn't time to put them back in their permanent stowage locations, the smithsonian national air &amp; space museum explains in a blog post. There may even be lunar dust on the purse, says nasa in its own blog post. In the mission transcripts, after armstrong and buzz aldrin went back into lunar orbit in the lunar module and then rejoined the command module, armstrong is recorded as telling michael collins about the bag, revealing that he intended to save it all along. \" you know, that — that one's just a bunch of trash that we want to take back — lm parts, odds and ends, and it won't stay closed by itself. We ' ll have to figure something out for it, \" he said; the astronauts later further described the contents as \" 10 pounds of lm miscellaneous equipment. \" according to the daily news, the bag was thought to have been ditched along with their life support backpacks and lunar overshoes; the smithsonian acknowledges the contents of the bag \" were formally scheduled to be left behind. \" instead, they remained in armstrong's closet, and he apparently never discussed them with or showed them to anyone in 45 years.

The independent reports the study — published in the international journal of obesity in november — was partly funded by ilsi europe, an \" industry-backed research consortium \" that counts coca-cola and pepsico as members. Not only that, but the group directly paid some of the researchers. Consumerist has even more: one of the researchers is an ilsi europe employee; the study's lead author once got funding from a lobbying group called sugar nutrition, uk — formerly the british sugar bureau; and other members of the study's team are \" employees and shareholders of companies that manufacture products containing sugars and low-energy sweeteners. \" \" overall, the balance of evidence indicates that use of low-energy sweeteners in place of sugar, in children and adults, leads to reduced energy intake and body weight, and possibly also when compared with water, \" the study states. The independent reports the study was based on results from three out of 5,500 related papers. Two of the papers found no difference between water and diet soda for weight loss. The sole paper claiming you're actually more likely to lose weight drinking diet soda over water was funded by the american beverage association. It flies in the face of numerous other studies, and one expert calls it \" laughable, unscientific nonsense. \" \" if you want good science, you cannot allow corporate sponsorship of research, \" he says. ( it's not the first time coca-cola has been involved in a controversy like this. )",

Arthur johnson, 64, was sentenced to life in prison for a 1970 gang killing. He was placed in solitary confinement in 1979 after multiple escape attempts. In september, johnson sued the state of pennsylvania, claiming cruel and unusual punishment in violation of his constitutional rights. His lawyer argued that johnson hadn't had a disciplinary problem in a quarter of a century and that the mere possibility of an escape attempt isn't justification enough for indefinite solitary confinement. A federal judge agreed, saying johnson was subjected to \" institutional exile \" in an \" area smaller than the average horse stall. \" johnson returned to the general population at sci greene state prison last friday. The christian science monitor reports solitary confinement can increase the risk of suicide and the likelihood of recidivism. Johnson says nearly four decades in a 7-foot-by-12-foot cell left him with depression, anxiety, loss of short-term memory, insomnia, and more.",

Arthur johnson, a 64-year-old philadelphia man whose iq places him in the category \" educable mentally retarded, \" received a lifetime prison sentence for the 1970 murder of jerome wakefield, the philadelphia inquirer reported. The then 18-year-old man was taken into custody and, after several failed escape attempts, sent to solitary confinement in 1979.

The decision to move johnson from his isolated cell comes as both federal and state prisons across the nation re-examine their use of solitary punishment. Earlier this year, president obama signed several executive actions to curtail solitary in federal prisons, including a ban on placing juvenile offenders in such conditions and limits to how long adult offenders could be subjected to the punishment.

Though their home wasn't badly damaged, the man tells the bbc they won't soon return to it. \" we've heard all these rumors about more earthquakes and aftershocks. \" indeed, at least 42 aftershocks have hit since the disaster, including a magnitude 6.7 temblor, mashable reports. Roughly three dozen were above magnitude 4.5, npr reports. And larger ones could be on the way: there's a 7 % chance one of at least 7.0 magnitude will hit in may, per the usgs; in the subsequent year, there's a 99 % chance of at least a 5.0-magnitude aftershock and a 77 % chance of one magnitude 6 or larger. Further, \" felt earthquakes ( ie, those with m ≥3 or 4 ) will be common over the next weeks to months. \" the death toll has climbed to 4,356 — including 18 killed on mount everest — but it could \" go up to 10,000 because information from remote villages hit by the earthquake is yet to come in, \" nepal pm sushil koirala says, per the guardian. That would make the quake nepal's deadliest disaster in history. Some 8 million people were affected and about 8,000 were injured. Koirala says nepal is now \" on a war footing \" and completely overwhelmed with \" appeals for rescues coming in from everywhere. \" a government official tells the bbc the country is \" desperate for more foreign expertise to pull through this crisis \" and specifically requests \" special relief materials and medical teams. \" aid is pouring but deliveries have been slowed by congestion at kathmandu's sole airport.",

The announcement that joseph jakubowski is now in police custody first came via a tweet friday morning from the beloit police department that read, \" captured! awesome work to the men and women who worked this case, \" along with a picture of the suspect stamped with a giant red \" found. \" a press release explains the vernon county sheriff's office in southwestern wisconsin got wind thursday night of a \" suspicious person \" who was said to be camping on a farmer's land and wouldn't leave when asked. Officers converged on the readstown location and captured the man without any issues just before 6am friday; they then were able to id him as jakubowski. Jakubowski has been the target of a massive manhunt since april 4, when he's believed to have busted into a janesville weapons store and stolen 18 firearms, after which he allegedly set his car on fire. Authorities feared he might have been planning on carrying out a major violent act against a school or public officials. Per wisn, a letter supposedly written by jakubowski and received by an ace hardware store in sussex thursday also suggested there would be violence carried out against churches in sussex on easter sunday. A copy of the manifesto sent to trump, received by local station wtmj-tv and publicized in part on thursday, accused both religion and the government of brainwashing people and cited a wish by jakubowski to suffer a death on live tv \" carried out by the hands of the president, \" per the journal sentinel.",

Fernande grudet — more commonly known as madame claude — ran a high-class call-girl ring catering to the rich and famous in the 1960s and 1970s in paris. According to afp, her clients included the shah of iran, marlon brando, and moammar gadhafi. \" it was so exciting to hear a millionaire or a head of state ask, in a little boy's voice, for the one thing that only you could provide, \" the times quotes grudet as saying. The bbc notes grudet liked to muddle her personal history, claiming — almost certainly falsely — that she was raised in a convent. And the times notes it's unclear exactly how grudet built her call-girl empire. But at the height of her business, grudet employed more than 500 \" swans, \" afp reports. According to the times, grudet would recruit girls who were \" foreign, from the fringes of the film and fashion worlds, with a sprinkling of students looking for extra cash and housewives looking for adventure. \" one columnist says grudet sought out girls who couldn't quite make it as models and actresses, but that \" didn't mean they weren't beautiful, fabulous. \" her swans had to know literature and current events, and their sexual talents were tested. One night with a swan could cost a client $ 1,500 in today's dollars. But it wasn't all glamour. \" she was like a slave driver in the american south, \" an actress who played grudet once said. \" it was sexual indentured servitude. \" grudet had multiple stays in jail in the 1980s and 1990s.",

As far as extraterrestrial bodies go, saturn's largest moon is surprisingly like earth, with a dense atmosphere that could shield delicate earthlings from radiation, reports new scientist. Titan's candidacy as a settlement isn't new, but a fresh analysis shows the yellow moon has valuable energy sources that could power a settlement. Per science alert, amanda hendrix and yuk yung write that once propulsion issues of getting there are tackled, titan is the \" optimal location in the solar system for an off-earth human settlement. \" some 808 million miles away, self-sustainability on titan is key. Robots and even humans could one day make nuclear power by using radioactive decay there. The scientists say solar power could come from a us-sized solar farm, even though titan is nearly 10 times farther from the sun than earth is. Titan's strong winds could also be put to use, if humans learn to build strong-enough turbines. Powerful tides created by saturn's pull could be harnessed for hydropower, though little rain adds complications. Titan could even be a crash pad on the road to more-distant exploration; ample methane-laced lakes may be mined for rocket fuel. \" as a resource for long-term, solar-system-wide civilization, titan would be a pivotal place, \" a johns hopkins university researcher tells new scientist. Researchers concede, however, that there are many unknowns, including titan's geology. And, they say, earth's own technology will have to improve before it can be exported.

This undated handout photo provided by the national zoo shows a red panda that has gone missing from its enclosure at the zoo in washington. National zoo spokeswoman pamela baker-masson says animal keepers... ( associated press ) the male named rusty was captured in a tree near a home in adams morgan, a neighborhood known for its restaurants and vibrant nightlife, said national zoo spokeswoman pamela baker-masson. Senior curator brandie smith said animal keepers surrounded the area where he was found and called rusty's name to calm him before capturing him in a net. \" we just had to approach him carefully, \" she said. \" we are surprised by the distance he was able to cover. \" the animal was taken to the zoo's animal hospital for a checkup and will remain there for several days. How he escaped is still a mystery, though. Zoo officials began reviewing security footage monday morning to see if there is any evidence of how rusty escaped or whether he may have been taken by a human and then set loose. Curators have cut back any long tree limbs that may have aided the skilled climber with the escape. \" there is no obvious point that rusty could have gotten out of the enclosure, \" smith said, adding that it had held red pandas for years. \" we all know that young males like to test boundaries. \" unlike giant pandas, red pandas are not members of the bear family.

            "A twitter photo and phone tip from a resident helped animal keepers track down a red panda in a washington neighborhood monday after it went missing from the national zoo. This undated handout photo provided by the national zoo shows a red panda that has gone missing from its enclosure at the zoo in washington. National zoo spokeswoman pamela baker-masson says animal keepers... ( associated press ) the male named rusty was captured in a tree near a home in adams morgan, a neighborhood known for its restaurants and vibrant nightlife, said national zoo spokeswoman pamela baker-masson. Senior curator brandie smith said animal keepers surrounded the area where he was found and called rusty's name to calm him before capturing him in a net. \" we just had to approach him carefully, \" she said. \" we are surprised by the distance he was able to cover. \" the animal was taken to the zoo's animal hospital for a checkup and will remain there for several days. How he escaped is still a mystery, though. Zoo officials began reviewing security footage monday morning to see if there is any evidence of how rusty escaped or whether he may have been taken by a human and then set loose. Curators have cut back any long tree limbs that may have aided the skilled climber with the escape. \" there is no obvious point that rusty could have gotten out of the enclosure, \" smith said, adding that it had held red pandas for years. \" we all know that young males like to test boundaries. \" unlike giant pandas, red pandas are not members of the bear family.

The telegraph explains that rouge sucette is about 75 % wine; the rest consists of not exactly earthy-sounding ingredients like sugar and cola flavoring, plus water, for a total abv of about 9 %. The los angeles times points out that regular wine drinking is down overall among the french: about 17 % of adults drink wine daily; three decades ago, that number was closer to 50 %. But flavored-wine drinking appears to be on the rise, with 15 million bottles of concoctions like grapefruit-flavored rosé sold in 2012, and sales expected to rise to 30 million bottles this year.

The new york times reports that weiner is expected to plead guilty to one charge of transferring obscene material to a minor. The plea stems from an investigation of his 2016 text exchanges with a 15-year-old girl in north carolina. The washington post also expects a guilty plea. A judge will ultimately determine weiner's punishment: he could get no jail time at all or up to 10 years, and while the times says it's likely he ' ll have to register as a sex offender, that hasn't been decided yet.",

Authorities say they're looking for four to five people — some of whom likely have construction or bridge work experience — seen in security footage walking on the footpath of the bridge around 3am. Police believe they scaled the main cables leading to the towers, thereby avoiding locked gates. A city worker tells nbc new york that the feat likely took two hours.

Scientists tested 65 us wines and found all but one contained arsenic in levels that exceed the 10 parts per billion permitted in drinking water, according to a release. The samples from wines out of california, washington, new york, and oregon contained an average of 24 parts per billion, though some samples contained 76 parts; oregon's wines had the lowest levels, averaging 13 parts. Time to freak out? not necessarily. Even frequent drinkers would only get about 12 % of the recommended maximum daily arsenic intake from wine, lead author denise wilson says. But if you consume a lot of foods high in arsenic, like apple juice, rice, seafood, and cereal bars, \" you should be concerned, especially pregnant women, kids, and the elderly. \" wilson also reviewed arsenic levels in other items and found an adult female who eats a large amount of rice, for instance, would get 101 % of the maximum recommended daily dose of arsenic from that source alone. Pair that with a few glasses of wine and you might have a problem; too much arsenic can cause skin, lung, and bladder cancers and other diseases. Wilson says wineries should try to remove arsenic, but \" the whole idea that you would sue a winery for having arsenic in their wine is like suing someone for having rocks in their yard, \" she says. Instead, people should minimize health risks through diet or undergo tests that can detect high arsenic levels. A scary find for infants: wilson says those who consume large amounts of formula made with organic brown rice syrup could be getting 10 times the maximum daily dose of arsenic.

Their means were extremely cruel, their impact on society was extremely bad. \" as for the significance and implications of the sentence, the post notes that it shows \" the seriousness of president xi jinping's anti-graft campaign as well as the sometimes blurry line between crime and business among some of china's elite. \" bbc china editor carrie gracie adds that liu han reportedly has ties to former security chief zhou yongkang, and says the case could lead to charges against him. Should a trial come to pass, he would be the highest-ranking leader involved in a political corruption case since the communist party took power.",

            "Photo: matt winkelmeyer ( getty images ) for the past day or so, the film world has been freaking out over the motion picture academy's apparent inability to find someone — anyone — willing to host the 2019 academy awards. It was the sort of huge nightmare scenario that regularly devastates the film industry but is mostly meaningless to everyone else, especially since the impossible hunt for a suitable host has already come to an end. As it turns out, kevin hart is more than happy to host the academy awards, and he announced on instagram ( via variety ) that he's actually taking the gig. Advertisement he says hosting the oscars is something he's wanted to do for a long time, and he's \"blown away \" to have gotten the call. He also promised to make this year's ceremony a \"special one, \" but we're so jaded at this",
            "With the 91st academy awards less than three months away, producer donna gigliotti has yet to line up an emcee, but don't blame her — it's a gig that almost no one should want. Long forgotten in the kerfuffle that ended the 2017 oscars, when la la land's victory was snatched from its jaws and handed to moonlight, were jimmy kimmel's tossed-aside words: \" i don't know what happened. I blame myself for this. … i knew i would screw this show up, i really did. \" perhaps he was joking. Regardless, his comment opened a window on the thinking of one of the few oscar hosts in recent memory who's escaped relatively unscathed after his two turns at bat, revealing that even a seasoned late-night host was convinced the first experience would end in failure. Kimmel's fears were hardly unjustified. Take a look",

Tyson's tattoo artist is suing warner brothers on the grounds that the studio committed \" reckless copyright infringement \" when it allowed the well-known marking to appear on the face of ed helms ' character in the upcoming hangover sequel. The lawsuit, filed in st. Louis federal court, asks that wb not display the tattoo in the film and strike it from all marketing materials, the new york times reports. That would likely delay the movie's launch and cost wb lots of money. Legal experts say suits like these are likely to become common as more celebrities ink their bodies with designs that might lend themselves to imitation. Already, sports stars rasheed wallace and david beckham have endured disputes about drawing explicit attention to their tats in marketing campaigns. Wb contends it was entitled to use the tattoo under the \" fair use \" provision of us copyright law, citing the clause that permits use for parody.

The government has released data today on what 3,300 different hospitals charge for the 100 most common procedures. The results show massive variation, reports the washington post. One dc hospital charges $ 115,000 to put a patient on a ventilator, while another in the same city charges $ 53,000. Nationwide it's even crazier: $ 5,304 for a joint replacement at one hospital in oklahoma compared with $ 223,373 for one in california. Some hospitals cited in the data say their bills are higher because they're teaching hospitals or have a sicker and older patient base, the new york times reports. But a medicare official says the variation is still too large to fully account for the discrepancy. As time thoroughly exposed earlier this year, charges for different procedures are set by a hospital master list called a \" chargemaster, \" which are wildly inconsistent across different hospitals and often bear little resemblance to what medicare says are their true costs. \" if you're charging 10 % more or 20 % more than what it costs to deliver the service, that's an acceptable profit margin, \" says a hospital finance expert. \" charging 400 percent more than what it costs has no rational basis in it at all. \"",

Well, elderly people in mental decline are experiencing just that at a so-called village in the town of weesp, in holland, reports gizmodo. Called dementia village, it allows residents to go about their day-to-day lives, buying what groceries they want, getting their hair cut, going out for dinner, and so on. Of course caregivers help them, but they still avoid the dehumanization that many dementia patients endure in long-term medical care. A german alzheimer's center found that patients ' greatest risk was wandering off on their own — and even created a fake bus stop for it, the telegraph reports. So dementia village simply put up gates and security fences to keep patients around. This may sound like a typically progressive dutch idea, but with baby boomers getting older and alzheimer's increasing by 68 % since 2000, this idea could travel. And the village's administrator says other countries have shown an interest in it, the new york times reports. \" everyone is struggling with the same problem, \" she said. Of course, there are no shortage of theories on how to avoid dementia.",

        "summary": "Four people were killed and 64 injured in bangkok today when police tried to break up an anti-government protest around the prime minister's office, one of several buildings protesters have tried to shut down in their campaign of obstruction. Gunfire broke out as thousands of police clad in riot gear descended on the crowd, the new york times reports. A protester spokesperson said demonstrators were \" peaceful and unarmed, \" but a photojournalist tweeted that a protester was carrying an assault rifle, that protesters fired shots, and that they \" pushed us out of the area after the gunfire started, screaming ' no photo, no photo. ' \" the government also alleged that protesters had thrown a grenade and fired tear gas. At least one of those killed was a police officer; another was shot in the head and is in critical condition. Police arrested more than 140 people, but protesters later managed to free a movement leader they'd detained. Police were more successful in driving protesters away from the ministry of energy, where they arrested 100 people, the bbc reports. Earlier they'd attempted to negotiate with protesters, who they have until now hesitated to use force against. The clashes came as thailand's anti-corruption commission said it would file charges against the chief object of protesters'scorn, prime minister yingluck shinawatra, over a controversial rice subsidy. Cnn has an interesting piece on how the subsidy has divided thailand along regional class lines.",

In the longer term, some analysts say the us should consider declaring cyberattacks terrorist attacks — and consequently acts of war — which will open a wider range of responses.

The us \" is investigating attribution and will provide an update at the appropriate time, \" a national security council spokeswoman said yesterday. Security experts say there is a long forensic trail linking pro-north korea forces to the sony attack, and sony is believed to be investigating whether they had inside help. Obama administration officials are split on any potential us response, with some wanting to confront north korea directly and others fearing that would play into pyongyang's hands, insiders tell the new york times. The times separately points out that yesterday's cuba news could leave north korea as the sole country on america's cold war blacklist. Mitt romney has a suggestion for how sony should handle things, tweeting: \" @sonypictures don't cave, fight: release @theinterview free online globally.

The channel 4 show, dead famous dna, maintains that hair from eva braun's brush suggests she had jewish ancestry on her mother's side. One caveat is that producers were unable to get dna swabs from braun's living relatives to confirm that the hair belongs to her, reports the independent. But the circumstantial evidence is strong: it comes from a hairbrush taken from her apartment by a us army officer, and it was inside a cosmetics case monogrammed with her initials. In analyzing the hair, researchers found a dna sequence associated with ashkenazi jews that is passed from mother to daughter. The times of israel explains that many ashkenazi jews converted to catholicism in germany during the 19th century. Braun attended catholic school, and hitler had her background carefully vetted before pursuing a relationship with the woman 23 years his junior, notes the independent. The show suggests that neither she nor hitler would have known about her jewish roots. They were married in hitler's bunker on april 29, 1945, and committed suicide ahead of advancing soviet troops the next day.

Uloma curry-walker, 45, was convicted of aggravated murder, conspiracy, and other charges surrounding the 2013 death of firefighter william walker, with prosecutors painting her during the trial as having fallen into financial straits and approaching her 17-year-old daughter and daughter's boyfriend with a deadly plan: find someone to take out her husband, william walker, so she could collect his life insurance money, which cleveland.com notes was contained in a $ 100,000 policy. Curry-walker handed over a $ 1,000 down payment to her daughter's boyfriend, chad padgett, to find a hitman, which precipitated a chain of events leading to her husband's slaying. But what william walker's death didn't bring to his widow was the life insurance money, as he had never named his wife as the beneficiary after they married. Who did get the money: his ex-wife, who was still named as the beneficiary on the plan. Padgett, curry-walker's daughter, and two men who tried to kill william walker ( one of them was the successful hitman ) took plea deals in exchange for testimony against curry-walker, who had said in her initial confession that her husband had abused her. Her daughter, the only one involved who won't go to jail ( she ' ll spend a month in a juvenile detention center ), said during the trial her mother had informed her: \" no one would believe i would hire a bunch of kids to kill someone when i know people that could. \" sentencing is aug. 8.

        "summary": "A video of a polar bear petting a sled dog that went viral seemed heartwarming, but a new development casts the interaction in a different light. The dodo has updated its initial post on the incident, which took place near churchill in manitoba. The video was shot on property belonging to brian ladoon, who keeps sled dogs at his mile 5 dog sanctuary — and last week, a bear on the property killed one of ladoon's dogs, a manitoba sustainable development rep tells the cbc. That bear, as well as another bear and her cub, were removed by officials from the property by conservation workers, partly because they caught wind ladoon had been feeding the bears. It's not something he denies: the day the dog was killed \" was the only day we didn't feed the f --- ing bears, the only night we didn't put anything out, \" he tells the cbc. Per manitoba's endangered species and ecosystems act, humans aren't allowed to \" kill, injure, possess, disturb, or interfere with a member \" of an endangered or threatened species, meaning if ladoon — who says he takes paying visitors out to see the bears — keeps feeding or otherwise \" baiting \" them, he could face \" further enforcement action, \" a sustainable development rep tells the cbc. A university of alberta professor notes ladoon's actions aren't just dangerous for the dogs, who are \" totally vulnerable \" when they're chained up, but also for the bears: they could learn to link humans and dogs with food and poke around in communities, where they may get killed by locals. \" it's basically a death sentence for the bears, \" he says, calling dog-bear interaction \" unnatural. \" ladoon disagrees: \" no. It's a phenomenon. \" ( the world's \" saddest polar bear \" just got temporary new digs. )",

A study in biological psychiatry finds marijuana potency is on the rise. Researchers analyzed some 38,600 samples of illegal marijuana — including plant material, hashish, and hash oil — seized by the dea over the past 20 years, reports live science. Not only did samples of a really potent type of marijuana, known as sinsemilla, increase from 2010 to 2014, but researchers found the level of tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) in samples jumped from 4 % in 1995 to 12 % in 2014; an earlier study in colorado found some samples contained up to 30 % thc, the main psychoactive ingredient in weed. At the same time, the presence of cannabidiol ( cbd ) — which is believed to have possible health benefits — dropped so that the thc level grew from 14 times the amount of cbd in 1995-era marijuana to 80 times the amount in 2014. Lead author mahmoud elsohly — who helps supply high-quality marijuana to researchers through a program at ole miss, per the oxford eagle — says higher doses of thc bring a higher risk of negative health effects, including psychosis and panic attacks, while lower doses usually produce \" a pleasant feeling. \" but why is more potent pot hitting the market? elsohly explains marijuana users can develop a tolerance for thc so they need higher doses to get high.

The indictment states that on the night of dec. 26, the republican harmed his wife by \" beating her about the face, head, and body with a closed fist while in the presence of a minor, \" the aiken standard reports. Police say in the presence of his children, ages 8 and 2, corley also pointed a handgun at his wife, \" causing her to fear for her life, \" before threatening to kill himself. Authorities have released a 911 call from corley's wife in which children can be heard in the background screaming and pleading: \" just stop, daddy. Just stop. \" corley, who faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if he's convicted of domestic violence, was suspended from the house under state law, and lawmakers from both parties are urging him to step down permanently, the state reports. State senate majority leader shane massey says the reason his fellow republican needs to resign is obvious: \" it's not ok to beat your wife. \" corley has been charged with \" high and aggravated \" domestic violence, which \" is one step down from murder, \" massey said. \" the only thing worse you can do is kill someone. \" other state lawmakers say that if corley doesn't quit, they will take steps to expel him. Last year, corley voted to strengthen penalties for domestic violence and accused fellow lawmakers of lacking morals after they took down the confederate flag.",

A new study has found that what the new york times dubs one of men's \" familiar physical complaints of midlife \" — that ballooning waistline — is not, as long believed, due to dipping testosterone levels. While those levels do produce other \" complaints, \" such as dwindling muscle tone, the researchers found that estrogen is the hormone that causes body fat to accumulate, and it, in union with testosterone, affects sex drive. \" a lot of things we think are due to testosterone deficiency are actually related to the estrogen deficiency that accompanies it, \" the study's leader tells the ap. First, a one-sentence science lesson from the los angeles times: estrogen is actually converted from testosterone in both sexes ( males produce a form of estrogen called estradiol ). Researchers found that men have at least two times the amount of estrogen that postmenopausal women do; once testosterone drops from a youthful average of about 550 nanograms per deciliter of blood serum to the 300- to 350-nanogram range, estrogen drops to a point where weight is affected. It's a big realization, but not an actionable one just yet. And the ap notes that doctors don't typically prescribe estrogen to men, as high doses can cause things like enlarged breasts; the way to remedy low estrogen is to give them testosterone and let the body convert it.",

Bush and gerald ford ). The latest accusations of disrespect are now being hurled at kellyanne conway, who was photographed monday with her feet tucked under her legs while tapping on her phone on an oval office couch. \" twitter freaks, \" usa today declares, with some users suggesting their reaction was exacerbated by the setting: conway was surrounded by leaders of historically black colleges and universities who were meeting with the president. \" now, you can't expect us to take this ' meeting'seriously when this is the setting, \" tweeted black lives matter activist deray mckesson. As for what she was doing on her phone, the afp reports conway was reviewing a photo she had just snapped of the group. Gateway pundit suggests the couch position was selected so as to allow her to take picture without blocking the pool cameras ( a photo here illustrates that ), and it declares the whole thing \" yet another example of why the trump administration has such heartburn in dealing with the media \": president trump was meeting with some 60 black college leaders, and the media's gaze is solely on conway, it argues. Mother jones engagement editor ben dreyfuss was unperturbed by the picture, tweeting, \" she was taking a photo. This is the dumbest outrage ever. \"",

Few details were released about their capture, but the prosecutor's office in jalisco state says the couches were picked up when they couldn't prove they were in mexico legally, reports cbs news. Authorities there had been working with us officials on the case since saturday, reports ap. The couches — ethan appears to have dyed his hair black — have been handed over to immigration authorities for deportation to the us, specifically to tarrant county, texas. The pair disappeared weeks ago after a video surfaced that allegedly shows ethan couch at a party and in possible violation of his probation in the fatal drunk-driving case that featured his unusual but successful defense; such a violation could result in a 10-year sentence. The dallas morning news notes couch failed to check in with his probation officer on dec. 10. A ruling is pending on whether couch's case will be moved from juvenile to adult court when he turns 19 in april, though authorities already have warned that he might face \" big-boy jail. \" it remains unclear whether his mother, 48-year-old tonya couch, will face charges.",
