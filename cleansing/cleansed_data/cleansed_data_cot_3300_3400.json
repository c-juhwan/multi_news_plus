        "summary": "Artificial intelligence has come a long way in recent years, and algorithms with machine-learning applications are proving skillful at things like playing poker, lip-reading, and, unfortunately, being biased. Researchers at princeton proved the point in an experiment involving an algorithm known as glove, which has learned about 840 billion words from the internet, notes wired. For their study, the researchers adapted a word-pairing test used to gauge bias in humans to do the same for the glove system. The upshot? every single human bias they tested showed up, they report in the journal science. \" it was astonishing to see all the results that were embedded in these models, \" one researcher tells live science. They found examples of ageism, sexism, racism, and more — everything from associating men more closely with math and science and women with arts to seeing european-american names as more pleasant than african-american ones. \" we have learned something about how we are passing on prejudices that we didn't even know we were doing, \" says another researcher. Just as twitter users taught microsoft's chatbot tay to unleash neo-nazi rants on social media last year, so, too, does this oft-used algorithm learn from our own behaviors, regardless of whether they are good or bad.

In bosnia, landslides have buried houses, loosened land mines, and paralyzed large areas, reports abc. \" we are asking people not to panic if they see a shell lurking from the ground, \" says an official at a de-mining center. There are believed to be more than 200,000 land mines still buried in bosnia, and the floods have moved warning signs from some areas, the independent reports. In serbia, the flooding is the worst since records began 120 years ago and authorities fear the death toll will rise sharply when waters subside and more bodies are found. Thousands of volunteers gathered in belgrade to stack sandbags along the swollen sava river. \" what happened to us happens once in a thousand years, not hundred, but thousand, \" prime minister aleksandar vucic told reporters. \" we have managed to avoid the worst catastrophe thanks to good organization...

Adults in japan, canada, australia, finland and multiple other countries scored significantly higher than the united states in all three areas on the test. Beyond basic reading and math, respondents were tested on activities such as calculating mileage reimbursement due to a salesman, sorting email and comparing food expiration dates on grocery store tags.

        "summary": "Parents at their wits ' end over an unruly kid might take heart: the brat will probably grow up to earn more than his well-behaving peers, a new study in development psychology suggests. Researchers with the university of luxembourg, the university of illinois at urbana-champaign, and the free university of berlin tracked data on 745 people in luxembourg from the ages of 12 to 52 and discovered that those who defied authority as kids tended to have higher incomes as grownups, reports quartz. In scientist-speak: \" rule breaking and defiance of parental authority was the best non-cognitive predictor of higher income after accounting for iq, parental socio-economic status, and educational attainment, \" says the study, as quoted by the sydney morning herald. Quartz notes that \" occupational success \" was measured by the researchers using an index that ranks careers based on prestige and socioeconomic status. Researchers floated some theories on why their conclusion might be the case: defy-authority types might be more aggressive when negotiating salary or raises, and they might thrive on competition more than their peers. Also: they might be more willing to break the law or at least engage in iffy behavior to boost their income.

In 1968, after a pond in the park was dredged, a park ranger spotted a vast collection of what may have been tools and weapons, as well as remnants of marine life that doesn't live in the fresh water of the pond. Though the items were collected, the site was never excavated and the discoveries \" didn't get recorded as we would today, \" says archaeologist margo schwadron. So now, before the park replaces a section of boardwalk on anhinga trail, archaeologists are seeing what else they can find. To do so, they put an aluminum tube 10 feet underground, using it to suck up water and mud at 16-foot intervals along an 0.8-mile section of trail, cbs miami reports. They then pour the material over a screen and pick through it by hand, the ap reports. They started on friday, and hadn't found much of clear significance as of monday. The project is a challenge: \" we basically just have the ranger's old field notes that talk about this discovery and we don't know where the site was, other than what he drew on some sketch maps, \" schwadron notes, as wfsu reported last week. But if they find something, it could help researchers understand how people lived in the everglades, because \" there's no written record, \" schwadron says. And, as the park's chief of cultural resources points out, the site is \" unique in the sense that it's a submerged site. We don't have very many of those in florida and in this area at all. That is why it's special. \" ( in other national park archaeological finds, researchers discovered a pair of ancient villages in arizona. )",

The anhinga trail is located closer to the main entrance of everglades national park, where tourists flock each year. For centuries, the everglades has been home to a wide array of plants and animals, but it has also been home to humans. In the 1968, a dredging operation of anhinga slough revealed artifacts like bone tools that may have been used as hunting weapons.

            "Follow cbsmiami.com: facebook &#124; twitter homestead ( cbsmiami/ap ) – the replacement of an old wooden boardwalk has been put on hold as archaeologists poke and prod near a muddy pond located inside the everglades national park. The scientists are looking for evidence of a prehistoric culture. National park service archaeologists began work on friday along a 0.8-mile trail around a shallow pond amid sawgrass. On monday, the team started sampling sediment down about 10 feet to the bedrock every 5 meters along the boardwalk. They are using an aluminum tube to suck up mud and water, and dump the contents over a screen. The park service knows the pond has history and doesn't want cultural resources damaged during the construction of the boardwalk. In 1968 a park ranger noticed hundreds of artifacts in the pond after it was dredged because of a record drought. The ranger collected and cataloged the items, but",
            "Archeologists are heading to the everglades this week to look for the remnants of a native american settlement. The national park service is trying to find the location of a settlement discovered back in the late 1960's and then lost. The anhinga trail is located closer to the main entrance of everglades national park, where tourists flock each year. For centuries, the everglades has been home to a wide array of plants and animals, but it has also been home to humans. In the 1968, a dredging operation of anhinga slough revealed artifacts like bone tools that may have been used as hunting weapons. But margo schwadron with the national park services'southeast archeological center says both the site, and the artifacts, were eventually lost to time. \"the site didn't get recorded as we would today, \" schwadron says. \" we didn't have gps."

But the us government recently changed all that, removing a rule banning satellite images in which features smaller than 50 cm ( about 20 inches ) were visible, the bbc reports. The move comes thanks to an appeal from digital globe, a firm that already has the technology to show items as small as 12 inches, wired explains, allowing it to show \" key features such as manholes and mailboxes. \" digital globe intends to launch a new satellite in august, and says more satellites will be launched to take advantage of the change.

According to officials in kaohsiung, the six men, led by a senior member of the united bamboo triad gang, killed themselves at the end of a 14-hour standoff in which they took two guards hostage and seized four rifles and six handguns from the prison's weapons cache, the bbc reports. During the standoff, the inmates agreed to exchange the two hostages for the prison's warden and head guard, who had volunteered to take the places of the guards the inmates seized after faking illness yesterday. The men, who were all serving sentences of 25 years to life for crimes including murder, had demanded safe passage out of the prison and complained about issues including low prison wages. They also complained about the release last month of former president chen shui-bian after just six years of a 20-year sentence for corruption, the bbc reports. According to the diplomat, the only request authorities honored was one for two bottles of liquor, made when the men released their hostages just before dawn today. Officials say the men then turned the guns on themselves, with four killing themselves first and the remaining two firing bullets into their bodies before shooting themselves, reports the ap, which notes that authorities didn't offer any video or other proof of the suicides.",

        "summary": "Florida inmate latandra ellington was dead 10 days after she warned that a guard threatened to kill her, and family members say the state is to blame. They've filed a lawsuit alleging that the 36-year-old mother of four was beaten and didn't receive proper medical treatment before her death last september, courthouse news reports. The lawsuit accuses the department of corrections of failing to act on reports that officers at lowell correctional institution used excessive force and sexually and physically abused inmates at the country's second-largest women's prison. Ellington filed a complaint about officer patrick quercioli less than 24 hours before she was found dead in a confinement cell from what authorities say were natural causes, the miami herald reports. The lawsuit states that a private autopsy found that ellington — who had seven months left to serve on a 22-month sentence for grand theft — had \" toxic amounts \" of blood-pressure medication in her system and that her body showed signs of abuse, including excessive bruising, reports the herald, which notes that quercioli was never disciplined over the alleged threats and has now left the prison system. Courthouse news reports that state authorities closed their investigation into ellington's death after failing to find evidence of a beating. Her death was just one of a record 346 in florida's prisons last year, the herald notes. ( florida fired 32 guards last year after investigating a series of horrific inmate deaths. )",

        "summary": "Does the tiny-brained fruit fly experience emotions like fear? new research published in the journal current biology suggests that the insects at the very least enter a fear-like state, demonstrating all of the so-called emotion primitives associated with fear — including persistence ( the response continues after the threat has passed, such as a fearful human's heart continuing to beat rapidly even after he is no longer in danger ), context generalization ( the threat distracts you from whatever you were previously doing ), and scalability ( the greater the threat, the greater the response ). \" no one will argue with you if you claim that flies have four fundamental drives just as humans do: feeding, fighting, fleeing, and mating, \" the lead author says in a california institute of technology press release. \" taking the question a step further — whether flies that flee a stimulus are actually afraid of that stimulus — is much more difficult. \" to test this, the researchers gave hungry fruit flies access to food and then passed a shadow over that food repeatedly. The flies, in turn, jumped and flew away — jumping and flying faster when more shadows passed, and continuing to respond even after the last shadow passed. Still, these displays of context generalization, scalability, and persistence don't quite solve the riddle, one author tells the new york times: \" we can only know that by verbal report. So we can't scientifically study feelings in any creature but a human. \" still, he says in the press release, the research suggests \" that the flies'response to the threat is richer and more complicated than a robotic-like avoidance reflex. \" and if researchers can \" identify new molecular players involved in the control of emotion states, \" as another author puts it, researchers may be able to develop better treatments for humans who are suffering from nervous disorders, reports discovery.

Buzzfeed reports the internet has some thoughts on a story recently shared by actors ian somerhalder and nikki reed on a podcast called dr. Berlin's informed pregnancy. On the podcast, somerhalder admits that \" i kind of decided \" it was time for the couple to start a family. That decision apparently took the form of throwing away all of reed's birth-control pills during a vacation to spain. Reed, who recently gave birth to the couple's first child, says she wasn't sure at the time if she even wanted children. But somerhalder says he was anxious to start a family because he was 35 years old. \" it was just time, \" somerhalder says. \" unbeknownst to poor nikki, she didn't realize that i was going to go in her purse and take out her birth control. \" somerhalder says there's a six-minute video showing reed freaking out upon realizing her birth control is gone, jezebel reports. Reed describes somerhalder tossing her pills as \" presumptuous. \" twitter used other words. \" ian somerhalder is [ expletive ] disgusting, \" one user tweeted. \" ian somerhalder is a real piece of [ expletive ]. I ' ll never forgive compulsive heterosexuality for making me think i was ever attracted to him, \" tweets another.

Nonetheless, the man credited with discovering the element named for the dwarf planet pluto did manage to use the occasion to sneak a little levity onto the periodic table of elements, national geographic reports. Rather than choosing the obvious abbreviation of \" pl \" for plutonium, berkeley chemist glenn seaborg \" suggested pu, like the words a child would exclaim, ' pee-yoo! ' when smelling something bad, \" according to an account in los alamos science. Seaborg and his team discovered plutonium between 1940 and 1941, per live science, but the discovery was kept under wraps until wwii ended. Once it did, however, seaborg submitted the name, which a naming committee inexplicably accepted \" without a word, \" wrote two colleagues. Scientists have a reputation for being stuffy. But, as \" pu \" demonstrates, the quest for knowledge and the search for laughs are not mutually exclusive. Two more cases: on april 1, 1976, per the guardian, british astronomer patrick moore told television audiences that a \" unique astronomical event \" would occur at 9: 47am. The earth's gravity would be momentarily reduced, and anyone who jumped at that moment would experience a floating sensation. Plenty of people reportedly bought the april fool's day gag. Famed physicist richard feynman, while working to develop the atomic bomb at los alamos national laboratory in the 1940s, once discovered the combination to a colleague's filing cabinets, per real clear science. He left notes in the filing cabinet, resulting in his colleague fearing that the secrets of the atomic bomb had been compromised. ( this bonsai tree survived the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima. )",

But that is not its biggest problem right now. That honor goes to the dismissal of just one employee last week. In the middle of a meeting with patch employees, thousands of whom were listening in via conference call, ceo tim armstrong abruptly fired the site's creative director abel lenz in about 10 words, then without skipping a beat, continued on with his talk. A recording of the meeting was posted on romenesko ( and subsequently spread like wildfire online ), but here's the relevant part:... I ' m going to be very specific about this, is patch from an experience — abel, put that camera down right now! abel, you're fired. Out! [ momentary pause. ] if you guys think that aol has not been committed to patch... Now armstrong has had to apologize for the \" mistake, \" which he called an \" emotional response at the start of a difficult discussion. \" in a company memo, he took responsibility for \" acting too quickly, \" but defended his decision: \" internal meetings of a confidential nature should not be filmed or recorded so that our employees can feel free to discuss all topics openly, \" he wrote, per businessweek. \" abel had been told previously not to record a confidential meeting, and he repeated that behavior on friday, which drove my actions. \" according to business insider, lenz typically took photos of speakers during meetings to post on the company's internal blog. As tech crunch notes, nowhere does the memo say the dismissal itself was wrong, so lenz is probably still without a job.",

Gribeluk — who is divorced, also has three children, and sometimes goes by \" heidi morris, \" cops say — reportedly knew the supposed hit man. She and bernstein allegedly wanted him to kill susan bernstein, whom he's divorcing, as well as beat up two unitedhealthcare agents poking around bernstein's business on fraud suspicions. But the supposed hit man went to the cops instead, and they started their own probe, which included putting makeup on the insurance agents to make it appear they'd been assaulted. When the two saw the pictures of the \" injured \" agents, they paid their liaison ( who described them as lacking emotion ), the new york daily news reports. Bernstein and gribeluk are each being held on $ 600,000 bail on felony charges of conspiracy and solicitation. The plot was a \" despicable plan to take the life of a wife and mother, essentially for financial gain, \" the rockland county da tells the journal news.

The state's department of revenue announced in a conference call last night that it's no longer accepting returns filed using intuit's online program after two taxpayers called wednesday to complain they were alerted that returns had already been filed under their names when they logged in, cbs minnesota reports. When the department pored over already-submitted returns that had come through turbotax, officials found \" potentially fraudulent activity, \" which led to the shutdown. Tax professionals will still be permitted to file returns using intuit's professional-geared programs. \" we do not take this step lightly, \" the department said in last night's call. State officials are now scouring \" a couple of thousand \" other turbotax-submitted returns to see what else pops up. \" if we identify a problem, we will contact the taxpayer, \" the revenue commissioner tells the star tribune, adding that the department's systems had not been infiltrated and that the state has a \" robust fraudulent protection system in place. \" officials are working with intuit to see if there were security issues on its end. Minnesota isn't the only state reporting anomalies: the utah state tax commission issued a statement yesterday that its own internal examination has found 28 fraudulent returns submitted by third-party filers, and that 18 other states are experiencing something similar, the pioneer press reports.

            "Turbotax, the country's most popular do-it-yourself tax preparation software, halted the processing of state tax returns for about 24 hours because of a spike in fraudulent filings. State agencies have reported a rise in filings with stolen personal information, said intuit, the company behind turbotax. Minnesota revenue officials said thursday that they had stopped accepting online tax returns from turbotax after hearing evidence of potential fraud from minnesota taxpayers. Most victims found out that a fraudulent tax return was submitted in their name when they received a rejection notice after filing their returns, said intuit spokeswoman julie miller. There haven't been issues with federal returns to date because the irs has implemented stronger fraud detection policies, miller said. Intuit said it resumed filing of state returns about 6 p.m. Eastern time friday with increased fraud protections, a day after it halted them. A minnesota resident who contacted the pioneer press on friday said she ran into problems filing her federal return. Several hours after she filed her turbotax return online, she received an error message from turbotax saying the irs had rejected it.

            "Turbotax, the country's most popular do-it-yourself tax preparation software, halted the processing of state tax returns for about 24 hours because of a spike in fraudulent filings. State agencies have reported a rise in filings with stolen personal information, said intuit, the company behind turbotax. Minnesota revenue officials said thursday that they had stopped accepting online tax returns from turbotax after hearing evidence of potential fraud from minnesota taxpayers. Most victims found out that a fraudulent tax return was submitted in their name when they received a rejection notice after filing their returns, said intuit spokeswoman julie miller. There haven't been issues with federal returns to date because the irs has implemented stronger fraud detection policies, miller said. Intuit said it resumed filing of state returns about 6 p.m. Eastern time friday with increased fraud protections, a day after it halted them. A minnesota resident who contacted the pioneer press on friday said she ran into problems filing her federal return. Several hours after she filed her turbotax return online, she received an error message from turbotax saying the irs had rejected it. The woman said she called the irs and spoke to a man who asked for detailed information, including her husband's social security number and birth date.

The new york times speculates that it might have also been a retirement party of sorts for baldwin's character, noting that he said in an interview this week that while \" i'd love to keep doing this, i have other things i ' m going to do, so i guess we ' ll figure it out. \" instead of hillary clinton, mckinnon this time appeared as kellyanne conway, while scarlett johansson returned as ivanka trump.

While avoiding gluten isn't harmful in and of itself, \" there is no evidence that avoidance of gluten by healthy individuals will result in weight loss or that gluten promotes weight gain, \" per the study. If you've become a coconut oil addict, well, sorry: \" current claims of documented health benefits of the [ coconut and palm ] oils are unsubstantiated and use of these oils should be discouraged. \" and finally, they write that fruits and veggies, and especially berries, are the healthiest source of antioxidants, but there is no compelling evidence that antioxidant supplements are helpful.

Neither has any known links to terror groups.

Further details and developments: investigators believe mohammadi was planning to seek asylum in germany, where his mother contacted authorities after he failed to arrive in frankfurt. A source tells the bbc that the other passenger may also have been planning to settle in europe. Both left qatar using their iranian passports, then switched to the stolen passports to board the malaysia airlines flight. But malaysian police haven't ruled anything out, and say they are focusing on four areas: hijacking, sabotage, psychological problems among passengers and crew, and personal problems among passengers and crew, reports the guardian. \" other than mechanical problems, these are the main areas of concern, \" a police spokesman says. Asked what he meant by personal problems, he gave the example of passengers with unusually large life insurance policies. The search — now involving at least 40 ships and 34 aircraft from nine countries — has been expanded to the sea on both sides of the malaysian peninsula, though malaysia airlines has retracted an earlier statement saying the western side is now the main focus, the ap reports. A spokesman for the vietnamese military says a search is also taking place on land in case the plane crashed into mountains or jungle.",

        "summary": "A gift fit for a king? saudi arabia's king salman is visiting cairo, and egypt has agreed to hand two small but strategic islands over to his country, the new york times reports. The country's cabinet announced on saturday that it had agreed to give up control of sanafir and tiran, two largely uninhabited islands at the mouth of the gulf of aqaba. Tiran, the larger of the two, is roughly the size of manhattan. Saudi arabia gave the islands to egypt in 1950 amid fears that israel might seize them, but while egyptian officials claim the territory is simply being returned, the announcement caused a public outcry in egypt and at least five people were arrested during a demonstration in cairo, the ap reports. The deal still needs to be approved by egypt's parliament. Authorities say it follows 11 rounds of negotiation since 2010, reports the wall street journal. Critics, however, say it looks as if egypt is selling its land to the wealthier country, especially since salman announced a new $ 16 billion investment fund during a speech to egyptian lawmakers. Al jazeera reports that the king's visit also yielded an agreement to build a bridge over the sea to connect the two countries. It's not clear where it will be built, though it would involve tiran island if it's built where the countries are closest. Egyptian president abdel fattah el-sisi has already suggested a name: the \" king salman bridge. \"",

        "summary": "The morning after 16-year-old gynnya mcmillen was brought to the lincoln village juvenile detention center in louisville, ky., she was found alone in her cell, dead. It's been almost two weeks, but neither local nor state officials are going public with any information regarding how she died, reports cbs news. Not only is it unclear why she had no roommate in the cell or how often she was checked on, the teenager was apparently healthy, with the hardin county coroner saying there were no physical signs of foul play and expressing doubts that she had a heart condition. \" it's a complete mystery right now, \" says dr. William lee, who notes it could take weeks to get toxicology results. The last person to die in custody at a department of juvenile justice facility was in 1999, the year of gynnya's birth. What we do know, according to the kentucky center for investigative reporting, is that gynnya was taken into custody just before 2am on jan. 10 following an alleged altercation in a private residence. A police department rep calls gynnya the \" perpetrator \"; minor injuries were observed on the victim, and gynnya was charged with misdemeanor assault. She was found dead jan. 11. Her sister has started a facebook page calling for justice, and more than 20 people have contributed to a gofundme campaign to \" not only bring gynnya's case to justice but to also raise awareness of the things that go on in these facilities. \" the new york daily news, meanwhile, spoke to an unnamed former employee of the detention center who said that juveniles kept in holding cells are to be checked at 15-minute intervals, though it's unclear if that's the type of cell gynnya was in. ( a report last year slammed the juvenile justice system for failing our girls. )",

And what we've long considered the planet's deepest — the 663-foot dean's blue hole in the bahamas — has been relegated to second place, say chinese researchers. They announced friday that 11 months of study have confirmed that an underwater sinkhole in the south china sea crushes that record. At 987 feet, it could nearly swallow the eiffel tower, reports the washington post. Known colloquially as \" dragon hole \" and the \" eye \" of the south china sea, the depth was confirmed using a videoray pro 4 underwater robot equipped with a depth sensor, reports xinhua. The researchers further found that oxygen exists only in the top third of the blue hole, and they identified more than 20 fish and marine species in that top layer. The local government has drafted measures related to the protection and study of the hole. In its report on the discovery, kyodo notes that when it's humans, not robots, exploring these blue holes, the situation is \" extremely dangerous. \" on nov. 17, 2013, a 32-year-old free-diver from brooklyn drowned at dean's blue hole. The economist ranks free-diving — relying on a single breath to dive as deep as you can — as second only to base-jumping in terms of its danger level. \" diving at extreme depths brutalizes the lungs, which at a depth of [ 100 feet ] compress to a quarter of their normal size. \" ( this blue hole in belize may hold the secret to the mayan collapse. )",

Turkey is hoping that selling the property to a responsible owner will help protect it from theft and decay. Locals hope that greece's culture and tourism ministry will step in and rescue the parcel.

No official word why bryan t. Norwood resigned, but sources tell the times-dispatch he has a rocky relationship with the mayor and has been looking for a new job for a year or longer. But norwood has gotten quite a bit of bad press lately, what with the brown case, and sources tell tmz the scandal \" accelerated \" his leaving. Tmz also reports that norwood was very involved in brown's case, certifying his community service hours and getting his case out of the hands of the probation department and under norwood's authority instead. Richmond's mayor wouldn't say whether the brown fiasco had anything to do with norwood's leaving, however, saying only, \" we're waiting for the results of that investigation. \" norwood was hired as chief of police in late 2008.

But iran has said it's not interested in renegotiating the deal, and european leaders say they don't want to change the terms of the deal. Germany, france, britain, russia, china, iran, and even the us all agree iran has held up its side of the nuclear deal. And on tuesday defense secretary james mattis said he believes it's \" in our national security interest \" to remain in the deal. But trump campaigned on the nuclear deal being unfair to the us. The president is said to be weary of a tenet of the deal wherein he must go to congress every 90 days to report whether iran is complying with it and if it remains in the national interest of the us.",

In an exclusive interview with the today show on monday, brittany diggs, 25, said the faint light of her insulin pump helped her find the emergency release lever in her trunk. ( since september 2001, all new cars must have such a lever there. ) diggs waited until the gunman who abducted her last tuesday was pulling out of the gas station before she yanked the latch and leapt from the vehicle. She described what was going through her mind, knowing she had just seconds to act. \" i ' m holding the latch like this, waiting for him to get back in the car.... He's yelling, and i feel the car reversing, and he's pulling out pretty fast, so i ' m, like, ' oh shoot, i better get out of here. ' \" diggs says the abductor grabbed her outside her apartment and, after learning she didn't have money on her, asked to look in her trunk. She showed him it was empty; diggs says he made her get in, then drove her around trying to use her atm card. He was allegedly attempting to use it at the gas station before her escape. He's still at large and has personal details about diggs, including her wallet and phone. Worried about her safety, she plans to move. \" i try to put it in the back of my head so i can just...

While it can be hard for me to remember filming doubtfire, i've been flooded with memories in the past few days. It's humbling to know i am one of the few people who was there for these moments, that he's no longer around to share them. He was a creator as much as a performer. After one of my friends posted robin's \"impression of a hot dog \" on facebook, i realized she had no idea that wasn't in the script. It was supposed to be a monologue where he listed every voice he could do, but he decided to take the ones he'd been given, add more of his own, and just riff for a while. Chris columbus, our director, would let robin perform one or two takes with what was written, then do as many more takes as robin had variations.

        "summary": "President trump on wednesday followed up on his \" all options are on the table \" warning to north korea by suggesting that negotiations are not one of those options. \" the u.s. Has been talking to north korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years, \" he tweeted. \" talking is not the answer! \" it's not clear what trump means by \" extortion money, \" notes the new york times. The new warning follows the north's decision to fire a ballistic missile over japan for the first time, and an analysis at 38 north sees a potentially \" ominous \" clue in the test results: the missile flew a relatively short distance of about 1,700 miles. It's possible engineers deliberately shut down the engine early, but the distance ( and reports of the missile breaking into three pieces ) suggests a more troubling possibility: pyongyang is testing something called a \" post-boost vehicle \" on the missile. Pbvs are standard on us and russian icbms, explains michael elleman, because they not only provide an added boost for the payload ( some kind of warhead ), they also provide for more accuracy. If the north had tested the missile with a pbv, and the test failed, the distance traveled would make sense. If that's the case, \" it is another sign that pyongyang is deadly serious about developing and fielding nuclear-tipped missiles capable of striking the us mainland, and critical us military bases in the pacific ocean, \" writes elleman, who thinks north korea is a year or two away from posing a credible threat to the us. Meanwhile, the navy shot down a medium-range ballistic missile during a test off hawaii, reports nbc news. \" we will continue developing ballistic missile defense technologies to stay ahead of the threat as it evolves, \" says a pentagon official.",

Why fly over japan? the test launch had two primary objectives. First, kim jong un likely sought to take measure of the international community's response to the overflight of japanese territory. Though north korea twice before attempted to launch a satellite using a flight path that passed over japan, the hwasong-12 is the first ballistic missile to overfly the island nation. If the us response to the test firing is judged to be mild by pyongyang, north korea may feel that future flights will be similarly accepted by washington and its regional allies. Second, the flight was likely intended to evaluate the missile's performance and reliability under operational conditions. Before the hwasong-12 and the intercontinental range hwasong-14 can be deployed, engineers must demonstrate that they work reliably when flown to maximum range.

        "summary": "Top athletes will go to extremes to get a competitive edge, but a bbc look at paralympians shows just how painful, and illegal, those extremes can be. It delves into \" boosting, \" a practice in which these athletes, who have a physical disability, increase performance by upping their blood pressure. And the ways they go about doing so sound downright awful: breaking their own toes, twisting their scrotum, sitting on something sharp, delivering electric shocks to the legs, or closing a catheter to overfill the bladder. One scientist involved in monitoring the paralympic games ' athletes estimates that a third of competitors with spinal injuries have boosted. Raising blood pressure boosts the amount of oxygen directed to one's muscles, explains the bbc, which prolongs endurance. It's a process that typically happens naturally as we work harder — but those with spinal cord injuries are often the exception and don't see an automatic blood pressure rise. But that's not the only thing boosting can rise: the chance of having a heart attack or stroke increase as well. The paralympic games run from wednesday through sept. 9.",

The new charges against james holmes emerged as part of efforts to convince a judge to allow the prosecution access to 100 pages of education records subpoenaed from the school where he had been a neuroscience doctoral candidate. The university turned over the documents last week, but holmes ' lawyers moved to keep them sealed. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 others in the july 20 shooting during a midnight showing of the latest batman movie. He has not issued a plea in the case and remains held without bail. Chief deputy district attorney karen pearson did not elaborate on the nature of the threats during the hearing, nor did she disclose where the information came from.

Defense lawyer daniel king objected to the release of the records, calling the prosecution's request a \" fishing expedition that needs to be stopped. \" the university didn't immediately have a comment on the prosecution's claims.

Also in june, the same month that professors told holmes that perhaps he wasn't cut out for a career in neuroscience, he quietly stockpiled explosives. Holmes also made threats in june that prompted cu officials to contact police. That confluence of events was laid out thursday in an arapahoe county courtroom by the lead prosecutor in the case against holmes, the suspect in the aurora theater massacre. In the court hearing, which centered on access to education records related to holmes, prosecutors from the county district attorney's office sought to draw a straight, bold line between holmes ' purported academic failings at cu and the events of july 20, when authorities allege holmes walked into an aurora movie theater and killed 12 and injured 58 others in one of the worst mass shootings in american history. Thursday's details marked the most extensive explanation authorities have offered to date as to the motive behind the shooting. And it means prosecutors and holmes'defense team — which disputed the details of the prosecution's account — have now staked out opposing narratives for what allegedly led holmes to the movie theater for a midnight screening of \"the dark knight rises."

Also in june, the same month that professors told holmes that perhaps he wasn't cut out for a career in neuroscience, he quietly stockpiled explosives. Holmes also made threats in june that prompted cu officials to contact police. That confluence of events was laid out thursday in an arapahoe county courtroom by the lead prosecutor in the case against holmes, the suspect in the aurora theater massacre. In the court hearing, which centered on access to education records related to holmes, prosecutors from the county district attorney's office sought to draw a straight, bold line between holmes ' purported academic failings at cu and the events of july 20, when authorities allege holmes walked into an aurora movie theater and killed 12 and injured 58 others in one of the worst mass shootings in american history. Thursday's details marked the most extensive explanation authorities have offered to date as to the motive behind the shooting. And it means prosecutors and holmes'defense team — which disputed the details of the prosecution's account — have now staked out opposing narratives for what allegedly led holmes to the movie theater for a midnight screening of \"the dark knight rises."

Mnuchin's wife of two months, the scottish actress louise linton, accompanied her husband on the trip, and posted a glam instagram photo ( her account is now private, but you can see a screenshot of the post here ) of her deplaning from a military jet that includes a slew of tags for the luxury items she was apparently wearing. Among them: those valentino pumps, #rolandmouret pants, #tomford sunnies, and #hermesscarf. It spurred what huffpost is calling her \" let them eat cake moment, \" after an instagram user's take on the photo didn't sit well with linton. A woman the new york times identifies as oregon mother-of-three jenni miller had this to say: \" glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable. \" a portion of linton's lengthy reply: \" @jennimiller29 cute!.... Aw!! did you think this was a personal trip?! adorable! do you think the us govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? either as an individual earner in taxes or in self sacrifice to your country? i ' m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day'trip'than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you'd be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours. You're adorably out of touch. Thanks for the passive aggressive nasty comment. Your kids look very cute. Your life looks cute. \" the washington post notes that linton has \" raised eyebrows \" in the white house for tagging along with her husband in a way atypical of spouses. A treasury department rep says the couple paid for linton's portion of the travel, and that linton didn't get anything from the fashion brands she endorsed.

At issue are the topless images that police say the student sent to leiva at his urging, according to courthouse news service. In texas, the age of consent is 17.

A state district judge on tuesday signed an order barring leiva from contacting the girl. But his attorney tells the chronicle that he would seek to have that reversed. \" she's indicated to me that she wants to continue to have contact with him, \" the attorney says. The relationship was discovered when the teen's mother found images of her daughter kissing an older man on a cellphone, according to charging documents. A school district police officer says the teen told him she began dating leiva in 2015 and confirmed sexual contact between the two. Leiva reportedly claimed to be the girl's \" mentor/teacher/friend/listener. \" phone records show that the couple had lewd text conversations. ( in one, leiva, who called himself batman and his penis robin, writes, \" i want to poke you with my robin. \" ) also, at least three pictures on leiva's phone depict the teen in various states of undress.

Behind the basement door, staff found what appears to be the private fire service of the factory's former tenant, the co-operative wholesale society, unused since the 1960s at least. \"we came across all of these fascinating finds. There's a set of seven or eight uniforms, \" nuttall marketing manager anna bamford tells fox news. \"there's a lot of hoses... There's even an old gas mask. \" there's also a pump that appears to be from the 1930s and a half-empty bottle of pepsi. The names of firefighters are still chalked above their hanging uniforms, the express &amp; star reports. Everything's covered in dust.

Scientists who studied mount etna on the italian island of sicily say it is sliding just over half an inch annually thanks to weak sediment and a modest slope of 1-to-3 degrees. Moving east-south-east, etna should reach the coastal town of giarre nine miles away in just over a million years. Of greater concern: etna could endure catastrophic failure on her lead flank, as experts have seen in extinct volcanoes that went adrift. \" i would say there is currently no cause for alarm, but it is something we need to keep an eye on, especially to see if there is an acceleration in this motion, \" says lead author john murray. \" around one million people live on etna and its immediate surroundings, so the destruction of property and loss of life could be catastrophic, \" says murray, per the telegraph. \" clearly even the mention of such a dangerous event would be very unnerving for the people who live on etna, so i am anxious that they don't get the wrong impression. \" murray suggests measuring etna's slide in 10 years to see if it has doubled — which \" would be a warning, \" he notes. His team's 11-year study marks the first time experts have seen an entire active volcano sliding on its base. Standing nearly 11,000 feet high between the cities of catania and messina, etna spewed lava three times over just three weeks last march, the sun reports.

Per the bridgewater courier news, the old bridge, new jersey, man's holiday display contains 300,000 lights, synchronized music, and starts going up in october. The scene can draw as many as 1,000 people a night from as far away as new york and pennsylvania. Neighbors aren't fans of those crowds: they say the 24-foot-wide road becomes clogged with parked cars on both sides and pedestrians in the middle, which critics call a dangerous situation. Nj.com reports that in years past, an auxiliary police group would man the scene free of charge. The town now says that's not enough: mayor owen henry says apruzzi needs to fork over $ 2,000 per night to pay for police officers, moveable light posts, and fuel. Apruzzi says those lights are going up dec. 1 come hell or high water. \" we're not gonna listen to what the police have to say, \" he said. \" it is my first amendment rights, it has to do with my religion. \" ( he's catholic. ) a gofundme campaign has been started on his behalf and seeks $ 75,000 to cover the town's fees, but apruzzi says that the amount raised won't affect his plans ( and at $ 1,600 raised as of this writing, he has a ways to go ). Chief of police william volkert says he ' ll have cops present even if apruzzi doesn't foot the bill, and the mayor insisted wednesday that he isn't planning to shut the light show down if apruzzi doesn't pay. But things have gotten a little crazy: one of apruzzi's windows was shot with a bb gun, and he has pondered moving to a \" christmas-light friendly \" town. The gofundme page notes the display is a 15-year tradition in the town: \" residents will tell you that they were brought to the apruzzi house as kids and now bring their own kids to witness the amazing display. \" ( a zombie nativity has also caused drama. )",

It might have been as good a deal for the anonymous buyer as it was for the seller. A diamond expert says the new owner — who is not a private collector but purchased the diamond for \" international trade within the industry, \" per cnn — is \" likely to re-cut it into a modern diamond that will emit even more sparkle and potentially be worth a multiple of today's price. \" the expert adds the cushion-cut \" tenner \" diamond, which originally came in a dirtied, 19th-century mount, was probably owned by royalty or someone of prodigious wealth because there were few diamonds available in that period. The seller had worn the ring almost daily for three decades before deciding to get it appraised within the last few months, says sotheby's. Also sold at the auction was a cartier diamond brooch worn by margaret thatcher, including on the day she gave her resignation to the queen, reports the telegraph. It fetched $ 105,000, more than double the estimate. A sotheby's rep attributed the \" strong bidding competition \" to \" so much interest and attention \" in the two items.
