But iqbal tells the guardian that the family had actually oked the marriage, and only changed their mind later, over money. Iqbal says the two had a nearly two-year engagement, and that he agreed to pay about $ 840 to marry parveen, but that her father then asked for an additional $ 1,000. \" they got into trouble with their house expenses and they demanded more money. Because i have more land than them, they think i am rich, \" he says instead of paying more, the couple chose to have a \" court marriage. \" her father then accused iqbal of kidnapping his daughter, which led to parveen's fateful visit to the courts on tuesday to issue a statement in the matter; she was attacked by waiting relatives. The woman's father has confessed to the killing and police are still searching for others involved in the lahore attack, which iqbal says involved two of her brothers and other family members. The ap reports he has buried his wife in his home village in a ceremony held at 2am because of the gruesome state of her remains.",

            "The village voice obtained a copy of mtv's standard contract for the real world, a 30-page document that essentially requires cast members to sign their lives away, quite literally — the first stipulation being the understanding that participating in this reality show could cause death, loss of limbs, or mental illness. Hundreds of cast members have agreed to these terms in the past 25 seasons of the show. While some of the terms in the contract may seem outlandish, they're there for good reason. Because one time a guy did almost die. In 2010, during the d.c. Season, cast member andrew woods was pushed off a two-story balcony by one of his drunk roommates, landing on a concrete slab.

The music-turned-reality-television network came blaring onto boob tubes across the nation on august 1, 1981 and, like it or not, the entertainment industry was changed forever. Thanks to mtv bands have been born, unnecessary awards shows have been held, and reality tv really got its start. It changed the entertainment landscape -- while also bringing us speidi and snooki. But in-between boy band reunions, starlet meltdowns and video countdowns, the network helped launch the careers of many former \"real world \" -ers, vjs and \"reality \" stars.

Miramonte is not malibu. It's a perfect recipe for a predator. \" indeed, a former teacher's aide from the school was imprisoned in 2004 for sexually abusing three kindergartners.

But that's exactly what a 2013 letter from the fda to pennsylvania's castle cheese inc. Stated, per buzzfeed — and an investigation by bloomberg shows that's just the edge of the cheese wheel. After the fda discovered that castle was cramming its parmesan cheese with lower-quality substitutes ( e.g., swiss, mozzarella, white cheddar ) and cellulose ( a filler made out of wood pulp that's legal in small amounts ), then distributing it to grocery chains nationwide, bloomberg decided to pick up some store-bought grated cheese and have it tested by an independent lab. And the results showed many supermarkets ' parmesan cheese suffered from the same issue. Although a food technologist for the wisconsin center for dairy research says cellulose is permitted as a cheese filler as long as it doesn't exceed 4 % of the final product, a walmart grated parm came in at 7.8 % cellulose, while a jewel-osco version registered at 8.8 %. And a whole foods brand whose label didn't indicate any cellulose tested at 0.3 %. Bloomberg also obtained the fda's castle report through an foia request and found \" no parmesan cheese was used to manufacture \" either a target market pantry brand or two versions sold by associated wholesale grocers — which appeared confusing to target, as a rep told bloomberg that castle has never been one of its vendors ( they're looking into it ). But why are the cheesemakers doing this? money, it appears. \" the bad guys win and the rule-followers lose, \" the executive vp of cheese merchants of america says, adding that competitors with subpar products often underbid him by up to 30 %.

Some background: grant had a chance run-in with paul mcmullen last year, and mcmullen told grant he'd been hacked. A few months later, grant met with mcmullen again and turned the tables: this time, he secretly bugged the former editor, and they talked all about the hacking operation. Grant wrote about the entire experience in the new statesman. Yesterday's interview started out relatively mildly, with grant recounting his experience and what he'd learned from mcmullen. But then mcmullen got personal, noting his belief that almost anyone would be willing to trade places with a celebrity like grant, even if it meant putting up with getting hacked. But grant pointed out that celebrities weren't the only ones who were hacked, and left mcmullen with this: \" you guys had no morals, no scruples at all, you didn't care who got hurt as long as you were able to sell your newspaper.... You're not journalists, you have no interest in journalism, it's just money, money, money.... You should try real journalism. Because you're not an idiot. You could probably do it. \"",

            "When i broke down in my midlife crisis car in remotest kent just before christmas, a battered white van pulled up on the far carriageway. To help, i thought. But when the driver got out he started taking pictures with a long-lens camera. He came closer to get better shots and i swore at him. Then he offered me a lift the last few miles to my destination. I suspected his motives and swore at him some more. ( i ' m not entirely sympathetic towards paparazzi. ) then i realised i couldn't get a taxi and was late. So i had to accept the lift. He turned out to be an ex-news of the world investigative journalist and paparazzo, now running a pub in dover. He still kept his camera in the car's glove box for just this kind of happy accident. More than that, he was paul mcmullan, one of two ex-now hacks who had blown the whistle ( in the guardian and on channel 4's dispatches ) on the full extent of phone-hacking at the paper, particularly under its former editor andy coulson. This was interesting, as i had been a victim - a fact he confirmed as we drove along. He also had an unusual defence of the practice: that phone-hacking was a price you had to pay for living"

A gallup poll released last week showed obama beating clinton among democrats and democratic-leaning independents, but not exactly in a runaway - 52 percent to 37 percent. A separate poll showed clinton outperforming obama in illinois, with 61 percent saying they viewed her favorably, compared with 52 percent for the president.

Kobach said trump's transition team is considering dusting off the national security entry-exit registration system, which kobach himself helped design as a member of george w.

The program, nseers, was abandoned in 2011. \" these programs had kobach's signature all over them, \" the director of the migration policy institute tells nbc news. \" now, the architect of the old program again has a seat at the table. \" kobach, in fact, is rumored to be on trump's list of attorney general candidates, reports mcclatchy.

That's a fraction of the approximately $ 5 billion that authorities have spent over nearly a half-century to develop the site, once the state's largest energy project. Work began in 1973 on two nuclear reactors — four were planned — when demand for electric power was growing by 5 % a year.

The auction is set for nov. 14, and bidding has begun; phoenix energy in nevada has already offered $ 38 million. Hollywood mayor frank \" buster \" duke, who worked at the site as a pipe fitter, hopes a buyer will finish the plant — and generate much-needed jobs. \" the plant was 90 % complete when tva quit building it, and i know they would have to change and update some things, but i sure hope somebody could operate it to make power, \" duke tells the times free press.

For his part, 26-year-old billy mcfarland acknowledged before he was sentenced that he \" betrayed the trust \" of just about everyone around him, adding, \" this is an extremely bitter reality. \" in addition to the prison time, mcfarland, who in march pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud, is on the hook for some $ 26 million in restitution, per vice, which notes that it is unknown how much of that money, bilked from investors, he still has. The fyre festival, which took place in april 2017, was billed as an \" unprecedented vip event \" on an island in the bahamas that would feature \" first-class culinary experiences and a luxury atmosphere, \" along with popular music acts. But upon arrival attendees, who in extreme cases paid nearly $ 13,000, found a scene reminiscent of a disorganized refugee camp with feral dogs, tents, and cheese sandwiches standing in for the first-class cuisine. Mcfarland also ran a fraudulent ticket-selling service — \" run-of-the-mill compared to the fyre festival, \" says the times — that cost at least 30 victims some $ 150,000. Mcfarland started this scheme while he was on pretrial release in connection to the fyre fiasco, npr reports. Claiming their client suffers from untreated mental illness and had done some charitable acts, mcfarland's attorney's sought a sentence of restitution, community service, and house arrest or minimal jail time. Prosecutors lobbied for 11 to 14 years in prison. One investor, who says he lost his life savings to mcfarland's schemes, told the court thursday that mcfarland, a \" skilled and convincing liar, \" deserves \" a long prison term. \"",

I was also thought to be the ideal teacher, which is to say patient, thoughtful, trustworthy, caring. In addition, i was making a small fortune.

        "summary": "James hodgkinson, the 66-year-old illinois man police say shot and wounded multiple people during a gop congressional baseball practice wednesday, was a former volunteer for the bernie sanders campaign, politico reports. Sanders condemned the shooting \" in the strongest possible terms, \" calling it a \" despicable act. \" \" violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society, \" he said. \" real change can only come through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held american values. \" here's what else you need to know about wednesday's shooting in virginia: in addition to frequently posting pro-sanders messages to facebook, hodgkinson also posted anti-president trump and anti-hillary clinton statements, tmz reports. In one post, he called trump a \" traitor \" who \" has destroyed our democracy. \" charles orear got to know hodgkinson while working on the sanders campaign in iowa, telling the washington post he was \" very mellow, very reserved \" and \" really progressive. \" newt gingrich tied the shooting to \" an increasing intensity of hostility on the left, \" using kathy griffin as an example, the hill reports. It was a sentiment echoed by others, including ann coulter and republican rep. Chris collins, who blamed the \" outrageous \" rhetoric of democrats, according to cnn. The atlantic has a quick biography on rep. Steve scalise, the majority whip from louisiana who was injured in the shooting. He was instrumental to getting the house health care bill passed and is said to be \" the gop's best offensive player \" on the baseball field. Cnn reports scalise is only the ninth member of congress since 1789 to be shot while in office. Sen. Rand paul says if it weren't for us capitol police officers, who were at the practice as security for scalise, the shooting would've been a \" massacre. \" time has a history of the capitol police, which was formed following a fight between the son of president john quincy adams and a supporter of andrew jackson. In march, neighbors complained to police that hodgkinson was shooting his gun too close to their homes, but officers found he wasn't doing anything illegal, the st. Louis post-dispatch reports. Hodgkinson has past arrests for battery, fleeing from police, and resisting arrest. Finally, virginia gov. Terry mcauliffe says \" there are too many guns on the street \" and work needs to be done to increase background checks and close the gun show loophole, though that's a conversation for another day, according to time.",

It turns out it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist: judging whether something is stupid \" comes instantaneously, \" researcher aczél balázs says. \" if one person calls something stupid, there's a high likelihood others will do the same thing. \" in fact, the rate of agreement was 90 %, the huffington post notes. Researchers found that behaviors deemed stupid stem from three primary conditions: overconfidence: you thought you could, but you couldn't. Lack of control: you knew you shouldn't, but you did. Absent-mindedness: you weren't paying attention. In the study, researchers gathered online anecdotes describing behaviors that had been called stupid. They asked 154 students to read them and determine if they were, indeed, stupid. Then, the students chose reasons why a behavior was stupid from a list. Some interesting takeaways: people with high intelligence aren't necessarily immune to doing stupid things. A determination of stupidity is based on the observer's expectations for a person's behavior; the person engaged in stupid behavior may have different expectations. Understanding the causes of stupid behavior may help people warn others from engaging in it — rather than saying, \" you're being stupid, \" one can say \" you're being overconfident. \" no matter what, balázs tells live science, we not only recognize stupidity when we see it, we love to \" watch other people doing something stupid as a source of amusement. \" ( stupidity may have thwarted a nazi invasion of britain.

A jury found christopher duntsch, 45, guilty of intentionally causing injury to an elderly person last week before delivering his sentence in a dallas county court on monday after an hour of deliberation, per cbs dfw. Though the trial focused on efurd's case, the jury heard how two patients died after surgery performed by duntsch. More than 30 others said duntsch left them with chronic pain, permanent nerve damage, or surgical waste inside their bodies, while one man said he awoke from surgery to find he was paralyzed on one side of his body. In efurd's case, a doctor said duntsch had \" done virtually everything wrong, \" including drilling a screw into her spinal cavity and attaching implants to muscle instead of bone. \" it's as egregious as you can imagine, \" he said. Lawyers for duntsch — who was stripped of his medical license in 2013, per the dallas observer — argued he was \" not a skilled surgeon \" and \" was on his own and doing the best he could. \" but prosecutors pointed to disturbing emails in which duntsch referred to himself as \" something between god, einstein, and the antichrist \" and said he was \" ready to … become a cold-blooded killer, \" per d magazine, which nicknamed him \" dr.

Strangio, in an email to the associated press, called her treatment since her 2010 arrest and subsequent time serving a 35-year sentence \" demoralizing and destabilizing assaults on her health and humanity. \" \" after her july suicide attempt, i watched her begin to piece her life and spirit back together only to have that shattered by the disciplinary proceedings brought against her and then the unannounced initiation of her term of punishment last month, \" strangio wrote. \" she has repeatedly been punished for trying to survive and now is being repeatedly punished for trying to die. \" strangio added he worries about manning's \" ability to keep fighting under these relentless abuses.",

Ms. Manning, the former army intelligence analyst who is serving a 35-year sentence for leaking archives of secret documents to wikileaks, disclosed the attempted suicide, which took place oct. 4, in a statement she dictated over the phone to a member of her volunteer support network. She asked that it be sent this week to the new york times, according to members of the network who want to keep their identities private. Chase strangio, an american civil liberties union lawyer representing ms. Manning, formerly known as bradley manning, confirmed the attempt, which raised new questions about the military's handling of the troubled soldier, dating to when she was permitted to deploy to iraq and kept at her post in a secure facility despite signs of erratic behavior. During ms. Manning's trial in 2013, testimony showed that she had been deteriorating, mentally and emotionally, during the period when she downloaded the documents and sent them to wikileaks. Then known as pfc. Bradley manning, she was struggling with gender dysphoria under conditions of extraordinary stress and isolation while deployed to the iraq war zone. At that"

All three devices run on the blackberry 7 os, and all sport touch screens. The flashiest offering may be the torch 9850/9860, rim's first all-touch screen blackberry, but there's also the torch 9810, which features a slide-out keyboard, and the bold 9900 series, which is the slimmest phone yet to boast blackberry's trademark keyboard, zdnet reports. But analysts are skeptical the new phones will help blackberry get its mojo back, they tell the wall street journal. The phones had been delayed, keeping them out of some carriers ' back-to-school programs, and they don't feature rim's newly-acquired and theoretically superior qnx operating system, which will hit stores next year.

A new study has found that pigs who were fed a diet of gm corn and soy had a higher rate of stomach inflammation than those who strictly ate regular feed. Of the 168 pigs slaughtered then autopsied in the study, 32 % of the gm-fed porkers showed severe stomach inflammation, versus 12 % of those consuming non-gm food, reuters reports. The difference was more profound in male pigs, though the gm-fed female pigs displayed a remarkable change of their own: uteri that were 25 % heavier than those of their non-gm counterparts. \" the thing about a pig is that their digestive system is very similar to that of a human, \" the lead researcher told abc radio. \" so the fact we've got these results in the stomachs of pigs means that we should really start looking to see if we're getting similar effects in the stomachs of humans. \" reuters notes that no variations were observed in terms of weight gain or mortality rate.

That total area is equal to 1.2 million square miles — what the guardian estimates to be about the size of two alaskas — and researchers say if there's not a quick turnaround on the conservation front, there could be zero major wild areas in \" less than a century. \" \" the amount of wilderness loss in just two decades is staggering, \" dr. Oscar venter of the university of northern british columbia says, per a press release. \" wildnerness, \" for the purposes of this study, was defined as land that's \" ecologically largely intact \" and \" mostly free of human disturbance, \" save for indigenous communities. The amazon claims the lion's share of these \" catastrophic \" losses over the past two decades, with about 30 % of its wilderness disappeared ( and rainforests still being cleared ). Central africa, meanwhile, has suffered a 14 % loss. Losing these natural environments isn't just about aesthetics: the study's authors note that widespread development spells disaster for endangered species, threatens biodiversity, and contributes to climate change, as forests hold huge amounts of carbon. As sciencealert notes: \" great job, humans. \" ( yosemite just scooped up lots more land. )",

At the same time, rising temperatures in california are increasing the amount of water trees need. \" this staggering and growing number of tree deaths should be concerning for everyone, \" a california climate and conservation manager tells the times. One dangerous side effect: having millions of dead, dry trees lying around increases the dangers posed by wildfires. Fires can start easier, spread more quickly, and burn hotter, damaging the soil. The us forest service spent more than half its 2016 budget fighting wildfires — money that could have gone to restoring dying forests.

Norton says he was moved to launch the fundraiser for the family after reading their story — as told by the father, a scientist — on hony, which has been chronicling the experiences of 12 syrian families being allowed to resettle in the us. Writing that the family's story \" moved me to tears, \" norton adds, \" let's reject the ' anti-human ' voices that tell us to fear refugees and show this man and his family what americans are really made of. \" the scientist had recounted to hony the tragic story of losing seven family members, including his wife and daughter, when a government anti-personnel missile tore through the family's compound. \" inside were 116 small bombs, and each bomb was filled with needles and shrapnel, \" he recalls. \" my son had to carry the pieces of his mother and sister out of the house, \" he says; the boy was 14 at the time. Shrapnel wounded another daughter. \" we survived but we're dead psychologically, \" he says. \"everything ended for us that day. \" the man has stomach cancer — \" from my sadness and my stress \" — and says he is unable to work in turkey because of regulations. \" i ' m fighting against time, \" he says, but \" i just want to get back to work. \" he thinks he can do that in michigan. \" i want to be a person again. I don't want the world to think i ' m over. I ' m still here.... I still think i have a chance to make a difference in the world. \" last week, president obama responded to the story on hony's facebook page: \" yes, you can still make a difference in the world, and we're proud that you ' ll pursue your dreams here.

Intelligence sources tell nbc news that the us government quietly communicated to ecuador that assange is tied up with russian hacking — officials say he knows the files he's releasing through wikileaks come from russian intelligence, though he's not taking part in any hacking himself — and shouldn't be allowed to continue. The information helped bring about what one official describes as assange's \" eviction notice, \" sources say. Assange himself says secretary of state john kerry pressured ecuadorian president rafael correa during a meeting last month to take action against assange. A state department rep, however, says \" any suggestion that secretary kerry or the state department were involved in shutting down wikileaks is false. \" the ap notes ecuador, whose economy is struggling, might simply have chosen not to risk its relationship with the us, its largest trade partner. Either way, wikileaks is still tweeting links to hacked emails from democratic officials, including john podesta. And though assange is still offline, he's at least on top of the news. London-based canadian comedian bobby mair tweeted a photo of himself holding a megaphone on wednesday with the caption, \" i ' m outside the ecuadorian embassy about to read the internet to … julian assange, \" per the washington post.

Following the collapse of the nearby larsen a ice shelf in the weddell sea in 1995 and larsen b shelf in 2002, scientists noticed a rift in larsen c, which is more than 1,100 feet thick. The rift has been extending across the ice shelf ever since, but over two weeks in december, it stretched an additional 11 miles in length, per the bbc. As of mid-december, it measured 70 miles long, the length of a football field in width, and a third of a mile deep, and had left a 2,000-square-mile chunk of ice attached to the shelf only by a 12-mile \" thread \" of ice, reports the week, via nasa. \" it's so close to calving that i think it's inevitable, \" says researcher adrian luckman. \" if it doesn't go in the next few months, i ' ll be amazed. \" the break will cause larsen c to lose more than 10 % of its area, leaving it \" at its most retreated position ever recorded, \" researchers say on a project website.

Fat can also be a career-ender for politicians because the public doesn't tend to favor overweight leaders. Even several newser readers attacked the 50-year-old governor by focusing on his weight following his speech last night. Christie is far bigger than any other major politician in recent years, and, if he were ever elected president as supporters would like, he'd be the heaviest commander-in-chief in 100 years, reports the los angeles times. The times speculates that the public may be in the mood for a change, and finally willing to swap ( in christie's words ) a \" big, fat rear end \" for the endless parade of tanned, toned politicians we've grown used to.

The reason for her surprising success, charged fuming critics and some viewers across the internet, was that \" tea party \" activists had spearheaded a campaign that essentially stuffed the show's ballot box in favor of sarah palin's daughter.this latest reality show tempest highlights the power of popularity over talent when mostly unregulated public voting is involved and, perhaps more dramatically, the polarizing effect of the palin family name, which received prominent attention earlier this month in one of the most heated elections in recent memory.the brouhaha began almost immediately tuesday evening after bristol was named a finalist, with celebrity websites like jezebel.com declaring that \" palin conservatives are cheating \" abc's voting system and late night talk host jimmy kimmel calling brandy, a popular singer and entertainer, the victim of \" hurricane bristol. \" the dust-up lost little momentum wednesday as radio host rush limbaugh predicted a bristol backlash in next week's final voting, while joy behar told her colleagues on the \" the view \" that the young palin will take the grand prize.this is hardly the first time a reality show elimination has led to an uproar or accusations of unfair play. Last year on the dancing show, kelly osbourne, daughter of ozzy and sharon osbourne, also advanced to the finals despite her often clumsy dance floor moves. And in 2009, \" american idol's \" kris allen, whose strong christian fan base was suspected of wrongfully flooded the phone banks in his favor, won the show's top prize over critical darling adam lambert, who, unlike allen, went on to pop culture success after the \" idol \" stage lights faded. \" all these shows are open to this kind of thing.

        "summary": "It was a tough day for snap inc., and particularly ceo evan spiegel, on wednesday. Snap stock plummeted 24 % to $ 17.59 per share after the company's first quarterly earnings report since going public showed disappointing revenue growth and the slowest pace of user growth in years, reports business insider. That meant spiegel lost $ 1 billion of his $ 5 billion fortune, though shares climbed to $ 18.76 on thursday. More on what that means: it's bad, but not unprecedented, reports the los angeles times, noting facebook stock fell 10 % and twitter stock fell 22 % following the first quarterly earnings report after an ipo. Snap's user growth, it states, will be key to watch going forward. While facebook rebounded from its 2012 hit, snap faces a hurdle that facebook didn't, an equity strategist tells cnbc: it has facebook as a competitor. Indeed, the stories feature on instagram, which is owned by facebook, has some 200 million daily users. Snapchat has 166 million. Spiegel seems flippant. \" people are going to copy your product if you build great stuff, \" he said during wednesday's conference call with investors. \" just because yahoo has a search box doesn't make it google. \" but that line raises a red flag for peter cohan, who says it's time to bet against snap. The company's \" man-child ceo \" is the \" most frightening issue for investors in its shares, \" who \" have no recourse but to pay the tuition for the ceo's on the job training, \" he writes at forbes, also citing snap's \" undisciplined growth strategy. \" nomura and pivotal research both appear concerned, expecting snap stock to fall to $ 14 and $ 9 per share, respectively. But goldman sachs and citi are more confident, with the former claiming \" audience and engagement represent a unique asset that will benefit from growth and diversification of internet usage and advertiser adoption as both mature. \"",

Joss, 24, apparently befriended the prince when she performed at a memorial concert for his mother, princess diana.

Among her other cringeworthy feats, per cnn: setting up a 2000 fundraiser at the playboy mansion and accusing a vietnamese republican challenger in 2010 of being \" very anti-immigrant and very anti-hispanic. \" sanchez started the apology trail on sunday, saying that her actions came amid a whirlwind of a \" crazy and exciting rush of meetings \" and that politicians \" who don't hide behind handlers \" sometimes err, the sacramento bee reports; she also defended her support of human and minority rights, saying that native american tribes \" know that i have always had their backs. \" plus this: \" and they know what many of you don't know.
