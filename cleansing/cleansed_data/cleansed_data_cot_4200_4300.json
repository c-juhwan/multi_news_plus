Researchers in new york say via eureka alert that walnuts can help improve learning, memory, and motor skills and reduce anxiety — at least in mice. The scientists, led by dr.

Those given the walnuts performed far better in mazes and other tests, the washington post reports. \" our study adds to the growing body of research that demonstrates the protective effects of walnuts on cognitive functioning, \" chauhan says. The antioxidants in walnuts may be responsible for the possible benefits, including lowering alzheimer's risk and delaying its onset or progression. Indeed, walnuts are second only to blackberries on a 1,100-item list of anti-oxidative foods, says chauhan. The researcher's earlier work suggested that walnut extract could fight damage linked to amyloid plaques, which develop in patients ' brains. But be aware: the things are packed with calories, consumer affairs reports. The findings come at a time when alzheimer's is expected to grow far more widespread among an aging baby boomer population. In other good news in the fight against it, researchers recently were able to recreate it \" in a dish, \" which should make it easier to test anti-alzheimer's drugs.",

        "summary": "Democrats argue that president obama's plan to raise the minimum wage will lift people out of poverty, while republicans say the move will kill jobs — and the nonpartisan congressional budget office says they're both right. The cbo has stoked debate with a report estimating that the plan to raise the minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 10.10 by 2016 would cost somewhere between very few and 1 million jobs — its best guess is 500,000 — while lifting around 900,000 families out of poverty and boosting the incomes of 16.5 million low-wage workers, reports the los angeles times. The cbo report includes an analogy that shows just how far the minimum wage has fallen in real terms, the washington post finds. Over the past 30 years, an average of 5.3 % of workers earned between the old and new minimum wages when congress brought in a hike, but under the proposed rise, 10.1 % of workers do. The white house, unusually, disputed the cbo's findings, saying the lost jobs estimate is probably too high, reports the new york times. Top republicans, however, welcomed the report, with senate minority leader mitch mcconnell calling the proposed wage rise a \" devastating blow to the very people that need help most in this economy. \"",

More specifically, the cbo found that raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour ( and then indexing it to inflation ) would reduce employment by between a very small amount and 1 million workers, with the agency's best guess being about 500,000 workers. Republicans are seizing on that finding, with a spokesman for house speaker john boehner ( r-ohio ) saying: \" this report confirms what we've long known: while helping some, mandating higher wages has real costs, including fewer people working. \" at the same time, the report finds that about 16.5 million low-wage americans would see an increase in their earnings as a result of the hike in the minimum wage.

        "summary": "It's no wonder pigeons are renowned for their sense of direction: their brains function like biological gps units, say two researchers. As nature explains, scientists already knew that pigeons used the earth's magnetic field to get around, but the new study shows for the first time how specific parts of their brains process the information. The researchers think those brain signals come from the inner ear, though it's possible that receptors in their beaks and eyes also take in and pass along information, notes popular science. \"we have found cells in the ( pigeon ) brain that signal the direction, intensity and polarity of an applied magnetic field, \" a study co-author from the baylor college of medicine tells discovery news. \"these three qualities can be used by the brain to compute heading information, like a compass, and latitude on the earth surface. \" a researcher not involved with the study calls it \" the most thorough investigation of the magnetic sense so far. \"",

The concert was postponed for the first time in october amid nationwide strikes over the government's plan to raise the country's retirement age. This weekend, it was snowy weather that forced authorities to ban big trucks from driving through the city. Concert organizers said gaga would be able to take the stage monday, and that the show originally slated for sunday would be rescheduled for tuesday. Despite the near-nationwide shutdown, the pop diva took to twitter to vent about her crew's transportation woes as she was miserably stuck on a bus. \" all 28 of my trucks for the monsterball were detained by the french government going on over 26 hrs, 2 of my employees were arrested trying to get into paris so we could perform, \" she tweeted on sunday. \" i am furious and devastated, its unfair to my fans and to me. \" it's unclear if gaga's fans could have even made it to the show to see her",
            "London ( cnn ) -- lisa suarez's voice breaks as she stands in the snow outside london's heathrow airport, unable to get a flight home to dallas, texas. \" it's very hard, \" she says. \" all i want for christmas is to hug my daughter. \" she and her family are among hundreds of thousands of people stranded by \" freak weather conditions \" that dumped unexpected tons of snow on europe this weekend, snarling flight schedules at the continent's busiest airports. Heathrow planned to cancel all arrivals sunday, but later said it might allow three planes to land. A dozen long-haul flights are scheduled to take off sunday night, spokesman andrew teacher said. He did not say which ones. Charles de gaulle airport in paris told travelers to expect two-hour delays and cancellation of a quarter of flights. One in five flights was being canceled at the french capital's second airport, paris-orly, with delays of an hour expected, aeroports de paris said on its website. Germany's frankfurt airport said at least 500 of a planned 1,300 flights would be scrapped sunday. And more snow is expected in germany during the day, which will put further strain on flight schedules, spokesman waltraud riehemann said. More than 200,000 passengers were due to take off from heathrow"

        "summary": "Superstorm sandy is slowly moving inland, leaving a trail of devastation across the northeast even as president obama quickly declared major disaster areas in new york and new jersey. The storm has killed at least 16 people in seven states, adding to the 69 people it killed in the caribbean. More than 6 million people in 13 states and dc are without power and transportation has been paralyzed across a huge area. New york city was especially devastated by the storm, the ap reports, including a 13-foot surge of seawater, three feet above the previous record. Large swaths of manhattan have lost power, and amid all the water, an out-of-control fire has destroyed at least 50 houses in queens. Obama's declaration, which normally waits until a storm damage assessment can be done, opens up federal funding for victims in several counties in both states, usa today reports. \" this was so evident how bad it was that the president said, ' let's just get this done, ' \" says fema's administrator. More storm misery lies ahead for people in the northeast and as far west as chicago, cnn reports. Heavy rains will continue to soak the region and a blizzard spawned by the storm will dump up to three feet of snow on parts of west virginia. As the storm heads west, more than a million people are under orders to evacuate and one disaster forecasting company predicts the economic losses from sandy will top $ 20 billion, only half of it insured, reuters reports. Meanwhile, the hurricane is taking its toll on the digital world: the huffington post, gawker, and mediaite are all down, the ap notes.",

He spoke to 10,000 enthusiastic supporters in madison, wisconsin, this week, which is \" incredible \" for this stage of the campaign, writes matthew yglesias at vox. The vermont senator's populist pitch is resonating especially well with rank-and-file union members, so much so that politico reports on an unusual move by the chief of the afl-cio: richard trumka sent out a memo to state and local leaders reminding them that they can't endorse a candidate — only the national branch can do that. Chapters in south carolina and vermont already have expressed formal support for sanders, notes politico. The story quotes the afl-cio president in massachusetts as saying that he understands trumka had to get tough, but in the same breath he explains why the senator is such a blue-collar favorite: \" sanders has spent his life actually fighting for working people. He's made no secret of it, and he's used it as his mantra. And that i respect very much. \" but what about hillary clinton? \"who? who? please. I mean with all respect, huh? \" the sanders camp hopes the national office will hold off on an endorsement during the primaries.",

            "Last night, bernie sanders managed to get 10,000 people to show up to a campaign rally in madison, wisconsin to watch a speech. At this point in the campaign cycle, that's incredible. The speech, which was met with thunderous applause from the crowd, is worth watching in full: whether he wins or loses, sanders ' ability to inspire that kind of intensity around a political campaign has important implications for the future. He is potentially engaging a large new cohort of people in politics, people who are specifically inspired by a message of populist economics rather than the mix of anti-war sentiments and racial progress themes that mobilized people for barack obama in 2008. At the rally, sanders hit on his key policy themes — single-payer health care, a $ 15 an hour minimum wage, free college tuition ( a good theme in a university town like madison ), a $ 1 trillion infrastructure program, and a massive jobs program to tackle youth unemployment. But his biggest message, as is often the case with insurgent candidates, was a little bit meta. \" this campaign is not about bernie sanders, \" he said, \" it is not about hillary clinton or anybody else. \" instead, it's \" about putting together a grassroots movement of millions of people to make sure the government works",

Story continued below the memo comes amid signs of a growing split between national union leaders — mindful of the fact that clinton remains the undisputed favorite for the nomination — and local officials and rank and file, who are increasingly drawn to the democratic party's growing progressive wing, for whom sanders is the latest standard-bearer. The south carolina and vermont afl-cios have passed resolutions supporting sanders, and some local afl-cio leaders in iowa want to introduce a resolution at their august convention backing the independent senator from vermont.

This bus will be used for a national tour wherein the wsp will display the collection at gallery showings, county fairs, diy punk basement shows, collector's conventions, and the like; as well as hunt for vhs copies hidden all over the u.s. And world. Project 2525: the world speed project bus conversion, then, is the first phase in the overall project. Through project 2525, we hope to raise the funds necessary to complete all the repairs and painting to convert our bus into a likeness of the bus from the film.

        "summary": "Sunday night's game of thrones episode brought the long-awaited meeting of fire and ice — that of daenerys targaryen and jon snow — but \" the queen's justice \" brought so much more. What's being said about the season's third episode ( spoilers abound ): rolling stone provides a recap, noting the aforementioned meeting bore a \" surprising lack of romantic or interpersonal fireworks between the two monarchs. \" but there were fireworks of some sort courtesy of cersei, who \" goes on what kill bill's bride might refer to as a roaring rampage of revenge \" ( most gruesomely, we learn the fate of ellaria sand ). The washington post's take: \" this was, once again, an exceptionally talky episode of game of thrones, but the action at highgarden was a reminder of what the series can do with talk when it pairs up its strongest actors. \" it also singles out \" two fleeting moments of great courage and empathy in this episode. \" billboard provides a succinct recap of nine noteworthy moments, and ends with a prediction of sorts: \" dany has been talking exclusively in regal-speak for many episodes now. It would be nice to have a scene of her reacting like a normal young woman. But it looks like we may finally see a break in her exterior in next week's episode,'the spoils of war. ' \" if you were expecting a stark reunion, you got one — just probably not the one you had in mind. Ew dives into the bran-sansa meeting with insight from showrunner d.b. Weiss. Vanity fair notes that casterly rock \" has never resonated with fans \" the way other ancestral homes like winterfell have, but it explains why it matters so much to tyrion, and digs deep into its place in both the books ( referencing \" lann the clever \" ) and in the show. The episode ended with some major twists: daenerys'taking of casterly rock was undermined by the fact that much of the lannister army was elsewhere: bound for highgarden, where the episode concludes with jamie offering olenna tyrell a painless poison death. In return, she savages him with a deathbed confession: that she was the one to poison joffrey. The independent has her \" amazing \" death speech. Vanity fair pays tribute with a piece called \" 14 reasons why lady olenna is the show's best character. \" with olenna gone, vox observes that in just two short episodes, daenerys has lost all three of her brand new allies, and reads into it: \" overall, it's clear that showrunners david benioff and d.b",

Rescues continue, however, with more than 40 saved since yesterday. The fates of some 372 people remain uncertain following reports by their families. Meanwhile, \" volatile \" protests following the collapse have drawn some 10,000 people, police say, amid reports of attacks on factories and buses set alight. Authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets on the crowd. Some have managed to speak to the media while still trapped in the rubble. \" it would have been better to die than enduring such pain to live on, \" said one. Building owners — reportedly in hiding — as well as bosses of factories inside are due to appear in court next week, the bbc notes. As the collapse highlights the dangers of bangladesh's garment industry, the ap reports the names of companies with links to the building. Ether tex, which had 530 workers in the building, says it supplies walmart, while new wave supplies mango, dress barn, and the children's place, among others. Dress barn and the children's place, however, say they weren't involved with the building when the collapse occurred. Walmart is investigating whether any of the factories were producing garments for it at the time of the collapse.",

With its approval by the state senate yesterday, a bill to decriminalize small quantities of pot is headed to gov. Martin o ' malley's desk — and he says he ' ll sign it, the washington post reports. Instead of possible jail time, possession of less than 10 grams of pot ( that's about a third of an ounce ) will result in a $ 100 fine; a second offense will call for a $ 250 fine, and a third a $ 500 penalty. There are a few other stipulations beyond money: a third offense would also result in a court-ordered drug assessment, and offenders under 21 would have to show up in court. Noting his own changing views, the verge reports o ' malley calls the bill \" an acknowledgment of the low priority that our courts, our prosecutors, our police, and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health. Such an acknowledgment in law might even lead to a greater focus on far more serious threats to public safety and the lives of our citizens. \" maryland's neighbor recently made a similar move.",

During remarks yesterday at a golf club in orange county, california, kasich praised latinos for their family values and their work ethic, then drifted into a discussion about a latina hotel maid, reports the los angeles times. \" a lot of them do jobs that they're willing to do, and that's why in the hotel you leave a little tip, \" he said.

Critics have pounded on the remarks as condescending — accusing kasich of equating latinos with service-sector workers — but a republican spokesman says kasich \" was talking about how great the service was and how we should respect everyone in our society no matter what their job or position might be. \" at the washington post, janell ross doesn't buy it. \" kasich and many other americans don't run across latino golf club owners, lawyers, doctors, artists and astronauts in their daily lives, \" writes ross. \" and, as such, they apparently have no sense of the range of interests, habits and skills that exist in any other population can also be found among hispanic americans.

The answer: before our kids can \" walk or talk, \" as a press release puts it. Philadelphia researchers surveyed 370 parents during a two-month period in fall 2014 at a pediatric clinic \" that serves an urban, low income, minority community, \" they write. The parents had kids between the ages of 6 months and 4 years, and most owned tablets ( 83 % ) and/or smartphones ( 77 % ). When researchers asked, \" how old was your child when he/she did these activities on a mobile media device? \" here's what they found among the \" under one year \" category: 52 % had watched tv 36 % had touched or scrolled a screen 24 % had called someone 15 % had used apps 12 % had played video games \" we didn't expect children were using the devices from the age of 6 months, \" says lead author hilda kabali, and \" some children were on the screen for as long as 30 minutes. \" in fact, by the age of one year, 14 % of kids logged usage of at least an hour a day. Further, the survey responses indicate \" most children are using [ mobile devices ] by age two years, \" though time points to the american academy of pediatrics'recommendation that kids under two not have exposure. Why is it happening? the researchers did ask when the children used the devices, and got these answers: while running errands ( 60 % ), while the parent was doing chores ( 73 % ), when the child needed to be calmed ( 65 % ), and to put the child to sleep ( 29 % ). The findings were presented saturday at the pediatric academic societies annual meeting. ( a recent study warns against handing your toddler an ipad. )",

The then-9-year-old was lucky enough to trip not on a rock, or a tree root, but on a 1.2-million-year-old fossil when trying to dash away from his brothers on a november desert hike with his family. And as new mexico state university biology professor peter houde explains to the new york times, jude was lucky to have been at the las cruces, nm, site just after a storm had exposed the fossil — but before the exposure reduced the specimen to nothingness. At first he and his brothers thought it might be from a cow; his parents thought it looked more elephant-like. Their research didn't turn up a clear answer, so they turned to houde, who identified it as part of a stegomastodon skull. Jude's parents actually weren't that far off. The times notes the stegomastodon was not a dinosaur ( non-avian dinosaurs were wiped out way more than 1.2 million years ago, after all ), and houde says in a university release that the creature \" would look to any of us like an elephant. \" fox news gets more scientific, explaining they're \" a primitive group of proboscideans ( ' elephantoids ' ) from which modern elephants evolved. \" the skull was excavated in may and marks what houde says may be just the second-such full skull found in the state. Houde credits the sparkses for their restraint in not digging up the bones but rather consulting a professional. He adds, \" to be quite honest, all these fossils from this area are radioactive and especially for children, not something you would want in your home. \" ( a 4-year-old found this dinosaur. )",

There was no touching allowed, however. Relatives have been forced to view the first boys rescued from the cave from behind glass, and communicate via phone, to prevent infection. Three of the boys have minor cases of pneumonia, though a doctor says most will be released in about a week. Still undergoing tests, the third and final group to emerge tuesday, four boys and their coach, have yet to be reunited with family, but they were able to send letters out of the cave with divers, per the bbc, which has details on each of the boys. Despite losing an average of 4.4 pounds each during their time inside the cave — the 11- to 16-year-olds ( though the bbc has one boy listed as 17 ) consumed only murky water in the first nine days before they were found — the boys are in \" good condition, \" health ministry inspector tongchai lertvirairatanapong said wednesday. \" i have to praise the coach who took care of the footballers very well, \" lertvirairatanapong added. A former monk, 25-year-old ekkapol ake chantawong reportedly taught the boys meditation techniques to keep them calm. The rescue commander also commended diver richard harris. The last person to exit the cave system, he soon after learned his father had died. \" we want to send our condolences to him and i do have to thank him a lot, \" narongsak osotthanakorn said, per cnn. \" without him, in this operation, i don't think we could have succeeded. \"",

What's more, by the time the orioles were down to their last strike last night, the sox had about a 98 % chance of winning the game. But wait, it gets crazier: the rays were down 7-0 to the yankees as late as the 8th inning — at that point, they had just a 0.3 % chance of winning. So by silver's rough estimate, the odds of all that happening were about one in 278 million. \"when confronted with numbers like these, you have to start to ask a few questions, statistical and existential. \" sabermetricians tend to discount streaks, clutch performances, and other intangibles, but sometimes, those things may just matter. \"one should also have license … to turn to various divine and karmic explanations. \" perhaps, for example, god was sending bud selig a message: don't add a second wildcard.

With working women achieving new freedoms, immigrants moving in, and male-female courtship and marriage undergoing changes, some americans considered ice cream parlors ( especially foreign-owned ones ) to be recruiting stations for sin.

Then he tried to walk both back to economy, but a flight attendant stopped him and didn't buy his argument that he wanted to use the bathroom back there while double-fisting his drinks. At that point, the man apparently texted his friends to come up to first class on the pretext of using the bathroom, but they were stopped at the threshold. The first-class passenger again spoke with the flight attendant, to no avail, and an airline manager soon appeared and asked the passenger to leave the plane.

Tweets from humanitarian officials show that 7-year-old bana alabed was evacuated safely from the city on monday, reports the independent. As government forces had closed in on the city in recent weeks, the girl's twitter account — run with the help of her mother, an english teacher — exploded in popularity as it described their ordeal. The account currently has about 326,000 followers, with bana being compared to a modern anne frank. Though critics including president bashar al-assad himself denounced the account as largely false propaganda, fact-checkers backed up its authenticity, reports the washington post. Bana \" is safe with her family after she was evacuated from her city, \" tweeted zaher sahloul, founder of the humanitarian organization american relief coalition for syria. \" she survived siege, bombing &amp; apathy. \" two days ago, the girl and her mother, fatemah, sent a video message to nbc news appealing directly to michelle obama. \" i talk to you as a mother, \" fatemah says. \" i implore you to help us...

On the martin shooting in particular, the racial gaps are extremely wide. Among african americans, 87 percent say the shooting was unjustified; among whites, just 33 percent say so. A slim majority of whites ( 51 percent ) approve of the not-guilty verdict in the zimmerman trial, while african americans overwhelmingly and strongly disapprove.

Among whites, 70 percent of republicans but only 30 percent of democrats say they approve of the verdict.

At 14 months, the boy weighed about 47 pounds, and attempts to keep his weight under control proved futile ( doctors note they are uncertain whether the child's parents stuck to the strict diet ); just four months later his weight had jumped to 65 pounds, and he was suffering from sleep apnea and bowing of the legs. Surgeons then decided to turn to an irreversible surgery in which they removed the outer part of the boy's stomach in april 2010, they write in a report published in the international journal of surgery case reports. What remained was a small portion of stomach about the size and shape of a banana. The boy lost 15 % of his body weight just two months after the surgery; he weighed around 53 pounds at age four and had a body mass index in the normal range ( see before and after photos here ). One obesity expert calls it a \" shocking \" case, and notes that the surgery may result in vitamin deficiencies later on. Bizarrely, it's the second such case to make the news in the last week; the khaleej times reports a 4-year-old boy also recently underwent bariatric surgery.

Hernandez, once a new england patriots tight end, is accused of killing semipro ballplayer odin lloyd in june of 2013 near hernandez's massachusetts home. Hernandez had a $ 40 million nfl contract at the time and lloyd was dating hernandez's fiancee's sister, the ap notes. The defense strategy was to \" shift blame \" to two other suspects, connecticut residents carlos ortiz and ernest wallace, the hartford courant reports. In that vein, tufts university professor david greenblatt was called to testify about the effects of pcp. The defense tried to show that pcp made wallace and ortiz violently psychotic that night. But under cross-examination, greenblatt admitted there's no proof they took the drug, suffered psychotic effects, or turned violent because of it. And video of them that night doesn't help: \" you just can't tell \" if they're high, he says. The case also turns on a piece of blue bubblegum carrying hernandez's dna. It was found in a trash bin, stuck to a shell casing that matches shells from the murder scene. An enterprise employee says she found the items in a rental car hernandez returned the day after lloyd's death, and threw them away.

At a shipping port south of bangkok, thailand, police on tuesday displayed seven shipping containers filled with more than 150 tons of discarded computer and game console parts and other e-waste from hong kong, singapore, and elsewhere. \"electronic waste from every corner of the world is flowing into thailand, \" a police official said at the news conference. Last year, china told the world trade organization that it was banning overseas trash, an action that analysts believe is causing e-waste — which is rife with health hazards thanks to toxins including lead and mercury — to be re-routed to southeast asia. China's state media last year estimated that in 2016 the country took in 70 % of the world's e-waste. Last week, thai police raided several factories near bangkok accused of illegally importing and processing e-waste and found nearly 100 tons of it: mountains of old computers, mobile phones, and other items, the ap reports. \" these factories have not received permission to operate and will be closed pending further investigation, \" a ministry official said. Workers at the factories were reportedly handling the toxic e-waste while wearing only cloth gloves and face masks for protection, notes fortune. Officials and environmentalists are alarmed. \"after china's ban, thailand could become one of the biggest dumping grounds for e-waste, \" says the director of ecological alert and recovery thailand. Thai officials are scrambling to ramp up site inspections to stem the tide of electronic waste; another 10 factories are due to be inspected by june 15. ( more on china's policy here. )",

She used a personal email account, the new york times reports, and it seems she didn't have a government one. The federal records act says her emails should have been held on government servers, but her staff didn't move to put them there, the times notes. \" it is very difficult to conceive of a scenario — short of nuclear winter — where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business, \" says a lawyer formerly with the national archives and records administration, noting that he can't remember another case in which a top executive-branch official opted to use only a private account. Government emails are supposed to be available when congressional committees or journalists need them. But not until two months ago did staffers go through a trove of clinton emails and provide 55,000 pages ' worth to the government; that came after a state department request to former secretaries for records, a department spokeswoman tells politico. What's more, \" personal emails are not secure, \" notes a transparency advocate. Indeed, the washington post notes that a hacker revealed a clinton adviser was corresponding with an address at the \" clintonemail.com \" domain — which was registered as clinton's confirmation hearings began in 2009.

Verizon, which agreed to pay $ 4.8 billion for yahoo in july, has a team exploring the possibility of a lower sale price after yahoo revealed an august 2013 hack affected 1 billion accounts, including those of fbi agents and white house staff, says the source, who acknowledges that trying to kill the deal isn't off the table. It isn't clear what kind of discount verizon might seek, but techcrunch notes there were rumors of a $ 1 billion price cut after yahoo's other hack in september. Bloomberg's source says the team also wants yahoo to assume responsibility for the latest hack, meaning verizon wouldn't be on the hook for any future legal issues. But that doesn't mean verizon might not still abandon the deal altogether, even while its integration team continues its work, the source says. A source tells reuters that verizon has threatened to try to wiggle out of the deal in court if it isn't granted \" major concessions. \" a business professor notes the most likely scenario is that verizon might ask yahoo for some form of compensation after the deal closes. In a statement wednesday, verizon says it \" will evaluate the situation as yahoo continues its investigation \" and \" review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions. \" adds yahoo, \" we are confident in yahoo's value and we continue to work towards integration with verizon. \"",

        "summary": "Will you miss harrison ford? undoubtedly. Will you still enjoy seeing how han solo got his start, and survived his first encounter with chewbacca? maybe. So say critics who've given ron howard's solo: a star wars story a 69 % positive rating on rotten tomatoes. It's a decent score, but not great. Four takes: \" howard stages a number of spectacular set pieces, \" which makes for \" good fun, and all that. \" but the film's \" flawed central performance ultimately makes solo a distinct disappointment, \" writes soren anderson at the seattle times. Whereas ford's portrayal of arrogance was \" engaging, \" alden ehrenreich's constant smirk \" turns han solo into a guy who is just this side of insufferable, \" he writes. Alan scherstuhl is of the same opinion. Given that solo copies a scene from 1980's the empire strikes back, it's only fair to compare the two films, and solo clearly doesn't measure up, scherstuhl writes at the village voice. It \" has a just-finish-the-movie quality to it, an uncertainty about the pacing and seriousness of developments in its own story. \" plus, ehrenreich's performance \" is froyo to harrison ford's ice cream. Anybody's would be. \" richard roeper gives ehrenreich more credit. He \" does a fantastic job at foreshadowing certain characteristics and tendencies of ford-as-han, without delving into impersonation, \" he writes at the chicago sun-times. Still, donald glover is better, giving \" the show-stopping, effortlessly scene-stealing performance of the movie, \" which roeper found \" entertaining as hell, \" though \" not particularly deep. \" though it took some adjusting, lindsey bahr welcomed ehrenreich by the end of what she calls a \" largely enjoyable \" movie-watching experience. References to future developments provide \" some of the most memorable and pleasing moments, \" along with \" at least three epic set-pieces, \" she writes at the ap, though she wonders whether the film \" really added anything of value to the character \" of solo.",

            "There was drama in the audience at a press screening of a new zach galifianakis-owen wilson comedy when an audience member suddenly punched a film critic sitting next to her. Stephen whitty, film critic for the newark-based star-ledger, was watching \"are you here, \" a new film by \"mad men \" creator matthew weiner, when \"this complete stranger — someone's guest — sat down next to me, \" he said. \"ten or 15 minutes after the movie started, she turned her head and started staring at me. I glanced over — she kept staring. \" the scene, like something from a psychological thriller, continued when \"a few minutes later, i realized she was still staring at me, \" whitty added. \"she said, a little angrily, something like, 'what are you even doing here, anyway? ' and punched me in the face. \" a gobsmacked witness at screening room magno sound and video in midtown told page six of the assault, \"this girl just started yelling and punched him. \" after getting cold-cocked, a stunned whitty exclaimed, \"what the … \" but the man with the alleged attacker, \"said by way of explanation, \"she just woke up. ' \" whitty fled the theater and returned with cops. But when the authorities tried to remove the woman, \"she just did a 'death drop to the floor, ' \" a spy said, adding that the film, also starring amy poehler, continued playing. \"they let the film run, \" a witness tweeted. \"there was a major dramatic moment with a cop in front of the screen. \" the anonymous woman finally was taken out and seen, \"sitting on the sidewalk between two cops, drinking water. \" no arrest was made, according to records. \"i didn't press charges; i ' m not suing anyone, \" whitty explained without revealing the woman's name. \"i just wanted someone to take a look at this person and see if she was a danger to herself and others. \" he even joked on twitter:"

Among the takeaways from this mishmash of government numbers, food-production estimates, and food bar-code data: adult daily calorie consumption is \" in the midst of [ its ] first sustained decline \" since the feds began tracking it more than 40 years ago, per the times. American children are cutting back even more on calories, by an average of roughly 9 % since 2004. So how many calories are adults eating? per this 2013 study, \" adjusted mean energy intake... Declined to 2195 kcal/d during 2009 – 2010 \" from \" 2269 kcal/d during 2003 – 2004. \" non-diet soda consumption is down a whopping 25 % since the new millennium; that said, the average american is still buying 30 gallons of full-calorie soda annually, as of 2014. The calorie changes are biggest in households with children, probably because the fight against childhood obesity is having an impact, experts say. Most big demographic groups are seeing changes, though whites have cut back more than hispanics or blacks. Americans aren't exactly eating healthier — we still love desserts and don't eat many fruits or vegetables. The latter fact was made clear in the july 10 issue of the cdc's morbidity and mortality weekly report. It noted that only 13 % and 9 % of americans hit the recommended daily targets for fruit and vegetable consumption, respectively, reports livescience. More bad news: according to the cdc, 34.9 % or 78.6 million adult americans are obese. It cites obesity-related conditions like \" heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. \" in other health news, a canadian study shows that people who live in \" walkable \" neighborhoods weigh an average of seven pounds less than those who have to drive for most errands, the ottawa citizen reports.

Rubio perked up and continued the \" fireworks, \" as the washington post put it, telling the audience to google \" trump and polish workers \" about trump's hiring of foreign workers and how he'd been fined for it. Trump mentioned how it had been hard to find workers in the hottest parts of florida and that they were part-time seasonal workers. Enter cruz, who didn't waste his opportunity to jump in and note that he was leading the fight against amnesty in 2013 while trump was \" firing dennis rodman on celebrity apprentice, \" per the times. Trump's immediate eyeroll came in the form of: \" i've had an amazing relationship with politicians both democrat [ and ] republican because i was a businessman, \" he said, per the post. \" you get along with nobody, \" he told cruz. \" you don't have one republican senator backing you...

Australia's department of foreign affairs and trade says an investigation is now underway and any illegal items found will be returned to their country of origin, reports the australian ap. The west australian stressed howard took the artifacts — including some she found while volunteering on digs — \" before laws changed and it became legally difficult to do so. \" the unesco convention preventing illicit transport of such items, for instance, was passed in 1970. But the bbc reports individual countries howard visited have had similar laws on the books since the 1950s; egypt has had laws protecting its artifacts since the 1880s. Archaeologist monica hanna of egypt's heritage taskforce argues in an open letter that howard \" behaved as a pirate....

Per the guardian, the exomars trace gas orbiter, a joint effort by the european space agency and russia's roscosmos agency, launched on a proton rocket in what one manager called a \" picture book performance. \" its task will involve measuring trace levels of gases in the red planet's atmosphere, including methane, which is produced as a waste product by living creatures and has been detected on mars before. But \" other purely geological processes, such as the oxidation of certain minerals, also release methane, \" the esa website explains, meaning whether scientists will find alien insects ( perhaps ), piles of rocks ( maybe ), or full-blown martians ( unlikely ) is still not clear. The tgo, which is the first phase of the exomars mission ( a rover with a drill is set to be sent to mars in 2018 ), will take seven months to make the 308-million-mile trip. It will also be on the lookout for water vapor, nitrogen oxides, and acetylene, cnn notes. In mid-october, the craft's schiaperelli lander is scheduled to be released and touch down on mars'surface, which, if successful, would make it a first for any space agency other than nasa, sky and telescope reports; nasaspaceflight.com adds the beagle 2 probe was launched, and landed, in 2003, but a malfunction prevented communications with the lander. \" it's a milestone that caps off several years of preparation — designing, building, and testing the ground systems, preparing the flight operations procedures, and then finally an intensive period of team training, \" the mission operations head says in an esa press release.

But it's also settling ever so slowly on the ocean floor in the form of plankton poop. And because plastic-laden poop is lighter and falls more slowly than poop that is free of plastic, it has more time to be eaten up by other marine life in the process, report researchers from the university of exeter in the journal environmental science &amp; technology. \" this could be an important route by which floating plastic litter is removed from the sea surface down to the ocean depths, \" says the lead researcher of the lab experiments. \" the magnitude of change observed here is concerning. \" the researchers observed zooplankton ingesting microscopic bits of plastic floating around and then pooping what is, essentially, plastic-filled feces. Ordinarily such poop pellets help transport carbon and nutrients down to the ocean depths, but as researchers report in a press release, this plankton feces is not only not doing that, it's transporting plastic into the mouths of the marine life that ingest it as a food source. It's unclear what this means, and whether the team's lab tests will play out in real life, but as grist reports, \" we've already got a serious problem on our hands, and these slow-moving, structurally unsound fecal dumbwaiters aren't helping. \" ( see how one young man wants to clean up the plastic in our waters. )",

            "Plastic waste could find its way deep into the ocean through the faeces of plankton, new research from the university of exeter and plymouth marine laboratory shows. The study is further evidence of the widespread impact plastic pollution could have on the marine environment. Researchers have found tiny marine creatures called zooplankton readily ingest \" microplastics \", plastic debris smaller than one mm in size. This plastic is later egested within their faecal pellets. In the marine environment, faecal pellets help transport carbon and nutrients into deeper waters, helping the ocean store carbon and providing food for animals living within the water column. This new study showed plankton that ate polystyrene microplastics produced faeces that were lighter than normal and therefore sank more slowly. Because these pellets sink slower there will be greater opportunity for them to be eaten by animals. This is the first evidence that plastic polluting the ocean alters the structure, density and sinking rates of animals ' faecal pellets. Project leader dr matthew cole, from the college of life and environmental sciences said: \" as these faecal pellets sink, they take the plastic with them. This could be an important route by which floating plastic litter is removed from the sea surface down to the ocean depths. We now need to determine whether this is evident in the field. \" the magnitude of change observed here is",
            "Few things in this world are more terrifying than free-floating poop. It ranks just below megalodons, carnival cruises, and tequila shots as the biggest threat to swimmers worldwide. The mere sight of a floater is enough to ruin a perfectly good day at the beach. But a new study published in the journal environmental science and technology suggests that it might actually be the dookie we can't see that should worry us the most. According to the study, microscopic poop pellets that come from plankton can be chock full of plastic pollution. And when those pellets sink to the ocean depths, they bring that plastic with them, delivering it straight to the mouths of fish, crustaceans, and other organisms. Indeed, the researchers found that fecal pellets containing plastic tended to have lower densities and thus sank slower than non-polluted poop, providing more time for passing feeders to scoop them up. The plastic also appeared to hurt the poop's structural integrity, causing it to break apart more on the way down. Normally, this poop-as-transporter paradigm is a good thing. Like little fecal dumbwaiters, plankton poo has long been known to sink carbon and deliver nutrients and other bits of organic matter to organisms living at the bottom of the ocean. But when it comes to plastic, which has no business being in the ocean"

The study is further evidence of the widespread impact plastic pollution could have on the marine environment. Researchers have found tiny marine creatures called zooplankton readily ingest \" microplastics \", plastic debris smaller than one mm in size. This plastic is later egested within their faecal pellets. In the marine environment, faecal pellets help transport carbon and nutrients into deeper waters, helping the ocean store carbon and providing food for animals living within the water column. This new study showed plankton that ate polystyrene microplastics produced faeces that were lighter than normal and therefore sank more slowly. Because these pellets sink slower there will be greater opportunity for them to be eaten by animals. This is the first evidence that plastic polluting the ocean alters the structure, density and sinking rates of animals ' faecal pellets. Project leader dr matthew cole, from the college of life and environmental sciences said: \" as these faecal pellets sink, they take the plastic with them. This could be an important route by which floating plastic litter is removed from the sea surface down to the ocean depths. We now need to determine whether this is evident in the field. \" the magnitude of change observed here is",
            "Few things in this world are more terrifying than free-floating poop. It ranks just below megalodons, carnival cruises, and tequila shots as the biggest threat to swimmers worldwide. The mere sight of a floater is enough to ruin a perfectly good day at the beach. But a new study published in the journal environmental science and technology suggests that it might actually be the dookie we can't see that should worry us the most. According to the study, microscopic poop pellets that come from plankton can be chock full of plastic pollution. And when those pellets sink to the ocean depths, they bring that plastic with them, delivering it straight to the mouths of fish, crustaceans, and other organisms. Indeed, the researchers found that fecal pellets containing plastic tended to have lower densities and thus sank slower than non-polluted poop, providing more time for passing feeders to scoop them up. The plastic also appeared to hurt the poop's structural integrity, causing it to break apart more on the way down. Normally, this poop-as-transporter paradigm is a good thing. Like little fecal dumbwaiters, plankton poo has long been known to sink carbon and deliver nutrients and other bits of organic matter to organisms living at the bottom of the ocean. But when it comes to plastic, which has no business being in the ocean"

The court ruled in favor of adrian moncrieffe, a legal immigrant from jamaica who came to the us with his family when he was three years old. He was deported after police found enough marijuana in his car for two or three joints during a routine traffic stop, and a judge decided that the charge of \" possession with intent to distribute \" amounted to a federal felony.

Supreme court has ruled that a longtime legal resident of the united states was improperly deported for possession of a small amount of marijuana.

Adrian moncrieffe immigrated with his parents to the united states from jamaica in 1984. He was 3 years old at the time. He and his family were all legal residents.

His lawyer did not advise him that if he pled guilty he could be deported. The u.s. Supreme court has since required that lawyers give such information to defendants. Ignorant of the immigration consequences, moncrieffe accepted a plea deal under which he would avoid prison, and his conviction would be expunged after five years of satisfactory probation. The federal government, however, jailed and then deported him to jamaica, contending that under federal law, there was no discretion on the matter because moncrieffe had been convicted of an aggravated felony. Not so, said the court on tuesday, ruling that moncrieffe's georgia conviction was not in fact an aggravated felony, meaning that the government had discretion to forgo deportation.

Randy forbes ( va-04 ), chairman of the house armed services seapower and projection forces subcommittee, today released a bipartisan letter to secretary of defense chuck hagel on the importance of maintaining the u.s. Navy's eleven nuclear aircraft carrier fleet. The letter was signed by eleven members of congress. \"the secretary of the navy was right this past fall when he noted that a smaller aircraft carrier fleet would be unable to execute the missions described in the defense strategic guidance, \" congressman forbes said. \"such a reduction in the navy's carrier force would profoundly damage u.s. National security, limiting our ability to deter aggression around the world and respond to crises in a timely manner. It is unacceptable to pretend that the united states lives in anything less than an 11 carrier world given china's growing assertiveness in the asia-pacific, rising instability in the middle east and the persistent danger of global terrorism. As rear admiral moore has phrased it so starkly, we're an eleven carrier navy in a 15 carrier world. \" january 28, 2014 the honorable chuck hagel secretary of defense office of the secretary of defense 1000 defense pentagon washington, d.c. 20301 dear mr.

But though anthrax outbreaks aren't unusual in the area, this would appear to be the most significant such event in bwabwata. While a 2004 outbreak killed at least 180 hippos in uganda, reports the bbc, previous anthrax outbreaks in namibia in 2003 and 2004 affected only a small number of hippos and elephants, sikopo says. The estimated 109 dead hippos found in the past week represents roughly 8 % of namibia's hippo population, per the guardian. Sikopo says hippo carcasses are being burned \" to prevent further spreading of the disease, \" if present, and to ensure no person \" starts feeding on the meat. \" officials warn that crocodiles who've eaten some of the carcasses might already be affected, however.

Once we have the results of the cause of death than we can decide on the way forward, \" shifeta said. Anthrax is a bacterial disease commonly associated with arid climates like the african savannah, where it kills game, cattle and sometimes humans.

            "This article is over 1 year old namibia says anthrax could be to blame for deaths of more than 100 hippos more than 100 hippos have died in namibia in a remote national park in the past week, the country's environment minister said on monday, warning that anthrax could be to blame. Images from the bwabwata national park in north-east namibia showed dozens of lifeless hippos, some flat on their backs, others with just their heads visible above murky water. \"over 100 hippos died in the past week. The cause of death is unknown but the signs so far show that it could be anthrax, \" pohamba shifeta told afp. He said the toll could be higher as crocodiles might have eaten some of the carcasses. \"our veterinary services are currently working at the area to determine the cause of death. Once we have the results of the cause of death than we can decide on the way forward, \" shifeta said. Anthrax is a bacterial disease commonly associated with arid climates like the african savannah, where it kills game, cattle and sometimes humans. Government officials estimated that namibia's hippo population was around 1,300 before the mass death. The minister added that he would be alarmed if there were any further hippo deaths at the national park, which is one of the country's foremost tourist attractions",

When police officer christopher carter confronted him in an apartment complex, the student resisted arrest, grabbed his baton, and \" used it to hit the officer, \" according to the university.

Male characters participated in more than twice the number of conversations as female characters, and female characters tended to not be central to the film's plot. The situation was even worse for women of color and lgbt women. In 2016, 47 of the top 100 films had no black female characters, 66 had no asian women, 72 had no hispanic women, and 91 included no lgbt women. The study also found female characters were more positive and talked about family values, whereas male characters talked about achievement and cursed more, according to a press release. \"writers consciously or subconsciously agree to established norms about gender that are built into their word choices, \" women and hollywood quotes study author anil ramakrishna as saying.

Black women control the narrative in \"hidden figures \" and \"girls trip \" — and are interesting, flawed, and fully-formed characters. \"wonder woman \" allows robin wright and connie nielsen — women over 40 — to kick as much ass as gal gadot. Despite these advances in representation, a new study from usc viterbi school of engineering's signal analysis and interpretation lab ( sail ) found that stereotypes are still the status quo in film."

The reality is especially difficult to ignore in dadaab, a city in northern kenya experiencing its second-lowest rainfall in 60 years. Dadaab is home to the world's biggest refugee camp, which is built for 90,000 but may soon have to accommodate five times that many. About 1,300 people are streaming in every day, mostly from somalia. \"it is very close to a famine, \" says a director for a somali aid agency. An oxfam official calls it \"the worst food crisis of the 21st century, \" adding that \" two successive poor rains, entrenched poverty, and lack of investment in affected areas have pushed 12 million people into a fight for survival. \" the oxfam site has more information and ways to help here.",
