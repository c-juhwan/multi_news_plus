In a project overseen by astronomer carl sagan, the gold records were filled with sounds from earth, including music from bach and chuck berry, sounds of nature, and greetings in 55 languages, reports pitchfork. But most humans never got a chance to listen. Two copies are now in deep space with the voyager crafts, one was reserved for jimmy carter, and a handful of others were distributed to nasa centers, reports the new york times. Sagan himself couldn't even get one. As the 40th anniversary approaches, however, ozma records hopes to raise $ 198,000 to release vinyl copies. It looks poised to meet that goal. With 28 days left in its kickstarter campaign, it has already raised $ 155,000 from more than 1,300 backers as thursday. Those who donate $ 98 are promised a \" voyager golden record box set, \" complete with three vinyl lps in a cloth-covered box with gold foil inlay and a full-color book of images. Digital downloads are also available for $ 25. \" it is as relevant now as it was in 1977. Perhaps even more so, \" says boing boing editor david pescovitz, who's teamed up with amoeba music's timothy daly and graphic designer lawrence azerrad to produce the records. \" our hope is that this release … will provoke questions about our place in the universe, open our minds to possibility, and serve as a reminder that the future is really up to all of us. \" ( a tiny toy is one of kickstarter's most lucrative projects ever. )",

Polls show that donald trump has pulled ahead in the state, and analysts, some of whom describe indiana as cruz's last stand, say it will be almost impossible to stop trump reaching 1,237 delegates if he has a big win on tuesday. Indiana awards 30 delegates to the statewide gop winner and three to the winner of each of its nine congressional districts, adding up to 57 at stake. A roundup of coverage: fivethirtyeight calls the gop vote a \" desperate last stand for ted cruz and the #nevertrump movement \" and predicts that trump will win enough districts to have a sizable delegate haul even if cruz wins the state. Cruz's evangelical and conservative core supporters, however, are too concentrated geographically for him to sweep the state. Cruz has been throwing everything he's got at indiana, even naming a running mate, but trump has been boosted both by his attacks on trade deals, which resonate in this manufacturing-heavy state, and his increasing \" aura of inevitability, \" the washington post reports. \" the cruz team not only put all their chips in the indiana basket, but they made it very clear how desperate they've become. They have tried everything imaginable, \" gop operative pete seat tells the paper. \" it feels like this is slipping away from ted cruz pretty rapidly. \" the guardian reports that cruz was mocked monday by trump supporters who asked him if he was canadian and told him he wasn't wanted in the state. He also struggled to deal with a 12-year-old heckler who shouted, \" you suck! \" and \" shut up! \" before police removed the boy from the rally, cruz, who has two young daughters, said, \" in my household, when a child behaves that way they get a spanking. \" cruz said on monday that he is \" in for the distance, \" politico reports, but donors may prove unwilling to cough up more funds if he can't win on tuesday. \" if we lose indiana, we have to do some soul searching, \" and things are looking \" rough right now, \" according to a top cruz aide.

Now a plan to save the sage grouse that took years to negotiate is in danger. The trump administration announced this week it's reviewing the 2015 greater sage grouse conservation plan to address concerns from the 11 western states where the bird is found and give greater consideration to \" local economic growth and job creation, \" npr reports. According to reuters, interior secretary ryan zinke says he wants to give states concerned the conservation plan is too \" heavy-handed \" more \" flexibility \" in choosing how they protect the sage grouse. Environmentalists worry the sage grouse could be under greater threat than ever if the conservation plan is altered. The bird relies on sagebrush and is highly sensitive to development; everything from roads to cattle fences to wind turbines can hurt populations. The conservation plan controls commercial development on 67 million acres of federal land. It was opposed by the oil, gas, and mining industries, who claimed it could cost them billions in lost profits. Already two governors from sage grouse states have come out against changing the conservation plan, and the audubon society says zinke could be about to \" snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, \" the washington post reports.

A historic preservation worker noticed that the grass didn't grow so well in certain areas near the ancient monument, the bbc reports. It's possible that giant stones were once placed there, suggesting that the outer ring of the site may once have been a full circle. Tim daw made the discovery while gazing at the grass, \" thinking we needed to find a longer hosepipe to get the parched patches to green up. \" that's when he had \" a sudden lightbulb moment. \" \" i remembered that the marks were where archaeologists had looked without success for signs that there had been stone holes, and that parch marks can signify them, \" he notes. An earlier scientific survey of the site sought to investigate the full-circle theory, which has divided experts, the bbc notes; the survey found no sign of a full circle. \" i am still amazed and very pleased that simply really looking at something that tens of thousands of people had unwittingly seen can reveal secrets that sophisticated machinery can't, \" daw adds. Dry, hot periods can make such \" parch marks \" show up, the bbc notes: in the past, the telegraph reports, such weather has revealed remnants of roman forts and other ancient sites.

        "summary": "The one-man rampage yesterday that left two california deputies dead has a sad side note: one of the deputies was killed 26 years to the day that his father, also a deputy, died in the line of duty, reports the los angeles times. Placer county detective michael david davis jr., 42, was shot to death as he approached a vehicle with a wanted suspect inside. His father, also named michael david davis, was killed during a drug investigation in a helicopter accident in 1988. A fellow placer county deputy also got shot along with the younger davis, but he was treated and released. The other deputy killed yesterday was danny oliver, 47, from sacramento county, who was shot hours earlier when he approached a suspicious vehicle in a motel parking lot, reports the sacramento bee. Oliver's shooting set off a furious manhunt that involved at least two carjackings. It ended when marcelo marquez, 34, surrendered in auburn, along with a woman believed to be his wife. Police say a motorist who tried to stop marquez from stealing his car was shot in the head and is in serious condition. It was a \" perfect storm \" of violence, says sacramento county sheriff scott jones. And \"if the suspect is willing to shoot an officer — unprovoked — then no one is safe. \"",

Given the amount of the stuff that's already on the ground, the latest accumulation — which marks the third snowstorm in two weeks — could leave piles as high as 80 inches in some areas of the state, the boston globe reports.

Much of boston is shutting down, with schools closed today and tomorrow, nonessential city workers given today off, and 70 % of flights canceled at logan airport. Also on hold are the trials of dzhokhar tsarnaev and aaron hernandez. Meanwhile, the city is calling on residents and businesses for help clearing out the snow; not shoveling a sidewalk means a $ 50 fine. \" we don't have the ability to get to every single one, so we're really looking for help, \" says mayor martin walsh.

As the new york times reports, maduro worked \" himself into what seemed to be near hysteria, shouting until he was nearly out of breath, \" and compared the opposition to nazis, accusing them of plotting no less than a coup and civil war. Maduro — narrowly declared the winner of the presidential election — also accused the us of being behind post-election violence that government officials say has killed seven, the ap reports. Maduro vowed to block a march by supporters of capriles, who says he is the real winner of the election and has demanded a recount, the times adds. \" i will use a hard hand against fascism and intolerance, \" maduro vowed in one of the broadcasts. \" if they want to overthrow me, come and get me.

That prompted pleas from all over to the operator of the webcam, the biodiversity research institute, to intervene and save the struggling eaglet. But wildlife experts opted to let nature take its course and the bird died. Observers say it was cruel, but a state raptor specialist sums things up this way to the ap: \" the nest cam is more of a mirror to reflect what's going on with all eagle nests. It's not to be used as a baby monitor to intervene when we see something that makes us feel sad as humans. \" in this case, webcam observers argued that they hadn't seen the parents in a while and figured the nest had been abandoned. Nope, says another state specialist. It's common for adults to pull back as their chicks get older, and that's what happened here. An adult has since been spotted feeding the remaining eaglet, which now stands a better chance of survival given the lack of competition. In fact, much to webcam watchers'displeasure, the adult and the eaglet ate the remains of the bird that was killed, notes the los angeles times. \" the general view is not to intervene, \" says an official with the research institute. \" these are wildlife. They're not pets. \" ( researchers elsewhere caught a rarity on film: an eagle attacking a deer. )",

Here are the contests the pundits are watching: romney vs. Expectations: with romney's victory assured, pundits are speculating over his vote tally. One strategist tells politico he has to hit at least 38 % — john mccain's 2008 total. Romney himself managed 32 % in that contest, but anything nearly that low would raise serious questions now. Jon huntsman vs. Ron paul: this looks to be the battle for second place, and both have invested much here. If huntsman can bump off paul, he might get a second look, \" but that's a big if, \" writes gwen ifill at the national journal ( nate silver agrees ). Rick santorum vs. Newt gingrich: they're battling for fourth, and the winner might look like the conservative alternative heading into south carolina. Nationally, santorum is polling strong, jonathan bernstein of the washington post points out, so it ' ll be interesting to see if a new hampshire dud derails him. The polls vs. The public: new hampshire polls are notoriously unreliable; romney should prevail, but everything after him is up for grabs. The union leader vs. Momentum: did new hampshire's influential paper manage to boost the flailing gingrich? new hampshire vs. Conservatives: if romney, huntsman, and paul combine for 80 % of the vote, bernstein thinks republicans may decide they have a \" new hampshire problem, \" with an early-voting state too heavily weighted toward moderates.",

Facebook said last week that it will boost news sources that its users rank as most trustworthy, while shrinking the percentage of news posts overall in users ' news feeds. Murdoch, whose companies own the wall street journal, fox news, the new york post, and other media properties, said monday that publishers are \" enhancing the value and integrity of facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services. \" his full statement is here. Murdoch has previously criticized google for the \" theft \" of news stories without payment, per the ap. The news industry has struggled as print advertising erodes. Online, meanwhile, facebook and google dominate, together taking nearly half of global digital ad revenue, according to emarketer. At techcrunch, a post by jordan crook is critical of murdoch's proposal, calling it more \" mudslinging than muckraking. \" he adds: \" we're not saying facebook shouldn't be paying somebody something, but this isn't a realistic solution and i don't think murdoch really believes it is either. \"",

Lafferty — whose philosophy states the world is run by the devil and the apocalypse is imminent — says his ideology influenced their murder-suicide. Lafferty says their relationship began a decade ago after kristi strack read jon krakauer's book under the banner of heaven, which describes lafferty's 1984 killings of his sister-in-law and her 15-month old daughter. Lafferty tells the ap she began sending him letters, then visiting him in prison. He says they fell in love. \" my ' insanity ' messes with people's lives, \" lafferty says from prison, where he's serving a life sentence. \" it's just the way it is. \" at one point, she visited lafferty on a weekly basis — once giving him a photo of herself in her pajamas, he says — and the pair spent hours on the phone. Lafferty cut off his long hair and beard and mailed them to her. Benjamin strack visited, too, and wasn't bothered by lafferty's relationship with his wife, the ap reports. However, the meetings stopped in 2008 when the stracks pleaded guilty to forgery and drug possession and lost visiting privileges. Lafferty, who says he is the prophet elijah, tasked with readying the world for the second coming, adds the friendship ended for good because strack doubted those claims. \" i ' ll miss them, but i ' m happy for them, \" says lafferty, who hadn't spoken to the family in years. \" i believe they're in paradise now. \"",

            "British singer says she would appear at the ceremony if she could perform anti-lynching anthem popularized by billie holiday singer rebecca ferguson has said she would accept an invitation to perform at donald trump's inauguration on 20 january on one condition: she be allowed to sing strange fruit. First recorded by billie holiday in 1939 and covered by nina simone in 1965, strange fruit is one of the nation's most famous songs about racism. The lyrics by abel meeropol graphically describe the lynchings of african-americans: southern trees bear strange fruit blood on the leaves and blood at the root black bodies swinging in the southern breeze strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees ferguson – a british singer who became well-known after appearing on 2010's x factor in the uk, memorably performing sam cooke's civil rights anthem a change is gonna come – called strange fruit \"a song that speaks to all the disregarded and down trodden black people in the united states \" in a twitter statement introduced with the words \"inauguration ceremony \" explaining that she would appear at trump's inauguration only if she could sing that song: i've been asked and this is my answer. If you allow me to sing strange fruit, a song that has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the united states for being too controversial. A song that speaks to all the disregarded and downtrodden black people in the united states.

To put it another way, \" smelling farts could be the best thing you do today, \" as per cnet. As the independent explains, researchers at the university of exeter discovered that while hydrogen sulfide — the stuff produced in the gut that causes gas — is toxic in large doses, it's actually quite beneficial in smaller ones. Specifically, it preserves mitochondria, which are vital to cell life. \" although hydrogen sulfide is well known as a pungent, foul-smelling gas in rotten eggs and flatulence, it is naturally produced in the body and could in fact be a health care hero with significant implications for future therapies for a variety of diseases, \" say the exeter scientists. They're not asking people to sniff appropriately. Rather, they've developed a compound called ap39 designed to deliver just the right dose of the stuff to cells.

There are no visible differences between this starbucks and any other — like so many starbucks, this one often serves as a location for job interviews, though in this case, intraagency ones. ( one unnamed officer says a member of the team who hunted osama bin laden was recruited here. ) and as far as jobs go, the nine workers who staff this starbucks — having made it through \" rigorous interviews and background checks \" — get some pretty unusual instructions: like telling their boss if someone starts asking too many questions about their job ( not that they're allowed to say much beyond the fact that they work in a federal building ).

Under us law, the nsa can't eavesdrop on citizens ' conversations without a court order. But \" if the nsa knows how to do this, presumably other intelligence agencies, which may be more hostile to the united states, have discovered how to do this, too, \" an expert tells the washington post. Central to the issue is the fact that most telecommunications companies use encryption technology known as a5/1, despite experts ' advice that it's easy to hack. A5/1 is used extensively in 2g gsm networks, which most of the world uses. Though 3g and 4g networks have taken off in the us, a lot of phones stick with 2g when it comes to calls. In fact, 80 % of the planet's phones have weak encryption, or none at all, a berlin-based security expert tells the post. The nsa doesn't need an encryption key to get past a5/1, which, a berkely computer scientist notes, \" was designed 30 years ago, and you wouldn't expect a 30-year-old car to have the latest safety mechanisms. \" nbc news'take: \" if you're vulnerable, blame your carrier \": verizon and sprint use an even older system, cdma; the post isn't sure whether the nsa can easily break it.

As bloomberg's albert hunt explains, most of the push is coming from fiscal conservatives who want to add an amendment requiring a balanced budget or some other kind of financial discipline. Hunt thinks it's \" still not likely \" the movement will succeed, but what has critics and constitutional scholars worried nonetheless is the unprecedented nature of such a convention.

Cu rua, found dead tuesday in a hanoi lake, was a cultural and spiritual icon that represented the nation's independence, the new york times reports. The 360-pound creature also happened to die just as the communist party congress is meeting to select its senior leaders for the next five years. \" people say the turtle's death is bad luck, and a way for the gods to show that something's about to happen, \" says a buddhist temple caretaker near the lake where cu rua lived. Indeed, the bbc notes the party's propaganda department initially instructed the media not to report the sensitive news; the reversal came with instructions to communicate the death without commentary and in a scientific nature. Many saw cu rua as the manifestation of a legendary turtle that reclaimed a magical sword from a 15th-century vietnamese hero who had fought off chinese occupiers. Cu rua was also said to appear during major events in vietnam's history, like hanoi's 1,000th anniversary, the bbc reports. \" the turtle was a sacred animal for us hanoians, \" writes a facebook user in vietnam. \" such sadness, such regret. \" it's also sad for wildlife experts, who say cu rua was one of only four known yangtze giant soft-shell turtles, cnn reports.

Its age was unknown, but media reports estimate cu rua was around 80 to 100 years old.",

The 20,000 villagers of wukan in southern china have chased off their communist leaders and are now encircled in a police cordon, reports the telegraph. Supplies are running low, though villagers are smuggling in relief from at least one neighboring town. They're also arming themselves and bracing for a fight, notes the new york times. The dispute goes back to september, when village officials ( the ones who have since fled ) took land from farmers and gave it to developers. Residents say they got ripped off in the deal and staged protests that were put down with great force by police. Tensions exploded anew this week when one of the villagers sent to negotiate with the communist party died in police custody. Village demands are pretty straightforward: \" we want them to admit responsibility for the bloodshed when the riot police beat us in september, admit that we have a legal complaint, admit that the village representatives are a legal negotiating team, and to return all of our land to us, for us to split evenly among the villagers. \"",

Police say the teen, who is white, was shot dead within a minute of officers arriving at the high school. Police say they didn't realize until after the shooting that the 911 caller — who told dispatchers the teen was unarmed — had been the boy himself. Both officers fired their weapons, and police say body camera footage will be examined as part of the investigation.

But propelled by an eagerness for a major hollywood film led by asian stars, crazy rich asians is showing almost unprecedented legs. It was helped by weak competition. The critically slammed r-rated puppet caper the happytime murders debuted with $ 10.1 million, a career-low for melissa mccarthy. The robot-dog fantasy a.x.l. Flopped with $ 2.9 million. Holdovers did ok, with mega-shark flick the meg banking another $ 13 million, followed by mission: impossible — fallout ( $ 8 million ) and christopher robin ( $ 6.3 million ), per the hollywood reporter.",

Convicted of two counts of criminal negligence causing death and two counts of dangerous driving causing death, emma czornobaj, 26, faced a maximum life sentence — though the prosecution asked for far less. Usa today reported that it wanted 9 months; instead, czornobaj was handed a 90-day sentence she can serve on weekends starting in january. She ' ll also need to complete 240 hours of community service, be on probation for 5 years, and is barred from driving for 10 years. The montreal gazette reports she was ordered to immediately hand over her driver's license.

And she's sticking to that contentious conviction. The rightwing pundit defended her eye-brow raising claims on tuesday in the aftermath of accusations that republican presidential candidate herman cain sexually harassed two women in the ' 90s. Shortly after the charges were launched, coulter went on a tirade claiming cain is a victim of the liberal mainstream media and insisted the attacks were akin to \" high-tech lynching. \" \" our blacks are so much better than their blacks, \" coulter told fox news. \" to become a black republican, you don't just roll into it. You're not going with the flow. You have fought against probably your family members, probably your neighbors, you have thought everything out and that's why we have very impressive blacks in our party. \" hln's joy behar questioned coulter's remarks on tuesday evening, asking if she believed \" all the african americans who are democrats are stupid? \" \" no, \" a testy coulter answered. \" i ' m saying google maxine waters, cynthia mckinney, john conyers, and then google allen west, michael steele or herman cain....

The company said it would stop picking up customers there for three months after the city sued, asking a judge to order uber to stop operating until it is in compliance with safety, health and consumer protection rules. But uber fully expects to be back. In fact, this could be good news for uber fans in the long-run. The city has agreed to update its laws, creating a new regulatory framework for companies like uber that tend to fall somewhere between a taxi and a ridesharing service. People use it by requesting a driver with a smartphone app. Related: uber's global ambitions hit roadblocks uber, which operates in 60 cities across 21 countries, has run into problems because its drivers do not always meet the city's regulations for taxi and car services.

            "Uber is standing down for the next three months in portland, just one of the cities where it has run into trouble. The company said it would stop picking up customers there for three months after the city sued, asking a judge to order uber to stop operating until it is in compliance with safety, health and consumer protection rules. But uber fully expects to be back. In fact, this could be good news for uber fans in the long-run. The city has agreed to update its laws, creating a new regulatory framework for companies like uber that tend to fall somewhere between a taxi and a ridesharing service. People use it by requesting a driver with a smartphone app. Related: uber's global ambitions hit roadblocks uber, which operates in 60 cities across 21 countries, has run into problems because its drivers do not always meet the city's regulations for taxi and car services.

In the clip, the young bull elk butts heads with a photographer for quite a while, without hurting the man. But park officials euthanized the animal on friday, fearing it could injure someone else, the asheville citizen-times reports. And though they say the issues with the elk pre-dated the video — the animal had grown accustomed to eating \" people food \" — officials admit the oct. 20 clip was a \" critical step in the decision-making. \" that's because it marked the first proof they had of the elk actually making physical contact with a visitor. Officials say they first tried to \" haze \" the creature 28 times since september, reports nbc news, attempting to scare it with firecrackers and pelt it using bean bag guns to change its opinion of humans. They also tried moving it elsewhere in the park. Apparently, neither technique deterred it, and the decision was made to put it down, a first for the park. The photographer and the man who posted the video say they're upset with the move. \" it has certainly pulled a black cloud over this whirlwind ' viral video ' experience, \" writes vince camiolo, who took the video, in the description on youtube. Adds photographer and head-buttee james york: \" i am deeply hurt by the loss of such a beautiful creature that in its own way bonded with me. I looked forward to watching him grow to a mature bull as the years passed. \" but york tells nbc news he's \" tired of being blamed \" for the animal's death, noting that the animal approached him — in a spot he had been sitting in for an hour.",

The aisle seats in the chamber have become hot commodities in recent years, with less-well-known legislators clamoring for a rare chance to, literally, reach out and touch the president — and be on tv, the washington post reports. The aisle seats are so sought-after, in fact, that house leaders have laid down some ground rules: for one thing, you have to actually be sitting in a seat in order to reserve it, meaning that your elected members of congress wait about 10 to 12 hours, one congressman estimates, for just a few seconds with the president as he walks down the aisle. They're known as \" aisle hogs, \" the new york daily news notes. So what do they say to the president during those all-important few moments? some, like rep. Gk butterfield, keep it simple: \" i said,'don't forget us in north carolina! '... And he would say, ' how could i? ' \" others, like rep. Eliot engel ( who's been hogging the aisle since 1989 ), have a specific topic in mind: \" stand by israel, now, \" he used to tell george w. Bush. And staunchly anti-war dennis kucinich may have been a critic of bush, but when he walked by during the iraq war, kucinich used his few seconds to tell the president, \" i wish you peace. \" what's the payoff? a bit of recognition back home, explains former rep and longtime aisle sitter dale kildee. \" people would say, ' gosh, i saw you shaking hands with the president.'so you had that advantage. \" ( click to see some of the notable guests at this year's address. )",

Yes, coverage tends to be of the superficial \" horse race \" variety and too many reporters covet \" insider \" status, but stray's complaint goes deeper. He thinks we have a far too narrow view of what \" politics \" means. The word encompasses more than candidates and government, he writes. The true meaning involves actual people and the way they want to change their communities. Unfortunately, \" most politics coverage is about politicians, not the things i care about and the actions i could take. \" it's the reason young people are tuning out of traditional politics, writes stray. They're not apathetic — they've just learned that social change is more likely to come about through ways beyond electoral politics. If the political press wants to stay relevant, it better pay attention. \" i want political journalism to help me better understand how to change the world to my liking, by acting with other people who want the same thing, \" writes stray. \" i want it to be about me and my community, and our aspirations, and what we could do to make them real. \" in short, \" political journalism should be politically empowering.

A refresher: tarantino's script for the hateful eight was leaked; tarantino freaked out; gawker's defamer posted a link to the leaked script; tarantino freaked out some more and sued gawker. In response, john cook at gawker lays out six points, including this big one: in cook's view, tarantino wants the script online. That's cook's interpretation of what tarantino originally said to deadline about the script leak: \" i do like the fact that everyone eventually posts it, gets it and reviews it on the net. Frankly, i wouldn't want it any other way. I like the fact that people like my s ---, and that they go out of their way to find it and read it. \" plus, cook points out, tarantino was the one who turned the leak into a huge story, giving an attention-grabbing interview about it back when it was just circulating in hollywood, before it had been posted online. And then there's the fact that gawker didn't leak the script in the first place, it just learned where the script had been posted and directed readers there. ( cook actually makes this point multiple times. ) finally, cook concludes, the link to the script is news, and thus fair game for publication, particularly since tarantino himself made it news. \" we ' ll be fighting this one, \" cook writes.

She learned that nuvaring maker merck made $ 623 million selling nuvaring last year, despite users who developed terrifying blood clots and filed roughly 3,500 lawsuits. Saddest of all is the story of erika langhart, who was found writhing on the floor on the monday before thanksgiving. \" was your daughter using birth control? \" asked a doctor when she was admitted to er. \" i thought so, because she's having a pulmonary embolism. \" langhart died, and the program at her memorial service reads, \" cause of passing: massive, double pulmonary embolism — a direct result of the nuvaring. \" a danish study only heightened concerns by analyzing health records of over a million women, and concluding that nuvaring users were far more likely to get blood clots than women who didn't use hormonal contraceptives. Even nuvaring admits to a blood-clot problem. So how did nuvaring get past the fda? by burying the bad news in one of 500 studies, according to a lawyer who is suing merck. \" when the fda comes back to the drug company, the drug company can say, ' you had it in your documents, ' \" he said. \" if it isn't in the 30-page summary, the fda is so understaffed it will never be noticed. \" click for brenner's full piece.",

The new york times reports that 88 retired military figures — described by retired army lt. Gen. Michael t. Flynn as a group of \" national security professionals \" — have placed their john hancocks on an open letter set to be released tuesday and endorsing the gop nominee. \" the 2016 election affords the american people an urgently needed opportunity to make a long-overdue course correction in our national security posture and policy, \" which can only be done by someone who hasn't been complicit in the \" hollowing out of our military, \" notes the letter, which was coordinated by holocaust survivor and army veteran maj. Gen. Sidney shachnow and the navy's rear adm. Charles williams. The letter seems to be trump's way to \" blunt the edge, \" as the times puts it, of possible support for hillary clinton from foreign policy aces who have already rejected him. The signatories, who seem to support trump's past and present stances on a variety of issues, include everyone from a retired air force lieutenant general who happens to be an obama birther to an ex-army official known for making inflammatory remarks about islam. \" we support donald trump and his commitment to rebuild our military, to secure our borders, to defeat our islamic supremacist adversaries, and restore law and order domestically, \" the letter says. \" we urge our fellow americans to do the same. \" in a campaign statement, trump called the endorsements a \" great honor, \" per politico.

The closure came as a shock to the close to 230 workers at the plant who say they were told to pick up their final paychecks friday.

The 59-year-old, who killed himself at his family's burial plot on friday, won the rochester-area district's gop primary with a vote of around 58 % to 41 % for honeoye falls mayor richard milne, politico reports. It will now be up to party leaders in the district — who did not withdraw their endorsement after nojay's death — to choose a candidate to be on the ballot, the democrat &amp; chronicle reports. Before the primary, local republican leaders said voting for nojay was a good way to honor his memory. Milne said they just wanted to get their own candidate elected. Politico notes that milne is unlikely to be the choice of the local gop both because of his moderate positions and the fact that he just lost an election to a dead man. The guardian reports that nojay — who had been accused of embezzling $ 1.8 million from a legal client, among other things — is the latest in a long line of dead american politicians to win elections, including hawaii's rep.

That person will go on to face democrat barbara baer, a lawyer and social worker who is running unopposed, in the general election. Lowell conrad, the chairman of the livingston county republican party, told the times he hoped to find someone \"as close to him as possible, philosophically \" to take nojay's place.

        "summary": "Scientists have been pondering why people who lived on easter island ( or rapa nui ) appear to have eaten palm trees — a primary crop, reports nature world news — for several centuries when other research suggests the plant went extinct right around the time of colonization in the 13th century. The answer may have just been found in tooth plaque. It turns out that the 30 teeth scientists analyzed, which were taken from excavations at several coastal sites in the early 1980s, had plaque with starch grains that line up well with the modern sweet potato, reports phys.org. By studying actual modern sweet potatoes grown in soil similar to rapa nui's, they also found that the tuber skins took on palm phytoliths from the soil, explaining why original analyses suggested palm was part of the diet. This marks the first time biological anthropologists have studied dental calculus in the pacific, and they say it makes a case for taking into consideration the environments the plants were grown in and not just the plants themselves. ( meanwhile, genetic data suggests easter islanders were not as isolated as once thought. )",

The journal reports that google shares the same policy, but gizmodo says it spoke with a google rep who clarified there wasn't a formal date-request count set in its policy. Reaction to the tidbit was varied. Breitbart news calls the policy \" dystopian. \" at slate, susan matthews calls it a \" quietly radical \" policy. \" at its heart, the policy echoes the principles of affirmative consent that so often get their college-age adherents mercilessly mocked — that consent should be energetic and unambiguous. \" ( this first date allegedly ended extremely badly. )",

        "summary": "Gambia's opposition candidate has defeated longtime ruler yahya jammeh — a man who in 2011 said he was prepared to rule for a billion years — in the west african country's presidential vote. It's an upset victory that could lead to the country's first transfer of power in more than two decades. Gambians voted thursday by placing marbles into drums marked for each candidate. Adama barrow won 263,515 votes, or 45 % of the total, while jammeh finished in second with 36 %, and a third candidate received 17 %, the head of the election commission announced friday. Eight opposition parties united behind barrow, a former businessman, and the campaign featured large opposition rallies and unprecedented expressions of frustration with jammeh's rule. Nevertheless, jammeh had projected confidence, predicting \" the biggest landslide in the history of the country \" after he voted on thursday. Jammeh came to power in a coup in 1994 and then swept elections in 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011 after a 2002 constitutional amendment removed presidential term limits. Critics say those earlier elections were not free and fair. Human rights groups have accused jammeh of ordering the deaths of countless political opponents as well as targeting journalists and gays and lesbians. If jammeh agrees to step down peacefully, it would demonstrate that even africa's most entrenched leaders can be brought down if opposition politicians overcome their divisions and unite, a human rights activist tells the ap. \" this is going to have resonance way beyond the tiny borders of gambia. \"",

        "summary": "A display featuring the titanosaur — a 122-foot-long, 70-ton sauropod — opened to the public friday at the american museum of natural history in new york, reports the wall street journal. It's the biggest dinosaur ever discovered, as far as many paleontologists are concerned. But, writing for fivethirtyeight.com, david goldenberg recalls the tale of one that was supposedly larger: amphicoelias fragillimus. Based on the reported 1877 discovery of a nearly 5-foot-tall piece of vertebra by a schoolteacher outside of cañon city, colo., amphicoelias would have been 190 feet long. But that piece of vertebra — the sole evidence that amphicoelias existed — has been missing for more than a century. After its discovery, the bone was shipped to philadelphia ( it was on a freight train manifest ), and renowned paleontologist edward drinker cope published a paper about it. When cope died in 1897, his collection was sent to the american museum of natural history. Upon cataloging the collection, the museum couldn't find the vertebra. Some have claimed that cope made it up to outshine a rival. ( this slate piece has details on that famous feud. ) one skeptic, cary woodruff, tells goldenberg he thinks the estimate of amphicoelias ' huge size is based on a typo: cope wrote that the vertebra was 1500mm when he meant 1050mm. Cope realized the error, woodruff believes, but kept quiet about it to avoid humiliation. In an earlier report, motherboard notes that studying the dinosaur based on cope's notes alone is unsatisfactory, so amphicoelias doesn't get counted among the biggest dinosaurs. But the matter is far from settled. \" large-dinosaur sleuths, \" goldenberg writes, still make their way to the american museum of natural history in search of clues about the elusive amphicoelias. ( an excavation at a school in scotland turned up remains believed to belong to a pirate. )",
