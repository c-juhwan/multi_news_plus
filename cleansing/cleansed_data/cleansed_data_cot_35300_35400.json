        "summary": "Cameron todd willingham was executed in texas in 2004 after being convicted of an especially heinous crime: murdering his three young daughters in a fire. But a decade later, the innocence project says newly discovered documents suggest something else heinous: the state killed an innocent man. As the new york times explains, the prosecution's case relied on the testimony of jailhouse informant johnny webb, who claimed that willingham had confessed to him. The innocence project says webb lied to strike a deal for a lighter sentence on his own robbery charges, and it uncovered a note in webb's file dictating that his charges were to be reduced \" based on coop in willingham, \" reports the guardian. During webb's testimony, he and the prosecution denied any such deal was in place. The ap tracks down the lead prosecutor in the case, who still denies it. \" the file may certainly reflect that we tried to get sentencing shortened, but it had nothing to do with any agreement relative to the willingham trial, \" says john jackson, who went on to become a judge and is now retired. The innocence project has filed an appeal with the state pardon board to have willingham exonerated, but the ultimate decision will be made by gov. Rick perry or his successor. Perry called willingham a \" monster \" 10 years ago in allowing his execution to take place, and a spokesperson says his position hasn't changed. Still, \" we ' ll see what happens, \" says willingham's stepmother. \" i can't help but be hopeful. \"",

Researchers then tracked the girls through age 20 and found that girls who'd lugged the doll around were 36 % more likely to get pregnant than girls who hadn't. And only 54 % of the realcare \" moms \" who got pregnant in real life had an abortion compared with 60 % of those who didn't use the dolls and ended up getting pregnant. One red flag about the doll's anti-pregnancy impact: although some of the girls handling the dolls seemed irritated by their virtual babies — one even reportedly abandoned the doll in a garden shed — brinkman says most of the teens didn't want to give the dolls back. Realityworks said in a statement to abc that the study isn't a reflection of how well its product works, as its fully comprehensive program involves more classroom time — and more at-home time with the fake baby — than the abridged program used by researchers.

A local community leader tells the detroit free press that \" hamtramck has made history \" with a contest that wasn't even close among the six candidates vying for three seats. Anam miah and abu musa, incumbent city councilmen, each got more than 1,000 votes, as did newbie saad almasmari, while the other three candidates garnered fewer than 700 votes each. Because census reports don't ask about religion, it's not clear what the muslim population of hamtramck is, though estimates run between 30 % and 50 %, the free press notes. Only 12 % of the populace remains polish, per us census figures cited by the paper, with arabs making up 24 %, african americans 19 %, and bangladeshis 15 %. It's not the first time muslims in hamtramck have made their mark. In 2004, the city oked the muslim call to prayer being broadcast from mosques ' loudspeakers, spurring some noise complaints, per the free press. And muslim organizer ibrahim algahim is making waves via a cellphone video in which he reportedly said of election results, \" today we show the polish and everybody else. \" that prompted a losing candidate to tell fox 2 detroit, \" i ' m shocked that he said that.

The good is that shepherds in a drought-stricken region near the city of gafsa stumbled upon an amazing thing: a brand-new lake that surfaced in an otherwise barren territory, reports news.com.au. It's spectacular, with rocks perfect for diving and water up to 65 feet deep, which is why hundreds of people have been flocking daily to so-called \" gafsa beach \" since it was discovered three weeks ago. Oh, but the bad news: the water might kill you. \" this lake is located in an area rich in phosphate deposits, which leave residue that is sometimes strongly radioactive, \" warns a report in tunisia daily by lakhdar souid, as quoted in the times of india. \" so there is a real risk the water is contaminated and carcinogenic. \" it's also a little worrisome that it's gone from clear blue to hazy green, \" meaning that the water is stagnant and conducive to diseases, \" says souid. Last week, the government warned that the lake was unfit for swimming, reports france24, but it did not put an official ban into place as testing continues. No word yet on how the lake formed, but one theory is that some kind of seismic activity — perhaps related to the local phosphate mining industry — jolted the water table.

In a statement posted to his facebook page on saturday, the ex-green bay packers qb wrote that he had received a request through the \" cameo \" app to record what he believed was a message of support for a veterans group. According to cameo's terms of service, users can buy personalized video messages from celebrities and athletes. Favre, who had to approve the message, receives $ 500 for each recording.

Though hughes surrendered without issue, authorities were ready to shoot him if the copter came any closer to the capitol, the ap reports. Minutes before hughes landed, a times reporter informed the secret service and capitol police about the scheme, which the paper learned about last year. Officials said they hadn't been notified of the plan, though a secret service agent interviewed hughes about it twice in october 2013, when hughes posted about it on his website. The agency says a \" complete and thorough investigation was conducted. \" the faa is now investigating. Hughes, meanwhile, believed the risks were worth the reward: the media turning a spotlight on campaign finance reform, which he called for in each of the 535 letters he carried in his copter. \" i don't believe that the authorities are going to shoot down a 61-year-old mailman in a flying bicycle, \" he told the times, but added, \" i'd rather die in the flight than live to be 80 years old and see this country fall. \" his son's suicide three years ago reportedly spurred hughes ' plan. \" he paid far too high a price for an unimportant issue, \" he said. \" but if you're willing to take a risk, the ultimate risk, to draw attention to something that does have significance, it's worth doing. \"",

After an 11-month investigation, a federal prosecutor determined mikhail lesin died after falling down drunk multiple times and closed the case. Now a 58-page police report is shedding new light — and raising more questions — on the death of vladimir putin's media czar. The report, which was released this week by dc's metropolitan police department, includes a timeline from the hotel where lesin was staying, the washington post reports. Apparently the founder of rt had been drinking heavily for his three-day stay, taking bottles of liquor from the hotel bar, and walking through the hotel in his underwear. He also had a visible injury to his eye on the night before his body was found. Among the details redacted from the report: lesin's autopsy. It remains unclear how his death was ruled an accident. The report also fails to mention anything about blunt force trauma or lesin falling down, buzzfeed reports. And a disc containing security footage from the hallway outside his room in the hours before his death was apparently defective. Police have not said whether they were ever able to view the footage. Buzzfeed had previously reported on three fbi agents and an intelligence officer who said lesin was beaten to death the night before he was going to be interviewed by the department of justice about the workings of rt. There are also reports lesin had angered powerful figures in russia.

        "summary": "New york fire department battalion chief lawrence stack was laid to rest friday — nearly 15 years after he died when the world trader center collapsed on sept. 11, 2001, the new york times reports. Stack was helping an injured business man from iowa when the north tower collapsed, killing him. His family had been holding off on a funeral in the hopes his remains would eventually be found. Only 65 % of the remains recovered in the wake of sept. 11 have been identified — the rest are too damaged — and a catholic funeral mass requires some part of the deceased to be present. According to cbs new york, that problem was finally solved when a vial of stack's blood was found in storage in minnesota. Stack had donated it during a bone marrow drive for a boy with cancer 18 months before 9/11. The vial of stack's blood was buried with his casket friday after a service on long island, wabc reports. He received a full fdny sendoff, complete with bagpipes and a procession. In attendance were mayor de blasio, the fdny commissioner, and thousands of firefighters. It was the first funeral for a firefighter killed on sept. 11 in a decade. \"this is all about never forgetting — 15 years later, never forget, \" a firefighter at the funeral tells cbs. The 58-year-old stack was a navy veteran who served in the vietnam war. He was with the fdny for nearly 33 years before his death, and both his sons are now firefighters. He was one of 343 members of the fdny killed on sept. 11. ( the last rescue dog from sept. 11 was euthanized this month. )",

One rebel leader says a total of seven brigadier generals have now joined the opposition. The ap also notes four military defections, though the ranks are different. Regardless, rebels are trumpeting the developments as further proof that bashar al-assad's grip on power is unraveling.

That's what's now on the menu for restaurant brands international, the owner of burger king and tim hortons that just raided the fast-food henhouse to buy the popeyes louisiana kitchen chain for nearly $ 1.65 billion, per the wall street journal. ( cnnmoney and bloomberg put the sale price closer to $ 1.8 billion. ) the company's majority owner, brazilian private-equity firm 3g capital partners lp, jumped onto this fast-food deal right after its failed attempts to form what the journal calls a \" global packaged goods juggernaut. \" the equity group had backed kraft heinz in its $ 143 billion offer to scoop up unilever, but the deal fell through over the weekend, per the ap. Part of the popeyes game plan, which would stay in line with restaurant brands ' past maneuvers, will be to expand the chicken chain into international markets, especially since \" spicy flavors, chicken, and rice tend to travel well, \" a bloomberg intelligence analyst says. The acquisition should also help the company up its game against competitors wendy's, mcdonald's, and yum brands, which owns kfc. Restaurant brands ceo daniel schwartz tells bloomberg that popeyes — which fortune notes boasts nearly 2,700 stores worldwide, with most in the us — will keep its headquarters in atlanta, and existing staff will stay intact for now. The deal is expected to close in april. ( if this guy still works for popeyes, it makes the deal extra sweet. )",

        "summary": "If today's men think that all those video games are helping them maintain optimal hand strength, they'd better think again. In a series of studies testing grip and pinch strength, researchers report in the journal of hand therapy that among the 237 healthy millennials studied between the ages of 20 and 34, men today are significantly weaker than their counterparts of the ' 80s. Specifically, men could squeeze with 120 pounds of force in 1985 and only 95 today, reports today.com. The strength of women dropped off, too, but not as substantially. The prime reason, the researchers propose, is that men are simply less handy — fewer work in manual labor jobs, hence the reduction in strength over these past three decades, reports the san francisco chronicle. They measured hand strength because it can be indicative of overall body strength, and weaker hands have been linked to anything from heart disease and stroke to arthritis. Men's fitness pointed out that this essentially means modern bros are wimpier than their dads and suggest that they start doing some grip strength workouts.

Fain explained that today's males are weaker because today, fewer of them work in manual labor jobs — jobs which have historically and statistically been held by men. As a result, their strength has diminished over time while women's tests don't show as substantial a decline. Reduced hand strength not only indicates a weak overall body, but can be linked to arthritis, heart disease, and strokes.

They did so, and an estimated 800,000 people were massacred in 100 days. \"it's clear, in hindsight, that the pullout of peacekeeping was the green light for genocide, \" says tom blanton of the national security archive at george washington university. It obtained the 300 cables along with the holocaust museum and was highlighting them this week at a conference in the hague on what world leaders did, and did not, do to stop the killing. ( you can access the full trove here. ) the cables show that bill clinton's white house — still stung from the \" black hawk down \" disaster in somalia only months earlier — pushed to remove the vast majority of the peacekeepers. One of the cables is from un ambassador madeleine albright instructing the state department to take that position. Albright recalls that she had been swayed by african criticism that a withdrawal would be a mistake, but she failed to convince the white house. \"i was an instructed ambassador, not the secretary of state, but i do wish i had argued harder, \" albright tells the times. The security council voted on april 21, 1994, to reduce the force from 2,100 troops to 270, and the canadian leader of the force wrote that those who remained were \" standing knee-deep in mutilated bodies. \" still classified are internal white house emails, which would shed further light on us decision-making.",

In her april 12 cable, ms. Albright said there was a \"window of opportunity \" to withdraw the bulk of the force because the airport in the capital, kigali, was still under the control of belgian and french troops.

That woman is 22-year-old kaylee moats, who tells barcroft tv that when she was 18, her 12-year-old sister got her first period, but moats still hadn't. Concerned, she went to the doctor, where she discovered the shocking reason underlying the issue: per live science, moats was told she had a rare genetic disorder called mayer-rokitansky-kuster-hauser ( mrkh ) syndrome, which affects one out of every 4,500 female babies, leaving her without a vagina, uterus, or cervix ( they never develop fully, or at all, in utero ). Because women with this disorder are genetically female and typically have normal-looking outside genitalia, they often don't realize they even have this condition until their menstrual cycle fails to start. There are various remedies available, including enlarging an underdeveloped vagina with a \" dilator, \" or by having surgery that reconstructs the vagina or implants a new one ( this last option is still experimental ). Moats is ready for reconstructive surgery, but her insurance considers it cosmetic surgery or a gender reassignment and won't cover the $ 15,000 cost. So her sister amanda set up a gofundme page, raising more than $ 17,000 so far for the procedure itself, as well as for counseling and hotel and flight expenses to the atlanta area, where the procedure will take place. In the meantime, with cash coming in from strangers, a supportive family and boyfriend — \" he accepts me for who i am \" — and hopes that she can one day be a mom via a gestational surrogate, moats is staying positive. \" i ' m still trying to accept myself, accept what i have, and not dwell on it, \" moats says in the video.",

However, each has been found in only a few affected individuals, and it is unclear whether these changes cause mrkh syndrome. Researchers are working to determine how genetic changes might lead to problems with reproductive system development in females. The reproductive abnormalities of mrkh syndrome are due to incomplete development of the müllerian duct. This structure in the embryo develops into the uterus, fallopian tubes,",

In it, she described being too sick to eat the day prior, but having felt better and attending a church service that morning — on board the rms titanic, which sunk early the next morning. Hart's husband, benjamin, never had a chance to mail the letter before he perished, the bbc reports. Hart reportedly found it inside his jacket after she and daughter eva were rescued — the jacket he had given her to keep her warm when he put her in a lifeboat as the boat sank. The letter will be auctioned april 26 in england. The letter is \" the only known surviving example of its type to have been written on that fateful day, surviving the sinking, and having belonged to such a well-known survivor, \" says an auctioneer at henry aldridge &amp; son. It was written on titanic stationery embossed with the white star line's flag logo and the header, \" on board rms'titanic. ' \" the handwritten dateline reads, \" sunday afternoon. \" one line details the claim that the ship was not supposed to roll: \" anyhow it rolls enough for me, \" hart wrote.

Never one to shy away from controversy, the artist borrowed the girl who famously appears in promos for les miserables and added tears streaming down her cheeks, ostensibly due to the tear gas canister at her feet. It's banksy's statement against the so-called \" jungle \" camp in calais, france, where authorities have reportedly used tear gas to try to evict hundreds of refugees so they can raze part of the camp, per the guardian. The mural is high tech, too, in what the paper says is a first for banksy's street displays: viewers who scan the qr code in one of the corners will be taken to a video that seems to show refugees in the camp being bombarded with rubber bullets and tear gas in an early january raid, per the bbc. The mural, which showed up on the side of what the bbc calls a \" large complex \" on saturday, isn't banksy's first artistic protest against the european refugee crisis: he's also behind the steve-jobs-as-syrian-refugee mural that recently showed up in calais, as well as a re-creation of the 19th-century painting the raft of the medusa, showing survivors on a raft trying to flag down a luxury yacht, per the guardian. A calais police rep told the paper last week \" it's not in our interest to use tear gas unless it's absolutely necessary to restore public order, and it is never used in the camp itself, \" but skepticism remains. The director of the property group in charge of the building where the mural appears tells the bbc the company is \" discussing future plans for the artwork \"; others are simply raving about the beauty and importance of such a piece. \" to see interesting art, you don't have to go to a gallery; you just have to walk the streets, \" suzanne moore writes for the guardian. \" street art reminds us both of what we have to fight for, and what we have lost. \" ( and then there's dismaland. )",

        "summary": "Some male marsupials have quite the end-of-life experience: they \" mate themselves to death, \" explains the lead author of a new study in the journal pnas. Researchers found that in some insect-eating species, the males buck themselves up for one grand finale, then mate with as many partners as possible in sessions that last up to 14 hours, reports the bbc. And then, all pooped out, they die. That kind of behavior — called suicidal reproduction, or semelparity — is more common with creatures such as fish or spiders, but it's rare in mammals, notes livescience. Scientists first observed the trait in marsupials years ago, but the new study fills in some details and suggests a reason to explain it: these \" suicidal \" males try to win the reproduction sweepstakes first by creating high-quality sperm ( they even have larger testes than their non-suicidal peers ) and then by making sure their sperm is delivered to as many females as possible. During the marathon mating sessions, they expend themselves so thoroughly that their muscles break down to provide needed energy. The ultimate winners: lady marsupials. \" females are all for this, \" the lead scientist tells national geographic, \" because they get the best fathers for their young by mating promiscuously and letting the best sperm win. \"",

Lauren hill, of mount st. Joseph's basketball team, has a type of brain cancer known as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. But that didn't stop her from scoring four points in the game via two memorable baskets: she scored one with her non-dominant left hand, which she's been using because her tumor makes using her right hand difficult. But \" the second basket was even more awesome because i made it with my right hand, \" she says. After her first successful layup, the game — whose date was moved up to accommodate hill — was paused, and hill was awarded the game ball. \" thank you guys so much for being here and supporting me and ( the fight against ) pediatric brain cancer. Today has been the best day i've ever had, \" she said. Her second basket came when she re-entered the game with 26.5 seconds remaining, the ap reports. A sellout crowd, including hall of fame coach pat summitt and wnba stars such as elena delle donne, watched hill's team win 66-55 against hiram college. One of hill's baskets was shown during a cincinnati bengals game yesterday, and her courage has inspired an ice-bucket-like online challenge: record yourself spinning around five times, then shooting a layup with your non-dominant hand to benefit a pediatric cancer charity.

An initial analysis of the wreckage announced in may by barry clifford suggests that the ship he found off the coast is about 200 years younger than the santa maria, reports the ap. A full analysis is expected soon from experts at unesco, \" but so far what we have seen... Tends to lead us to think it is a later ship, \" says culture minister monique rocourt. Clifford, though, is standing by his claim. Nobody from unesco examined his photos from the dive site, he said, adding that he thinks the un report will be \" highly, highly prejudiced. \" he found the wreckage off northern coast near the city of cap-haiten, but as haiti libre explains, spanish experts think clifford was way off in his search site. In fact, changes in sediment in the centuries since columbus sailed suggest the ship would actually be buried on land by now instead of under the sea, they say. Rocourt seems in agreement and says haiti would likely allow a search on shore. \" even a single piece of wood that we would find, we ' ll put it in a museum, \" she says. ( of course, there's always the possibility that columbus was lying about the santa maria's fate. )",

        "summary": "Donald trump's campaign is on damage control after one of the most damaging leaks in election history — but some commentators aren't sure if he ' ll be able to recover at all from the release of a 2005 \" hot mic \" tape in which he makes some very crude comments about women. The candidate is facing an almost unprecedented backlash from his own party, with some leading republicans calling for him to step down as the nominee. A round-up of coverage: house speaker paul ryan is one of scores of leading republicans now trying to distance themselves from trump, the washington post reports. He released a statement saying he is \" sickened \" by the comments — and trump is no longer invited to a wisconsin campaign event he was supposed to attend saturday. Cnn looks at how the old access hollywood tape made its way to the media at a very unfortunate time for trump. Sources say a producer remembered the tape early in the week and, after digging it up mid-week, the show planned to air it monday — but a copy made its way to the washington post first. Cbs reports that mike pence has been refusing to answer reporters ' questions about the tape. Reporters accompanying pence were suddenly ushered out of a restaurant when the tape became public friday. At a rally in ohio that evening, pence said that trump emerges \" still standing stronger than ever before \" whenever he is targeted by the media. Republican fundraising chief spencer zwick tells the ap that he has been getting phone calls from donors who \" want help putting money together to fund a new person to be the gop nominee. \" he says a write-in campaign \" could actually work, \" although some states don't allow write-in candidates. The los angeles times reports that even florida gov. Rick scott, who leads a pro-trump super pac and had his hands full dealing with hurricane matthew, found the time to denounce trump's comments. \" i ' m not following politics closely right now, but this is terrible, \" he said. \" i don't agree with anyone talking like this about anyone, ever. \" the new york times takes a look at what it calls \" the apology that wasn't. \" sources say trump huddled with advisers, including daughter ivanka, before issuing the brief — and defiant apology — late friday. The insiders say aides urged trump not to mention the clintons in the apology, but their advice was ignored. Nbc news has statements from many of the republicans who have condemned the remarks, including rnc chief reince priebus. \" it's over, \" a gop",

While on an expedition in the azores some 950 miles west of portugal, as many as four beaked whales surfaced and spent about 10 minutes near a small inflatable boat, giving the instructors time to capture underwater footage of the whales. But not just any whales: a study in peerj reports they turned out to be the rarely seen true's beaked whales, which were first described in 1912 and had never been filmed underwater. Only seven live sightings had previously been recorded — and new scientist points out not all were verified — in part because of the elusive whales ' behavior: a brief surfacing followed by dives that can last up to two hours and take the creatures as deep as two miles down. True's beaked whales are identifiable by a white patch on their head that looks like a beanie, but the video shows new markings, including one with a white mask, reports seeker. That discovery could be a sort of wrench, explains senior author emma carroll, who says \" it might be more difficult to tell the different beaked whale species apart in the wild than previously thought \" as the cuvier's beaked whale bears similar coloration. But there's a flip side to the coin: more data on their markings could also make it easier for scientists to identify the whales. New scientist explains that most such data to date comes from stranded whales, whose coloration can be darkened by the sun. Getting better at identifying them could allow scientists to do something they've never done before: estimate just how many true's beaked whales are out there.

And whatever it is you want, you go searching for it. \" sound familiar? the larger story profiles alexander and depicts him as a brilliant ( he has three master's, in electronic warfare, physics, and national security strategy ) and aggressive advocate of using every technological and cyber-tool available to ward off us enemies. It includes quotes from his supporters who say it's for the greater good — for example, attacks on us troops did decline in iraq after the rtrg program began — and from critics who say he's trampling on privacy. It also ends with a telling anecdote about his mindset: a few years ago, he met with bigwigs in the financial industry to warn them of cyber-attacks from abroad. His solution? give the nsa full access to their sites to better protect them. As the post tells it: \" the nsa chief was offering to serve as an all-knowing virus-protection service, but at the cost, industry officials felt, of an unprecedented intrusion into the financial institutions'databases. \" they politely declined.

If they want to jump in the \" fast lane \" and make their whoppers \" high priority, \" they ' ll have to pony up $ 13 for the \" fast \" mbps ( \" making burgers per second \" ) or $ 26 for the \" hyperfast \" version. \" the internet should be like burger king restaurants, a place that doesn't prioritize and welcomes everyone, \" a bk marketing rep says in a statement explaining the ad, which comes on the heels of the fcc repeal of net neutrality protections in december. Some call the ad \" brilliant \" for explaining the complex subject using fast food, but more cynical observers see it as bk capitalizing on a timely topic for its own purposes. Recode, which notes burger king hasn't exactly been on the front lines until now lobbying for net neutrality repeal ( business insider backs that up ), calls it a \" branding exercise \" by a \" #woke brand \" that \" [ sees ] in every social and political cause du jour an opportunity for 15 minutes of web infamy. \" and engadget says the ad doesn't even explain the concept all that well ( it points to its own explainer instead ), though it gives the clip props for its subtle dig at fcc chief ajit pai: the bk king is seen at the end drinking out of a giant reese's mug, as pai has been known to do. Also at the end of the ad: a link to a change.org. Petition supporting net neutrality. ( montana has become the first state to protect net neutrality. )",

A massive study of some 140,000 people aged 35 to 70 in 17 countries finds the palms of a person's hands may be better than blood pressure at indicating their risk of heart attack, stroke, or an early death. Specifically, researchers say quick declines in the force of a person's grip — as opposed to a slower, natural decline with age — show an increased risk for health problems, the bbc reports. Researchers monitored participants ' health over four years and used a handgrip dynamometer to measure grip strength, harvard health reports. Each 11-pound drop in grip strength was associated with an increase in a person's risk of dying from heart disease by 17 % and from any cause by 16 %. The weaker grip was also associated with an increased risk of stroke by 9 % and heart attack by 7 %, researchers say. There was no connection, however, to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer, or other chronic conditions. Researchers aren't sure why evidence of a weak heart might appear in a person's grip, but it's possible that hardened arteries hinder muscle strength. Experts also say a person's grip is a strong indicator of a person's biological age — a measure of body function influenced by physical fitness, illnesses, and strength — rather than their chronological age. \" grip strength could be an easy and inexpensive test to assess an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease, \" a researcher says in a press release. \" further research is needed to establish whether efforts to improve muscle strength are likely to reduce an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease. \" ( a study claims our hands were designed to punch. )",

As part of the international prospective urban and rural epidemiological ( pure ) study, researchers measured grip strength in nearly 140,000 adults in 17 countries and followed their health for an average of four years. A device called a dynamometer was used to assess grip strength. Each 11-pound decrease in grip strength over the course of the study was linked to a 16 % higher risk of dying from any cause, a 17 % higher risk of dying from heart disease, a 9 % higher risk of stroke, and a 7 % higher risk of heart attack.

Degroote school of medicine and cardiologist for the hospital. \" doctors or other healthcare professionals can measure grip strength to identify patients with major illnesses such as heart failure or stoke who are at particularly high risk of dying from their illness. \" the study followed almost 140,000 adults aged 35 to 70 over four",
            "A strong or weak hand grip carries more than just social cues. It may also help measure an individual's risk for having a heart attack or stroke, or dying from cardiovascular disease. As part of the international prospective urban and rural epidemiological ( pure ) study, researchers measured grip strength in nearly 140,000 adults in 17 countries and followed their health for an average of four years. A device called a dynamometer was used to assess grip strength. Each 11-pound decrease in grip strength over the course of the study was linked to a 16 % higher risk of dying from any cause, a 17 % higher risk of dying from heart disease, a 9 % higher risk of stroke, and a 7 % higher risk of heart attack. The connections between grip strength and death or cardiovascular disease remained strong even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can contribute to heart",
            "Image copyright thinkstock the chances of having a heart attack, stroke or dying young may be hidden in the palm of the hand, a study suggests. A trial on nearly 140,000 people in 14 countries, published in the lancet, suggests grip strength is better than blood pressure at predicting risk. The international research team said it would be a \" simple, inexpensive \" tool for doctors. Experts argued the link between grip and the heart was unclear and needed more study. The maximum crushing force you can exert in your grip naturally declines with age. But those whose grip strength declines fastest may be at greater risk of health problems, the study suggests. Women in their mid-20s have a grip strength about 75lb ( 34kg ), which falls to 53lb in a 70-year-old. The equivalent figures for men are 119lb ( 54kg ) falling to 84lb. The huge trial, in"

The emotional video closes with maynard breaking down, saying that \" if all my dreams came true, i would somehow survive this. But i most likely won't. \" she goes on to share her wishes for her mother — that she not be buried by grief — and for husband dan diaz, hoping that he one day has a family. People notes diaz said earlier this month that he didn't expect his wife to kill herself on the appointed day if she woke up \" feeling good. \" a counselor advised him that picking such a date gives maynard \" something to work toward and to work beyond. \" maynard recently completed her bucket list.",

The pair had one child together, and in case they wanted a second, hardin stored his sperm at a houston fertility clinic in 2002, when the couple were domestic partners, before getting a vasectomy, reports abc news. He also signed a contract explaining leblanc would decide what would happen to the sperm even if the pair broke up, which they eventually did, per ktrk. Hardin later began dating tobie devall, and the couple visited the clinic, texas andrology services, in 2008, before breaking up a year later. But by 2010, devall had become pregnant with hardin's sperm — something that shouldn't have happened without leblanc's consent, hardin and leblanc allege in a lawsuit against devall, her doctor, and the clinic, reports kprc. \" i don't think you can do anything worse in society today, \" says hardin, who has never met his second son, now 5. Attorneys for devall and the clinic say hardin told workers he wanted to use his sperm to have a baby with devall during their clinic visit in 2008 and never mentioned he didn't have control over his sperm. Devall's attorney says she was inseminated in 2009, when the couple were still dating, and hardin was excited to have another child. \" mr. Hardin has got some obligation to let people know he's changed his mind, \" the clinic's lawyer adds. Regardless of hardin's intentions, the purpose of preserving the sperm \" was for me to have a biological sibling for my son, \" leblanc says. \" that was for me to decide how to use. \" her lawyer adds, \" there are more security checks in place for me going and buying alcohol at a gas station than there were for ( devall ) to receive a man's dna and the building blocks of life. \" the trial started tuesday and is expected to last two weeks.

            "A group of geneticists are hoping to bring back to life the extinct passenger pigeon by using its museum-specimen dna. Revive &amp; restore is a non-profit organisation that aims to use genetics to \" rescue \" endangered and extinct species that went from billions to zero in just a few decades. The great passenger pigeon comeback is the first project by the organisation to attempt to revive an extinct animal using museum-specimen dna – if successful the technique could be used to bring back hundreds of other extinct species. \" the goal... Is to bring the passenger pigeon all the way back using the genome of the band-tailed pigeon and state-of-the-art genomic technology, \" revive &amp; restore said. \" the genomes of the two birds will be compared in close detail, to determine which differences are most crucial.

Fire officials say an electrical failure ignited the dried-out tree, causing a late-night blaze that engulfed the annapolis-area home within a couple of minutes, the baltimore sun reports. Homeowners don and sandra pyle and their four grandchildren — sisters alexis and kaitlyn boone, 7 and 8, and their cousins charlotte and wesley boone, 8 and 6 — were sleeping in rooms connected to the main room and the fire would probably have blocked their escape routes, investigators say. \" the fuel load from the christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and what caused the fire to spread as quickly as it did, \" a county fire marshal told reporters, adding that it would \" without a doubt \" have made a difference if the home had a sprinkler system. Investigators say that the pyles had a tradition of extending christmas for their grandchildren, and left the tree \" lit most of the time, \" wbal reports. The final body was removed from the mansion's ruins earlier this week and the families issued a statement thanking the community and first responders, reports the new york daily news. \" though we are grieving deeply, this has brought us some small sense of closure, \" they said.",

But as the tampa bay times details in a fascinating read, the man residents knew as dennis \" lee \" lafferty had a hidden past — one that led from alleged drug-smuggling in florida to him ditching his wife and four kids, making his way to the other side of the globe by sailboat and other transport, and settling down to a relatively normal, quiet life with his mistress, janet wood, with whom he had fallen in love in key west. \" i ' m surprised no one ever came looking for him, \" says wood, who says she ended up marrying him, raising a family, and eventually divorcing him. She's now telling their tale since lafferty ( real name: raymond grady stansel jr. ) is gone. Stansel was indicted in 1974 on charges of smuggling 12 tons of pot and set for trial on jan. 5, 1975, in daytona beach. But that morning, his attorney said he had disappeared while scuba diving a few days earlier off honduras, a story that few bought. The years that followed had authorities pursuing sightings in florida, honduras, panama, and south america. \" it's like chasing a phantom, \" the frustrated head of the pinellas sheriff's vice unit once said in the 1980s, while a lawyer who for years led a federal drug task force in florida says, \" it was like sightings of elvis or big foot. \" read the entire intriguing story in the times.

So what's left for the adventurous spirit drinker to try? shochu. Shochu is the national spirit of japan, and while most americans ' first free association of alcohol and japan will be sake",
            "Coca-cola will soon be giving japanese consumers a new kind of buzz. In a departure from its traditional soda business, coke ( ko ) plans to launch an alcoholic drink in japan this year. It's trying to get in on the growing market for \" chu-hi \" -- canned, flavored drinks typically made with sparkling water and shochu, a japanese spirit distilled from grains. The new drink is a \" highly japan-specific approach given the complexity and richness \" of coke's range of products in the country, coke spokesperson yohko okabe told cnn on wednesday. The company declined to give further details on the plans, but in a recent blog post,"

Codrick beal, 4, had spent the night with a babysitter and family friend while his mother celebrated her birthday, when he got hold of a loaded firearm in the house yesterday morning and fatally shot himself, reports the houston chronicle. \" my baby is gone, \" codrick's mother, ashley beal, lamented outside the house. The babysitter, meanwhile, fell to the ground convulsing as she sobbed outside her home; paramedics later returned to pick her up. \" it's just a terrible accident, \" a cousin of codrick's mom tells the chronicle. \" we see it all the time on the news but you never think it ' ll hit home. It's the most horrible thing. \" investigators are still trying to determine how the boy got hold of the weapon, reports abc 13. An average of 62 kids under the age of 14 die every year in accidental shootings in the us, according to the centers for disease control and prevention, though other figures suggest these numbers too low. Authorities did not divulge what type of gun was fired, to whom it was registered, or where codrick died. ( last year, a 3-year-old accidentally shot his 18-month-old brother to death in arizona. )",

Mama, on the other hand, bucks tradition and serves as a new identity for hip, alternative, progressive mothers. Dads are just fine with \"dad \" and \"daddy, \" strauss argued, because \"being a male with offspring comes with few linguistic, and therefore identity, traps. \" sure, dad may not be as socially loaded as mom is for women, but its popularity is also seemingly waning among the urban, cultured class.

Despite having never toured and rarely even being seen in public, the 54-year-old is worth an estimated $ 136 million, \" about double that of chris martin, \" writer anne helen petersen notes; she lives next door to bono and has sold 80 million records, sales peterson compares to beyonce's. All this while some deride her work as \" muzak \" or, less derogatorily, \" new age \" ( a term enya is \" not fond of, \" as the ap recently put it ). And now, in addition to doing a round of rare interviews, enya is saying she might actually do a tour — a possibility that surprised even the chairman and ceo of her record label. She's also giving a glimpse into her process: she's only ever worked with nicky and roma ryan, a husband-and-wife team who write the lyrics and produce the songs — and who, in turn, only work with her. ( \" from the beginning, we never allowed an a&r man here, or anyone who wanted to deviate or move the album in any direction, \" nicky says. ) she met nicky when he managed a band three of enya's siblings and two of her uncles were in, from which enya and nicky ultimately split off. It was nicky who convinced enya to spell her name, eithne, phonetically, and to drop her last name. After her 2008 christmas-themed album, enya tells peterson, \" i felt i didn't know what to do. I thought i needed a break, and the music needed a break. \" three years later, roma shared some of her new poems with enya, and they started working on dark sky island. Click for the full piece.

        "summary": "A tiny find in a worm-sized brain could give scientists a far greater understanding of how animals use the earth's magnetic field, phys.org reports. In a lab at the university of austin in texas, certain hungry worms were found to move down in gelatin-filled tubes, perhaps in their natural search for food. But worms of the same species, c. Elegans, from elsewhere in the world — including hawaii, england, and australia — didn't, because they were heading in what would have been down in their native region. And when researchers changed the magnetic field in the lab with a magnetic coil system, the worms changed direction. Then it happened: scientists identified for the first time a microscopic sensor that helps an animal navigate via the earth's magnetic field, they report in the journal elife. \" it's been a competitive race to find the first magnetosensory neuron, \" says jon pierce-shimomura, a member of the team. \" and we think we've won with worms, which is a big surprise because no one suspected that worms could sense the earth's magnetic field. \" they discovered the sensor on the end of the so-called afd neuron, which resembles a microscopic tv antenna; researchers already knew it could help sense carbon dioxide levels and temperature, nbc news reports. And while other animals ( like pigeons ) are known to process data related to magnetic fields, no one had found a magnetosensory neuron before. \" chances are that the same molecules will be used by cuter animals like butterflies and birds, \" says pierce-shimomura. He even suggests that farmers could manipulate magnetic fields to rid crops of pests, per ut news. ( dogs use earth's magnetic field... To poop. )",

        "summary": "People who receive life-threatening cancer diagnoses and find themselves battling depression and anxiety might consider munching on magic mushrooms, and that's not coming from a snake oil salesman. Scientists at the johns hopkins university school of medicine announced last week at the annual meeting of the american college of neuropsychopharmacology that a single dose of the hallucinogenic ingredient, called psilocybin, appears to have a protective effect that lasts for an astonishing six months, per a press release. Found in some 200 mushroom species, psilocybin can give users hallucinations, nausea, and a distorted sense of time, reports the international business times. To study its effects on cancer patients, roland griffiths and colleagues compared low and moderately high doses of psilocybin in 51 patients. On the day the drug was administered, those with the higher dosage exhibited \" substantially greater effects, including perceptual changes [ and ] mystical-type subjective experiences, \" the researchers write. When the patients were checked five weeks and six months later, the higher-dose group continued to experience reduced mental health problems compared to the low-dose group. Further, the researchers write \" a higher percentage [ of the higher-dose group ] reported the experience to be among the 5 most personally meaningful of their lives ( 54 % vs. 16 % ). \" the findings piggyback on a 2011 study showing similar effects on 12 cancer patients. ( magic mushrooms were last year found growing in this famous person's gardens. )",

That's right, let china do the heavy lifting ( and spending ) on this, and when its engineers perfect the electric auto, we can just piggy-back off them, he writes in the american interest. Among his points: detroit's been making inferior cars for years, so why would anyone think they're going to suddenly outshine foreign makers on electric models? also, if electric cars do come on the market, oil exporters will have to slash prices. \" americans will be swooping over the interstates as our gas prices fall, \" writes mead. \" the arabs and the venezuelans will be begging us to take that black gooey stuff off their hands. Suv sales will boom; since this is about the only car detroit can make profitably, the us car industry will enjoy another respite from its long decline. \" he admits it's a cynical strategy, but he says it's also a practical one.",

            "We all have our off days; tom friedman ( a man i admire ) had one last sunday in a new york times column calling for higher gas taxes and a crash program to build electric cars. As usual, he's worried about the right things and is even ahead of the curve. The piece raises some serious questions about the future of the american middle class, our dependency on gasoline creates both environmental and security problems, and china in particular is making some long term investments in infrastructure that are likely to exacerbate some of the competitive issues we currently face. But electric cars won't save the american middle class. They won't even save china. ( credit: david megginson ) friedman's column argues with his characteristic urgency that china is eating america's lunch with a series of high-profile, high-cost investment initiatives that over time will give it a series of crushing economic and technological activities. State-of-the-art airports, high-speed trains, gene sequencing efforts and a combination of policies that make gas expensive and subsidize the electric car industry are the secrets of china's future success. America needs to match these policies and investments, especially in the electric car business, or our goose is cooked. Infrastructure and research, yes unless you are a laissez-faire purist friedman scores some telling points.",
