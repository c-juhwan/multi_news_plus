On monday, the same day one software company debuted a porn-related app for the device, google rushed to address the matter with an update to its google's glass platform developer policies. Under the content policies section, it now reads: \" we don't allow glassware content that contains nudity, graphic sex acts, or sexually explicit material.

The body lay on the ground for at least two hours, as what kmov describes as \" large crowds \" of protesters began to gather at the scene. Its reporters describe police in riot gear as being present and observed flashes of light. One reporter tells the bbc, \" as soon as i got there police started firing off flash bangs, which are used to, hopefully, disperse some of the crowd. \" ksdk reports things heated up around 2am, when protesters reportedly hurled rocks and bricks. About a dozen protesters remained five hours after the shooting. Though his mother tells ksdk that martin did not have a gun and was just on his way to see his girlfriend, county police confirm they have recovered \" the deceased subject's \" handgun. The post-dispatch notes that it appears there are security cameras at the scene; police say they ' ll release that video at 8am est.",

Mathews, who was out on bail on a charge of child endangerment, is being held on $ 1 million bond on the new charge, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the ap reports. Police say more charges — and more arrests — are possible. Mathews has told police that sherin, who was adopted from india last year, was on a special diet and was being punished for not drinking her milk. He did not report her missing for five hours and police are seeking surveillance footage of a vehicle they believe left the home between 4am and 5am on oct. 7, the night the girl disappeared. Earlier monday, mathews and his wife went to a court hearing seeking to regain custody of their biological 4-year-old daughter, who was taken into protective custody after sherin disappeared.",

Kitty hawk, a silicon valley startup named for the location of the wright brothers ' first controlled flight and backed by google co-founder larry page, has revealed its flying car prototype and says buyers will be able to get their hands on a similar design by the end of the year, per abc news. For now, the kitty hawk flyer looks less like a car and more like \" a flying motorcycle, \" but riding it is a blast, cimeron morrissey writes at medium. The rider mounts the 220-pound device and controls its eight, battery-powered propellers from a set of handlebars. Getting the hang of the controls takes only \" minutes \" and there's no need for a license, kitty hawk says. But riders won't be cruising over land anytime soon. The flyer, which has two pontoons attached, is only legal to operate over fresh water \" in uncongested areas of the us, \" according to kitty hawk's website. While such a \" flying car \" might not be what consumers envisioned, \" i think it demonstrates a vision of the future, \" an engineer tells the new york times. Interested? kitty hawk — run by the founding director of google's x lab, sebastian thrun — says anyone who pays a $ 100 membership fee now will receive a $ 2,000 discount off a flyer at a later date. The catch: kitty hawk has yet to reveal the retail price of the flyer, which can now travel up to 25mph.",

She's now on trial for his murder, as well as for the murders of two boyfriends and the attempted murder and robbery of another, who later died of cancer, reports the bbc.

        "summary": "Last wednesday, the parents of garrett pope, jr., found the 11-year-old south carolina boy in his room, dead from accidental asphyxiation. Now they're speaking out to let the world know that something called the \" choking game \" killed their little boy and to warn other parents so the same thing doesn't happen to them, the washington post reports. Also known by names including \" cloud nine, \" \" five minutes in heaven, \" \" blackout, \" and \" good kid's high, \" the game involves briefly cutting off the flow of oxygen to the brain, resulting in a euphoric feeling. But it's dangerous, especially when played alone; some children use belts slung from doorknobs to achieve the high. The advocacy group gasp estimates nearly 400 children died from playing the choking game between 1995 and 2007, but notes that it's difficult to track exact numbers since many of the deaths are reported as suicides. Indeed, rumors went around that garrett had committed suicide, which is one of the reasons his parents are speaking out. \" please know that his senseless death was not intentional. He took this terrible ' game'too far, \" they write in a facebook post that has been shared more than 1,500 times so far. \" he was so young and impressionable, he didn't know what he was doing, and made a terrible mistake. \" garrett's mom, stacy, tells the herald she heard about the choking game from a football coach over the summer and asked her son about it, but he claimed he had never heard of it. \" i should have pushed it further, \" she says. \" if you talk to your kids and they said they don't know about it, don't stop there. You educate them on what it is, it's not a game and it can kill you. \" pope's father says he assumes his son learned about the game from his peers, because there's no record of him researching it on family electronics, the lancaster news reports. A gofundme campaign in garrett's memory aims to raise money to buy books for local schools.",

In syria, warren said except for the kurdish town of kobani, isis has maintained its area of influence and even gained some ground near damascus, homs, and a foothold in the yarmouk refugee camp south of damascus. Warren pushed back against the notion that isis is simply making a strategic retreat into syria. \" this is offensive pressure being placed on isil, forcing them out of areas, \" he said.

            "The islamic state in iraq and syria ( isis ) has lost control of territory in iraq since august while gaining some ground in syria, the pentagon said monday. Isis has lost control of about 25 to 30 percent of territory in central and northern iraq, which is equal to about 5,000 to 6,000 square miles, pentagon spokesman army col. Steve warren told reporters monday. Advertisement \" isil is no longer the dominant force in roughly 25 to 30 percent of the populated areas of iraq where it once had complete freedom of movement, \" warren said, using a different acronym for isis. However, warren said some of that area is still \" contested, \" such as tikrit, where the u.s.-led coalition is assisting iraqi security forces in an offensive that began last month. In syria, warren said except for the kurdish town of kobani, isis has maintained its area of influence and even gained some ground near damascus, homs, and a foothold in the yarmouk refugee camp south of damascus. Warren pushed back against the notion that isis is simply making a strategic retreat into syria. \" this is offensive pressure being placed on isil, forcing them out of areas, \" he said. Warren said it was too early to say the tide of battle was turning in iraq, and did not say how much area isis",

Per the washington post, a super pac aligned with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has \" declared open warfare \" against the former white house chief strategist, who's reportedly demanding promises that candidates will not vote for mcconnell for majority leader before offering his endorsement. Though some fear it will only emphasize bannon's message, the senate leadership fund says it will spend millions attacking bannon's populism and alleged links to white nationalism in an effort to discredit his favored candidates and bolster gop incumbents in the 2018 midterms. Among the slf's targets is arizona state sen. Kelli ward — bannon's pick to replace retiring sen. Jeff flake — whom the super pac has labeled a \" conspiracy theorist. \" slf also targeted bannon-backed danny tarkanian, who's challenging republican sen.

Kuriki, 33, lost nine fingers to frostbite on the mountain in 2012, when he barely survived two days in a snow hole at 27,000 feet in below-zero temps, reports the bbc. And with the mountain claiming one in 10 climbers who try to summit, kuriki decided not to push his luck. This time it was the conditions that prompted him to turn back after spending a month acclimatizing, reports cnn. \" i realized if i kept going, i wouldn't be able to come back alive, \" kuriki wrote on facebook. Kuriki was at the final stretch, having rested at the last camp on the route that everest's first climbers, edmund hillary and tenzing norgay, took in 1953, but \" it took too much time to move in deep deep snow, \" he wrote. Kuriki was not only climbing without oxygen, but also without partners — he prefers to climb solo — and at a difficult, more volatile time of year. Climbers typically make their attempts in may, but nepal closed the mountain for the spring climbing season after the april earthquake killed 19 people at base camp. Kuriki was the first to make an attempt since. ( the earthquake actually moved everest's peak. )",

            "Milan an italian court sentenced ex-prime minister silvio berlusconi on thursday to one year in jail over the publication by his family's newspaper of a transcript of a leaked wiretap connected to a banking scandal in 2006. Under italian law, the 76-year-old media billionaire would not have to serve any jail time until the appeals process has been exhausted, and a higher court could overturn the ruling. However, judicial sources said the charges will expire in mid-september, before an appeal trial can be completed, because of the statute of limitations. So no matter what happens in the appeal, it is unlikely that berlusconi would serve time in jail. The verdict came in the midst of a political impasse arising from last week's election which left no party able to form a government on its own, although berlusconi's center-right formation emerged as the second strongest in parliament. Berlusconi is embroiled in a series of trials, with separate cases over charges of tax fraud and paying for sex with an underage prostitute due to wind up this month.

In italy prison sentences for non-violent crimes do not usually become effective until the two-tier appeals system has been exhausted.

Plato thought democracies were especially susceptible to \" tyranny \" the longer they lasted and the more democratic they became, and the us seems to be in exactly the kind of \" late-stage democracy \" ripe for such a thing, writes sullivan. Watching trump's rise over the past year, it has been \" increasingly hard not to see in plato's vision a murky reflection of our own hyperdemocratic times and in trump a demagogic, tyrannical character plucked directly out of one of the first books about politics ever written. \" sullivan concedes he may be \" overreacting, \" but he warns that republicans and democrats must unite against trump. For republicans, that likely means disowning their nominee and writing this election off \" to save their country. \" democrats, meanwhile, are dangerously misguided if they assume hillary clinton will beat trump in a landslide, he warns. Looking to europe, sullivan writes that the \" power of right-wing insurgency \" has been underestimated all over the west in recent years. The stakes are too high to let it happen in america, argues sullivan. Trump \" is not just another candidate to be parsed and analyzed by tv pundits in the same breath as all the others, \" he writes. \" in terms of our liberal democracy and constitutional order, trump is an extinction-level event. It's long past time we started treating him as such. \" ( click to read the full column. )",

Politico calls it \" the most shocking primary defeat since republicans took the house in 2010. \" brat, who teaches at randolph-macon college near richmond, argued on the campaign trail that cantor was more concerned about his rising political star than conservative ideals. \" while he's got an eye on the speaker job, he's turned his back on his constituents, \" brat told cnn yesterday. He also made an issue of immigration, criticizing cantor's support of reform measures as \" amnesty. \" brat had just $ 40,000 in his coffers at at the end of march, compared with cantor's $ 2 million, reports the washington post. \"this is an earthquake, \" former minnesota congressman vin weber and a friend of cantor's tells the newspaper. \"no one thought he'd lose. \"",

Held since 1905, it's thought to be the country's second-oldest race behind the boston marathon, and it has two highly distinctive features. One is the course, which is treacherously steep, involves nearly 700 stairs to climb in the first mile alone, and allows for shortcuts. The other is that handicapping, which places children and the most elderly runners at the front of the pack; at the rear are men ages 19-30. In the middle are runners distributed \" by a complex algorithm of gender and age \" now handled by an mit-educated engineer, with waves released every minute for 25 minutes. That's allowed an 8-year-old girl and 72-year-old man to win the june race in recent years. The winner of the 2017 race was a 46-year-old woman named chris lundy. There's a heck of a lot of passing involved, and by extension, \" a lot of touching, hands on sweaty backs and shoulders, to keep in control. \" as for branch, he started out six minutes before the young male runners.

( if your legs have not burst, maybe your heart will. ) it is not the treacherous plunge toward the ocean, the crooked depths and broken steps of steep ravine, even the poison oak that crowds the skinny trails and tickles the legs before blooming into a postrace rash. And it's not the course's maze of permissible shortcuts, like the one named suicide, that give locals an advantage, as long as they stay upright and do not get lost. No, unexpectedly, the toughest part of the 7.5-mile dipsea, a topographically schizophrenic romp that was first run in 1905, could be mental.

It is not the jiggly-legged drop into muir woods, or the steep rise up dynamite, so named because your churning legs might feel ready to explode. And it is not even the next big hill, called cardiac. ( if your legs have not burst, maybe your heart will. ) it is not the treacherous plunge toward the ocean, the crooked depths and broken steps of steep ravine, even the poison oak that crowds the skinny trails and tickles the legs before blooming into a postrace rash. And it's not the course's maze of permissible shortcuts, like the one named suicide, that give locals an advantage, as long as they stay upright and do not get lost. No, unexpectedly, the toughest part of the 7.5-mile dipsea, a topographically schizophrenic romp that was first run in 1905, could be mental. It is knowing that the slowest runners are given head starts and the fastest ones begin at the back. It is like unloading a zoo's worth of animals in reverse order of mobility and releasing the cheetahs at the end.",

After steadfastly declining several offers, lipinski found himself getting a \"manzilian \" from none other than janea padilha herself, the inventor of the brazilian. And \"the pain was almost unbearable, \" he writes on salon. \"afterwards, i felt shaky and emotional, but invigorated, as if i'd just walked away from a car accident unscathed. \" along the way, lipinski gleaned various fun facts about manscaping, which is growing in popularity. Among the more amusing tidbits: women are \"not comfortable with their husbands and boyfriends getting waxed by other men, \" padilha says, but men are concerned about becoming aroused by a female waxer — so, one aesthetician explains, \"we hire only older women for the waxing, like your grandmother. \" one 35-year-old female waxer explains why: some men assume \"that since they're naked, you're gonna give them head, \" she says, recalling a time a client got so aggressive she had to taze him.",

        "summary": "The hot movie of the moment is christopher nolan's dunkirk, which retells the story of the evacuation of allied troops from the french city of that name during world war ii. But this was an epic evacuation, with more than 333,000 mostly british and french soldiers rescued from the beachhead. In fact, had the germans opted to attack instead of holding back, such a decisive win in 1940 might have changed the outcome of the war, writes james gibney at bloomberg. ( the headline says germany \" blew it. \" ) so why didn't they? all these years later, the answer remains unclear, says historian robert citino. He recounts the confusion among hitler and his top panzer commanders and says one thing is clear: the germans realized their mistake almost immediately, even as the evacuation was taking place. Read the full q&a here. Related stories: fact vs. Fiction: the movie ranks high in terms of accuracy, and slate takes a look at specific examples. Kenneth branagh's character appears to be based on a real-life british captain, and a memorable scene about a soldier's walk into the ocean is based on witness accounts. What you don't see: the film doesn't deal with the fighting taking place beyond the beach, the impact on civilians, and, generally, the perspective of the french, german, and belgian soldiers involved, per a post at gizmodo. First-hand account: historians can weigh in all they want, but a 97-year-old veteran who was actually there has this to say: \"i never thought i would see that again. It was just like i was there again. \" ken sturdy served in the british royal navy and now lives in canada. See video of him at global news. Controversy in france: some historians and critics in france say the film gives short shrift to french bravery that made the evacuation ( operation dynamo ) possible. Specifically, how 30,000 french troops held off the germans at lille to protect the mission. The london times has details. Counter-view: a piece at france24 makes the case that nolan's critics in france are misreading the film. Yes, it gives french soldiers a disproportionately small role, but it's not a documentary — and it does not \" disregard their valor. \" finally: david fear at rolling stone writes that nolan has always been an adept filmmaker — look at his batman flicks — but this is the movie his doubters ( fear included ) have been waiting for. \" he's finally established himself as an artist. \"",

        "summary": "Will the real mona lisa please stand up — or at least send us a signal from within the paint layers? the art world is buzzing over a french scientist's claims that he discovered a portrait of another woman lurking beneath the top layer of the world's most famous painting — meaning the mona lisa as we know her might not be the real her, the bbc reports. Pascal cotte, who co-founded a paris-based company that digitizes fine art, has been studying da vinci's signature piece for 10 years using a technology called the layer amplification method, or lam, which involves shining \" intense \" light onto a painting, then measuring the bounced-back reflections to gauge what's underneath, per newsweek. And what cotte says is underneath the surface of the mona lisa is an image of a woman looking off to the side ( not straight ahead ) with different physical characteristics than the model that currently smiles down on crowds at the louvre. For instance, the hidden portrait shows a woman who boasts a bigger head, nose, and hands, as well as smaller lips, the telegraph notes. Which means, as an art historian tells the paper, that \" it was a portrait [ that woman's ] husband never received. Instead, leonardo went on to paint the world's most famous picture over the top. \" but not everyone's convinced the find is that amazing. An oxford university art history professor tells the bbc that the newly uncovered model was likely not the start of a completely different painting, but simply an \" evolution \" of the final mona lisa in which da vinci kept painting over the previous version until he got the result he wanted. \" i am absolutely convinced that the mona lisa is lisa, \" he says. The louvre, for its part, is declining comment because it \" was not part of the scientific team \" that analyzed the painting, per the bbc. ( the telegraph floats a whole bunch of intriguing rumors about the painting. )",

Scout, who headed the school's pride alliance, was killed after four campus cops responded to a 911 call about someone armed with a weapon. Investigators say schultz was nearing the cops and didn't comply when told to put down his knife, the ap reports. Per cbs news, a video shows a male officer fired after schultz said, \" shoot me \" and the officer replied, \" no, drop the knife, \" only for schultz to continue toward the police. Chris stewart, the schultzes ' attorney, says scout was holding a utility tool but the blade wasn't out. \" they overreacted, \" stewart tells the journal-constitution, adding schultz seemed to be having a mental breakdown. Schultz's parents agree, with lynne schultz telling the paper she didn't understand why nonlethal force, such as pepper spray or stun guns, wasn't used. Stewart, who says the schultzes plan on filing a civil suit, said monday he'd confirmed that campus police don't carry those less-lethal alternatives, which he called \" insane, \" per cbs. Bill schultz said scout had a history of depression — the engineering student had attempted suicide two years ago — but had seemed ok recently and was doing well at georgia tech, with a 3.9 gpa and an early graduation date set for december. Lynne schultz explains to the journal-constitution that scout identified as nonbinary ( neither male nor female ) and was classified as intersex, having biological or physiological characteristics that are neither fully male nor female. \" why did you have to shoot? \" bill schultz asked at the presser. \" that's the only question that matters right now. \"",

Bloomberg reports that the move could bring in $ 2.5 billion in much-needed cash, and sears sees it as a way to become \" a more focused company. \" the managing director of an nyc investment group sees it differently: \" they're continuing to burn the furniture to stay warm. \" and what's likely to remain of sears is becoming less valuable by the day: yesterday's financial results showed a 3.7 % drop in same-store sales over a 12-week period, and predicted a q3 earnings loss of as much as $ 300 million. An analyst sums up the core issue thusly: \" they haven't spent on the store base, and that's the issue. \" to wit, sears spent about $ 1.51 per square foot on its sears stores last year, reports bloomberg, while home depot spent $ 5.56 and macy's spent $ 6.25.",

I know women who left 8-week-old infants, \" the democrat says. \" this trip to japan and korea was seven days, and it's the longest i've been away from my daughter, and it was horrible. \" asked how she feels about becoming the first senator to give birth, she said: \" well, it's about damn time. I can't believe it took until 2018. It says something about the inequality of representation that exists in our country. \" ( in 2014, nancy pelosi refused to let duckworth vote by proxy when she was unable to travel because of pregnancy. )",

But before she died, the guardian reports, natasha chin, 41, rang an alarm bell in her cell for about two-and-a-half hours with no response from the staff at bronzefield prison. Chin had been released in april, but was reportedly recalled to prison earlier this month. It is believed she was taking the medication to help her recuperate following a major surgery. Sodexo, which receives more than $ 84,000 per year per inmate to run the prison, confirmed that the death occurred and called it a \" tragedy \". But it would not say if chin had been designated an \" at risk \" inmate. For observers in england, chin's death serves to highlight mounting problems within the country's prison system. \"too many prisoners are dying in custody, \" academic and former inmate alex cavendish tells the guardian. \" a significant proportion of these deaths might have been avoided if appropriate care, including mental health support, had been in place and proper assessment procedures followed. \" according to a report released this year, prison assaults in 2015 were up 27 % over the year before; incidents of self-harm were up 24 %.

Now it appears that researchers at los alamos have made real progress: they've been using an uber-secure system of their own design for about two and a half years. As you might expect, any system with the word \" quantum \" in front of it takes some explaining, and the mit technology review starts with this: \" the basic idea here is that the act of measuring a quantum object, such as a photon, always changes it. So any attempt to eavesdrop on a quantum message cannot fail to leave telltale signs of snooping that the receiver can detect. \" this idea of using \" quantum cryptography \" to deter eavesdroppers isn't new, and popular science notes that a rudimentary system based on the principle is already on the market. The problem is that such systems have, until now, been limited. \" they can send secure messages from a to b but cannot route this information onwards to c, d, e or f, \" says the review. That is, they can't network. The los alamos researchers have gotten around the problem with a unique \" hub and spoke-type network, \" and the results look promising. \" it's not quite a quantum internet — yet, \" is the first line of coverage at the verge. It is indeed promising, adds ars technica, but the study doesn't mention one all-important factor: how much it would cost to translate this into the real world.",

The los angeles times reports that there was a \" long-brewing mix of drugs, mental illness, homophobia, and extreme family dysfunction \" leading up to last week's killings. In a facebook post 10 days before his father allegedly shot him dead, issa complained that he felt like his \" sister or brother or mother or father \" was \" literally controlling \" him in his sleep. \" if there is a devil or evil spirit, i truly believe it manifests itself in my family, \" he wrote, adding that his name is \" prince christ. \" in a video posted weeks earlier, issa's father calls him a \" pervert \" as he interrogates his parents about whether they have had anal sex. Shehada issa has been charged with first-degree murder in his son's death but hasn't been charged in the death of his wife, who was found stabbed to death in the family home. A police spokesman says officers are investigating whether amir killed his mother before being shot by his father. A next-door neighbor tells the los angeles daily news that the father complained to her about his son's drug use but never mentioned his sexual orientation. \" if he killed him because he was gay, he would have killed him earlier, \" she says. \" i still don't believe that he did it.

            "Residents look on to the scene of a shooting in the 15000 block of rayen street. David crane/los angeles news group north hills >> two flower-filled vases and eight lit candles on the sidewalk were the only signs sunday of last week's violent deaths of an elderly mother and her grown son at their home in the 15000 block of rayen street. Next door neighbor maria gomez, who had chatted with the family's patriarch many times over the past 11 years, struggled to make sense of what prosecutors alleged friday: that shehada ( or shehadeh, according to police ) issa, 69, deliberately shot his son amir with a shotgun outside their home tuesday \"because of the victim's sexual orientation. \" the slain mother, identified by coroner's officials as 68-year-old rabihah issa, was found dead inside the home's bathroom with \"numerous \" stab wounds, authorities have said. No one has been charged for the mother's death, which is still under investigation. The elder issa had complained about his son's alleged drug use, saying he had tried unsuccessfully to get him off drugs, but never about him being gay, gomez said. Gomez, who said she was unaware of the son's sexual orientation until the news broke friday, also questioned why he would have been killed now if that was indeed the father's motive. \"if he killed him because he was gay, he would have killed him earlier, \" gomez, a house cleaner, reasoned in spanish on sunday as she stood in her home's doorway and her granddaughter looked on. \"i still don't believe that he did it. I still can't believe it. \" the son has been identified by coroner's officials as amier issa, 38, of los angeles, though prosecutors spelled his name as amir and gave his age as 29.

        "summary": "Hurricane irma slammed into islands in the northeast caribbean with devastating force early wednesday, damaging buildings and sending debris flying with winds estimated at 185mph. The national weather service says the eye of irma, a category 5 storm and the strongest atlantic hurricane ever recorded, passed over the island of barbuda at 1: 47am, the ap reports. The storm ripped the roofs off of buildings, including the island's police station, and damage was also reported on the neighboring island of antigua. Many residents on both islands have fled to shelters, fearing the storm will destroy their homes. The latest: other leeward islands, including anguilla, montserrat, st. Kitts, and nevis, are under hurricane warnings, as are puerto rico, the us and british virgin islands, and the dominican republic, reports reuters. The national hurricance center has warned of \" life-threatening wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards \" for places in irma's path. The center predicts that irma will hit the other leeward islands on wednesday morning before passing over the virgin islands and close to northern puerto rico later in the day. French authorities have warned people on the islands of st. Martin and st. Barthelemy not to leave their houses under any circumstances, kcra reports. Bahamas prime minister hubert minnis has ordered the mandatory evacuation of islands in the southern half of the chain, the weather channel reports. This is the largest evacuation in the country's history. Aid agencies predict that a massive response will be required, and that it won't be easy to deliver, the guardian reports. \" one of the main challenges is going to be logistical, given the isolation of some of the islands, \" says a red cross regional director. In puerto rico, where a decade-long recession has left much of the island's infrastructure in very poor shape, authorities warn that irma could leave parts of the island without power for months, the new york times reports. In florida, authorities say a mandatory evacuation order for the keys will be issued wednesday evening. Miami-dade county is also expected to issue a mandatory evacuation order — its first in 12 years — for miami beach and much of the mainland coast, reports the miami herald. Places hit hard by irma may have very little time to recover before the next storm hits: tropical storm jose, which formed in the atlantic on tuesday, is expected to strengthen into a hurricane and hit much the same area as irma by the weekend, accuweather reports.",

Strike it in one place, and the vibrations carry. After last month's quake in new zealand and last year's quake in chile, the pacific plate has now seen catastrophic quakes on three of its corners.

The city is located 75 miles west of moscow and has since the summer been on the receiving end of more and more of moscow's waste — at their peril, say those who live there. The new york times explains volokolamsk's problem began when balashikha's ended: residents of the latter town complained to vladimir putin about the negative effect of a sizable landfill there, and so putin ordered it closed — within a month, rather than the years officials wanted to formulate a plan on how to deal with moscow's waste. That left roughly 1,000 trucks ' worth of waste needing somewhere to go each day, and a landfill in yadrovo, near volokolamsk, was on the receiving end of some of it. The times explains the yadrovo landfill doesn't currently have a system for capturing the biogas that's created by the rotting food deposited there; one is planned, but until then, the methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide vents through the soil and into the air. The ap reports things came to a head last month when 57 of volokolamsk's kids were hospitalized after experiencing nausea and fainting — symptoms of gas poisoning. Radio free europe reports that after protests, officials announced new waste would no longer be taken to the landfill as of april, but the times reports on the likely domino effect: that the waste will be carted to other landfills, spurring protests there.

Health officials in the town of volokolamsk, 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) west of moscow, said that 57 children have been hospitalized with symptoms of gas poisoning, including nausea and fainting. Moscow region gov. Andrei vorobyev said in remarks carried by his office that he will draw up plans to take \" as many children as possible \" on vacation trips. His office emphasized that vorobyov wasn't talking about a total evacuation. Local residents held a protest rally earlier this month, demanding that authorities close down a local landfill as a health hazard. Authorities in volokolamsk in early march called a temporary state of emergency after high levels of hydrogen sulfide were recorded around the landfill. Early wednesday, hundreds of people gathered outside the local hospital and surrounded local administrator yevgeny gavrilov, with one man in the crowd trying to punch him. Gavrilov was escorted to safety as the crowd shouted \" killer! \" a group of volokolamsk residents have filed a lawsuit demanding to close the landfill.",

            "Moscow ( ap ) — a gas poisoning linked to a toxic landfill in a town outside moscow left dozens hospitalized wednesday, prompting the regional governor to promise to evacuate local children from the area. Health officials in the town of volokolamsk, 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) west of moscow, said that 57 children have been hospitalized with symptoms of gas poisoning, including nausea and fainting. Moscow region gov. Andrei vorobyev said in remarks carried by his office that he will draw up plans to take \" as many children as possible \" on vacation trips. His office emphasized that vorobyov wasn't talking about a total evacuation. Local residents held a protest rally earlier this month, demanding that authorities close down a local landfill as a health hazard. Authorities in volokolamsk in early march called a temporary state of emergency after high levels of hydrogen sulfide were recorded around the landfill. Early wednesday, hundreds of people gathered outside the local hospital and surrounded local administrator yevgeny gavrilov, with one man in the crowd trying to punch him. Gavrilov was escorted to safety as the crowd shouted \" killer! \" a group of volokolamsk residents have filed a lawsuit demanding to close the landfill.",

Mirasolo pleaded guilty to third-degree sexual conduct and was sentenced to one year in county jail.

Plans for a senate judiciary committee vote on kavanaugh's nomination are now on hold, reports the washington post, which predicts that a \" potentially dramatic and politically perilous hearing \" will determine the fate of the nomination. The white house said in a statement that kavanaugh \" looks forward to a hearing where he can clear his name of this false allegation. \" friends in palo alto, calif., tell the san jose mercury news that ford, who had confided in them that she had been assaulted by somebody who is now a federal judge, struggled with the decision to come forward, fearing it would bring attacks and intense scrutiny. Jim gensheimer recalls her telling him: \" i've been trying to forget this all my life, and now i ' m supposed to remember every little detail. \" rebecca white says ford is the right person to deal with \" grueling questions \" at the hearing. \" she's one of those people who teems with honesty and truth, \" white says.

        "summary": "Poaching elephants for their ivory has already devastated populations, but poaching the animals for their skin could be disastrous, according to a new study detailing the \" heartbreaking \" practice in myanmar. Poaching wasn't thought to be a major issue in the country at the outset of the three-year study, when 19 wild elephants were fitted with gps collars, because tusks only appear in 25 % to 30 % of male asian elephants. But almost accidentally, researchers uncovered an organized poaching operation. \" we started to see a lot of the elephants dropping off the map in a pretty alarming way, \" john mcevoy of the smithsonian conservation biology institute tells smithsonian. All 19 elephants disappeared or turned up dead in a 13.5-square-mile area in less than two years. Another 40 elephants were found dead in areas of south-central myanmar, their skin and trunks removed. Researchers then learned poachers were paying thousands of dollars to learn an elephant's location and killing the animals specifically for their skin. In neighboring china, where it's used in traditional medicine, elephant skin sells for as much as $ 350 per pound, national geographic previously reported. Though the extent of the problem isn't fully known, researchers say this method of poaching could spell disaster for asian elephants already suffering from habitat loss. All elephants are targeted, rather than only tusked elephants, and \" hunting females and calves is a really quick way to drive a species towards extinction, \" mcevoy says. \" this is especially worrisome for myanmar where the wild elephant population collapsed from an estimated 10,000 individuals in the 1940s, to an estimated 1,430-2,065 today, \" the study in plos notes.

            "Abstract in the southern bago yoma mountain range in myanmar, asian elephants are being killed at a disturbing rate. This emerging crisis was identified initially through a telemetry study when 7 of 19 of collared elephants were poached within a year of being fitted with a satellite-gps collar. Subsequent follow up of ground teams confirmed the human caused death or disappearance of at least 19 elephants, including the seven collared individuals, within a 35 km2 area in less than two years. The carcasses of 40 additional elephants were found in areas located across south-central myanmar once systematic surveys began by our team and collaborators. In addition to the extreme rate of loss, this study documents the targeting of elephants for their skin instead of the more common ivory, an increasing trend in myanmar. Intensive research programs focused on other conservation problems identified this issue and are now encouraging local authorities to prioritize anti-poaching efforts and improve conservation policies within the country. Myanmar represents one of the last remaining countries in asia with substantial wildlands suitable for elephants. Increasing rates of human-elephant conflict and poaching events in this country pose a dire threat to the global population. Citation: sampson c, mcevoy j, oo zm, chit am, chan an, tonkyn d, et al.

            "Abstract in the southern bago yoma mountain range in myanmar, asian elephants are being killed at a disturbing rate. This emerging crisis was identified initially through a telemetry study when 7 of 19 of collared elephants were poached within a year of being fitted with a satellite-gps collar. Subsequent follow up of ground teams confirmed the human caused death or disappearance of at least 19 elephants, including the seven collared individuals, within a 35 km2 area in less than two years. The carcasses of 40 additional elephants were found in areas located across south-central myanmar once systematic surveys began by our team and collaborators. In addition to the extreme rate of loss, this study documents the targeting of elephants for their skin instead of the more common ivory, an increasing trend in myanmar. Intensive research programs focused on other conservation problems identified this issue and are now encouraging local authorities to prioritize anti-poaching efforts and improve conservation policies within the country. Myanmar represents one of the last remaining countries in asia with substantial wildlands suitable for elephants. Increasing rates of human-elephant conflict and poaching events in this country pose a dire threat to the global population. Citation: sampson c, mcevoy j, oo zm, chit am, chan an, tonkyn d, et al.

        "summary": "A time capsule buried during the construction of a nazi training center in poland has been unearthed — 82 years after it was buried, and 71 years after adolf hitler's \" thousand-year reich \" was eradicated. The copper cylinder recovered from the foundation of the ordensburg krossinsee building in zlocieniec contains exactly what you would expect nazis to put in a time capsule: researchers found two copies of mein kampf and photos of hitler, along with coins and newspapers, the independent reports. High-ranking nazi officials deposited the capsule when construction on the center for training future nazi leaders began in 1934, history.com reports. When the capsule was buried, zlocieniec was called falkenburg and it was part of germany. The site is now home to a polish military barracks. A spokesman for authorities in the city tells the ap that they unearthed the capsule in the hope that it would contain a film showing the town's 600th anniversary celebrations, which took place in 1933. The dig took weeks, with hazards including old german land mines. The film wasn't found, but the spokesman says the reminders of a \" time of evil \" will be put on display in a local museum. ( days before the end of the war, thousands died on the \" nazi titanic. \" )",

Kim received the operation between september and october by inviting a foreign doctor into the communist country, according to lee cheol-woo of the ruling saenuri party and shin kyong-min of the main opposition new politics alliance for democracy.

According to the study, paying attention to bedtimes could help manage weight gain during the transition between the teen years and adulthood. Asarnow has a couple of theories for the link between later bedtimes and weight gain. \" if you're staying up late, you're more likely to be eating junk food late at night, \" she tells cbs. \" people who stay up late are also less likely to eat breakfast, and breakfast skipping is associated with weight gain. \" ( going to bed earlier could also reduce your anxiety levels. )",

He adds that as he and his co-worker cowered in the freezer, they were sure the gunman was \" looking for us. \" but the gunman was felled in the shooting, later dying from his injuries. The dad and one of his sons were also hit; the son's injuries weren't life-threatening, while it's not clear on the father's condition. Sgt.

        "summary": "An explorer trying to complete a historic trek across antarctica covered 913 miles over 71 days on his own — only to die 30 miles short of his goal, reports the guardian. Henry worsley, a 55-year-old former british army officer, died of \" complete organ failure \" after being airlifted out, says his wife in a statement monday. He was trying to become the first solo person to cross the antarctic unaided, pulling a sled with all of his food and equipment instead of relying on supply drops, reports the bbc. Worsley had been in touch by satellite phone with the outside world, and he called for help after being unable to leave his tent for two days because of exhaustion and severe dehydration. Chilean doctors who were unable to save him say his abdomen had become infected with bacterial peritonitis. Worsley had managed a final statement: \" the 71 days alone on the antarctic with over 900 statute miles covered and a gradual grinding down of my physical endurance finally took its toll today, and it is with sadness that i report it is journey's end — so close to my goal. \" one part of the goal he did achieve, however: his shackleton solo expedition raised $ 142,000 for the endeavour fund, which helps wounded uk soldiers. Worsley timed his charity trek to coincide with the centennial of the famed 1915 attempt by ernest shackleton, an explorer for whom he had a lifelong fascination, notes the telegraph. His death has caught the attention of the royal family: \" harry and i are very sad to hear of the loss of henry worsley, \" prince william said in a statement. \" we are incredibly proud to be associated with him. \" ( see newly unearthed photos from the 1915 expedition. )",

Several victims are said to be in \" grave \" condition, ria novosti reports. The 10-ton meteor was traveling at least 33,000mph when it entered the atmosphere, experts say, according to the ap. The explosion occurred between 18 and 32 miles from ground level near the ural mountains. Shockwaves damaged buildings, the bbc reports, breaking glass that caused most of the injuries. Some meteorites — fragments from the meteor — eventually landed near a lake. As the ap explains, meteors typically cause sizeable sonic booms when they enter the atmosphere because they are traveling much faster than the speed of sound. But widespread meteor-related injuries like today's are very rare. \" there was a very loud noise, similar to the roar of an airplane, and then a detonation and the shattering of glass, \" said a student at one of a pair of schools where some 20 kids were hurt. \" we had the feeling that something very large had landed in the neighboring courtyard. \" a zinc factory looked like a bomb had hit it, der spiegel reports. One of the craters left by a meteorite measures nearly 20 feet in diameter, and almost 3,000 buildings were damaged to some extent.

People took photos of the fish — which has razor-sharp, \" fang-like \" teeth, and grows up to 6.6 feet in length, notes tech times — and posted them on facebook, inspiring some people to say they would stay out of the water for now, the daily mail reports. The fish itself was reluctant to leave when put back in the ocean, possibly because it was ill, reports wistv.com. The two species of lancetfish have a long history — dating back 11 to 16 million years, biologists say — and are the only survivors of the genus alepisaurus, or scaleless lizard. Living at great depths, it swims in most waters outside of polar regions and likes eating shrimp, other crustaceans, and occasionally another lancetfish. Its watery muscles are poorly suited for long-distance swimming, so it likely ambushes prey. \" i wouldn't want that thing lancing me! \" wrote one facebook user, reports aol travel. \" wow!! very prehistoric looking!! \"",

( it's here, known as the madrid statement. ) a previous type of pfas, popularized by dupont years ago in teflon products, is no longer in use because of concerns the chemicals lingered in bodies and raised the risk of cancer. In today's warning letter, scientists warn that the replacement pfass need far more study to make sure they're safe. \"research is needed to find safe alternatives for all current uses of pfass, \" writes health and human services official linda birnbaum in a companion commentary piece. \"the question is, should these chemicals continue to be used in consumer products in the meantime, given their persistence in the environment? \" reps from the chemical industry and dupont in particular insist that the chemicals are safe.

The wife of larry isenberg, 68, said he fell from their boat and drowned in lake coeur d ' alene in february, but the county examiner now says he died with lethal levels of benadryl in his body and showed no signs of drowning or stroke. What's more, wife laurcene ( lori ) barnes, 64, has failed to appear for an arraignment involving grand theft and 40 counts of forgery, and the family's will has been altered to evenly divide the estate between their eight children from previous marriages — two on larry's side and six on lori's, the spokesman-review reports. Also at issue is lori's description of the drowning: she waited two hours to report it, had a bloody nose when she did, and said larry appeared ill before falling out of the boat, while his friends say he'd been in good health. On the day larry vanished, the coeur d ' alene press reported that lori had left her job as director of the north idaho housing coalition. After an internal audit, she was arrested for allegedly stealing from the nonprofit, was released on $ 75,000 bond, and hasn't been seen since. A $ 500,000 warrant was issued for her arrest, and now the spokane sheriff's office has a warrant for crimes including murder, grand theft, and criminal conspiracy. The sheriff is also investigating lori's daughters, amber hosking and jessica barnes, for conspiracy to commit theft and first-degree murder. Per fox 28 spokane, a family friend tells detectives that \" the only tension he knew of between larry and lori was her constant enabling and giving of money to help out her daughters. \"",

Now the 57-year-old ex-marine ( and ex-dea agent, and personal trainer, and group exercise instructor ) has another athletic feat under his belt: the \" people's plank, \" a five-hour, 15-minute, and 15-second plank that he pulled off on saturday in oceanside, calif. Hood's abdominal bridge — resting on your forearms in a push-up position for as long as you can — beat the record of four hours, 26 minutes set by a chinese police officer in september. To put those times in context: the san diego union-tribune notes that a \" typical \" plank is one minute; a \" greater challenge \" for most people would be five minutes. Hood trained for nine months — four to six hours a day, with at least 30 hours of planking thrown in every week, nbc notes. During his record attempt, hood asked for as many distractions as possible: he chatted with the support crew there to place ice chips under his achy elbows, concentrated on music blaring from the loudspeakers, and studied objects that spectators placed on the mat in front of him. One thing he didn't focus on was time: no one was to tell him how much longer he had until he broke the record, per the union-tribune. Hood's world record wasn't only meant to reassert his planking powers ( he had held the record before mao weidong beat it last fall ): he was also there to raise money for injured us service members. \" the discomfort that i feel right now pales in comparison to [ what ] they feel, \" he told nbc.

And while we're being candid, let's just come out and say it: planks destroy your abs. For a pretty basic isometric exercise, planks strengthen your entire body — they make your core pop, strengthen your lower back, and build your shoulders. Better yet, you don't need any equipment, and you can amp-up the intensity by widening your stance and bracing yourself with your hands instead of your forearms and elbows. See for yourself.

        "summary": "Lars mittank spent the first week of july 2014 with friends at a bulgarian beach resort. He has spent the nearly four years since as one of youtube's greatest mysteries. Kirk pepi has the story at mel magazine. Pepi writes that the 28-year-old's holiday with his five former classmates from itzehoe, germany, was unremarkable, with two exceptions: his friends noticed he ate very little, and he got in a fight with some other germans at a mcdonald's over rival football teams. His friends had already gone back to the hotel; mittank says he got punched in the face, and that the force ruptured his eardrum. And so he told friends he had to delay his flight to hamburg for a day to give his eardrum more time to heal. They left — and things started to get weird. He made whispering phone calls to his mom, saying he was being followed; the hotel's cameras saw him pacing and hiding in an elevator. But he managed to make it to the terminal on the morning of july 8 and went to the airport doctor to get cleared for takeoff. Dr. Kosta kostov determined he could fly home but noticed mittank seemed paranoid, doubly so when an airport construction worker walked into the office. Mittank stood up, left his bags behind, and ran — through the terminal and a parking lot, over a barbed-wire fence, and into the woods. Airport surveillance footage of his exit has been watched some 16 million times via video compilations of odd mysteries, writes pepi, who calls him \" maybe the most famous missing person on youtube. \" and he remains missing. Read the full story for more on the private investigator mittank's mom hired.",

        "summary": "Jim webb last night became the first \" well-known \" democrat, as politico puts it, to launch a presidential exploratory committee. The announcement came last night via a new website, webb2016.com, and webb ( a former one-term virginia senator, vietnam vet, and ronald reagan's navy secretary ) didn't exactly hold back in explaining his motivation. The simple site features a 14-minute video and 2,100-word letter. A sampling: \" the democratic party used to be the place where people … could come not for a handout but for an honest handshake, good full-time jobs, quality education, health care they can afford, and the vital, overriding belief that we're all in this together and the system is not rigged. We can get there again. The american dream does survive. I see it every day in the journey of my wife hong, who at the age of seven escaped with her extended family on a fishing boat when the communists took over south vietnam in 1975 … and [ who ] through her own determination became a graduate of cornell law school. Everybody deserves that opportunity. \" the formation of the committee will enable webb to begin raising money as he weighs an official run; he's the first to do so for 2016, and, as russell berman notes for the atlantic, he's the \" first democrat to challenge the assumed candidacy of hillary clinton. \" webb didn't mention her in the video or letter. Berman's take: \" while he would bring experience both in foreign and domestic policy to a presidential race, he is neither widely known nor a particularly dynamic speaker, and it's unclear whether he ' ll be able to amass the necessary funds to mount a serious bid. \"",

        "summary": "Police today discovered the partially decomposed bodies of at least 20 migrants piled up in a truck parked on the shoulder of an austrian highway leading from the hungarian border. The chief of burgenland police, hans peter doskozil, says the truck has hungarian license plates. The state of the bodies made establishing the identity and exact number of dead migrants difficult, but the total number could rise to 50, says doskozil. It's believed the migrants suffocated, the guardian reports, via the krone newspaper. Doskozil adds the truck was apparently abandoned yesterday and its back door was left open. Police ordered reporters converging on the scene, about 25 miles southeast of vienna, to move away from the vehicle, a white refrigeration truck with images of food items on it. One reporter on the scene describes a \" terrible smell of death. \" \" human smugglers are criminals, \" interior minister johanna mikl-leitner says, condemning the traffickers. \" those who still think that they are gentle helpers of refugees are beyond saving. \"",

        "summary": "Pro athletes in cuba make all of $ 20 a month, which goes a long way toward explaining why so many baseball players, boxers, and others have been defecting of late. But now the government hopes to remedy that: new rules will let cuban athletes sign contracts to play in foreign lands for the first time, reports reuters. It's a little unclear, however, whether that means baseball players will be able to jump to american teams. Both reuters and ap think cuban officials will prevent that, at least in the near future, because of the american embargo on cuba. Athletes who want to play elsewhere will still have to fulfill some obligations to their homeland, including a pledge to compete on behalf of cuba in international competitions. Raul castro's government also is raising athletes ' monthly pay from that measly $ 20 to somewhere between $ 40 and $ 200, says reuters. Now contrast that with the seven-year deal for $ 42 million signed by cuban defector yasiel puig with the dodgers.",
