Robin thicke and brother brennan, the oldest of thicke's three sons, say that tanya callau — who wed thicke in 2005 — is threatening them with bad publicity unless they give her more of thicke's estate. Thicke left much of his estate to his three children, but callau still inherited a significant amount ( the hollywood reporter has the exact breakdown ) and was allowed to continue living on his carpinteria, calif., ranch. Thicke's sons say their father acquired most of his wealth before meeting callau, and that she signed a prenup prior to marrying thicke. They also say she had no issues with the prenup or the estate plan the last time thicke updated his trust, in february 2016. ( he died in december. ) but now, thicke's sons claim, callau is claiming the prenup is invalid and there are problems with the trust. Per a petition the brothers filed in a los angeles court this week, the brothers say callau also claims she has community rights to more of thicke's assets, she should be reimbursed for any improvements she makes to the ranch while living there, and that she took a step back from her own career to support thicke and help raise his youngest son. The brothers ' attorney says in the filing that callau has \" threatened to make her claims fodder for'tabloid publicity ' unless the co-trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands, \" leading the brothers to ask a court to enforce the prenup and thicke's will, tmz reports. Callau's rep says in a statement, \" tanya thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public. \"",

        "summary": "President trump's first budget proposal was officially unveiled thursday morning — and it delivers exactly what he promised. The proposal — titled \" america first: a budget blueprint to make america great again \" — contains cuts that the washington post says could be the biggest reduction in federal programs since the post-world war ii drawdown. The environmental protection agency and the state department are the hardest-hit agencies according to budget previews, with cuts of around 30 %. Military spending would be beefed up by $ 54 billion under the proposal, $ 1.5 billion is earmarked for a border wall, and homeland security would get a 6.8 % funding increase. A roundup of coverage about the $ 1.15 trillion spending plan: the document is here. Politico reports that the budget is \" red meat \" for trump's base, with deep cuts to their most disliked government agencies and programs, though it is also what's known as a \" skinny budget \" because it is so short on details. A more detailed budget will be out in may. The ap lists winners and losers. The latter group includes the departments of energy, labor, and transportation, along with after-school programs and many independent agencies supported by tax dollars. White house budget director mick mulvaney acknowledged that the cuts would lead to job losses, reuters reports. \" you can't drain the swamp and leave all the people in it, \" he said during a budget preview wednesday. He said that white house officials had looked at trump's campaign speeches, and \" turned those policies into numbers. \" the new york times reports that congressional republicans have already declared parts of the plan dead on arrival. \" the administration's budget isn't going to be the budget, \" sen. Marco rubio told reporters. \" we do the budget here. The administration makes recommendations, but congress does budgets. \" the hill notes that such proposals tend to be \" little more than guidance \" for lawmakers — and that the senate shot down obama's 2015 budget 98 to 1. The ap reports that the budget funds trump's boost for the pentagon, the biggest since ronald reagan's, with cuts to conservative targets including the national endowment for the arts, legal aid for the poor, and the americorps national service program. Nbc notes that trump's proposal, which makes cuts to 12 out of 15 cabinet agencies, only covers the \" discretionary \" quarter of the $ 4 trillion budget for the fiscal year that starts in october. The portion dealing with issues including taxation, social security, and medicare is due in mid-may. The",

It seems young hanhang tripped and fell with the chopstick in his hand, and it went straight up his nose, according to a report by central european news spotted by fox. His parents saw it happen, removed the chopstick — or so they thought — and took him to the hospital to be safe. Unfortunately, doctors sent him home without realizing that about 2 inches of the chopstick had broken off and was still inside. \"when we got home after our first visit to the hospital, my husband broke all the chopsticks in half and threw them away as we were worried something like this could happen again, \" says his mother, yu liao. When the boy grew increasingly lethargic and sick, his parents brought him back, and only then did an x-ray reveal the reason. Hanhang showed immediate improvement once it was removed. The mommy files blog at the san francisco chronicle rounds up two similar stories and concludes, \" note to parents: chopsticks are to only be handled by children sitting at the dinner table. \" ( the x-ray calls to mind another strange case, this one involving a nail gun. )",

As bmj tells the washington post, the british pair whose bottoms became infested with hookworm larvae on a beach in martinique initially agreed to the jan. 13 publication of their case, as well as photos of \" red pinprick marks \" on their backsides. Though their names were never mentioned, the pair \" indicated their understanding that complete anonymity could not be guaranteed \" and were warned journalists might pick up the story, bmj says. But when that happened — with headlines like \" his and her hookworm: same rash strikes couple on the rear \" — the pair had a change of heart. With the spread of photos and case details — including the woman's age, the couple's caribbean destination, the cruise line on which they traveled, and the cambridge hospital they visited — one of the pair asked that the article be withdrawn over concerns \" about being identified by close friends and/or colleagues, \" bmj says. In what the post calls a \" highly unusual ' correction, ' \" the journal then announced it was pulling the article despite standing by its content. As the independent reports, the article was meant to helpful in combating a lack of familiarity in the medical community with hookworm infections. According to the cdc, such infections can be passed through contact with soil or sand contaminated with feces. As the bmj study explained, the british couple were infected when they sat on a sandy, and apparently unsanitary, beach.",

Russia and the taliban deflected any insinuation that their relationship has ventured into equipment provisions, with taliban officials telling reuters that russia has offered only \" moral and political support. \" as for russia's take on a possible supply chain: \" absolutely false, \" a russian foreign ministry rep told ria novosti, via the tasnim iranian news agency. As stars and stripes notes, russia has tried to evade full-on criticism for its taliban rapport by claiming the militants are going after isis, not afghani forces. However, army gen. John nicholson, in charge of us forces in afghanistan, has said he rejects the \" public legitimacy \" that russia tries to impart on the taliban. Nbc news reports that scaparrotti's theory comes just hours after reports that the taliban had taken hold thursday of the district center of the \" hotly contested town \" of sangin, although that hasn't been confirmed.

        "summary": "\" a move on straws \" is afoot across the pond, and mcdonald's is driving the push. The fast-food chain is nixing plastic straws and moving to paper in all of its ireland and united kingdom restaurants in what the uk's environment secretary calls a \" significant contribution \" to going green, the bbc reports. Those locations currently use 1.8 million plastic straws per day. The straw switchover will start in september and be fully in place by 2019. The initiative comes after a trial run there, and new paper-straw trials are set for some mcdonald's locations in france, norway, sweden, australia, and the us, cnbc notes. Cnnmoney notes that, per trash-mapping app litterati, plastic straws are the sixth most common type of litter in the world. Only about 1 % of plastic straws are recycled, and, because of their combination polypropylene-polystyrene makeup, they can take hundreds of years to decompose. Some advocates say plastic straws are safer for certain customers with disabilities, but mcdonald's says the plastic versions will still be available upon request \" for those that require it. \"",

        "summary": "One potentially tragic consequence of the government shutdown: with 16 employees of craters of the moon national monument in idaho now on furlough, the search for a missing woman last seen there has slowed dramatically. Jo elliott-blakeslee, 63, went hiking with amy linkert, 69, on sept. 19; they were reported missing last monday when elliott-blakeslee didn't arrive at work. The body of linkert, who is believed to have died from exposure, was found last week, cbs news reports. Now elliott-blakeslee's family is asking experienced hikers to help search for her, kboi reports — the station notes that federal workers can't even volunteer to do their jobs during a shutdown. More unfortunate consequences: children with cancer are being blocked from starting clinical trials, officials say, since federal health employees are also on furlough. Each week of the shutdown, 200 patients won't be able to start their clinical trials; 15 % of these patients are expected to be children, and 33 % of those children ( or 10 per week for as long as the shutdown lasts ) have cancer. Ongoing clinical trials will continue, however, abc news reports. The cdc has also furloughed employees, so it can't track multi-state disease outbreaks. And its seasonal flu program will be halted, which might hinder its ability to create next year's flu shot, a spokesperson says. The washington post has a list of the nine most painful consequences. Among them: of the more than 2 million federal workers whose paychecks might be delayed, 800,000 might never actually get paid. If the shutdown lasts more than a couple of weeks, veterans may not receive pension payments or see their disability claims paid. Disability benefits for non-veterans could also be interrupted. The women, infants and children ( wic ) nutritional program could keep running through october in many states, but could shut down after just one week in some. And head start programs, which provide health, nutrition, and other services to low-income kids, will gradually start closing. Npr runs down the shutdown's many impacts on science and health. Workers are furloughed and programs are being shut down at the national institutes of health, the cdc, the fda, nasa, the us geological survey, noaa, the epa, the forest service, and the nuclear regulatory commission.

        "summary": "A month after confirming zika causes birth defects, cdc researchers say there is a \" substantial \" risk that a pregnant woman will have a baby with a birth defect if infected with zika during her first trimester. More specifically, the risk for microencaphaly is 1 % to 14 % depending on the scenario, reports the ap. The range is wide given that research into the disease is relatively new. For the study, scientists analyzed data from 400 babies diagnosed with microcephaly — in which babies are born with abnormally small heads — in the brazilian state of bahia between july and february. Because the study focused exclusively on microcephaly in a single brazilian state, \" these numbers are probably only the tip of the iceberg, \" says a ucla professor. One notable quirk: the bigger the outbreak, the better the odds are of having a healthy baby — because more women would be exposed before becoming pregnant and perhaps develop immunity. When the outbreak is small, the risk rises to the 14 % level. An earlier study out of brazil put the risk of zika-related birth defects and fetal death at almost 30 %, though one based on a zika outbreak in french polynesia put the risk of microcephaly at 1 %. But even a 1 % risk could be devastating in developing countries, where there are limited care options for disabled children, a health expert tells usa today. A separate study published wednesday notes three brazilian infants with microcephaly showed eye problems not linked to zika before, including retinal lesions, hemorrhaging, and abnormal blood vessel development, per a release. ( the number of pregnant women with zika in the us has nearly tripled. )",

Tom cruise stars as an antiquities hunter who disturbs an egyptian sarcophagus and awakes an evil spirit. Here's what critics are saying: peter travers calls the mummy \" a monster fail \" that kills anticipation for future franchise flicks. It has too much cgi, and director alex kurtzman \" can't seem to make sense of a script by numerous writers clearly unashamed of hack work, \" he writes at rolling stone. He adds russell crowe appears as dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde for no good reason. Crowe is \" surprisingly fun \" in this role, but the film's attempts to make him into \" head honcho, superhero, and mad scientist all at once \" may be its \" worst conceptual misfire, \" rafer guzman writes at newsday. But then, \" virtually everything in this movie seems like the wrong decision. \" it's a \" massive mess of a movie \" that \" seems doomed to repulse anyone who comes across it, \" he writes. Glenn kenny was also thrown off by the jekyll character, but that's just one reason he's warning that the \" dark universe \" franchise might be a \" grievously ill-advised \" one. Its first installment has \" plenty to get irritated about, \" including some \" very old-school sexism, \" he writes at rogerebert.com. It's \" amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other, better horror and sci-fi movies \" to boot. It's not all bad, though, writes stephanie merry at the washington post. \" some of the action is thrilling, especially a brilliantly choreographed plane crash, \" and there are a \" few genuinely funny moments. \" but those moments \" are no match for the cumbersome, convoluted story, not to mention the nonexistent chemistry between cruise and [ annabelle ] wallis, \" she notes.

He garnered national attention as the president of the national association of evangelicals and much more in 2006, after it came to light he'd had sex with and taken drugs with a male prostitute. Since then, he's appeared in countless news reports and documentaries that were shown on tlc and hbo. He's been featured on \"divorce court \" \"oprah winfrey \" and \"larry king live. \" but an actual reality show? this would be new. \"celebrity wife swap \" is based on the british show of the same name and is similar to \"wife swap, \" an american tv series that provided hours of jaw-dropping culture clashes between ordinary families. The premise is simple: haggard and busey will swap partners for a short time. The first couple of days, the men make the rules for their new \"spouses. \" after that, the women take charge.",

The search engine says it has removed offensive autocomplete results initially spotted by carole cadwalladr at the observer, reports the guardian. Cadwalladr explained how google suggested a search for \" are jews evil \" when \" are jews \" was typed into its search box. Typing \" are women \" and \" are muslims \" returned \" are women evil \" and \" are muslims bad, \" cadwalladr said. Clicking those suggestions took her to page results that would lead one to conclude that \" jews are evil. Women are evil. Islam must be destroyed. Hitler was one of the good guys, \" cadwalladr added. An answer box highlighted by google even explained that \" every woman has some degree of prostitute in her. \" a data scientist urged google to take action, noting it had \" clearly become a conduit for right-wing hate sites \" and a victim of \" the troll army, \" per the guardian. \" it is clearly very frightening what is going on here. \" most of the offensive autocomplete results spotted by cadwalladr have since been erased — \" are women equal to men \" was among them, per cbs news — though \" are muslims bad \" is still a suggestion.

        "summary": "A 5-month-old born using a \" revolutionary \" genetic technique is said to be the world's first baby created using dna from three parents since the technique was banned about two decades ago, new scientist reports. The boy, ided by the international business times as abrahim hassan, was born in mexico to jordanian parents, and embryologists are hoping his successful birth will hasten using the procedure elsewhere. Abrahim's mother, shaban, carries the gene for leigh syndrome — a severe neurological condition that decimates mental and physical capabilities and often results in a child's death before kindergarten. Although hassan herself is healthy, her first two children died from the disease. That's when she and her husband looked for assistance from nyc's new hope fertility center, where a team led by dr. John zhang started them off on an alternative way to parenthood. There are a couple of different ways to pull off the three-parent technique, but the one they chose to go with is called spindle nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus from the mother's egg is placed in a donor egg whose own nucleus has been taken out; that egg, which then contains nuclear dna from the mom and mitochondrial dna from the donor, is fertilized with the father's sperm. Five embryos were created in this case, and when just one \" took, \" it was implanted into hassan, who delivered abrahim nine months later. This all had to be done in mexico, where zhang says \" there are no rules \" ( the times labels it \" relatively flexible legislation \"; the procedure isn't approved in the us ). One concern scientists are keeping an eye on: faulty mitochondria that could replicate, a problem that may have occurred when the technique was last tried in the ' 90s.

While standardized tests showed 11.6 % of americans 65 and older had dementia in 2000, only 8.8 % did in 2012, reports nbc news. What's more, people are getting dementia later, with the average age at diagnosis increasing from 80.7 to 82.4 over the same period, reports the new york times. One possible factor: a person's average education increased during that period from 11.8 years to 12.7 years, say university of michigan researchers. \" education might actually change the brain itself, \" lead author kenneth langa tells npr. \" we think that it actually creates more, and more complicated, connections between the nerve cells so that you're able to keep thinking normally later into life. \" another potential factor: while health ailments linked to dementia such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol increased, people were treating them with better medications. The study draws on long-range data about 20,000 americans from all kinds of backgrounds, and langa says it suggests that dire predictions about the nation's dementia problem might have been been overstated. The alzheimer's association isn't so sure: though dementia rates may be falling, \" the total number of americans with alzheimer's and other dementias is expected to continue to increase dramatically \" as the number of older adults climbs, \" it says. In the us, the number of people 65 and older is projected to double by 2050, notes npr. ( a game could reduce your dementia risk. )",

        "summary": "Like low-status neanderthals, contemporary men who aren't exactly winners — literally, when it comes to playing video games — are more likely to harass women online, new research cited in the washington post finds. Scientists who conducted the study published in plos one played 163 games of halo as either male-voiced players or female-voiced players ( 82 female, 81 male ) with remote teammates and opponents. The study gauged a remote player's skill by measuring such factors like kills and deaths. Researchers found men were typically cordial to players they believed to be male, and that more skilled men who kicked first-shooter butt were less likely to direct negative comments toward female-voiced players than their less skilled male counterparts. But lamer players tended to take their frustrations out on female players with more frequent, caustic comments. A lead author notes that gaming provides the perfect breeding ground for this kind of behavior: after all, the post notes, players can remain anonymous, they may never run into an online teammate or opponent again, and it's a significantly male-biased recreation. Females threaten gamers ' \" pre-existing social hierarchy \"; the guys at the bottom of the virtual totem pole feel threatened and therefore become more threatening to those they think they can quash the easiest. \" as men often rely on aggression to maintain their dominant social status, the increase in hostility towards a woman by lower-status males may be an attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank, \" the study notes. Such gamer communities mirror male-dominated industries — such as engineering or the tech field — and may promote sexist actions in real life, scientists warn.",

While the lawmakers debated, riot police clashed with protesters outside the parliament building. Parliament must pass the measures — which include wage cuts, tax increases and privatizations in a recession-starved country — before greece's foreign lenders unlock the next installment of aid that the country needs to avoid default. Prime minister george a. Papandreou has a five-vote parliamentary majority as he tries to push through the austerity plan, which strikes at the heart of his socialist party base. The center-right new democracy opposition party has struck a populist tone and opposes the measures, saying they offer too much austerity and not enough stimulus. In the tense countdown ahead of the vote to approve the austerity package, which is scheduled for wednesday, at least one member of parliament from the socialist party who had opposed the bill changed his mind.

        "summary": "What happens when humans abandon 1,600 square miles because of radioactivity? wildlife runs rampant, apparently. A new study on animals in the chernobyl exclusion zone shows what once looked something like a wasteland is now packed with elk, roe deer, red deer, wild boar, and wolves. Researchers conducted aerial surveys in the zone during winter months between 1987 — a year after the chernobyl disaster — and 1997 and estimated animal populations based on tracks in the snow, reports the guardian. They found the number of animals in the area was actually on par with those in four uncontaminated nature reserves nearby; but the number of wolves was more than seven times greater than in reserves. The numbers of elk, roe deer, and wild boar also jumped at a time when elk and wild boar populations were sliding elsewhere in the former soviet union. \" it's very likely that wildlife numbers at chernobyl are much higher than they were before the accident, \" a researcher says in a release. \" this doesn't mean radiation is good for wildlife, just that the effects of human habitation, including hunting, farming, and forestry, are a lot worse. \" but another researcher who has studied birds in the zone tells the bbc the research \" only applies to large mammals under hunting pressure, rather than the vast majority of animals — most birds, small mammals, and insects — that are not directly influenced by human habitation. \" and since the study didn't look at radiation exposure, it \" does not address the issue of whether radiation has effects on reproduction, survival, longevity, or general health of the animals surveyed. \" while scientists found chernobyl's wild boar population dipped in 1993, they say hungry wolves and a disease outbreak were to blame.

An earlier version of the bill passed by the system would have done away with north carolina's system of requiring a handgun purchase permit for those who want to buy a pistol but don't hold a concealed handgun permit. The house rejected the bill largely based on this measure. The compromise passed by by both chambers tuesday keeps the current handgun permit system in place but gives local sheriffs less latitude in issuing the permits. Sheriffs will no longer be able restrict the number of handgun permits an individual can obtain in a year, something that some sheriffs do now. Also, sheriffs will have to keep a record and show cause when they reject a handgun permit application. \" there's really no uniformity of practices now, \" said rep. Jacqueline schaffer, r-mecklenburg. \" you can have difference in outcomes in wake county versus mecklenburg. \" other parts of the bill will allow concealed handgun permit holders to bring their weapons to bars and restaurants that serve alcohol – although they are not supposed to consume alcohol – carry them in funeral processions and allow them to keep firearms locked in their car when parked on college or public school campuses. The bill also removes information regarding those who hold concealed handgun permits from public view. The bill also strengthens penalties for those who violate firearms laws and will increase the amount of information, such as mental health problems, in the state's background check system. The house passed the measure on a 73-41 vote. The",
            "North carolina lawmakers have approved a bill greatly expanding where concealed handguns are legally allowed. The republican-backed bill approved by both the house and senate on tuesday allows concealed-carry permit holders to take firearms into bars and restaurants and other places where alcohol is served as long as the owner doesn't expressly forbid it. The measure will also allow concealed-carry permit holders to store weapons in locked cars on the campus of any public school or university. Guns will also now be allowed on greenways, playgrounds and other public recreation areas. The final bill dropped a controversial provision that would have repealed the long-standing law requiring a background check and permit issued by county sheriffs for handgun purchases. The measure now heads to republican gov. Pat mccrory's desk."

Who was i before? who was i then — is that part of me? who am i now? \" the new york times reports hannah upp, a 32-year-old teacher in st. Thomas, disappeared sept. 14, a week after hurricane irma hit the virgin islands. Her clothes, car, keys, cellphone, passport, and wallet were found at a beach where she had gone for a swim. Upp was still missing five days later when hurricane maria battered the caribbean. Upp is far from the only person missing in the wake of the storms, but her case is unique in that she may not even know she's missing. Upp has dissociative fugue, a very rare type of amnesia made famous by the fictional jason bourne. \" normally, we forget things in little pieces, \" dr. David spiegel says. \" these people forget things in large pieces that involve what they've done for the last year or two years. \" in 2008, upp was found floating face down in new york harbor by a ferry captain. She had been missing for three weeks at that point and remembered nothing of that period. \" i went from going for a run to being in the ambulance, \" upp said after her rescue. Newsweek reports upp disappeared again in 2013 in maryland — this time for two days. Now friends and family are hoping upp has once again entered a fugue state and didn't drown or fall victim to a crime. \" my hope is that she found somewhere safe to hide, \" friend maggie guzman says. Official resources are stretched thin responding to the two hurricanes, so upp's friends have been searching for her and putting up posters, hoping she sees one. \" if she's in her fugue state, it would at least get her to the point where she realizes something's wrong, \" friend jake bradley tells the virgin islands daily news.",

Louis post-dispatch set the stage further: \" there for a brief moment, before rally cat came into their lives, yadier molina paused at the plate, stood tall, and pointed his bat toward left field, appearing as if he were calling his shot. \" as it turns out, he was pointing to a cat in the outfield that went on to interrupt the game for a few entertaining minutes. When the game resumed, molina hit a grand slam on the very next pitch, and the lead held for a st. Louis victory. \" i ' m not a cat person, but i sure like that one, \" cardinals manager mike matheny said after the game. The mlb site has video of the cat ( immediately dubbed \" rally cat \" in the game's broadcast ) scampering around and either biting or scratching the st. Louis field crew member who finally corralled it. Others are posting youtube clips. It's not clear whether the cat is a stray, but if so it would surely find a home quickly given the fans'reaction. The incident calls to mind a similar one involving a squirrel in the 2011 playoffs.

It happened in wellington, as falbo mowed the back yard of boyd jentzsch and laura gontchar. The husband and wife had put food out for the ducklings and were watching with their 7-year-old son as the mother duck led them out of a lake to feed. That's when they say falbo deliberately headed for the ducks on his riding mower, ran them over, and hit them again in reverse. Seven died instantly, and two more made it back to the water and drowned, say police. Only the mother and two ducklings survived. \" we were horrified, \" jentzsch tells the sun sentinel. He, his wife, and their son, kai, ran after falbo as he neared the ducks screaming for him to stop, to no avail. The family says falbo was laughing on his second pass over the ducks. They booted him from the property and called animal control, and falbo was charged with nine counts of animal cruelty. His employer tells cbs12 that falbo is \" kind-hearted \" and wouldn't have run over the ducks on purpose. He says falbo didn't see them in the tall grass and backed up after the first pass only because he wanted to avoid hitting more ducks in front of him. He is being held on $ 27,000 bond.

That flag, frankly, is divisive, and it shouldn't be shown. \" he refueled that fire saturday when he tweeted in response to the charleston church shootings, writing, \" take down the #confederateflag at the sc capitol.

Scott walker, who says, \" i fully expect the leaders of south carolina to debate this, but the conversation should wait until after the families have had a chance to bury and mourn their loved ones. \" texas sen. Ted cruz is trying to see both sides, saying he understands \" those who see a history of racial oppression and a history of slavery \" embedded in the flag, but that he also gets \" those who want to remember the sacrifices of their ancestors and the traditions of their states, not the racial oppression. \" sen. Marco rubio, businesswoman carly fiorina, and expected presidential candidate ohio gov. John kasich are taking a non-interventionist approach ( though fiorina and kasich say they agree personally with taking the flag down ), stating it's up to the people of south carolina to decide what to do — not \" outsiders, \" as rubio puts it.

The post also revealed that principal photography is now complete. The movie opens dec. 18 of next year, usa today reports, and very few other details are officially known other than the fact that it reportedly takes place three decades after return of the jedi. The cast was announced earlier this year, and in addition to old favorites ( harrison ford, mark hamill, carrie fisher, anthony daniels, kenny baker, peter mayhew ), the movie will star andy serkis ( the lord of the rings ), gwendoline christie ( game of thrones ), max von sydow, and lupita nyong ' o, plus a number of young, little-known actors. The original movies, of course, also featured a trio of relative unknowns, and usa today speculates on the meaning of the title: \" the fact that [ the force is ] ' awakening ' could refer to the new characters the film will introduce. \" entertainment weekly notes that the title raises a question: \" has the force been … slumbering?... Maybe this energy that binds the galaxy together has only been visible to a select few, while the denizens of the galaxy put their faith in the science and technology of interstellar travel? \" ok, so that may not tell us much, but at least one important person has high hopes for the new film: daniels, perhaps better known as c-3po, tweeted sunday: \" ' no movie sequel is better than the empire strikes back. ' you might eat those words for xmas dinner in 2015. Joy &amp; indigestion to the world! \"",

Capote and lee had been writing partners for years, and she even based a character in to kill a mockingbird on him, bustle reports. But in a 2006 letter to flynt, lee said of capote: \" his compulsive lying was like this: if you said,'did you know jfk was shot? ' he'd easily answer, ' yes, i was driving the car he was riding in. ' \" she also said that while their friendship was strained by capote's drinking and \" misery, \" it was ultimately ruined by jealousy. \" i did something truman could not forgive: i wrote a novel that sold, \" she wrote. \" he nursed his envy for more than 20 years. \" to kill a mockingbird has sold more than 40 million copies.

The new york times describes wright as a \" rebel, \" both hosts as \" irreverent and eccentric, \" and the recipes as \" sometimes confounding. \" wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \" i've had a fantastic life and i've done everything i could have wanted to do and more. \" it wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \" if you're fat you're fat, \" she once said. \" i hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name. \" her agent remembers wright similarly in a statement: \" loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, clarissa was utterly non-pc and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost. \" there's no word on wright's cause of death, but the guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year.",

If it were just a simple case of tb, there wouldn't be such a brouhaha — but the unnamed patient has extensively drug-resistant tb, or xdr tb, which doesn't respond to some of the most powerful anti-tb drugs, per the world health organization. Although the disease is rare — the cdc says only 63 cases of it were noted between 1993 and 2011 — tb bacteria can enter the air via coughs or sneezes and remain there for several hours, the agency notes. After spending time in india — the country with the largest number of tb cases in 2013, according to who — the woman flew back to chicago in april, then traveled to missouri and tennessee over the next seven weeks, notes nbc. Cnn points out as many as 8 weeks can pass between exposure and a positive tb test. A spokeswoman for the mchenry county health department in illinois tells the chicago tribune it's keeping an eye on some people the woman was in close contact with and that the general public is likely not at risk. An nih statement says the patient is being treated in a room \" specifically designed for handling patients with respiratory infections, including xdr-tb, \" per nbc; the cdc says she's in stable condition.

        "summary": "The us military is trying to reclaim signing bonuses and student loan compensation it says it improperly awarded to 9,700 california soldiers during the mid- to late 2000s, at the height of the iraq and afghanistan wars. The la times reports that soldiers who served their six-year contracts to completion are now being placed in debt collection for failing to return their bonuses, which in many cases were as high as $ 25,000. The soldiers, understandably, are less than thrilled that a government they put their lives on the line for is now trying to walk back on its promises. \" i signed a contract that i literally risked my life to fulfill, \" says former army sergeant first class robert richmond, one of the soldiers from whom the government is trying to reclaim money. \" they ' ll get their money, but i want those years back, \" says former army master sergeant susan haley. The issue, npr reports, stems from a 2010 discovery that california's national guard office had misspent up to $ 100 million. Independent audits revealed the money had gone to signing bonuses for soldiers who shouldn't have been eligible for such compensation. ( it was meant to be limited to \" soldiers in high-demand assignments... [ or ] noncommissioned officers badly needed in units due to deploy, \" per the times. ) a years-long review of the program revealed almost 10,000 incidences of improperly awarded bonuses — bonuses the military say it's legally required to recoup. No one, from soldiers to military leadership to lawmakers, is happy about the situation. The military says it would happily defer the debts if congress would legalize it. As the story gains more media traction, the california house of representatives on sunday condemned the pentagon's effort to recoup the money, and pledged to do what it could to help the veterans.",
