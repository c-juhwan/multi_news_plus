        "summary": "Lars von trier is back at the cannes film festival, seven years after he was banned for declaring he was a nazi — and the danish director is as controversial as ever. His new serial-killer drama, the house that jack built, prompted more than 100 people to walk out of its monday night debut at the festival, with some calling it \" disgusting, \" variety reports. The movie stars matt dillon as a killer who sadistically murders and dismembers women, with one victim played by uma thurman. The walkouts began during a scene in which the killer shoots two small children, and there was a steady stream of people leaving during later scenes. Those who remained gave von trier a standing ovation. Some critics slammed the \" vomitous \" movie and said it should never have been made, though others defended it, arguing that anybody going to a von trier movie about a serial killer should have known what they were in for, reports the san francisco chronicle. In a less controversial premiere, director spike lee received a 10-minute ovation after the debut of comedy-drama blackkklansman, based on the true story of a black police officer who masterminded the infiltration of a kkk chapter in the 1970s. The audience erupted in applause at least six times during the screening, which had a closing sequence that the hollywood reporter calls \" one of the most emotional finales to hit cannes in recent memory. \"",

The report, published in the british medical journal, could offer a warning not only to contact-wearing patients who go long stretches without eye exams, but to optometrists as well, since the clump of lenses hadn't caused an obvious infection. If such an incident did lead to an infection, a person could lose her sight, the specialist trainee warns. In this woman's case, doctors say her \" deep-set eyes \" could be part of the reason so many contacts — which were bound together by mucus, per time — could have accumulated without notice.",

        "summary": "Christopher e. Filardi, a director at the american museum of natural history, stumbled upon an elusive male moustached kingfisher while on guadalcanal in the solomon islands recently — and then killed it. In scientific terms, he \" collected \" it, but that means euthanasia, the washington post reports. Moustached kingfishers were first described in the 1920s, using a single female specimen; two more females were found by hunters and brought to collectors in the 1950s; the birds have only been \" glimpsed in the wild once, \" and \" scientists have never observed a male, \" filardi wrote for the museum after finding the male. \" given its history of eluding detection, realistic hopes of finding the bird were slim, \" he continued, and he himself had been searching for almost two decades. When news broke that he'd found a male only to kill it, \" outrage ensued, \" the post reports. \" filardi's weak justification attempts to explain why science trumps common sense, decency, or morality, \" tweeted one prominent bird watcher in a typical sentiment. In response to the backlash, filardi wrote a piece for audubon titled, \" why i collected a moustached kingfisher. \" he explains that the decision to preserve the bird as part of the scientific record \" was neither easy nor made in the spur of the moment, \" but that researchers estimated a population of more than 4,000, \" a robust number. \" yes, sightings of the bird and information about it are rare, but \" the bird itself is not, \" nor is it in danger of extinction. \" in this context, the decision to collect an individual specimen of the moustached kingfisher as part of our survey work reflects standard practice for field biologists, \" he writes. The post notes that pro-collection scientists argue such practices can ultimately help ensure the survival of the species as a whole since scientists can use the specimen for important studies. Opponents, however, argue that collectors can get overzealous and hurt rare wildlife populations. ( our seabirds might be in trouble. )",

Enter alicia buzbee and daughter kansas humphrey: they swept in from an adjoining neighborhood and rushed butch to the vet. The news wasn't good: butch had nearly zero lung capacity, a leaking trachea, and a swollen heart; doctors scheduled the sick pup for a \" humane euthanasia. \" but buzbee and humphrey didn't want him to go out like that, so they made his last few days the best he ever experienced: he scarfed down burgers and pumpkin pie; he romped with toys; he celebrated thanksgiving with buzbee's family; he even met santa and the local fire department, and had a going-away party in the park with presents and balloons, buzzfeed reports. Butch even seemed to be getting better from all the tlc, so his new family called off the euthanasia, but then he had a relapse on friday. \" before he goes, i want him to look into my eyes, and i want to look into his eyes, and i want to whisper, ' i love you, ' \" buzbee told al.com. \" i want him to hear those words and to see those faces of the people who love him. \" butch died on saturday.

The bad news? a retired real estate broker tells the oregonian that he sold cylvia hayes and an ex-boyfriend 60 acres in 1997, and that after it went into foreclosure he found marijuana \" cuttings all over the pool table \" and the apparent accoutrements of a marijuana grow operation, including fertilizer, containers, and irrigation equipment. Hayes responded to the allegation yesterday, saying that she was in an \" abusive relationship \" and that the property \" was intended to be the site of a marijuana grow operation that never materialized. I was never financially involved with it. I did not pay any part of the down payment or mortgage payments. \" malarkey, says the broker: \" he was not the leader. The leader was her. She did all the talking, all the negotiating. I remember her saying, ' oh, this is just the perfect place. ' \" it's not the only problem staring down hayes: she's also facing scrutiny over running her consulting business out of the governor's mansion, reports the willamette week, as well as questions over her use of her title at paid appearances. Hayes ' current beau, oregon gov. John kitzhaber — who's up for re-election on nov. 4 — yesterday asked the oregon government ethics commission to determine whether hayes should be considered a \" public official \" ( and therefore barred from profiting from her public position ), but he's been vocal in her defense. Citing her \" successful career long before she met me \" at a debate on friday, he called it \" ludicrous \" that hayes \" should be expected to give up her life's work because she is married — hopefully soon — to a governor. \"",

After much hemming and hawing and stern pronouncements, both sides reached a deal to avoid a showdown over filibuster rules, meaning harry reid won't use the so-called \" nuclear option \" to make them more difficult to call, reports politico.

The deal is basically this. - richard cordray, the long-filibustered, recess-appointed director of the consumer finance protection bureau, will get a vote at 11 a.m. He won't be filibustered. Advertisement - the president will be allowed votes on nominees to the national labor relations board — three democrats, two republicans. But he ' ll have to give up on richard griffin and sharon block, the democrats appointed during a 2012 recess, * and nominate two new people. \" we've been calling on the white house for six months to send two new, legal, nlrb nominees, \" said a republican aide, simultaneously talking down the scope of the deal and reiterating the party's objections.

At the moment, it appears that the deal involves agreeing to hold a confirmation vote for richard cordray as the head of the consumer financial protection bureau, which was created by dodd-frank in 2010 but has yet to have a confirmed executive. Barack obama gave cordray a recess appointment while the senate wasn't actually in recess, angering republicans who vowed to block cordray in the next session.

The deal is basically this. - richard cordray, the long-filibustered, recess-appointed director of the consumer finance protection bureau, will get a vote at 11 a.m. He won't be filibustered. Advertisement - the president will be allowed votes on nominees to the national labor relations board — three democrats, two republicans. But he ' ll have to give up on richard griffin and sharon block, the democrats appointed during a 2012 recess, * and nominate two new people. \" we've been calling on the white house for six months to send two new, legal, nlrb nominees, \" said a republican aide, simultaneously talking down the scope of the deal and reiterating the party's objections. The junking of griffin and block is the only real concession to republicans; the tacit assumption here is that obama's new warm bodies will get votes. By giving democrats nearly everything they asked for, republicans avoided a change to the filibuster.",
            "There aren't a lot of details on the deal cut by the senate to stop the nuclear option, but both sides are emerging from talks heralding the agreement: senators have reached a tentative deal on averting the constitutional showdown over confirming president obama's agency nominations. \"we may have a way forward on this, i feel fairly confident, \" majority leader harry reid ( d-nev. ) said tuesday morning. Sen. John mccain ( r-ariz. ) signaled enough republicans would support breaking a filibuster on the first test vote on the showdown, for obama's pick to lead the consumer protection financial bureau. \"i think everyone will be happy, \" reid said. The deal would not be finalized until later tuesday afternoon. At the moment, it appears that the deal involves agreeing to hold a confirmation vote for richard cordray as the head of the consumer financial protection bureau, which was created by dodd-frank in 2010 but has yet to have a confirmed executive. Barack obama gave cordray a recess appointment while the senate wasn't actually in recess, angering republicans who vowed to block cordray in the next session. In return, democrats will only get two confirmation votes for the nlrb, whose recess appointments have been overturned by the 11th circuit court of appeals. It appears that reid will ask the white house to choose new"

        "summary": "Two new studies have uncovered what the guardian is terming a \" missing link \" between sonar and whale strandings. Though the advent of military sonar in the 1950s coincided with a spike in strandings, one of the researchers involved explains that an unknown piece of the puzzle has been how — and even whether — whales respond to the noise. In one study off southern california, a simulated military sonar signal was sounded at levels well below the military's threshold, at distances between roughly 2 and 6 miles from two beaked whales that had been studded with suction cups; that particular species was chosen because it is most regularly the victim of mass strandings. The result: the whales first stopped feeding ( and didn't resume eating for as long as seven hours, which is unusual ) and swimming, then high-tailed it away from the noise and were observed to have taken longer dives. A second study in the same region suggested that blue whales ' feeding was similarly disrupted; a creature lost the equivalent of a day's meal, which a researcher says could \" have significant and previously undocumented impacts \" on the animals ' health. But he called the responses \" complex, \" with physorg noting that not all the whales reacted in the same way — and some didn't react at all. The us navy provided funding for the studies, which it points out only concern behavior, not any eventual harm. ( in other fascinating whale news, scientists have figured out how the creatures can hold their breath underwater. )",

But one name is starting to emerge that has a familiar ring to it: beau biden, son of the vp and delaware's attorney general.

There are some snags, though. Biden suffered a mild stroke in 2010, which calls his health into question, and he disappointed some democrats when he failed to run for senate that same year, when the left's control of the upper house was tenuous. He ' ll probably need \" a larger platform, \" too, \" in order to follow his father in climbing the ranks, \" writes mcpike.

        "summary": "A new study might be inching us closer to the possibility that the worst criminals can blame their behavior on bad genes. In the study of 900 convicts in finland, researchers found that those with mutated forms of two genes were 13 times more likely to have a history of violence, reports the bbc. The researchers said that up to 10 % of violent crime in finland can be attributed to people with this particular genetic profile. For the science-minded, the genes in question are monoamine oxidase a ( maoa ), which is linked to dopamine levels in the brain, and cadherin 13 ( cdh13 ), which is linked to impulse control, reports the telegraph. Scientists from sweden's karolinska institute emphasize that human behavior is unimaginably complex and that they are not suggesting screening for criminals. \"we've observed two genes that have a relatively big effect on violent behavior, but there are possibly tens or hundreds of other genes that have a smaller effect, \" says one. \" this is why a 'test for criminality ' is not possible from this study. \" a scientist not involved with the work echoes the sentiment, telling the independent that \" to call these ' genes for violence ' would... Be a massive exaggeration. \" but the study in molecular psychiatry points the way for future research, raising the possibility of identifying people at risk early and trying to steer them away from trouble. For instance, the bad behavior associated with the maoa gene may be more pronounced when booze or drugs is involved, reports io9.

        "summary": "A time capsule sealed with great fanfare in 1914 was finally cracked open yesterday — just over 40 years after the lower wall street business men's association had intended for it to be opened. The bronze box was forgotten amid the new-york historical society's archives for decades, but it was rediscovered in the ' 90s and for a time was thought to be the world's oldest unopened time capsule, reports the new york times. But the contents turned out to be pretty dull: the now-defunct business organization had filled it with things like financial reports and company yearbooks that they apparently believed would be of great interest to the new yorkers of 1974. While the 1914 capsule may have been a bit of a letdown, interns at the historical society have contributed items to a time capsule of their own, set to be opened in 2114, reports the daily beast. That capsule's contents will include an iphone, a kindle, a gay pride t-shirt, an obama campaign button, subway maintenance signs, a ticket from a lady gaga concert, and even websites preserved on a flash drive. In boston, meanwhile, a 113-year-old time capsule discovered in the head of a lion statue last month will be carefully removed today, the ap reports. A spokeswoman for the bostonian society says it may be opened today as well, although any documents inside will probably be too delicate to be removed immediately.

As a co-signer on his daughter's private student loans, mason was on the hook for her iou, which turned into $ 200,000 after interest and late fees piled up. While there's been some governmental progress at alleviating the heavy burden of student debt — which grew nationwide at an average clip of 6 % per year between 2008 and 2012, according to the project on student debt — families like the masons who have lost a child find themselves in a troublesome situation: unless they have a federally backed loan, explains cnn, the loan typically can't be discharged in a bankruptcy, and the lender isn't required by law to forgive the loan or lower interest or payment amounts ( though some lenders have done so as an act of goodwill ). \" people with other debt from splurging — they can discharge that, \" mason tells cnn. \" but somehow getting [ my daughter ] an education has encumbered me for the rest of my life. \"",

            "Image copyright spl image caption researchers from more than 30 countries investigated the genes linked to schizophrenia scientists have uncovered 80 previously unknown genes which may put people at risk of developing schizophrenia, research in nature suggests. The team says the world's largest genetic study of the disease shows it can have biological causes - putting it on a par with other medical conditions. Led by cardiff university, the international group believes this could be a launch pad for new therapies. Charities say that holistic approaches to the illness must continue. Scientists have debated the relative role genes play in schizophrenia - a condition which affects more than 24 million people worldwide - for many years. This study puts psychiatry into the same category as other parts of medicine prof david curtis, university college london now a global consortium across 35 countries has examined the genetic make-up of more than 37,000 people with the condition, comparing them with some 110,000 people without the disease.

The dome, built in the late 1970s on runit island in the pacific, holds more than 110,000 cubic yards of radioactive topsoil and debris left over from nuclear testing in the marshall islands, per a guardian report. Between 1946 and 1958, more than five dozen bombs were detonated on the enewetak and bikini atolls there — bombs whose \" explosive yield [ was ] equivalent to 1.6 hiroshima bombs detonated every day over the course of 12 years, \" per the guardian. Runit dome was supposed to be a temporary fix, but no long-term cleanup plan was devised by the mid-1980s, when the marshall islands became an independent country. The us insists that the dome is now the problem of the marshallese, but some fear it may become the world's problem. \" it's clear as day that the local government will neither have the expertise or funds to fix the problem if it needs a particular fix, \" a climate adviser to the marshallese president maintains. What kind of fix could be needed? a 2013 department of energy report found that radioactive waste has leaked into the soil around the structure. Meanwhile, global warming has caused the sea level to rise, further increasing contact between the nuclear-contaminated debris and the ocean. Climate change also increases the threat of a typhoon or other severe weather that could further damage the dome's concrete shell. As one climate expert puts it, \" runit dome represents a tragic confluence of nuclear testing and climate change. \" read the guardian's full piece.",

        "summary": "Humans have been running relatively advanced dairy operations for more than 7,000 years — the first cheese dates back to then — so it seems logical to assume that human bodies have been able to process milk for just as long. Turns out, that assumption is off by thousands of years, reports the washington post. A study of the genetic history of bones dug up in central europe shows that humans generally remained lactose intolerant until 3,000 years ago. Researchers suggest that ancient europeans weren't relying on dairy enough to develop the trait. \" these ancient europeans would have had domesticated animals like cows, goats, and sheep, but they would not yet have genetically developed a tolerance for drinking large quantities of milk from mammals, \" says researcher ron pinhasi in a press release. Instead, they might have been making cheese and yogurt, the processes of which break down lactose. The study focused on the remains of 13 individuals found in the great hungarian plain who lived between 5700 bc and 800 bc. Researchers unraveled their genetic secrets by examining the petrous bone, which happens to be the hardest bone in the body and is found inside the skull where it protects the inner ear, notes livescience. As pinhasi explains, \" the high-percentage dna yield from the petrous bones exceeded those from other bones by up to 183-fold. This gave us anywhere between 12 % and almost 90 % human dna in our samples. \" teeth, fingers, and rib bones yield no more than 20 %.

            "By analysing dna extracted from the petrous bones of skulls of ancient europeans, scientists have identified that these peoples remained intolerant to lactose ( natural sugar in the milk of mammals ) for 5,000 years after they adopted agricultural practices and 4,000 years after the onset of cheese-making among central european neolithic farmers. The findings published online in the scientific journal nature communications ( 21 oct ) also suggest that major technological transitions in central europe between the neolithic, bronze age and iron age were also associated with major changes in the genetics of these populations. For the study, the international team of scientists examined nuclear ancient dna extracted from thirteen individuals from burials from archaeological sites located in the great hungarian plain, an area known to have been at the crossroads of major cultural transformations that shaped european prehistory. The skeletons sampled date from 5,700 bc ( early neolithic ) to 800 bc ( iron age ).

        "summary": "It would likely have been a no-brainer: voters in alaska will decide in november whether a well-regarded judge will remain on anchorage superior court. But now a controversial case has thrown that into doubt, and a \" no retention for judge michael corey \" facebook page has more than 3,000 likes in its first days. As ktuu reports, the case involves 34-year-old justin schneider, who police said offered a 25-year-old woman a ride in his vehicle, choked her into unconsciousness, and masturbated on her. Corey accepted a plea deal in which schneider got no jail time — he admitted to assault charges, other charges of kidnapping and harassment were dropped, and he received credit for a year under house arrest. \" i was just absolutely appalled, \" says elizabeth williams, the woman who created the facebook page, per cbs news. Williams and other critics also fault assistant district attorney andrew grannik for agreeing to the plea, which he referred to in court as schneider's \" one pass. \" they also say the victim, a native woman who immediately notified police, was given scant consideration. As the outrage grows, the washington post notes that state officials say the judge and ada were hamstrung by current law. For example, the state doesn't include semen in its criteria for sexual assault, so only harassment charges were filed. And the serious kidnapping charge would have been tough to prove given that the woman entered his vehicle willingly. The judge wanted schneider to undergo sex-offender treatment, and the plea deal was the only way to ensure that, says a state deputy attorney general. Lawmakers now say they want to toughen state laws in the wake of the controversy.",

It was baluchi's second try crossing the ocean in his \" hydro pod, \" abc news reports. And it was his second time being pulled out of the water by the coast guard: he was rescued 70 miles off the coast of st. Augustine, fla., during an october 2014 attempt after his gps fell into the water. That rescue, per the sun sentinel, cost $ 140,000 and, the coast guard says, placed personnel at risk. Having ignored the order not to embark on this latest journey, baluchi faces up to seven years in prison, fines of up to $ 40,000, and the bill for his latest rescue. But a rep for baluchi, known for running 11,720 miles through the contiguous us, says he is undeterred: \" yes, he will definitely try again. \"",

        "summary": "At the debut of his variations on an original theme in 1899, english composer and cryptographer edward elgar hinted at a riddle of sorts hidden in the work. The idea is that the 14 variations in the piece are, in fact, variations of a particular piece of music. \" so what is that enigmatic theme that supposedly runs through the entire work but is never played? \" asks daniel estrin writes at the new republic. Well, that question about the so-called enigma variations has been the biggest mystery in classical music for more than a century, the story explains. \" it has been understood to be a well-known melody that would harmonize with the music if played along with it, \" but elgar never gave it up. And while countless musicians and sleuths have tried and failed to solve the puzzle, estrin recounts how a 47-year-old violin teacher from plano, texas, believes he's succeeded. Bob padgett says the secret melody is the 16th-century german hymn \" ein feste burg \" by protestant reformation leader martin luther.the complicated explanation of this theory is laid out on padgett's blog, along with various clues that he says support it. For example, padgett says elgar \" literally gave away the answer \" when he gave a book that quotes \" ein feste burg \" to the conductor who premiered the variations. But he goes much, much deeper than that, using code-breaking techniques to substitute letters for notes to reveal what he says are hidden messages in the work. Not all scholars aren't convinced — and some even think elgar was playing an elaborate practical joke. But padgett says they aren't willing to accept that an \" outsider \" could solve the enigma, especially one who claims he did it with god's help. Click for the full piece, which notes that an envelope to be opened in 2034 may provide the definitive answer.",

The 24-year-old, who was shot dead after allegedly killing four marines in chattanooga yesterday, was a \" swell \" and \" unbelievably nice \" guy, a friend who wrestled with him at the city's red bank high school tells the chattanooga times free press. \" he was honestly one of the funniest guys i've ever met, \" the friend says, adding that his family was very religious and the women all \" wore the little hoods. \" another former red bank student tells the times free press that abdulazeez ( whose name has been spelled various ways by different media ) was quiet but popular and his family \" were your average chattanooga family. \" more: federal officials say abdulazeez was a jordanian born in kuwait who became a naturalized us citizen, reports the new york times, which describes the subdivision where he grew up as \" a movie-set vision of american suburbia. \" adbulazeez \" was very humble. He always did what i asked him to do; he never gave me any problems, \" his high school wrestling coach tells the los angeles times. \" all the guys seemed to like him. He was not an outsider. \" after high school, abdulazeez took part in mixed-martial-arts events. In a red bank yearbook, the quote under abdulazeez's name is: \" my name causes national security alerts. What does yours do? \" according to an online résumé, abdulazeez became an intern at the tennessee valley authority after graduating from the university of tennessee at chattanooga with an engineering degree in 2012, the la times reports. No motive for the attack has been disclosed, and cnn reports that abdulazeez was not on any databases of suspected terrorists, but he appears to have been influenced by radical islam: a blog in his name has two posts on religious issues, both made on monday. One of them describes this world as a \" prison \" where life is \" short and bitter \" and \" designed to separate the inhabitants of paradise from the inhabitants of hellfire. \" at the islamic society of greater chattanooga mosque, a spokesman tells the new york times that abdulazeez's family worships there and he had become a regular visitor in the last few months. The spokesman says the mosque is in mourning for the fallen marines and today's eid celebration has been called off.",

One of 13 paintings jewish art collector and dealer alfred weinberger stored in a paris bank vault before fleeing the city, the impressionist work was seized in december 1941 before being offered at auctions in london, johannesburg, zurich, and new york over the ensuing decades, reports the new york times. For a time owned by a company operating art galleries on cruise ships, it was sold in 2012 for $ 390,000, then put on the auction block by christie's a year later. That's when 59-year-old sulitzer, weinberger's granddaughter and only heir, caught wind of it. Upon hearing from sulitzer's lawyer, christie's withdrew the painting and alerted the fbi. In a wednesday ceremony at new york city's museum of jewish heritage, the 12-by-15-inch canvas was officially returned to sulitzer. \" i think he would be very, very happy, \" she said of weinberger, who became a rural resistance fighter rather than accept an offer to serve as an art expert for the nazis; before his death in 1977, he would file claims for the painting with both french and german authorities. \" i ' m very thankful to be able to show my beloved family, wherever they are, that after all they've been through, there is justice, \" sulitzer added, per cnn.

To be clear, the researchers aren't saying that the grooming itself helps lead to the sti, reports live science. While it's possible that's the case — perhaps because shaving causes small tears that lead to vulnerability — it's also possible that people who groom down there are more sexually active to begin with and thus more likely to pick up an infection. In scientist-speak, this is all about correlation, not causation. Still, the study in sexually transmitted infections found that regular groomers were about four times more likely to report having had an sti. For the study, researchers surveyed 7,580 people ages 18 to 65 and learned that 84 % of women and 66 % of men had shaved or otherwise trimmed their nether regions. Of those, 17 % fell into the \" extreme \" category of removing all hair once a month and 22 % were in the \" high frequency \" category of trimming daily or weekly. The greater the frequency, the greater the link to stis. The upside for groomers: they had fewer reports of lice. For the record, electric razors were the most common method for women and manual razors for men, notes the bbc. Also of note: of the 7,580 adults, 110 said they were virgins. Given the lack of a definitive link, how might the findings be put to use? \" if a clinician were to see evidence of grooming upon physical examination, perhaps that physician should inquire about safer sex practices or a sexual history, \" says lead author charles osterberg of the university of texas dell medical school, per time.

The irishman arrived with a gopro camera in tow to capture the entire trip and be able to show his children and family back home what he had seen and done. But mr griffin somehow managed to get the gopro stuck on selfie mode and instead of filming the wonderful sights in nevada, captured more than four minutes of footage of his face. Add in his narration and you've got a hilarious home video. He more than likely never expected his faux pas to leave the confines of his home – but unlucky for mr griffin, his son evan decided to upload the entire thing to facebook. Watch the video here and see for yourself!",
            "An irishman enjoying a dream trip to las vegas has become a viral star after unwittingly recording his whole trip in selfie mode. Joseph griffin borrowed his son's gopro camera to capture the exciting trip on camera but clearly should have asked him how to use or at least brought the instructions along. More than 1.4 million people have watched the ' irishman in las vegas ' clip after his son evan uploaded the highlights of the trip to youtube. \" gave my dad my gopro while he was in las vegas, i did not, however, instruct him on how to use it, so my dad being my dad … didn't know which way to point the f ------ g thing, \" he wrote. Instead of capturing the famous las vegas strip, he mostly managed to capture close-ups of his own face while pointing the camera the wrong way. \" there's the trump tower, same colour as his hair, \" he jokes in the clip. The video has attracted hundreds of comments, with one saying: \" this is gold, such a dad thing to do. \" another added: \" this is way more golden than having videos of vegas. Wish you got his reaction to seeing all the footage he took. \" one viewer joked: \" see, he knew the whole time which way the camera was pointed. He knew we couldn't see it and that he had to describe it in the best way possible for us to get it. \" perhaps a future in vlogging could await"

In last week's hearing, us district judge michael seabright decided that a 2009 editorial in the kona coffee farmer's association newsletter in which sheppard expressed misgivings about roundup did not mean the 2-year statute of limitations for claims had passed — especially considering the who's designation of roundup as a probable carcinogen.

The long-running assumption has been that fleas living on rats spread the strain by biting a sick person then biting a healthy person. But the dna extracted from the 14th-century skeletons'teeth wasn't any more virulent than a strain that recently hit madagascar. That country saw 60 deaths, while 60 % of londoners are believed to have died centuries ago. The week zeroes in on the nagging question that followed the finding: why was the earlier strain so much deadlier? scientists with public health england posit that the plague must have been spread in an airborne manner, via coughs and sneezes, in order to travel so pervasively. If that's indeed true, then the black death wasn't a bubonic plague at all, but a pneumonic one. The rat flea \" explanation... Simply isn't good enough, \" explains public health england's tim brooks, whose theory will air in a uk documentary on sunday. \" it cannot spread fast enough from one household to the next to cause the huge number of cases that we saw. \" other black death secrets revealed: a second wave of victims lived during a \" period of lawlessness. \"",

They found that while the precise patterns tend to be regional and based on national holidays ( such as golden week in japan and thanksgiving in the us, reports live science ), the overall pattern is that people eat more and gain more during these holidays, with most of the weight gain happening around the end of the year for people in all three countries.

            "Missing in paradise it's been over five years since 18-year-old natalee holloway disappeared while on a high school graduation trip to aruba joran van der sloot has been sentenced to 28 years in prison after pleading guilty to the 2010 murder of a 21-year-old peruvian woman he had met at a casino in lima. Van der sloot was also ordered to pay $ 75,000 in reparations by a three-judge panel in lima for the \" cruel \" and \" ferocious \" murder that took place exactly five years to the day after the disappearance of american teen natalee holloway in aruba. He showed no emotion as the court clerk read the sentence, describing how he elbowed flores in the face then beat and strangled her with his bloodied shirt. Van der sloot told the court he reserves the right to appeal the conviction and sentence. Due to time already served, the judges said van der sloot's sentence would end in june 2038. But under peru's penal system, van der sloot could become eligible for parole after serving half of the sentence with good behavior, including work and study. Van der sloot could be freed sometime in his late 30s if paroled after serving half of his 28-year sentence.

        "summary": "The fbi has joined the investigation into monday's car-and-knife attack at ohio state university that left nine people injured and the assailant dead, reports nbc news. The suspect is abdul razak ali artan, an 18-year-old somali refugee who attended the school, reports the ap. He reportedly left somalia in 2007 with his family, moved to pakistan, and came to the us in 2014. Witnesses say that a car plowed into a group of students about 10am, and the assailant then got out with a butcher knife and began stabbing people. A campus police officer fatally shot him within a minute. The ap reports that federal law enforcement officials have been worried about precisely this kind of an attack because of a recent wave of extremist propaganda online encouraging the strategy. One of the victims was critically injured. \" i thought it was an accident initially until i saw the guy come out with a knife, \" says one student. The attack happened outside watts hall, and the columbus dispatch reports that students were congregating outside because of a reported gas leak in the building. It was unclear whether the report of the leak was related to the attack. Another witness tells cnn that the assailant had a \" crazy look in his eyes. \" he says the responding officer shot the assailant because the \" stabber clearly wasn't stopping. \" the president of the somali community association of ohio says reports of the assailant's somali background is disturbing. \" every somali person has been calling me, and everybody is crying, \" he says.",

Mossad agents crafted elaborate plots, including wiretapping, break-ins, and a honey trap, yediot aharonoth reports, via the jerusalem post and the times of israel. The previously top-secret \" meltzer file \" confirms an account that spies came close to capturing the twisted doctor responsible for carrying out horrific experiments on auschwitz prisoners. There has been much speculation as to why agents didn't grab a man matching mengele's description they tracked to brazil in 1962. But yosef chen, an ex-mossad agent who compiled the documents, told the post that it simply was \" not entirely clear if it was him. \" even as israel captured other notorious nazis like adolf eichmann, mengele, aided by his rich family back in germany, remained elusive. \" there is no path [ mossad ] didn't try, \" chen says. Plots to track mengele included tapping the phone of his only son, rolf, in germany, and reading his mail. Agents were hoping the two might talk on the birthday they shared in march 1983. ( it turns out mengele was already dead. ) they also planned to tell rolf — code named \" the lame one \" — that his father had fallen ill in hopes he would lead them to their target, per the times. A plan to plant an \" attractive, intelligent \" agent as rolf's private secretary also failed. Mengele drowned while swimming in 1979, and he was said to be buried under a false name. A doctor announced in march that his bones, discovered in a brazilian grave in 1985, would be donated to medical research, per the times. ( a holocaust survivor's search for his twin went viral. )",

She had one friend, daniel. \" she became one of the young site's most popular stars, \" cresci writes. But she was a fake.

Bree was played by jessica lee rose. Yousef abu-taleb played daniel. Their episodes, shot on a webcam in flinders ' bedroom, were scripted. Beckett worked tirelessly behind the scenes to figure out how to get lonelygirl15 into the most viewed section. He discovered how youtube's algorithm chooses a video preview image. \"if it was a good freeze frame, you would get like 100,000 more views, \" flinders says. \" but as her popularity grew, \" cresci writes, \" so too did the suspicions. \" web sleuths went to work trying to uncover evidence that bree was not who she said she was. That finally happened in september 2006. The people behind the lonelygirl15 fessed up. Still, the series, the first on youtube to make money off of product placement, continued for two years.

Though the city went completely bonkers when the canucks lost the stanley cup, the two were captured in a photo locked in \" the kiss \" that has captivated the public. Bizarrely, the pair's juicy embrace, lying in a stretch of street among baton-wielding riot cops, appears more like a scene in an edgy vogue shot than journalism. Many viewers speculate the shot was staged. A new photo has emerged to show men standing around the isolated couple, adding fuel to the theory. But the photographer who snapped the scene insists it's for real — though he believes the woman may have been hurt, not hugging. Canada-based photographer richard lam spotted the couple after fleeing riot cops, then stopping and looked back. \" i noticed in the space behind the line of police that two people were lying in the street with the riot police and a raging fire just beyond, \" he recalls. \" i knew i had captured a ' moment ' when i snapped them against the backdrop of such chaos, but it wasn't until later when i returned my photos that my editor pointed out that the two people were not hurt, but kissing \" — though he's not completely convinced.

        "summary": "Well, that was quick: the mooch is out. President trump on monday decided to remove anthony scaramucci from his brand-new post as white house communications director. Coverage of the surprise move makes one thing clear: the decision came at the request of new chief of staff john kelly, who is in his first day on the job. Scaramucci didn't even last two weeks in the job, though he made an impression with, among other things, a profanity-laced rant against rivals such as former chief of staff reince priebus. Related coverage: one big takeaway: the bold move by kelly shows that he is \" moving quickly to assert control over the west wing, \" per the washington post. It appears to be working: he \" is already changing the culture around here, \" one white house aide tells politico. The firer: scaramucci was \" too loose a cannon \" for kelly's taste, writes david graham at the atlantic, who is not surprised that the impetus to can him came from the chief of staff. For all his reputation of being the guy to yell \" you're fired, \" president trump is actually reluctant to do that in the real world, he notes. Fatigue factor: trump was initially pleased with scaramucci's tough-talking persona, but kelly and trump family members began to turn the president against scaramucci over the weekend, portraying him as a political embarrassment, according to the new york times, which was first to report the firing. Bannon factor: axios reports that steve bannon, a target of scaramucci's infamous tirade, had been pushing hard to get him fired. Bannon reportedly has a good relationship with kelly, though it's unclear whether they spoke about scaramucci. White house: \" mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give chief of staff john kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team, \" says the official statement. \" we wish him all the best. \" mocked online: the short tenure is leading to a lot of jokes along the lines of \" how to lose a guy in 10 days, \" and people rounds them up. One notes that the short stay \" made kim kardashian's marriage to kris humphries seem long. \" next for mooch: it's not clear whether he will leave the white house entirely or shift into a different position. Bigger challenge? \" in ousting scaramucci, kelly is only solving a problem that has existed for a mere 10 days, \" writes andrew prokop at vox. The looming question is whether he can get trump himself to rein in behavior often",

Over the next six months, the island nestled between two others of the tonga nation experienced heavy erosion, but \" then it leveled off, \" nasa scientist dan slayback explains in a video. Three years later, hunga tonga-hunga ha ' apai remains — reaching 400 feet above the ocean and covering almost 500 acres — and is predicted to last anywhere from six to 30 years, according to a new nasa study. It's an exciting development for a couple of reasons: first, scientists say the mass presents the first opportunity in the satellite era to carefully study how such islands form, per the guardian. Second, the island could help scientists learn more about similar eruptions far away on mars. \" everything we learn about what we see on mars is based on the experience of interpreting earth phenomena, \" says nasa's jim garvin. \" we think there were eruptions on mars at a time when there were areas of persistent surface water, \" he adds, noting the new island could indicate whether mars'thousands of volcanoes erupted beneath lakes or oceans, per the new york times. Nasa scientists, who've been monitoring the island monthly since its birth using radar and optical sensors, also hope to discover why it hasn't disappeared as predicted. A specific chemical reaction is suspected: in the case of the volcanic island surtsey, formed near iceland in 1963, warm seawater mixing with ash created a tougher rock than normal.

As for yamato being fine, the ap reports that while he went without food for the length of his time in the woods ( tap water was available in the military training ground hut where he sought shelter ), he suffered only mild dehydration and had some insignificant bruises on an arm and his legs. He told those gathered outside the hospital that he is eager to go back to school and take part in a school sports day.

That's the narrative north korea is now pushing, with state media claiming 4.7 million of its people have volunteered or re-enlisted, usa today reports. That's roughly 20 % of its population, and of those said to have signed up, more than 1.2 million are women, per the rodong sinmun newspaper. This after president trump promised to \" totally destroy \" north korea and other verbal sparring with kim jong un and foreign minister ri yong ho. The yonhap news agency notes that whenever tensions are ratcheted up between the two countries, north korea tends to try to spur solidarity with propaganda claims on a boost in military volunteering. It reportedly did the same when the un security council approved new sanctions on pyongyang in august. In fact, these claims of nationalists rushing to serve their country have been circulating since at least august, reuters reported then. The express notes kim jong un's \" propaganda machine is in full force, \" claiming north koreans are \" furious \" at the us. A state-controlled website says citizens are even calling for trump's \" beheading \" and that his rhetoric against the north is \" unprecedented rude nonsense. \" the daily star reports that the general federation of trade unions of korea, which represents about 1 million of the north's citizens, is also holding tight with kim, noting workers are eager to supply \" more strategic weapons \" and \" turn out in the do-or-die battle with the us. \" meanwhile, if war were to break out, a retired air force brigadier general says the pentagon estimates 20,000 would die daily in south korea, per the los angeles times.",

        "summary": "At yesterday's berlin marathon, kenya's wilson kipsang broke a world record — but he didn't break the tape. That honor went to a guy who jumped in from the crowd in running gear; he was wearing a number as well as a t-shirt advertising an escort service, the local reports. Race officials pursued him in the finish area, which was blocked off for the first time amid concerns following the boston marathon. The unnamed man was passed to police, who charged him with trespassing. He's also barred from any future events planned by the same organization. Kipsang, meanwhile, managed to run the race in 2 hours, 3 minutes, and 23 seconds, the new world record. The previous record was held by kenyan patrick makau; it took him 15 seconds longer to pound out 26.2 miles, which he also did in berlin, in 2011, reports the new york times. Kipsang walked away with $ 54,000 for his troubles, plus a $ 68,000 bonus for setting the record. Kenya's florence kiplagat won the women's race in 2: 21: 13.",

The state was down to its last dose of the execution drug last month, but it has managed to obtain several more shots from a compounding pharmacy and will be able to carry out three more scheduled executions this month, san angelo live reports. There are at least three more executions scheduled in the state for may and june, reports the ap, and corrections officials say they're looking at other options, including using other drugs or finding fresh sources of pentobarbital. Before he was executed, sprouse apologized to the victims ' families and to his own family \" for all the trouble i have caused them, \" wfaa reports. After the execution, the widow of slain officer marty steinfeldt issued a statement saying it was the \" emotional end of a long, excruciating journey. \" she was pregnant when the 28-year-old officer was killed and gave birth to their daughter several months afterward, reports wfaa.

        "summary": "The godzilla franchise enters its seventh decade and there's plenty of building-smashing to go around. But does the beast also have a sensitive side? director gareth edwards shows there's more to the monster in this latest godzilla flick, starring bryan cranston and elizabeth olsen. How does he do? critics are mostly pleased; the film currently has a 74 % fresh rating on rotten tomatoes. Andrew o ' hehir has high praise for it. \" it's a bracing tonic for the bored palate of the mainstream moviegoer, and one of the most intriguing big-budget breakthrough films since steven spielberg made jaws, \" he writes for salon, adding that it has \" tremendous visual daring, magnificent special-effects work, and surprising moral gravity. \" betsy sharkey at the los angeles times isn't quite as big a fan. While she admires a \" 21st century godzilla, eco-conscious with 3d side effects that are monstrous in all the right ways, \" edwards lets \" too many people problems and... Other monsters \" get in the way of the star of the show — the big beast people came to see. \" ironically this big, lumbering movie could have used more, not less. \" edwards ' goal in resurrecting the godzilla franchise appears to be a \" return to the creature's sober, serious roots, \" ian buckwalter writes for npr. He succeeds in balancing \" character and meaningful story \" with spectacle, and keeps godzilla in the shadows until necessary. \" this is exactly what big summer movies ought to aspire to: never short on dazzle, but unafraid to let us catch our breath once it's been taken away. \" as for colin covert at the minneapolis star-tribune, he argues \" the new godzilla is the best godzilla since the first godzilla, \" though admittedly, that's \" a large degree of faint praise. \" he adds that \" the film is technically remarkable \" but \" too often mumbles and repeats itself. Its attention to the human details is wobbly at best... This godzilla leaves a shallow footprint. \"",

            "The new \"godzilla \" is the best godzilla since the first \"godzilla. \" there's a large degree of faint praise in that assessment. The film is technically remarkable, and takes its title character seriously. He's come a long way from those 1960s toho studios cheapies starring a guy in a rubber beanbag suit doing pro wrestling elbow drops on dragon-monsters. The best movies in the 60-year-old series made the monster an archetype for each age. In ishiro honda's melancholy 1954 film, godzilla was a radiation-breathing symbol for post-hiroshima atomic angst. Director gareth edwards ' epic reboot is a climate-change disaster allegory, with the spiky city-stomper a stand-in for ecocatastrophes unleashed by heedless humanity. While the film doesn't achieve the level of christopher nolan gravitas and spielbergian spectacle it aspires to, its ambition, scope and scale are commendable. The opening credits are smart, sharp and telegraphic",
            "It's the big lizard, stupid. I say that because someone's clearly lost sight of the obvious when the no-name monsters get more screen time in \" godzilla \" than the main attraction.
