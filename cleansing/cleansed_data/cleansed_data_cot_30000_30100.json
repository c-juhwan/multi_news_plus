In a $ 2.8 billion deal supported by a $ 650 million equity injection from the billionaire brothers, the bbc reports. The company, subject of two previous meredith acquisition attempts, publishes titles including people, sports illustrated, and entertainment weekly, as well as time. Meredith publishes titles including better homes &amp; gardens and also owns numerous local tv stations, meaning it hasn't been hit as hard as time by the steep decline in print advertising revenues in recent years. The two companies say the deal, unanimously approved by both boards of directors, will close early next year, the ap reports. Meredith ceo stephen lacy calls the joining of the two magazine giants \" a transformative and financially compelling growth opportunity. \" time ceo rich battista is expected to depart after the deal closes. Meredith says the investment vehicle owned by charles and david koch, prominent supporters of conservative causes, will not have a seat on the board and they will not influence editorial decisions. Mary bottari of the center for media and democracy, however, tells the guardian that she believes the brothers want to create their own \" media megaphone \" to convince the public that they don't need to worry about climate change and they should \" forget about regulating the fossil fuel industry. \" ( time and president trump are in a dispute over his person of the year claims. )",

        "summary": "Hate airport security lineups? the transportation security administration is offering to eliminate screenings entirely at small and medium-sized airports in a new cost-saving effort, cnn reports. An internal tsa document outlines the proposed $ 300 million budget slash, including fewer federal air marshals ( $ 39 million ), cuts at tsa headquarters ( $ 26 million ), fewer k-9 reimbursements to law enforcement ( over $ 20 million ), and less spent on part-time benefits ( $ 18.5 million ). But the removal of screenings at more than 150 airports with flights carrying 60 passengers or less — with savings of $ 115 million — is getting the most attention. As cnn reported earlier, the proposal would have luggage and passengers on those flights screened after they land at larger airports for connecting flights. It's \" stunning that this is even seriously being considered, \" says cnn terrorism analyst paul cruickshank. \" al qaeda and isis still regard aviation as a priority target — that includes aircraft where you have fewer than 60 people on board. \" tsa officials say it's an old idea that returns from time to time, but with the tsa establishing a working group to analyze potential risk and cost, it's getting more attention this year. As a tsa spokesman tells the hill, proposed cuts are \" pre-decisional \" and wouldn't happen \" without a risk assessment to ensure the security of the aviation system. \"",

But the guardian presents the case of alireza, a 37-year-old drug smuggler sentenced to death for having been found in possession of a kilo of meth. Earlier this month, iranian officials strung him up, hanged him for 12 minutes, cut him down, pronounced him dead, and sent the body off to be buried. Except morgue workers the next day noticed steam in the plastic in which he was wrapped... And the state found itself resuscitating and hospitalizing the guy it had failed to properly kill. \" we couldn't believe he was still alive when we went to collect his body, \" a relative says, adding that \" his two daughters are very happy. \" only now iranian judges want to hang him again — as soon as he's fully recovered — saying that they in fact sentenced him to death, not hanging, so his sentence hasn't been carried out. Amnesty international is predictably appalled, saying that \" carrying it out twice \" is \" simply ghastly \" and \" betrays a basic lack of humanity, \" and, anyway, \" the death penalty is not working in the fight against drug trafficking. \" iran is thought to have executed ( successfully ) 508 people so far this year, adds the telegraph; that's a number that hasn't exactly slowed since hasan rouhani's election, with 125 of those coming since he took office in august. Most executions are for drug-related offenses.",

South africa requires such an evaluation, masipa said, when mental health issues are raised in a case. A forensic psychiatrist, testifying for the defense, previously said pistorius suffered from generalized anxiety disorder. The prosecution, calling for tests, said the disorder could have affected his actions in the death of reeva steenkamp. Prosecutor gerrie nel says he doesn't believe that was the case; still, the psychiatrist's testimony required him to seek the 30-day evaluation, which could in turn delay the trial by two months. It's possible the prosecution is looking to bar the defense from claiming a disorder in the event of a conviction, the ap notes. The defense opposed the tests, the bbc reports. Pistorius ' uncle, however, welcomed the judge's decision: \" as a family, we are comforted by the thoroughness and detail of this judgment and judge masipa's commitment, using every avenue, to ensure a fair trial. \"",

Mouse brain cells, the scientists found, contracted during sleep, and fluid was able to move between them more easily. Upon a mouse's waking, the cells expanded. Not only could the phenomenon explain why extensive sleep deprivation can kill — it may also teach us about an observed link between sleep disorders and alzheimer's disease, among other brain diseases.

It's those actors — led by chadwick boseman as leader of the african kingdom of wakanda — who ensure the film only exceeds expectations, according to critics, who give it a 98 % rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: \" believe the hype: black panther transcends its comic-book origins, achieving a mythic grandeur that's nothing short of exhilarating, \" writes calvin wilson at the st. Louis post-dispatch. Not only is the film \" a huge step forward for black cinema, \" but it's \" a terrific time at the movies … at once narratively engaging and visually stunning, \" says wilson, praising both boseman as t ' challa and michael b. Jordan as his rival. \" when the villain still manages to make your eyes tear up … you know you're in the presence of great acting and storytelling, \" odie henderson writes at rogerebert.com, demanding a place for jordan in \" the anti-hero hall of fame. \" but the film also presents \" numerous memorable, fierce and intelligent women, \" in addition to \" stunning cinematography \" and costumes that \" pop so vividly that they become almost tactile, \" henderson points out. It combines for \" an epic of operatic proportions \" and \" one of the year's best films. \" that's downplaying it a bit, according to richard roeper. Black panther is \" one of the best superhero movies of the century \" and watching it was \" one of the best times i've had at the movies this decade, \" he writes at the chicago sun-times. It has \" provocative premises touching on isolationism, revolution and cultures of oppression, \" and \" winning performances from an enormously talented ensemble. \" in particular, letitia wright, in the role of t ' challa's little sister, \" steals every scene she's in. \" above all, it's the actors who \" elevate black panther to stirring heights, \" writes ann hornaday at the washington post. \" as they dominate the screen in a movie rooted firmly in their own history and narratives, they provide an exhilarating, regal rebuke to the chronic absence and denigration of black bodies in american cinema. \" the result is a film that \" pulses with color, vibrancy and layered textural beauty \" and \" is great fun to watch. \"",

A routine national weather service test on tuesday resulted in a false push notification to mobile phones about a tsunami warning, giving a jolt to many residents on the east coast around 8: 30am, reports gizmodo. A glitch meant some people with the accuweather app installed received what looked like an actual warning, nws meteorologist hendricus lulofs said. The verge cites the nws ' miami branch in reporting these tests happen once a month, and the nws is investigating what went awry in this case. Accuweather didn't immediately return a call seeking comment, reports the ap, and it didn't elaborate on twitter beyond clarifying the nws alert was a test. The herald-tribune has the copy of the message, which begins ominously but clearly contains test-related language: \" tsunami warning tsunami warning in effect until 9: 28 am est. Source: u.s. National weather service... This_message_is_for_test_purposes_only... This is a test to determine transmission times involved in the dissemination of tsunami information... \" the verge notes the alert went to locations spanning from portland, maine, to houston.",

As the bbc reports, it's not unusual to see couples getting intimate in havana's public areas, like parks and beaches, because they don't have the privacy to do so at home. The nation's housing crunch means that multiple families often have to share the same apartment and divorced couples sometimes must continue living together, reports reuters. While private facilities do offer rooms for rent by the hour, at a fee of $ 5 for three hours, that's not in the budget for many in a nation with an average monthly salary that's less than $ 30. To help, cuba says it will bring back state-run \" posadas \" or \" love motels, \" which were common some three decades ago. The state will start by opening a 16-room motel in havana, named hotel vento, before converting another hotel, a rep for the provincial housing company of havana tells trade union weekly trabajadores. \" to think about how to diversify options for love is not farfetched, \" per trabajadores. \" it is a reality that concerns everyone, and cannot become a luxury. \" some of the dozens of posadas in use in the city until the 1990s, when hurricanes necessitated that they be converted into housing for the homeless, will also be restored. Havana's la monumental will reportedly be among them. \" we want to revive this service that is in high demand, has a big social impact and without a doubt is very profitable, \" the housing rep says.

        "summary": "The federal reserve has hiked the short-term interest rate a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 1.75 % to 2 %, and suggested that two more increases are likely to occur this year, for a total of four in 2018, reports cnbc. The rate is closely tied to adjustable-rate loans, such as home-equity lines of credit and credit cards. In a statement released at the end of a two-day meeting, the fed suggested that the us economy is strong and not in need of a boost, according to the new york times. Moreover, the bigger threat at this stage is inflation. The fed anticipates that inflation will be 2.1 % in 2019 and 2020, which is a little over its target rate of 2 % through 2020, but is viewed as manageable. This marks the seventh time the fed has hiked rates since 2015, per reuters, and is part of a slow process to return rates to normal levels. Ten years ago, the fed cut interest rates to near zero in an effort to boost the economy and stem the deepening financial crisis and recession. Fed chairman jerome powell said at a news conference that the us economy has strengthened considerably since the 2007-08 recession and is in \"great shape. \" the fed expects unemployment to fall to 3.6 % this year, and, said powell, \"most people who want to find jobs are finding them. \" us stocks dropped slightly on the news, notes marketwatch, and bond yields nudged higher.",

            "That is odd for an economy with a tight labor market, with unemployment running at a 3.8 percent. And some analysts say it is a reason for officials to slow their pace of rate increases, since the benefits of a hot economy have not yet translated into a significant wage increase for workers. At a comparable time of low unemployment, in 2000, \"wages were growing at near 4 percent year over year and the fed's preferred measure of inflation was 2.5 percent, \" both above today's levels, tara sinclair, a senior fellow at the indeed hiring lab, said in a research note. \"too many increases too quickly could choke the economy before we really see how good it could get. \" mr. Powell played down concerns about slow wage growth, acknowledging it is \"a bit of a puzzle \" but suggesting that it would normalize as the economy continued to strengthen. The fed chairman said growth was being lifted, at least in the short term, by tax cuts and government spending increases signed into law by president trump last year. And he dismissed, for now, concerns that mr. Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, were hurting growth, saying the fed had yet to see any data indicating an impact. \"so right now, we don't see"

In neighboring baden-württemberg, five people were injured overnight when a suspicious fire broke out at a home for refugees, reports cnn.

Eu countries including france and the uk have agreed to accept thousands more people, but hungarian prime minister viktor orban says he is opposed to any \" quota \" system for refugees. He says the thousands of people moving north through his country are looking for a \" german life \" instead of safety and says the influx could damage the \" christian welfare states \" of northern europe, the bbc reports.

But that's where things go awry, as smugglers hire locals to get the meat back to china via vietnam. \" to save costs, smugglers often hire ordinary vehicles instead of refrigerated ones, \" a director of the country's anti-smuggling bureau tells the paper. \" so the meat has often thawed out several times before reaching customers. \" this poses a major public-health threat, given that some of the meat has been refrozen after it's spoiled.

Three children were with her at the time, edwards ' friend and fellow missionary bobbie solley tells the sun. \" two of the boys got away from the gunmen and ran for help, \" she says. \" a 4-year-old boy was taken. We haven't heard a word about him yet. \" edwards took care of not only the 20 orphaned or abandoned kids in her charge at the home: she also ran a local nutrition center that provided meals to 160 children five days a week, the sun notes. The president of a nashville religious group that worked with edwards tells cbs news that edwards \" knew it was a dangerous place and she took precautions, \" including carrying a handgun, but \" it just didn't work out for her this time. \" in a statement on its website, the estes church say it plans on \" continuing the battle against satan in haiti. \" meanwhile, an estes minister says he thinks this was an isolated event and that church members aren't being specifically targeted, but he adds \" we're being cautious. \" a team of missionaries from the church that had arrived friday to help edwards out was sent back home; a smaller group will go back to counsel the kids in the home, wbbj reports. Solley, who had never felt threatened before, adds her job there is done and that \" i wouldn't go back. \" in the meantime, she mourns: \" she was a fabulous woman. … her only concern was the children of haiti and the children she was caring for. \" ( haiti went after a missionary a few years back for trying to take children out of the country. )",

A house in the area has just been sold for $ 8.7 million — and it's already famous, regardless of the buyer. It was the home of tom selleck's character in magnum, pi, pacific business news reports. \" people on the beach here think ( the future owner is ) obama, and some people like me are thrilled at the prospect, \" one neighbor tells khon. \" my dog there can't wait to play with bo. \" but if he's hoping for a full-time presidential neighbor, that pup may be disappointed. All that seems clear is that one of obama's good friends bought the place. The trail of documents in the confidential deal leads back to marty nesbitt, and he tells khon that he is \" the sole purchaser and did not have any partners or co-investors in the transaction. \" along with being an obama golf partner, nesbitt is the head of the barack obama foundation, pacific business news notes; that's the group in charge of work on obama's presidential library. Wherever the obamas end up is reportedly up to sasha, the chicago sun-times reports: while malia will be in college by the time the president gets out of office, sasha will still be in high school and gets to make the location decision, the president has noted. ( the obamas were on vacation in hawaii earlier this year and spent their last day with the lead singer of pearl jam. )",

        "summary": "Labs are among the most popular dogs in the country, and they're also prone to packing on too many pounds. A new study suggests a scientific reason that helps explain both: a genetic mutation. Researchers at cambridge found that about 25 % of labs have a gene variant that makes them constantly crave food, reports the guardian. The upside for the breed is that it makes the dogs food-focused and thus easy to train, boosting their popularity. The downside is that it makes them more likely than other breeds to put on too much weight, with all the health problems that entails, reports the bbc. \"there is some hard-wired biology behind that persistent food-seeking behavior, \" says eleanor raffan, a co-author of the study published in cell metabolism. The telltale glitch occurs in a gene known as pomc that helps control hunger, explains science. The dogs are missing a stretch of it, keeping their appetites in overdrive, a mutation found in no other breed save for the related flat-coated retriever. So what is a lab owner to do? be aware of the tendency, the better to resist those \" big brown eyes \" when food is around, advises raffan, per gizmodo.

But with the stroke of midnight on friday, their lives may have become a lot easier. As part of an agreement reached in 2011 and ratified in june, 162 pockets of land belonging to one country but surrounded by another — 111 indian plots in bangladesh and 51 bangladeshi parcels in india — hoisted new national flags on july 31, reports the wall street journal. The enclaves joined the country that surrounds them, while 37,000 indians and 14,000 bangladeshis now have a choice: stay and accept their new nationality, or move, reports the ap. While neither option is necessarily convenient, the washington post gave a hypothetical that shows just how inconvenient the previous situation could be. Someone living in an enclave might technically need a visa to enter the country that surrounds their land, but getting that visa would require passing through the other country so they could get the visa from a major city in their homeland. And then there was the third-order indian enclave of dahala khagrabari — the only one of its kind in the world — which was enclosed within a bangladeshi enclave, which was framed by an indian enclave, which was surrounded by bangladesh. Most enclaves also had little administration or infrastructure; one man describes sneaking past border guards to get to school. A bangladeshi official tells the ap no one from bangladeshi enclaves within india has requested to be moved to bangladesh; 979 people from indian enclaves have asked for such a relocation to india.

But gazprom didn't explain the move in terms of geopolitics; the company said it was ending a previous \" discount, \" granted in december, because ukraine owes it $ 1.7 billion for unpaid gas bills. The price \" is absolutely expected and clearly in accordance with the contract, \" the head of ukraine's state-run energy company said. To wit, reuters notes that the new price is $ 385.50 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas; ukraine was paying about $ 400 before the discount hit in december. The blow will also be softened by a new imf loan package. Meanwhile, russia continues to militarily threaten ukraine as well.

            "Brussels, belgium ( cnn ) -- nato will suspend \" all practical civilian and military cooperation \" with russia because of its annexation of crimea, saying it has seen no sign that moscow was withdrawing troops from the ukrainian border. Foreign ministers from the 28 members of the western military alliance met in brussels on tuesday for the first time since russia grabbed the black sea peninsula from ukraine last month, triggering the worst east-west crisis since the cold war. They were discussing ways to boost nato's military presence in formerly communist central and eastern europe to reassure allies worried by russia's moves. After the session, u.s. Secretary of state john kerry said russia has challenged truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident: that european borders in the 21st century would not be redrawn by force. \" it is important for everybody in the world to understand that the nato alliance takes seriously this attempt to change borders by use of force, \" he said. \" so that is the wake-up call. \" russia's aggression \" is the gravest threat to european security in a generation and it challenges our vision of a europe whole, free and at peace, \" nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen told reporters.

Martin zibeau and his friends heard about the idea of alternative currencies from a french tourist, and the group decided to try putting the idea into motion in gaspesie. A half-bill is called a \" demi, \" and a demi is worth just what you'd think — $ 5 if it's half of a $ 10 bill, $ 10 if it's half of a $ 20 bill, etc. Demis can only be used locally, and the idea is to keep money circulating in the community. Of course, for that to work, local businesses have to agree to accept it; currently, there are a few businesses that do so in gaspesie. The demi is different from other forms of local alternative currency in that it uses existing canadian currency as its base. Economic experts have warned that anti-counterfeiting measures need to be taken into account when creating a local currency, but the demi gets around security concerns — the canadian government has already taken anti-counterfeiting measures, and so the demi comes built-in with those features. Other alternative currencies include the sonantes in nantes, france ( which is all-digital ) and the ithaca hour in ithaca, new york. \" we printed our own money because we watched federal dollars come to town, shake a few hands, then leave to buy rainforest lumber and fight wars, \" says the hour website, noting that more than $ 110,000 of the paper money has been issued since 1991 and thousands of purchases have been made with it.",

While dollars make us increasingly dependent on transnational corporations and bankers, hours reinforce community trading and expand commerce which is more accountable to our concerns for ecology and social justice.

In a letter on its website, the company says it would never \" do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any apple product, \" but it decided to slow down the older phones in an update around a year ago to prevent unexpected shutdowns caused by aged lithium-ion batteries being unable to deliver heavy energy loads, techcrunch reports. Apple says the cost of out-of-warranty batteries for anyone with an iphone 6 or later will be reduced from $ 79 to $ 29 from the end of january until the end of 2018. The slowdown was not discovered until this month, when geekbench charted the performance of older iphones running different versions of ios. Apple, which apologized to customers feeling \" let down, \" also says that early in 2018, it \" will issue an ios software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iphone's battery, so they can see for themselves if its condition is affecting performance. \" apple says that a fresh battery will enable the older models to run at normal speed, business insider reports.

        "summary": "Black barbershops are known for lively conversation on sports, politics, you name it — so of course there's a fascinating history behind them. In an interview with collectors weekly, vassar college history professor quincy mills goes over barbershops ' key role in black politics and identity, from the pre-civil war years through jim crow to modern times: \" before the civil war, most black barbers explicitly groomed wealthy white men, \" says mills — even in the north. So where did blacks get haircuts? \" on somebody's front porch, or in the yard, \" or maybe in \" barbershops after hours, off the record. \" post-civil war, black communities targeted black barbers for refusing to serve black men. Yet many of those barbers \" were still deeply engaged in black communities, \" influencing politics or starting businesses for black customers ( like insurance companies ). Things got tricky in the 1890s when white barbers, mostly german, honed in on black barbers ' \" wealthy white clientele \" by starting a barbers ' union and pushing for licensing laws. \" as you might have guessed, blacks were not admitted to these barber colleges. \" around that time, blacks born after the civil war opened barbershops in black communities. There, \" african americans could safely gather, talk, and organize. \" civil rights activist stokely carmichael \" was first exposed to activism \" at a barbershop. \" when his family moved to the bronx, the local barbers were irish and couldn't cut his hair, so carmichael wound up going to harlem every week to get his hair cut. \" now mills is worried that blacks ( like everyone else ) are too \" tethered to our phones \" to engage in barbershop conversation. \" the generation of men in their 50s, 60s, and older, still goes to barbershops to hang out and talk. \" see a ledger-enquirer piece on black barbershops in columbus, georgia, or for another twist, see what the us senate paid for its barbershop.",

        "summary": "The first case of a woman sexually transmitting the zika virus to a man is now in the books. Before the new york city case occurred, officials believed only males could transmit the virus sexually ( either to women or to other men ). But then, the cdc reports, a man developed zika symptoms even though he hadn't traveled outside the united states any time during the prior year. His female partner, however, had just returned from an area where zika is present, and had developed the illness herself the week prior. Before realizing she had the virus, she'd had unprotected sex with the man. He saw the same doctor as her, who suspected she'd passed the illness to him sexually; the city's health department confirmed that suspicion. Cnn calls the development \" startling. \" the cdc is now changing its guidance for pregnant women, since this means woman-to-woman transmission may also be possible: all pregnant women, whether their sexual partners are male or female, should use barrier methods when having sex if they live in or their partner has recently traveled to an area where zika is present. The virus can cause birth defects, may cause developmental problems post-birth, and may also be linked to pregnancy loss, the new york times reports. There have now been 1,305 travel-related cases of zika reported in the us, and 14 known cases of sexually transmitted zika in the us, per cnn.",

The air force launched the missile over the pacific sometime between 10 a.m. And 11 a.m. Tuesday from a b-52 stratofortress based at edwards air force base in california. Traveling at 50,000 feet, the b-52 was to launch the missile, which would then scream across the pacific at hypersonic speeds. The missile got away from the b-52, but then flopped uncontrollably into the ocean. The stakes were high. So far the tests have cost the pentagon some $ 300 million. True, the millions in research and testing have helped advance the field of hypersonics, but the shortage of tangible results have also helped spoil the confidence the air force once had in producing",
            "The u.s. Air force says an unmanned experimental aircraft suffered a control failure during an attempt to fly at six times the speed of sound. In this july 17, 2009 photo provided by the u.s. Air force, an x-51a waverider hypersonic flight test vehicle is uploaded to an air force flight test center b-52 for fit testing at edwards air force base.... ( associated press ) the x-51a waverider was designed to reach mach 6, or 3,600 mph ( 5,800 kph ) after being dropped by a b-52 bomber off the california coast on tuesday. But the air force said wednesday that a faulty control fin prevented it from starting its exotic scramjet engine, and it was lost. The pentagon has been testing hypersonic technologies in hopes of being able to deliver strikes around the globe within minutes. The first boeing-designed aircraft achieved mach 5 for about 140 seconds in 2010. A second flight last year ended prematurely, with the craft trying to restart its engine until it plunged into the pacific."

Aldous said pham hopes the suit will \" help make sure that hospitals and big corporations properly train their nurses and healthcare providers. \" \" this is not something that nina chose, \" aldous said, but \" she's hoping that through this lawsuit she can make it a change for the better for all nurses. \" pham is still coping with ebola's after-effects, including nightmares and body aches, her lawyer said. \" she has not gone back to",

Pham said she called the hospital and the dallas county health department, and was told to monitor her temperature. But unless her temperature reached 100.4, they told her, she should not be concerned. The day after duncan died, pham said she met with someone from the cdc and the hospital's employee health manager to walk through her care of duncan and how she protected herself. She woke up early oct. 10 with a temperature of 100.6. Pham said she called the presbyterian emergency room and told them who she was and that she was coming to the hospital. She drove to the hospital, where she was put in isolation. Her boyfriend at the time was quarantined but remained ebola-free. They stopped seeing each other soon after, and pham is currently not dating anyone. When she was admitted to presbyterian, pham said, she made it clear that she did not want any information released about her medical condition. \"i wanted to protect my privacy, and i asked several times... To put be as 'no info ' or at least change my name to jane doe, \" pham said. \"i don't think that ever happened. \" when a test confirmed that she did have ebola, \"i"

In autopsies on the brains of 774 men after their deaths, scientists found that those who took beta blockers to help control hypertension had fewer of the brain lesions and less of the brain shrinkage seen in alzheimer's than men who took other types of blood pressure medications and those who left the condition untreated. Their brains also showed significantly less evidence of multiple tiny strokes, called microinfarcts. A parallel study showed that an expanded group of men who took beta blockers also experienced less cognitive decline as they aged compared with those in the control groups. The research, to be presented at the american academy of neurology's annual meeting in march but released to the media on monday, is preliminary; of the 774 japanese american men who agreed to have their brains examined after death, 610 had suffered from high blood pressure and only 40 had taken beta blockers. That is far too small a number to support a sweeping conclusion that beta blockers have benefits beyond controlling high blood pressure, experts warned. \" there's a hint there, \" said dr."

The study of 125 women expands upon what the bbc reports are some fairly broad stats: only 4 % of women actually deliver when predicted, and 30 % do not give birth within 10 days of their due dates. As livescience explains, that variation was previously attributed to inaccurate calculations of the baby's age. But the us national institute of environmental health sciences study used urine samples to determine precise ovulation and implantation dates, and, after excluding premature births, found the natural gestation period varied by up to 37 days. ( the average ovulation-to-birth time was 268 days. ) the study also found there was a link between gestation length and the age of a mother, the weight she was at birth, and the time it took for embryos to implant. \" the emphasis on a single due date may make the length of pregnancy seem more predictable than it really is, \" says a study researcher. The upshot? perhaps a \" delivered by \" date would be better than a \" due date, \" suggests a spokesperson for the uk's royal college of obstetricians and gynecologists.",

The company operating france's most-visited monument says see-through panels are being set up at the north and south ends of the site. Each panel, made from over 2.36-inch thick armored glass, measures nearly 10 feet high and weighs 1.5 tons. In all, 450 glass panels will compose the two walls north and south of the monument. Two graphic grids have been erected on the two other sides of the site and bollards against vehicle ramming attacks will be set up all around. The president of the société d ' exploitation de la tour eiffel, which runs the monument, described the new walls as \" rock-solid for absolute security, \" per the bbc. French soldiers and police will keep patrolling outside and inside the area, as they have done since the deadly november 2015 attacks in the french capital. The glass walls being installed allow visitors to admire the views from the nearby champ-de-mars gardens to the other side of the seine river that cuts through paris. The renovation is part of a $ 350 million project announced last year to modernize the 129-year-old tower. The security renovation should be completed by september. \" when you are on site, you see that the 3-meter high walls, compared to the scale of the monument, are absolutely not visible, \" said jose luis fuentes, one of the architects in charge of the project. \" it will really look as if the square ( under the eiffel tower ) was open. \" between 6 and 7 million people visit the eiffel tower every year. The eiffel tower hasn't always been so popular, according to npr. Early critics called it a \" truly tragic street lamp, \" a \" carcass waiting to be fleshed out with freestone or brick, \" and \" a half-built factory pipe. \"",

And the provincial government, declaring the parents unfit and claiming the need to protect the girls from exploitation, took them away from their family and, in an act of what link calls \" great hypocrisy, \" raised them on a compound referred to as quintland, a sort of human zoo where people could observe the dionne girls playing through one-way windows.

Now, the two surviving quintuplets are \" reluctantly \" back in the public eye, per the new york times. Annette and cécile dionne are fighting another government decision — this time from the mayor of north bay. He wants to move their childhood home, a now-defunct museum, 45 minutes away to the only interested buyer, claiming the house would cost the city an estimated $ 110,000 a year to maintain. The would-be buyer has no ties to the women: it's an agricultural society that puts on a fall fair in a small ontario town each year. Annette and cécile argue the house should stay as a reminder of the \" foolish choices \" governments can make. In a letter sent to the city council in february, the women call theirs \" a canadian story worth remembering. Our birth and survival in this small house, without heat and electricity, was a huge story during the great depression....

Still poor despite donations and now with 10 children, the family was approached by exhibitors of the chicago century of progress fair to put the girls on display as medical marvels.

        "summary": "Last month, brazil's congress voted to start impeachment proceedings against its beleaguered president, dilma rousseff. It's now come down to the country's senate, which will decide wednesday if she ' ll be suspended and put on trial in what the new york times calls a \" watershed \" vote in a nation beset by a terrible economy and rampant corruption ( she says it would be a \" coup, \" as she hasn't been charged yet with a crime ). A simple majority of the 81 senators is all that's needed to suspend her, per the ap, leading the way for vp michel temer to take over for now. The senate would then have 180 days to hold a trial and cast a decision on whether to make her temporary ouster permanent, in which case temer would stay in office until her term comes to a close at the end of 2018. And cnn notes it doesn't look good for rousseff: per a survey published in a brazilian newspaper, of those 81 senators, 50 have said they'd be in favor of impeachment. \" plainly said, this is the worst crisis in our history, with its combination of economic calamity, discredited politics and the violation of the lowest ethical standards, \" a brazilian historian told journalists earlier in may, per the times. The country is also struggling with the zika virus and preparation for this summer's oiympic games in rio. Rousseff herself is accused of covering up budget deficits by playing a sort of shell game with money from public banks. But despite the dire straits, not everyone's celebrating her possible removal, with some fearing impeachment would be \" undemocratic. \" temer's ratings are also in the toilet, with just 2 % of citizens in a recent poll saying they'd pick him as president. Not that rousseff seems ready to give up. \" i am going to fight with all my strength, using all the means at my disposal, \" she said tuesday, per cnn. If she is indeed ousted, she'd be the second of brazil's presidents to suffer that fate since the country broke away in 1985 from its 20-year military dictatorship, the bbc notes.",

But lately the market has been less convinced the fed can lift rates again before the end of the year, with analysts citing a variety of factors, from soft inflation numbers to the economic impact of huricane harvey.

        "summary": "There's a literal cloud hanging over the rapidly melting greenland ice sheet. That's because a new study published tuesday in nature communications reveals exactly how clouds are exacerbating the problem. Cloud cover over the ice sheet causes 56 billion tons of meltwater runoff every year, up to a third more than clear skies, science daily reports. But researchers were surprised to discover exactly how clouds are affecting the ice sheet, according to the study. Rather than trapping heat and causing ice to melt themselves, clouds do more damage by keeping temperatures warm at night and preventing the ice that melted during the day from refreezing, phys.org reports. According to the washington post, 58 % of meltwater refreezes under clear skies. That drops to 45 % when it's cloudy. All this is important because the greenland ice sheet is the second largest in the world and is causing nearly one-third of rising sea levels globally, phys.org reports. \" over the next 80 years, we could be dealing with another foot of sea level rise around the world, \" study co-author tristan l ' ecuyer says. \" parts of miami and new york city are less than two feet above sea level; another foot of sea level rise and suddenly you have water in the city. \" even worse, climate change may be increasing cloud cover over greenland, leading to more melting, according to the post. But this new study is a good step toward understanding how bad things could get. \" this is something we have to get right if we want to predict the future, \" phys.org quotes l ' ecuyer.

It's possible with what the uk's royal society of chemistry calls \" a new paradigm for dental treatments. \" scientists at nottingham and harvard universities say they've developed dental fillings that stimulate stem cells to regrow and heal damaged teeth. Researcher adam celiz explains that existing dental fillings — typically made of calcium hydroxide or mineral trioxide aggregate, per science alert — are meant to protect pulp tissue in the middle of a tooth containing blood vessels and nerves, but \" are toxic to cells, \" per newsweek. About 10 % to 15 % of these fillings fail, resulting in root canals which weaken teeth further. The latest fillings made from synthetic biomaterial, however, \" can be placed in direct contact with pulp tissue to stimulate the native stem cell population. \" scientists say the stem cells encourage the growth of pulp tissue and dentin — the hard material that forms the majority of a tooth. \" in in vitro testing, the fillings stimulated the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells into dentin, \" reports popular science. \" the researchers believe that if used in a damaged tooth, those stem cells can repair the kind of damage that often comes from the installation of a filling. In essence, the biomaterial filling would allow the tooth to heal itself. \" patients won't need to endure any more suffering than usual, either. The biomaterial is injected into a tooth and hardened with uv light just like a normal filling.

It can be tough to diagnose babies with cocaine-linked health issues that may not appear until they're older, medical daily reports. But a baby who seems healthy may reveal through her cry that her nervous system has been affected by the drug, researchers at the university of north carolina say via eureka alert. In their study, researchers found that the cries of both human infants and rat pups contain similar characteristics associated with a mother's prenatal cocaine use. The study focused on a high-pitched sound called hyperphonation, which is comparable in babies and rat pups exposed to the drug. The findings are helpful, says the study's lead author, because it can be difficult to tell whether nervous system damage is related specifically to cocaine or to other factors. The link to rat pup vocalizations will allow assessments \" that can be used to detect the isolated effects of cocaine or similar drugs on brain limbic mechanisms common to humans, rodents, and other mammals, \" the lead researcher says. Maternal cocaine use can lead to problems with babies ' brains, genitals, and kidneys, and they can experience withdrawal symptoms from the drug — though a recent study suggested exposure to crack may not be as dangerous as was thought.",

On july 20, sotheby's will auction a bag containing traces of moon dust, which a chicago-area woman picked up for $ 995 and which is expected to sell for as much as $ 4 million. It's an extreme price befitting the extreme story behind the bag, which neil armstrong used to store lunar rocks collected from the moon after the apollo 11 landing. The bag's convoluted history includes the 2003 fbi raid on the home of max ary, the former director of a kansas space museum. The wall street journal reports the director was convicted of theft tied to his auctioning of some nasa artifacts, and his possessions were seized, with some auctioned for restitution — which is when the goof happened. How ary ended up with the bag is still a bit murky, but what is clear is that the government auctioned it as \" one flown zippered lunar sample return bag with lunar dust ( ' lunar bag ' ), 11.5 inches; tear at center. Flown mission unknown, \" and nancy lee carlson scooped it up. The sotheby's listing explains carlson wanted to learn more about her bag's history, so she sent it to nasa; officials there realized what had happened and refused to return it, until a court forced them to earlier this year. \" this is a once-in-a-lifetime event, \" sotheby's cassandra hatton tells the chicago tribune, which explains why: this may be \" the only privately held object of its kind in the world, \" at least as far as legally sold lunar objects go. Carlson plans to donate some proceeds to charity and set up a scholarship at her alma mater, northern michigan university. ( this widow can sue over nasa's brutal sting operation of her. )",

Per a county coroner, history professor ethan schmidt was shot dead in the head today at delta state university in cleveland, miss., the clarion-ledger reports. Authorities say their suspect is fellow delta state instructor shannon lamb, reports the sun herald; he's also suspected in another shooting about 300 miles away. The two men were said to be romantically involved. As for the school, it remains on lockdown with all classes canceled while city police work with campus police, sheriff's deputies, atf agents, and the mississippi highway patrol to hunt down their suspect, cnn reports. Lamb, who joined delta state's staff six years ago, is a geographer and social sciences expert who just finished his doctorate at the school. The 45-year-old also lived with a woman in the town of gautier, where police responded to the shooting death of a woman this morning; she hasn't yet been identified. Lamb apparently left home in a green suv that matches one authorities have found on campus. Messages on lamb's facebook page are urging him to give himself up to authorities: \" man, just turn yourself in bro!! \" reads one. \" don't do anything to yourself or anyone else... \" schmidt was an assistant professor in us history, wlbt reports, and specialized in native american history.

And last month, he allegedly tried and failed to overthrow gambia president yahya jammeh, the daily beast reports. Yesterday, faal, 46, faced neutrality act violation charges in a minnesota courtroom, while gambian-american businessman cherno njie — faal's alleged co-conspirator and the man who was planning to rule gambia in jammeh's place — faced his own charges in maryland. Faal, njie, and about a dozen others wanted to \" restore democracy to the gambia and improve the lives of its people, \" faal ( who still has family there ) told the fbi. Njie allegedly handled the money and organized his plotters — including vets of both the us and gambian armies, adds minnesota public radio — who bought armor, ammo, and night-vision equipment. Faal allegedly bought and shipped rifles to gambia, concealed in barrels. The conspirators thought gambia's military would join the coup and abandon jammeh. They'd then take over with no harm to gambians, and njie would come out from hiding and take his place, the wall street journal reports. It didn't work out that way. At the state house in gambia, the plotters split into \" alpha \" and \" bravo \" teams. Alpha fired a shot to scare the guards — extra ones were on duty — but the team was instead rewarded with heavy fire that killed the team, faal says. Bravo members who weren't shot fled, including faal, who went to senegal and turned himself into the us embassy. For his part, jammeh claims the coup was the work of german, american, and british dissidents, usa today reports. \" i live for the gambia, \" he says. \" i die for the gambia. \"",

She and her daughter turned their backs on the creature from roughly 6 yards away to get a photo with the bison in the background, the bozeman daily chronicle reports.
