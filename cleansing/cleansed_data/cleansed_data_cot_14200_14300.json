By all accounts, drugeon had a very normal childhood. His father was a bus driver and his mother a secretary and committed catholic.

But like a significant number of others who later took the path to radicalization, his parents'divorce when he was 13 was traumatic. Drugeon began acting out, and his grades at school nosedived. He began hanging out with a group of young muslims in the neighborhood who espoused a fundamentalist interpretation of islam. Before he turned 14 he converted, changing his name to daoud. By 2010, drugeon was on the radar screen of french security services and had made several trips to egypt to learn arabic and more about islam. He funded the trips by taking driving jobs.

        "summary": "An unhappy ending to the story of a 97-year-old woman who was fighting eviction in california's bay area: marie hatch has died, the law firm representing her pro bono announced late thursday. \" there is no doubt that the callous eviction of marie hatch has caused her death, \" cotchett, pitre &amp; mccarthy said in a statement, per the san jose mercury news. Hatch had battled cancer in recent years, but the san francisco chronicle says she was hospitalized due to a severe cold. She died after returning home thursday. Hatch had been served with an eviction notice feb. 11 giving her 60 days to move out of the cottage she had been living in for 66 years. She said a recently widowed friend who owned the home asked her to move in all those years ago, and promised she could live there the rest of her life, a promise that was kept by the friend's daughter and granddaughter but reneged by the granddaughter's estranged husband after his wife was murdered. The husband, the current landlord of the house, claimed he felt awful about having to evict her, but said the agreement was not put into writing. He said his wife's trust was expiring this year and he needed to sell the house in order to make sure his sons were provided for. Hatch's story went viral, prompting many offers of help, and the law firm representing her filed a suit against the landlord last week alleging breach of contract, elder abuse, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Others offered alternate housing arrangements, but hatch was agoraphobic and did not want to move. She was paying about $ 960 a month in rent, $ 1,600 below the average rent in the county, and the mercury news says her story illustrates how difficult it is for seniors on fixed incomes to afford bay area housing. The law firm will continue the suit on behalf of 85-year-old georgia rothrock, who lived in the house with hatch for 36 years.",

Hookworms, for instance, cause anemia, diarrhea, and pain, while the human whipworm causes severe iron deficiency and slowed growth in kids, reports live science. But pig whipworm eggs sold by thai company tanawisa are now being touted as a health remedy for anything from autoimmune diseases like crohn's to mental health issues, per new scientist. Germany is even considering approving them as a food ingredient, a potential first in europe. The idea is that not all parasitic worms are necessarily bad, and they may even secrete substances that calm our immune systems. But research has failed to show positive effects, and experts like dr. Peter hotez at the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college dismiss the idea as the same kind of \" pseudoscience cult therapies as chelation therapy for autism. \" others counter that the eggs are probably \" no worse than many other dietary supplements that many people use regularly. \" the product is being considered in germany as a food ingredient, not medicine, and thus must only be shown to be safe rather than also shown to be effective. It would be sold in vials with up to 2,500 eggs, to be added to foods and drinks; reassuringly, pig whipworms cannot survive long or reproduce in humans.

        "summary": "India's missiles are already capable of hitting pakistan — today the country will learn if it has the ability to strike deep into another rival. India will this afternoon launch an intercontinental ballistic missile called the agni v. If successful, the nuclear-capable missile's 3,100-mile range would put beijing and shanghai within reach, reports the wall street journal, and would, according to a security expert, narrow \" the missile gap between india and china \" and \" potentially free up other short- and intermediate-range missiles for use against pakistan. \" the ap notes that china is shoulders ahead of india in the missile race, with the ability to reach anywhere inside india. India's most powerful missile, the agni iii, can travel only 2,100 miles, a distance that falls short of many major chinese cities. \" while china doesn't really consider india any kind of a threat or any kind of a rival, india definitely doesn't think in the same way, \" explains an indian defense analyst. The 57-foot tall agni v is designed to carry a 1.5-ton nuclear warhead and reportedly cost $ 486 million to build. If today's launch is successful, the country will need to carry out four or five more tests, meaning the earliest it would join india's arsenal would be 2014.",

Agni v, an intercontinental ballistic missile, is set to be launched from wheeler island, off the coast of the eastern state of orissa, in the late afternoon, according to a defense ministry official. The expected launch of agni v is part of india's broader missile development program, a key aspect of the country's nuclear strategy.

Trump claimed curiel could not impartially hear the case because of his background and trump's hardline immigration policies. The case was eventually settled. Now, curiel is assigned to hear the case of juan manuel montes bojorquez, 23, who his lawyers allege was deported from california to mexico earlier this year despite having active protection under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, also known as daca. And trump's comments toward curiel last year -- he called the indiana-born judge a \" hater \" and a \" mexican \" -- drew some of the loudest accusations of racism that the then-candidate faced during his campaign and several repudiations from prominent republicans. The lawsuit, which is brought under the freedom of information act, has already become a flashpoint in the trump administration's immigration policy and the president's murky position on daca. Curiel's involvement is sure to increase the publicity surrounding the case, which is"

        "summary": "Cuba is officially in mourning, miami is unofficially in party mode, and much of the rest of latin america and the world is split over the death of fidel castro. The cuban government has announced that after nine days of national mourning, the 90-year-old leader will be interred at a cemetery in santiago, close to where he grew up, reports abc. In the days before the dec. 4 ceremony, there will be mass gatherings in havana and castro's ashes will make a cross-country tour. A round-up of coverage: cnn reports that president obama released a statement saturday morning offering his condolences to the castro family and promising that the us will be a friend to the cuban people. \" history will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him, \" he said. Donald trump's remarks were shorter: \" fidel castro is dead! \" he tweeted. The new york times looks at what might lie ahead for cuba, with trump headed for the white house and raul castro now freer to plot his own course. Some analysts predict that raul will accelerate his reforms. The guardian looks at some of the many failed plots that the cia and cuban exiles devised to kill castro. By his security team's count, there were no fewer than 634 attempts to assassinate the leader. One of the more ridiculous plots involved exploding molluscs. The miami herald reports on the reaction to the death across latin america. Venezuelan president nicolas maduro said the \" invincible giant has gone on to meet with che guevara, \" though some critics suggested the meeting would be happening somewhere very hot. The los angeles times looks at the life and legacy of the cuban leader, who clung to the very end to his \" belief that his revolution had succeeded in lifting a nation above self-interest and material obsessions. \" the ap rounds up reactions from world leaders including china's xi jinping, who said castro \" made immortal historical contributions to the development of socialism around the world. \" ed royce, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, was less flattering: \" no one should rule anywhere near as long as fidel castro did, \" he said, slamming castro's legacy as \" one of repression at home, and support for terrorism abroad. \" npr reports that cuban-americans from both parties in congress issued statements denouncing castro, including sen. Marco rubio, who called him an \" evil, murderous dictator. \" the new york times finds that in havana, the death has laid bare a generation gap. \" my grandparents ' generation, which benefited a lot from him",

        "summary": "We're one step closer to finding chuck hagel's replacement: president obama announced today he's nominating pentagon ace ashton carter to take over as secretary of defense, the ap reports. Although some fear that carter's insider status may hamper his ability to come up with creative solutions to challenging issues, others say his extensive expertise on a variety of subjects — including nuclear weaponry and the navigation of global hot spots — will make the transition seamless, the wall street journal notes. \" on day one, he ' ll be ready to hit the ground running, \" obama said in his announcement this morning. For a scientist who's never served with the armed forces, carter has had a storied defense career: he started out as bill clinton's assistant defense secretary in 1993, became undersecretary of defense in 2009, and served as deputy defense secretary from 2011 to 2013. Carter's experience will prove key, as he'd be entering a role faced with growing world threats — for example, islamic militants in the middle east and confrontations with russia — all of which he'd have to face with a declining defense budget, the journal notes. He's stood out in helping to create state-of-the-art war equipment, such as mine-resistant vehicles used in iraq and afghanistan, the new york times notes. \" it's no exaggeration to say there are countless americans who are alive today, in part because of ash's efforts, \" obama said during his announcement. From his autobiography, carter appears capable of withstanding the often-brutal political environment. \" public service at senior levels in washington is a little bit like being a christian in the coliseum, \" he wrote in 2007, as per the journal. \" you never know when they are going to release the lions and have you torn apart for the amusement of onlookers. \"",

They reveal the moon's craters and even the pores of astronauts'skin in incredible detail, per the verge.

House ways and means republicans on friday evening released an irs video depicting agency employees line dancing to singer cupid's \"down, down, do your dance. \" the irs shot the video for entertainment at a 2010 agency conference in anaheim, calif. Text size - + reset the release of the video comes just days before the treasury inspector general for tax administration — the same watchdog that uncovered irs employees were targeting conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status — is set to release a report that's likely to bring a new wave of troubles for the irs. ( photos: 8 key players in irs scandal story ) the report is titled \"collected and wasted: the irs spending culture and conference abuses, \" and part of it looks at the anaheim conference. The probe shows the agency spent about $ 49 million on at least 220 conferences for employees over the past three years, according to a washington post report. House republicans on the oversight and government reform committee, which is slated to hold a hearing on irs conference spending thursday, will surely use the new video to blast the agency for wasting money. The video doesn't lack for theatrics. Employees in the film are whipped into shape by a colleague yelling, \"get in line now. … chop, chop! \" \"after countless hours of hard work and one broken leg, \" the moderator says, the employees end up picking up on the shuffle and have fun. \"they finally got it, \" the woman who plays the trainer jokes. \"they're ready for anaheim! \" but republicans don't find it funny. \"whether it is the tens of thousands of hard-earned taxpayer dollars spent to produce frivolous entertainment for agency bureaucrats, or the irs's own admission that it targeted the american people based on their personal beliefs, the outrage toward the irs is only growing stronger, \" said ways and means oversight subcommittee chairman charles boustany in a statement. The louisiana republican said the video proves the irs is a place \"where abuse and waste is the norm and not the exception. \""

        "summary": "It was first dredged up in 1870s off papua new guinea, and now scientists say they've hauled one up from the deep once again: a so-called faceless fish. The afp reports on the scientific bounty collected two weeks into a month-long expedition off the eastern side of australia, where researchers are exploring the commonwealth marine reserves from northern tasmania to central queensland. It's an abyss: waters up to 2.5 miles deep that have never been surveyed. Lead scientist tim o ' hara calls it \" the most unexplored environment on earth, \" and what it has returned so far is everything from \" tripod fish \" to dinner plate-sized sea spiders — and that 16-inch faceless fish, typhlonus nasus, which researchers are calling a faceless cusk. \" it's got eyes way under the surface but really you can't see any eyes, \" di bray tells australia's abc news. ( see a photo of it here. ) \" it looks like two rear-ends on a fish, really, \" adds o ' hara, who explains the creature lives in an unforgiving environment of \" crushing pressures, \" no light, and temps around 34 degrees fahrenheit. The guardian reports the expedition's finds have been collected through the use of a \" metal sled-style device \" which is connected to the surface via 5 miles of wire and is dragged along the bottom. The sled has also collected plenty of trash, some dating back two centuries. And while most media reports suggest this is the first time the fish has been collected since the crew of the hms challenger did so in 1874, an expedition blog post makes clear that isn't so: \" although rare, it's quite widely distributed... In 1951, one trawl in deep water off east kalimantan, borneo, collected five specimens. \" the voyage will end june 16. ( this uninhabited island is home to trash, too. )",

        "summary": "If richard black's purple heart and bronze star weren't example enough of his bravery, stepson chad hayashi says his last act summed it up. According to hayashi, the 73-year-old vietnam veteran fatally shot a naked intruder found choking his 11-year-old grandson, also nude, in the bathtub of their home in aurora, colo., around 1: 30am monday, only to be killed seconds later by police. While police will give their version of events at a thursday press conference, \" they shot the first thing they saw moving, \" hayashi tells abc news. Describing a strange woman awaking him, claiming her son was on drugs and had his boy, hayashi says black \" shot the guy twice in the torso \" with a legally owned weapon after a struggle that sprayed water across the bathroom. Black, who'd had a vase smashed over his head, then \" went around the corner \" and was shot. It was only after a pause that police officers identified themselves, hayashi adds. He says he saw his stepfather face down on the floor in handcuffs as hayashi was led from the house and was later told black had ignored requests to drop his weapon. But \" there was no warning at all \" and \" all the officer's spent cartridges were outside the house. So, they shot through the open door, \" hayashi says, calling for the release of bodycam videos. Per the denver channel, the man black killed has been identified as 26-year-old dajon harper, who twice had charges of first-degree murder dropped or reduced. More information is expected at the press conference, but aurora police chief nick metz has hinted that the police narrative won't be in line with hayashi's account. Much of the information shared already \" has been inaccurate, \" he said this week.",

        "summary": "A texas water park has been closed for testing after a past visitor succumbed to the so-called \" brain-eating amoeba. \" per wfaa, the bsr surf resort in waco chose to close down its wave pool while the cdc tests the water for the microbe, whose scientific name is naegleria fowleri. The move came after the death of new jersey surfer fabrizio \" fab \" stabile, who had reportedly been in the wave pool prior to his death from the disease earlier this month at the age of 29. \"our hearts and prayers are with his family, friends, and the new jersey surf community during this difficult time, \" park owner stuart e. Parsons jr. Said in a statement, per the ap. Parsons added that his park follows all cdc \"guidelines and recommendations concerning naegleria fowleri. \" naegleria fowleri is as rare as it is deadly. Typically found in warm, fresh waters in the american south, the microbe is largely harmless unless it makes its way up the nose. Recreational swimmers can become victims if the amoeba winds up in the brain. Once there, it can cause a lethal infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis. While just 143 cases were reported between 1962 and 2016, only four of those people survived, per cnn. ( in a 2016 case, it was suspected an ohio teen died from the illness after being exposed to naegleria fowleri while visiting a manmade whitewater rafting channel in north carolina. )",

That same night, she found herself back in a police car — but this time she was the one arrested under the state's domestic violence law, reports the connecticut post. The unusual situation involves bridgeport police sgt. Stacey lyons. While being filmed for the new a&e reality series, she arrested a man accused of choking his girlfriend. \"domestics are the most dangerous calls a police officer can go on, \" lyons told the camera. As the man proclaimed his innocence, she told him, \" this is a domestic situation and i don't have a choice. \" hours after filming the episode, the 33-year-old was charged with disorderly conduct after she allegedly entered an ex-boyfriend's house by punching in his security code and confronted him about another woman. The ex-boyfriend said the pair got into a shoving match, and he called police. The reality show featuring lyons ' arrest aired friday night. As deadline explains, the two-hour live show shows officers in six different departments answering calls in real time as host dan abrams and two police detectives provide commentary. Think \"unmediated, live cops with third-party journalistic context, \" as an a&e exec puts it. The idea is to show a typical friday night for cops on patrol, per realscreen.

For one, the wall street journal thinks it has found the paper trail through which trump attorney michael cohen paid stephanie clifford, aka stormy daniels, $ 130,000 to keep quiet. Cohen established a company in delaware in october 2016 called essential consultants llc and used it to send a check to a lawyer representing clifford, called \" peggy peterson \" in the matter. Cohen apparently chose delaware because the state has relatively strong laws guarding the privacy of such companies, though the journal found a document listing him as its \" authorized person. \" at the time, just ahead of the election, clifford was reportedly in talks to appear on good morning america to discuss the relationship she had with trump a decade earlier. The second set of details is more salacious. Mother jones unearthed emails from a political consultant who was advising clifford as she flirted with a run for the senate in louisiana back in 2009. In one of those emails, the consultant mentioned to another political consultant that clifford had some potential big backers, including trump. When the second consultant expressed surprise that clifford was friendly with trump, the first one wrote back: \" yep. She says one time he made her sit with him for three hours watching 'shark week. ' another time he had her spank him with a forbes magazine. \" both consultants confirmed they exchanged the emails to mother jones, which notes that an issue of forbes from the fall of 2006 featured trump on the cover.

Researchers studying public restrooms found that just an hour after bathrooms were sterilized with bleach solution, they were once again packed with various microbes, npr reports. In a study over the course of a few months, researchers found 77,000 different kinds of bacteria and viruses. And the most common ones, amounting to 45 % of the microbes, were bacteria from feces. They popped up on toilet seats and around soap dispensers. Other unpleasant finds included traces of hpv and herpes viruses, as well as some genes from mrsa bacteria, which can cause serious illness. Meanwhile, in a separate study, researchers in britain found that, perhaps surprisingly, air hand-dryers actually had more germs around them than paper towel dispensers did. The worst offenders were the high-powered driers, whose local bacteria count was 27 times that of paper towel dispensers, cbs news reports. Still, an expert tells npr we shouldn't panic; in fact, we should perhaps celebrate. \" all human environments contain pathogens — your bedroom, the phone you're talking on, even the bugs inside of you could turn pathogenic at any time, \" he notes. \" but we desperately need them in our lives. \" indeed, they can actually help fend off disease, experts say.",

            "The fewest workers in three years filed claims for u.s. Jobless benefits last week, indicating the world's largest economy is strengthening heading into 2012. The number of applications for unemployment payments dropped by 19,000 to 366,000 in the week ended dec. 10, less than the lowest forecast of economists surveyed by bloomberg news and the least since may 2008, according to labor department figures issued today in washington. Other reports showed manufacturing accelerated this month after pausing in november. \"the u.s. Economy, unlike the rest of the world, is gathering momentum as we head toward year-end, \" said eric green, chief market economist at td securities inc. In new york. \"the labor market is improving sharply, \" he said, and \"we look for gains in industrial production. \" a reduction in firings may pave the way for an increase in employment that will help spur consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. Lean inventories and growing demand may probably spark gains in production that will keep factories at the forefront of the expansion. The standard &amp; poor's 500 index rose, snapping a three-day drop, on the improving economic outlook. The gauge climbed 0.6 percent to 1,218.71 at 1: 03 p.m. In new york. Manufacturing may contract this month from china to the euro region as global demand slows and europe's leaders struggle to contain the worsening debt crisis, reports today showed. Global manufacturing chinese factory output may decline for a second month in december as europe's fiscal woes weigh on exports and home sales slide, preliminary results from a markit economics survey indicate. In the euro area, manufacturers may face a fifth straight month of contraction as the region endures its worst quarter for 2 1/2 years, a separate report showed.

The latter was intentionally placed there as a decoy by police who feared there might be a \" thrill \" killer afoot, and it's led to the arrest of one man on a weapons charge, reports the review-jounal. The body of daniel aldape, 46, was found on jan. 4 at an intersection some distance from the strip; he had been struck in the head at least four times. A month later, david dunn, 60, was found dead of head trauma at the same intersection. And so police decided to try to lure the killer back by setting up a blanket-covered mannequin \" to resemble a human male sleeping in a natural position. \" and then they watched on surveillance video as shane schindler approached. Police say that at 3am on feb. 23, the 30-year-old surveyed the scene for traffic, covered his head with his hoodie, and removed a 4-pound hammer from a little caesar's pizza bag. Then schindler allegedly struck, employing both hands to \" generate maximum force... With the intent to kill, \" per a police report cited by the sun. Schindler confessed to striking the mannequin, but says he was aware from the outset it was not a human; the police report counters that the scene was \" staged in a manner which would have made it impossible \" for schindler to make that determination. Police are questioning schindler about the murders. For now, he faces one count of carrying a concealed weapon, which his public defender tells the guardian is baloney: \" carrying a hammer in a bag is not carrying a concealed weapon...

It apparently began when the woman, unnamed by police, came home to find her door locked with the chain on. Concerned that her estranged husband was inside with her three children, she called police, who looked around and found nothing. Roughly two hours later she and her 29-year-old boyfriend heard a loud noise and he went looking in the garage, police say. That's when the boyfriend heard her scream. He ran into the living room and saw her ex-boyfriend, 25-year-old tyler bergkamp of salina, hanging through the living room ceiling. The boyfriend pulled him down and they struggled, with bergkamp apparently pulling a knife and threatening to kill them both, ksal reports. Police arrived to find the two men struggling outside. Bergkamp was arrested and accused of crimes including stalking, aggravated burglary, and possession of methamphetamine. The woman's three children, aged 5 and under, were home but unharmed during the melee.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease is currently marching through the brains of some 5 million americans, eradicating vast swaths of memories in a seemingly irrecoverable assault on cognition. But what if those memories were recoverable, that devastating assault reversible? scientists in the journal science translational medicine think they have a solid shot at just that based on a new ultrasound-based therapy they've tested on mice. By directing noninvasive ultrasound waves to the brains of mice, they were able to activate a type of cell called microglia, which essentially attacks things that don't belong in the brain, reports popular science. These cells dramatically cut a plaque — amyloid-β peptide, which can disrupt brain cell communication — whose buildup has long been associated with alzheimer's by as much as 75 %. For years it's been tough to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which separates and protects the blood and chemicals within the brain from those beyond, to get to these protein tangles. But scientists found that by using ultrasound alongside a microbubble injection they were able to temporarily open a pathway through the barrier without causing any brain damage or impairment. They then observed that over the course of weeks of followup, the mice who received the ultrasound treatment continued to perform better on both memory and spatial recognition tests. But hold the victory dances: though it shows big promise, \" there is a long way to go before this noninvasive technique could be translated into a practical treatment for alzheimer's, \" one researcher not affiliated with the study tells the la times. Next up: test sheep before moving to human trials. ( check out which drugs are associated with an increased risk of developing alzheimer's. )",

        "summary": "A construction worker in tehran has unearthed a mummified body at a former royal mausoleum, and its discovery could pose a tricky problem for the nation's rulers. The hot speculation is that the remains are that of reza shah pahlavi, seen by many as the founder of modern iran and the father of the shah who was overthrown in the 1979 revolution, reports the telegraph. It's a \" possibility, \" says the head of the city's heritage committee, and one \" that will be examined by responsible bodies. \" it was not clear if or when dna tests would take place. Pahlavi had been placed in the mausoleum after his death in 1944, but revolutionaries destroyed the site following the iranian revolution. Pahlavi's body was never recovered. It was his son, mohammad reza pahlavi, who was overthrown. The discovery of the remains came during work on a shiite shrine, and a spokesman for that shrine dismisses the idea that the remains are that of pahlavi. If he's wrong, however, the ap explains that iran's leaders have a fine line to navigate. Pahlavi, who rose to power in 1925 and ruled until his abdication in 1941, is still widely revered. Among other things, he ordered men to wear western clothes and to bring their wives to public events with their hair uncovered. He also banned women from wearing long robes known as chadors. His grandson, reza pahlavi, tweeted monday that he is closely watching how authorities handle the investigation into the remains. \" i warn the responsible authorities not to hide anything, \" he wrote.",

Police say 3-year-old titus greyson tackett's grandparents were babysitting when his parents returned home at around 1am wednesday to discover them sleeping, the front door open, and the boy gone, reports nbc news. After an overnight search involving local police, the missouri highway patrol, the fbi, and volunteers, titus ' body was found in the van at 11am, wrapped in a blanket, reports the st. Louis post-dispatch. Somebody who spotted the body flagged down a searcher, police say. Family members told police that they last saw titus at around midnight — and he was wearing only a diaper. The temperature in the area was around 14 degrees overnight, according to the national weather service. Authorities say an autopsy will be carried out and it still isn't clear if foul play was involved in the boy's death, ktvi reports. \" at this point, it's too early to determine exactly how he got out of the house and how he ended up where he was, \" iron county sheriff roger medley tells the daily journal, adding that there does not appear to be any connection between the van's owners and the boy's family.",

Cnnmoney reports that the former alaska governor filed her complaint, which seeks upward of $ 75,000 in damages, against the times on tuesday for an editorial it published right after the shooting of rep. Steve scalise earlier this month. In the op-ed touching on the viciousness of the current political climate, the times editorial board had pointed a finger at palin and cited her as a force of \" political incitement \" before the 2011 gabby giffords shooting in arizona, claiming that an ad from palin's pac had positioned \" giffords and 19 other democrats under stylized [ crosshairs ], \" per the lawsuit. Two days later, the paper added what the new york post deems an \" embarrassing correction \" — that no definitive tie had arisen between \" political rhetoric \" and the giffords attack, and that the pac ad had shown electoral districts, not actual democrats, under the crosshairs. The nyt opinion account also tweeted a mea culpa for getting \" an important fact wrong. \" the times itself reports on palin's suit, which says the paper \" violated the law and its own policies \" and \" knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly and maliciously \" published the piece to hurt the \" devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, \" or at the very least exhibited \" blatant disregard \" for possible harm.

Nbc san diego reports a growing number of states — including minnesota, missouri, kansas, washington, and colorado — are asking drivers to wait until the exact point where the lanes narrow before merging. The colorado department of transportation says waiting until the last possible moment to merge actually reduces delays by up to 35 %, according to the coloradoan. And the west central tribune reports it can reduce the length of a backup by up to 40 %. The explanation is actually fairly simple: cars merging earlier than they absolutely must leave the remaining portion of the closing lane unused. That makes backups worse. Merging as late as possible is also safer. The tribune notes that merging early \" can lead to unexpected and dangerous lane switching, serious crashes, and road rage. \" but despite the evidence, drivers aren't likely to start going easy on people who skip the line to merge at the last second.

( think \" superbugs \" and the rise of antibiotic-resistant infections in humans, for example. ) today, the fda took its first action to curb the practice, reports usa today. It is asking drug companies to voluntarily change their labels to make it illegal for farmers to use the drugs solely to boost growth. Already, two of the biggest such companies, zoetis and elanco, say they will comply. Also, farmers will now need a veterinarian's permission to administer the drugs. All of which should make public health advocates thrilled? not exactly. Critics say farmers can keep using the drugs and get around the law by saying they're doing so to prevent illness, not boost growth, reports the new york times. And the washington post quotes congresswoman louise slaughter of new york, a microbiologist, as saying the rules fall \" woefully short of what is needed to prevent a public health crisis. \" more forgiving is the director of the pew charitable trust's program for health and industrial farming, who calls it a \" promising start, especially after decades of inaction. \" drug companies have 90 days to say whether they will comply, then three years to put the changes into effect.",

The story quotes one expert as saying it could come down to sponsors — if enough say they want no part of the show, that might be the end for her at the network. All this stems from the newly revealed court deposition out of a discrimination lawsuit brought by one of her restaurant managers. \" yes, of course, \" she has used the n-word, she said in court, but it was a long time ago. And then there was her ( unfulfilled ) wish to stage a plantation-style wedding for her brother with all black waiters. ( the huffington post has the full transcript. ) today, deen's lawyer explained further, telling usa today that the celeb chef grew up in different times, \" when america's south had schools that were segregated, different bathrooms, different restaurants and americans rode in different parts of the bus. \" but things have changed and so has deen, says the lawyer, adding that deen doesn't condone use of the word or discrimination. The ap, meanwhile, talks to a pr expert who thinks that deen's core audience is probably safe, but she'd be in trouble if she tries to expand further. It also quotes a texas woman leaving deen's store in georgia with a bag full of goodies. \" who hasn't ever said that word? i don't think any less of her.

Suu kyi, the longtime activist turned de facto leader of myanmar, has been criticized for her response to accusations of ethnic cleansing in her nation; nearly half a million members of the rohingya muslim minority have fled to neighboring bangladesh due to violence in recent weeks, but suu kyi has downplayed the issue and dismissed claims of sexual violence against rohingya women.

So report johns hopkins researchers in the journal drug and alcohol dependence. They rounded up healthy individuals ages 18 to 45 and tested their blood, urine, saliva, and hair. Then the scientists put 12 of the participants in a plexiglas-and-aluminum smoke chamber the size of a dorm room and asked the six smokers among them to light up as many of the 10 single-gram high-potency joints as they pleased over the course of an hour in the presence of the six nonsmokers. ( participants were allowed to wear jumpsuits and disposable booties to protect their clothes, as well as goggles to prevent eye irritation, which must have been quite the look. ) it turns out that when the researchers ran the experiment without ventilation, participants had minor but detectably higher heart rates and performance impairments, and four of the nonsmokers failed multiple drug tests a day after exposure. When the room was ventilated, however, cannabinoids were so low as to even be undetectable in blood and urine tests. In fact, the only noticeable effect when ventilated is that even nonsmokers got the munchies, although researchers acknowledge that \" lunch hour was approaching, \" reports new york. And while the researchers say their study highlights the potentially dangerous effects of secondhand smoke, they acknowledge that \" it's really hard to get a positive [ drug test result ] from passive smoke unless you're in an extreme scenario, \" reports livescience.

But he hasn't done stand-up, or even really talked about stand-up, since he gave it up, and that made the performance something truly special. How was he? \" mostly pretty good, occasionally almost great, and for one moment truly special, \" fox writes. He performed for about 10 minutes, which included some banjo songs, per the guardian. His opener was solid: \" jerry couldn't make it tonight... Have a safe ride home! \" his jokes were classic steve martin: \" i ' m a little upset with the beacon theatre. I was backstage and i used the restroom. And there was a sign that read, ' employees must wash hands. ' [ pause ] ' and i could not find [ pause ] one employee [ pause ] to wash my hands. \" sure, it might sound cheesy, \" but that's the point, \" fox writes. \" martin in his prime did comedy that made fun of comedy. \" he still exhibited a \" masterful \" command of rhythm, as the aforementioned pauses illustrate.

        "summary": "Black friday has in recent years received a black mark as retailers took criticism for slowly pushing back the mega-shopping event until it actually started on thanksgiving day. Some retailers and shopping venues have given in to the backlash: various malls ( such as the mall of america ) and chain stores including radioshack and office depot will be shuttered on thanksgiving this year, per cnnmoney. But one of the largest superstores is doubling down, then adding a few hours for good measure, usa today reports. Toys r us will be opening its doors at 5pm on turkey day and keeping them open for 30 hours straight — until 11pm on black friday. \" our customers have voted at the doors year after year, and they continue to want the option to get an early start on their holiday shopping lists, \" joe venezia, executive vp for the company's global operations, said in a statement. But not every consumer feels that way: per a bestblackfriday.com poll cited by usa today, 60.2 % of consumers say they'd refuse to shop on thanksgiving. And brian rich, who started the boycott black thursday facebook page five years ago, tells cnn that while \" walmart, best buy, and target probably won't close on thanksgiving anytime soon … this movement is clearly having an impact. \" patrons definitely still have plenty of other stores they can descend upon after emerging from their tryptophan fog, including kohl's ( a 6pm thanksgiving day opening ), macy's ( 5pm ), and jcpenney ( 3pm ), per cnbc.

The book bills itself as a \" true manifesto \" for the \" disruptive soul, \" but babe writer harry shukman said that it reads more like the \" unabomber manifesto \"; shukman pulled out excerpts from create rebellion as well as domestic terrorist ted kaczynski's manifesto and dared readers to see if they could tell which one was which. Well, that didn't go over well with tripp: in a follow-up post, shukman revealed tripp sent babe a letter to warn that he has consulted his lawyer and is considering suing the site for defamation, false light, and copyright infringement. \" the website has deliberately and negligently violated my copyright in multiple articles, and has exhibited a pattern of targeted harassment of me and my reputation, \" the letter says.

It was then sold to an individual who donated it to the museum, which is \" satisfied that our version is real, \" a spokesperson tells the tribune. Trump's version apparently now hangs in trump tower. Based on a photo taken there that shows the painting, \" it seems clearly to be a copy of that famous chicago picture, \" an art historian adds, per artnet, which cites a second art historian who agrees that renoir never painted exact replicas of his own work.

The body had been tied up with rope and a post-mortem examination found that she had been killed by a blow to the head. After she disappeared, nichols claimed she had left a typed note and called him briefly on christmas eve. Neighbors say nichols was strange — he was once spotted with a dummy riding in the front seat of his car — and they always had their suspicions after his wife vanished. \" ultimately, we all said he did it, \" one former neighbor tells the poughkeepsie journal. \" we automatically all said that, ' he did something with her.

The gruesome find was uncovered behind a ' false wall ' in the basement of the home the woman had shared with her late husband, police said. Joann nichols'remains were found inside a large plastic bin, inside a plastic bag and wrapped in a sheet, said dr. Kari reiber, the dutchess county medical examiner. \" the body was skeletonized and the hands were tied with rope.... A large area of the right side of the skull was also missing, \" reiber said. Sealing the body in the plastic bin behind a false wall might have been enough to mask the smell as the body decomposed, she said. Members of the medical examiner's office removed the body after it was found friday and were able to identify nichols through dental records. An autopsy showed the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head, according to reiber. Nichols, a 55-year-old former first-grade teacher at gayhead elementary school in hopewell junction new york, was reported missing on december 21, 1985, by her husband, james nichols. Police said he called in the report after his wife didn't show up for a hair appointment at a beauty parlor earlier that day. The next day the couple's vehicle was discovered in the parking lot of a shopping center in the town.

Officers said they found the house filled with personal items, debris and garbage.

        "summary": "A tortoise-napper is on the loose in new york city. The wall street journal reports a 95-pound tortoise named millennium was stolen from the alley pound environmental center in queens sometime between sunday evening and monday afternoon. The educational center isn't sure how the thief or thieves managed to get way with the african spurred tortoise, \" one of the center's most prized animals, \" according to ny1. A hole was cut in the tortoise enclosure's fence, but it wasn't large enough to slip millennium through and it would have taken quite the effort to boost him over the 6-foot-high fence. \"he's not an animal you can just come and pick up and walk him half a block. He's very awkward, \" the center's head of operations tells the journal. \" you would need a wagon, a hand-truck, or a wheelbarrow. \" \" it was quite shocking and disappointing because millennium is one of our big attractions here, \" an alley pond educator tells dnainfo. Millennium was rescued by the center a dozen years ago and has been living in an enclosure with another tortoise named mini me. Millennium is estimated to be 17 years old but could actually be up to 100 based on its size. Police are reviewing security footage from the center and nearby areas and using a police dog in hopes of locating the pilfered tortoise. Meanwhile, mini me is still safe in the enclosure.",

Part of the problem is habitat loss. Borneo has the worst deforestation rate in the world, with approximately 865,000 acres of forest lost to development every year between 2001 and 2016. Researchers estimate another 45,000 orangutans could be lost in the next 35 years from deforestation alone. But voigt says hunting of orangutans is \" at least a major driver if not the major driver \" for their decline. They're killed for food or when they wander onto plantations; mothers are killed to sell their babies as pets. \"we know this decline has been largely due to hunting, and if we can turn that around, these orangutans could, over a long period, bounce back, \" wich tells the guardian. The world's other two species of orangutans — both found in indonesia — have fewer than 15,000 or so members combined. ( a recent study found great apes may be able to \" read minds. \" )",

        "summary": "Call it the attack of the purple pigment. Live science reports purple splotches are damaging old animal-skin parchments around the world. Take, for example, a 16-foot-long scroll inside the vatican secret archives. The parchment was written by italian villagers in 1244 asking the church to make laurentius loricatus a saint. Loricatus was a teenage soldier who, having accidentally killed a man, spent the next 34 years in a cave burning his face with a hot iron and otherwise punishing himself to atone for his sins. While the story of loricatus is interesting, it's incomplete thanks to those damned purple spots. Purple pigment dots the scroll's margins and completely obscures the first and last pages. But thanks to a study published thursday in scientific reports, we may finally know why so many old parchments look like prince. Scientists subjected flakes of the loricatus scroll to new genetic sequencing techniques, and lead researcher luciana migliore says the results were \" absolutely surprising, \" gizmodo reports. The purple spots were being caused by halobacteria, a type of marine microbe that eats salt, according to afp. Not the kind of thing you'd expect to find on a goat-skin parchment nowhere near the ocean, migliore recalls her initial reaction: \" there must be some mistake. \" the explanation lies in the process used to create parchments worldwide: the animal skin is first soaked in a sea-salt bath to preserve it by killing flesh-eating bacteria. That, however, introduces the salt-eating bacteria, which create purple pigments. Migliore and her team are looking into ways to possibly remove the purple splotches.

The movie, starring hugh jackman and jake gyllenhaal, about a father who takes justice into his own hands to find his missing daughter, is getting good ratings from critics. But though some are clapping loudly, others are just plain maddened by its end. Stephen whitty is a big fan. Writing for the star-ledger, he says the film has \" a moral complexity that few movies like this even bother to consider, \" and the cast members all do fine jobs. \" is it the best hollywood mystery we've seen in awhile? oh yes. Is it one any parent would want to see? only if they don't mind nightmares. \" rene rodriguez at the miami herald acknowledges prisoners \" explores the subject of vigilante justice from a fresh perspective, \" plus it looks great. But in its final minutes, prisoners \" starts revealing its secrets to progressively hokier effect \" in a way that's \" jarring and fake — it's incredibly frustrating. \" liam lacey is on the same page. \" any pretense of naturalism, of real-life stakes, disappears \" as the movie progresses, he writes for the globe and mail. \" the more that prisoners conforms to the expectations of a well-crafted movie experience, the less it seems to be about anything that matters. You may be impressed, but you're less likely to be convinced by its resolution. \" richard corliss at time, however, wasn't impressed from the start. \" prisoners has got more pedigree than a westminster dog-show winner.

Beatriz allen, who passed away in her sleep at the age of 81 on april 30, had lived in her noe valley home for nearly 40 years. But in 2014, healthcare tech startup ceo tariq hilaly bought the building, along with the one next door. In march 2016, allen was served an eviction notice giving her 60 days to vacate. The guardian explains the state's ellis act allows some property owners to remove longtime tenants from their rent-controlled apartments. Recently a 100-year-old woman died in san francisco after losing a similar battle; a 93-year-old man was fighting his eviction at the time of his death. \" mom is number three, \" allen's daughter says. \" she is the third person to be killed and die for this. \" hilaly said he wanted to move his parents, who are in their 70s, into allen's apartment, and his lawyers asserted that he had every right to occupy it. But allen's attorneys argued that it was unethical to evict her in her final year of life. Even as doctors gave her just weeks to live, hilaly, whose lawyers say he offered to pay for her to relocate, set may 9 as her eviction date. Allen died before it came to that. \" it was scary for her, \" her daughter says. \" it felt like they were killing her. \" the story comes a few weeks after the department of housing and urban development released 2017 income limits related to subsidized housing; san francisco's figures in particular made waves, as they established that a family of four making $ 105,350 is \" low income, \" reported the mercury news.",

Sources tell the washington post that trump so far has only a \" bare-bones \" understanding of the memo, based on media coverage, but he has told aides he supports its release because he believes it will show that the investigation of him has been biased. Republicans say the republican-written secret document exposes wrongdoing in the fbi surveillance of trump campaign aide carter page, but democrats and security officials argue that its release could damage intelligence-gathering efforts, politico reports. Justice officials have argued that the release could be \" extraordinarily reckless. \" the house intelligence committee voted along party lines not to release a competing document written by democrats. \" today this committee voted to put the president's personal interests, perhaps their own political interest, above the national interest, \" rep. Adam schiff, the ranking democrat on the committee, said after the vote, per the ap. Republicans are split on how much impact the memo — which grew out of the committee's investigation of the controversial trump-russia dossier — will have, though rep.

The women also said the officers arrested them to justify a non-existent long-term investigation into prostitution and sex trafficking near the club. Daniels, whose real name is stephanie clifford, was arrested in july for inappropriately touching a female undercover officer. Club employee miranda panda was arrested for touching another cocktail waitress and brittany walters was arrested for touching an undercover officer while dancing. Charges against all three women were dismissed. Columbus city attorney zach klein said a week after the arrests the law used to arrest and charge the three women with first-degree misdemeanors was \" glaringly inequitable \" and should not be enforced. Daniels ' attorney, michael avenatti, said at the time that daniels ' arrest was politically motivated, a claim denied by a police union official. A message seeking comment about the lawsuit was left tuesday with klein's office. Meanwhile, insiders tell the wall street journal that trump personally managed an effort to stop daniels from going public with her account of their sexual tryst. That allegedly meant coordinating with lawyer michael cohen and son eric trump, who had the president's company, the trump organization, coordinate arbitration paperwork. The report contradicts trump's claims that he had cut ties with his company.",

            "Columbus, ohio ( ap ) — two women who were arrested at an ohio strip club along with porn actress stormy daniels sued four police officers tuesday claiming they sought to retaliate against daniels for her sex allegations concerning donald trump before he became president. The women also said the officers arrested them to justify a non-existent long-term investigation into prostitution and sex trafficking near the club. Daniels, whose real name is stephanie clifford, was arrested in july for inappropriately touching a female undercover officer. Club employee miranda panda was arrested for touching another cocktail waitress and brittany walters was arrested for touching an undercover officer while dancing. Charges against all three women were dismissed. Columbus city attorney zach klein said a week after the arrests the law used to arrest and charge the three women with first-degree misdemeanors was \" glaringly inequitable \" and should not be enforced. Daniels ' attorney, michael avenatti, said at the time that daniels ' arrest was politically motivated, a claim denied by a police union official.

        "summary": "The us government has unleashed millions of wasps into 24 states, the guardian reports. But, contrary to the horrifying mental pictures this creates, the release of the wasps is actually a good thing. The emerald ash borer is believed to have invaded north america in the 1990s via wooden shipping crates from russia, china, and elsewhere. Since then, the beetle has spread across more than two dozen states from massachusetts to louisiana, according to phys.org. In doing so, the ash borer has killed approximately 38 million ash trees. And that's a $ 25 billion problem. The possible solution: four species of tiny wasps from china. These wasps — each about the size of a pinhead — are parasites to the ash borer, which has no natural enemies in north america, the des moines register reports. The wasps lay their eggs in ash borer eggs and larva, killing the beetle in the process. But humans have nothing to fear. The stingless wasps are more likely to be mistaken for gnats than anything else. \" the word ' wasps'does create alarm, but they are very small — not recognizable by the average person, \" iowa department of agriculture rep mike kintner tells the register. After extensive testing with other beetle species, experts are also confident the wasps won't threaten any native insects. Still, even with a seemingly perfect weapon, the battle against the ash borer is far from over. \"this isn't going to save anybody's tree in their yard, \" entomologist ben slager tells the guardian. \" what we're working to do is to protect the next generation coming up. \" ( this is the most dangerous tree in the us. )",

But cooper then continued to ask questions about miller's brother, even after he started crying. After the third question, miller broke down and eventually walked away; cameras followed him as he knelt and cried, according to the hollywood reporter. Fansided points out one common criticism of the interview: nbc chose to air it, despite the fact that it had the footage hours in advance of primetime. Miller later addressed the emotional moment, the guardian reports: \" it was just some questions and comments about my brother.... It was just a lot of emotion. \" he also urged people not to blame cooper, on his twitter account: \" i appreciate everyone sticking up for me. Please be gentle w christin cooper, it was crazy emotional and not all her fault. #heatofthemoment...

        "summary": "Two 41-year-old men in manitoba, canada, have been devastated to discover that they were raised by the wrong families after having been switched at birth by a hospital that mixed up at least two other babies the same year. Leon swanson and david tait jr. Were born three days apart in early 1975 at norway house indian hospital in a remote northern community, the cbc reports. The two men, who know each other, had dna tests and discovered the disturbing truth after luke monias and norman barkman — who were born at the hospital on the same day in june 1975 — discovered last fall that they had been switched. Both men wept at a press conference friday. \" forty years gone, \" tait said, per the national post. \" it's pretty tough. It hit me like a ton of bricks. \" the hospital in the indigenous community was federally run at the time, and officials have promised a third-party investigation to find out what went wrong — and whether any other babies were switched. \" we can live with one mistake, but two mistakes of a similar nature is not acceptable, \" says eric robinson, manitoba's former aboriginal affairs minister. \" we can't slough it off as being a mistake. It was a criminal act. \" david tait sr. Says the two families have talked and have decided to consider themselves one big family. ( this japanese man was 58 when he discovered he had been sent home with the wrong family. )",

            "Wall street bonuses up 17 % in 2009 new york ( cnnmoney.com ) -- new york state comptroller thomas dinapoli said tuesday that wall street bonuses jumped 17 % last year, to an estimated $ 20.3 billion, as profits in the financial services sector rebounded. The average taxable bonus for securities industry employees in new york rose to $ 123,850 in 2009 from $ 112,000 the year before, according to estimates from the comptroller. At goldman sachs ( gs, fortune 500 ), morgan stanley ( ms, fortune 500 ), and jpmorgan chase ( jpm, fortune 500 ) overall compensation increased by 31 % in 2009. Average compensation rose by 27 % to more than $ 340,000. The rebound in bonus payments comes amid a sharp increase in wall street profits, which could reach an \" unprecedented \" $ 55 billion for 2009, dinapoli said. That would be nearly three times greater than the previous all-time record annual profit, but follows a $ 42.6 billion loss in 2008. The bulk of the increase in profits came from broker-dealer operations, which brought in a record $ 49.9 billion through the first three quarters of 2009. Despite the increase in compensation and profits, bonus payments remain below record levels of just a few years ago. In 2007, for example, bonuses totaled nearly $ 33 billion. \" it's still not back to historic levels, \" dinapoli told reporters at a press conference in new york. \" it's down by about 30 % compared to the numbers in the bonus pool prior to the downturn and the great recession. \" dinapoli said the financial services industry is \" vital \" to new york's economy, but he acknowledged the massive bonuses are a \" bitter pill \" for most americans. \" there's a lot of resentment against the industry over its role in the global economic meltdown, \" dinapoli said in a statement. \" taxpayers bailed them out, and now they're back making money while many new york families are still struggling to make ends meet. \" wall street firms received billions in government bailout funds in 2009 as the financial crisis crippled the industry and the economy sank into one of the worst recessions on record.

The comet was initially expected to be visible to the naked eye, though hopes of that seemed to be fading. In the best-case scenario, another eruption from the comet will make it brighter.

        "summary": "The truce was as short-lived as you can get, with fierce clashes between police and protesters breaking out in kiev just hours after it was announced. Reports say firearms are being used by both sides in the battle over independence square, marking a \" new and ominous phase, \" reports the new york times. Fighting resumed just after daybreak today, when ski mask-clad men began an advance on the riot police who had taken the square on tuesday. By around 10am, protesters had reclaimed the whole square, but at a cost: bodies were seen lined up on a sidewalk as the sound of gunfire echoed, and the ap's current death count for the day sits at 70 ( that number comes via a medic with the opposition, and the ap notes it has not been verified ). The ap describes the scene as an \" almost-medieval melee. \" other developments: in one protester's telling, the ski mask-clad men decided to rush the square because they believed the truce to be a stalling technique that would grant president viktor yanukovich enough time to send in more troops. On that front, the times has this: \" it was not clear how the military could be legally deployed for what would be a domestic policing mission unless the authorities first declared a state of emergency, a step that mr. Yanukovich has previously shied away from and for which the military has shown no enthusiasm. \" further, the us has been \" warning against \" imposing such a state for months now. But american officials ' attempts to connect with top ukrainian military officials have been fruitless in recent days. \" nobody is picking up \" the phone, says a state department official. Protesters have reportedly captured 67 policemen, per the country's interior ministry. The ap reports the officers were seen being led through the protest camp with their hands held high; an opposition lawmaker says they are being held in kiev's occupied city hall. An ap cameraman saw snipers shooting at protesters; video footage showed at least one sniper wearing a ukraine riot police uniform. The bbc reports the white house has this morning issued a statement, which reads in part: \" we urge president yanukovich to immediately withdraw his security forces from downtown kiev and to respect the right of peaceful protest, and we urge protesters to express themselves peacefully. We urge the ukrainian military not to get involved in a conflict that can and should be resolved by political means. \"",

It says that the minion caveman toy makes three sounds — \" para la bukay, \" \" hahaha \" and \" eh eh. \" the statement says \" a very small number of customers \" have been in touch with the company about the toy. Others have taken to youtube, reports cnnmoney, with parents posting videos that they say capture the naughty line; this one has racked up more than 1.4 million views as of this writing. Mcdonald's said the promotion is supposed to run through the end of july. \" our goal at mcdonald's is to serve up food and fun for our valued customers, and we're glad to have the minions on board, \" the company said. A spokeswoman for mcdonald's, lisa mccomb, says there are no plans to take the toys out of distribution. The movie premieres today; critics are so-so on it.",
