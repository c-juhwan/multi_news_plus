        "summary": "The amazon's largest fish is nearing extinction, reports livescience, though it's not because its habitat has drastically changed. The arapaima, or pirarucu, is huge for a freshwater fish, weighing upward of 400 pounds and reaching 9 feet in length. Unfortunately this makes the amazonian giants easy targets for fisherman — along with their tendency to hang out near the water's surface so they can, yes, breathe air. ( they are the only known fish in the world whose gills allow them to breathe underwater but whose primitive lungs allow them to also breathe air. And they've got another quirk: the males actually incubate tens of thousands of eggs in their mouths, guarding them with everything they've got. ) the arapaima is being overfished by some groups in the amazon not only for their flesh and tongues, but also to make jewelry out of their large scales, reports national geographic. Interviewing 81 local communities, researchers found that the fish appear to be extinct in about one-fifth of them already, and are depleted or nearing extinction in more than half. The good news is that communities that have established fishing rules have 100-fold the number of arapaimas, a sign that regulation could help revive the dwindling numbers. ( check out which bird is back from the brink of extinction. )",

            "Also known as the paiche or the pirarucu, the arapaima is an air-breathing fish that plies the rain forest rivers of south america's amazon basin and nearby lakes and swamps. One of the world's largest freshwater fish, these giants can reach 9 feet ( 2.75 meters ) long and weigh up to 440 pounds ( 200 kilograms ). They have a wide, scaly, gray body and a tapered head. Though arapaimas can stay underwater for 10 to 20 minutes, they tend to remain near the water's surface, where they hunt and emerge often to breathe with a distinctive coughing noise. They survive mainly on fish but are known to occasionally grab birds close to the water's surface. The arapaima's proximity to the water's surface make it vulnerable to human predators, who can easily target them with harpoons. Some indigenous communities consume the arapaima's meat and tongue and collect its large scales, which are fashioned into jewelry and other items. The amazon's seasonal floods have become part of the arapaima's reproductive cycle. During low-water months ( february to april ) arapaimas construct bottom nests and females lay eggs.

        "summary": "The us is less than two months away from getting its new $ 100 bills — hopefully. The oct. 8 release date is already more than two years behind schedule, a delay caused by production problems that apparently have not abated. Writing for the new yorker, david wolman reports that the bureau of engraving and printing has hit yet another snag, per a memo from the bureau. The country has just two currency-printing facilities, and the washington, dc, location has had a \" mashing \" issue, in which the application of too much ink led to what the new yorker likens to a kid painting outside the lines. The affected bills are \" clearly unacceptable \" and internal quality checks apparently missed that. They were delivered to the fed interspersed with ones that were printed just fine, and now the fed is sending back some 30 million of them — and won't take any more from the dc location for now. In the meantime, bureau director larry felix has, with an eye on oct. 8, asked the fort worth, texas, facility to step things up. The atlantic wire does the math and calculates it that it's a $ 3.79 million blunder: the bills reportedly cost 12 cents apiece to produce ( that's about $ 3.78 million ), and it tacks on another $ 12,000 for destroying them. But wolman sees \" a possible greater cost, \" likening the situation to that of \" a magician getting caught unloading a crate of bunnies from the back of his truck. It threatens to injure the aura — the almightiness — of the dollar. \" click for more on the coming ( fingers crossed ) bills.",

Today, david wolman of the new yorker reports that 30 million of the new $ 100 bills were incorrectly produced, and so the federal reserve might have to delay the bills'release once again. It's another embarrassing problem for the federal reserve, which budgeted for the bills'release, and the bureau of engraving and printing, which was responsible for its production.

        "summary": "Advocates for pregnant women are raising their voices over what they say is growing suspicion over substance abuse — suspicion that is often unfair. At cosmopolitan.com, ada calhoun recounts the story of one california mother's nightmare: when tiffany langwell, 38, gave birth to a daughter, she left the hospital earlier than doctors recommended. The next day, she found child protective services at her door; hospital workers had alerted officials that langwell, her fiancé, and his mother showed shakiness that could signal substance abuse, while langwell had pill bottles ( they were iron supplements, she says ). An early test was inconclusive — apparently because langwell's saliva was particularly thick. That \" may have had something to do with the fact that i had just given birth and it was 110 degrees, \" she notes. Cps came back with a warrant and took the baby away, first to the hospital, where \" they tried eight times to catheterize my one-day-old, \" the father notes. Then the newborn was put in foster care for a week. \" i thought it was some horrible joke. You are guilty until you prove your innocence, \" langwell says. After a hair-follicle drug test came up clean, the baby was finally returned to langwell. The case — which activists say isn't isolated — occurred against a background of what an advocate calls \" extremely problematic ' if you test positive for a drug, we're going to take the baby ' cases. \" poor families are often unfairly suspected, advocates say. Fear of arrest is prompting some pregnant women to avoid getting the care they need in hospitals, notes nancy redd in an interview with calhoun, who has previously written on the topic. ( parents raised questions earlier this year when a mother was arrested for leaving her child in the park while she worked. )",

Julie curtin said, and he insisted that \" after he put the condom on [ during the alleged incident ] it was a sobering moment and that he had a moment of self-restraint and [ stopped ] … he called it a moment of divine inspiration, \" wmur reports. Labrie's defense, meanwhile, maintains that detectives tried to separate labrie from his parents during questioning — an assertion curtin admits to doing \" to get his side of the story, \" as the ap puts it. In other news from the trial, a state forensic expert testified yesterday that sperm was found on the alleged victim's underwear, but she couldn't determine conclusively that it was labrie's, the concord monitor reports. She could determine labrie's dna was found in other places, but she says that was from skin cells and could have ended up there from sweat, saliva, or even just touching. On monday, two of labrie's friends testified that he had told them he had sex with the alleged victim, with one of them noting labrie had confessed to harboring a \" crush \" on the girl and thought she was a virgin, nbc news reports. Labrie, who nbc says planned to become a minister, is expected to testify on his own behalf today, per the guardian. ( labrie detailed st. Paul's sexual-conquest culture. )",

Crayola wasn't planning on revealing the color being cut until friday, but it made the announcement early after a twitter user posted a photo of a crayola 120-crayon box at a target store with the words \" dandelion is retiring \" on the side, npr reports. Crayola is still counting down to its national crayon day announcement friday — and the company says it will reveal the \" color family \" of the new addition to the box of 24 at an event in times square, consumerist reports. \" dandelion was so excited to announce his retirement he snuck a few packages out of the factory and onto the shelves of a handful of his favorite retailers last night, \" a crayola spokesman says. The company says the dandelion color has been around for 27 years, and joined the 24-box 18 years ago. It joins numerous others in retirement, including blizzard blue, magic mint, mulberry, and teal blue, which were dropped in 2003.

They say the former q host then told them \" big ears teddy shouldn't see this, \" rotated the bear's face away from them, and then began to choke or hit them. Gawker points out that someone tweeted seven times under the handle @bigearsteddy in april. Among the tweets: \" this just in: @jianghomeshi the real life monster behind britney spears smash ' hit me baby one more time '. #hideyourkids #hideyourwife. \" meanwhile, lucy decoutere, described as a popular tv actress in canada, says she was one of the women who was choked — so hard that she was unable to breathe — making her the first accuser to reveal her identity. She recounts a 2003 incident that she says began with the two of them kissing at his home and ended with ghomeshi slapping her three times.

Egypt has been buzzing over the ad, in which a motherly figure named abla fahita chats with an unseen character called \" mama touta. \" fahita, a widow, is looking for her husband's missing sim card, and talks about searching a mall with a sniffer dog, the independent explains. It seemed harmless until blogger and youth activist ahmed spider spent nearly an hour on tv dissecting its supposed symbolism, the new york times reports. Spider saw mama touta as the muslim brotherhood, a red ornament as a bomb, and so on. A vodafone spokesperson called in saying, \" i ' m sad that we have reached this level of thinking. \" the 25-year-old spider is a repeat conspiracy theorist, who once called egypt's 2011 revolution a masonic plot, according to the financial times. Abla fahita herself ( yes, the puppet ) appeared on tv wednesday to debunk the plot, saying, \" i am a comedic character. \" some egyptians have lent credence to the theory, but it's being widely mocked online, the economist reports. Fake support groups are cheekily protesting the puppet's likely torture by police, while others call for a puppet-hunt for mama touta.",

            "Prosecutors in egypt have this week questioned officials of one of the largest telecommunications companies in the country over allegations that their advert included coded signals for bomb attacks by the muslim brotherhood. Egyptian state security prosecutors have questioned the makers of a commercial for vodafone egypt which features popular puppet abla fahita, a widow attempting to reactivate the phone line previously used by her late husband. In the advert, the puppet can be seen talking on the phone while her daughter karkoura searches for her deceased father's sim card. Speaking on the phone with a friend, fahita says she asked for the sniffer dog of a shopping mall to help search for the missing card and discusses another character called \"mama touta \". However, video-blogger and youth activist ahmed spider accused the advert of containing pro-muslim brotherhood messages during an hour long appearance on egyptian television on tuesday. The egyptian unit of vodafone, the world's biggest mobile operator by revenue, rejected the suggestions. Spider said the mall and the dog were code words for the planned sites of a coming attack, and \"mama touta \" is a secret name for the brotherhood. The 25-year-old told the private al-tahrir tv channel in an interview that baubles hanging on a cactus featured in the commercial represented bombs. \"these elements tell us that there will be a big mall and an explosion after",
            "In a place as politically turbulent as egypt, where yesterday's good guys become today's villains and vice versa, telling fact from fiction can be tricky. But clearly, many egyptian newspapers make little effort to do so. A spoof arabic news website recently posted a story claiming that swedish riot police have tested laughing gas to control crowds. The gas had proven astonishingly effective, it said, making dangerous rioting mobs fall haplessly to the floor with giggles. A quick check on google would have shown this to be a hoax. Yet not only did half a dozen cairo newspapers pick up the story and run it as fact, several embellished on it, or ascribed it to \" wire reports \" or \" a swedish news service \".

However, video-blogger and youth activist ahmed spider accused the advert of containing pro-muslim brotherhood messages during an hour long appearance on egyptian television on tuesday. The egyptian unit of vodafone, the world's biggest mobile operator by revenue, rejected the suggestions. Spider said the mall and the dog were code words for the planned sites of a coming attack, and \"mama touta \" is a secret name for the brotherhood. The 25-year-old told the private al-tahrir tv channel in an interview that baubles hanging on a cactus featured in the commercial represented bombs. \"these elements tell us that there will be a big mall and an explosion after",
            "In a place as politically turbulent as egypt, where yesterday's good guys become today's villains and vice versa, telling fact from fiction can be tricky. But clearly, many egyptian newspapers make little effort to do so. A spoof arabic news website recently posted a story claiming that swedish riot police have tested laughing gas to control crowds. The gas had proven astonishingly effective, it said, making dangerous rioting mobs fall haplessly to the floor with giggles. A quick check on google would have shown this to be a hoax. Yet not only did half a dozen cairo newspapers pick up the story and run it as fact, several embellished on it, or ascribed it to \" wire reports \" or \" a swedish news service \". Get our daily newsletter upgrade your inbox and get our daily dispatch and editor's picks. It is not just egypt's press that struggles with the truth. On new years day vodafone, a mobile-phone operator, felt obliged to issue a statement denying that an advertisement it had produced, featuring muppet-like dolls, carried any subversive messages. The denial followed allegations, aired on a television talk show, that the advert contained imagery and words suggesting that a coded message was being issued to islamist terrorists.

        "summary": "Scientists have spotted four-stranded dna in humans for the first time and say it could provide a key to fighting cancer, the bbc reports. A cambridge university team revealed the find to nature chemistry last year, saying the \" quadruple helix \" may arise when a cell is unstable or in a dysfunctional state — like one that leads to cancer. \" we need to prove that; but if that is the case, targeting them with synthetic molecules could be an interesting way of selectively targeting those cells that have this dysfunction, \" said cambridge chemist shankar balasubramanian. They found that four-stranded dna occurred most often when a cell is copying its dna right before dividing. That could link the quadruple helix to cancers, which are often caused by genes that mutate to boost dna replication. Perhaps synthetic molecules could curb the out-of-control cell proliferation that leads to tumors: \" i ' m hoping now that the pharmaceutical companies will bring this on to their radar, \" said balasubramanian.

            "William m. Daley, who was mr. Obama's chief of staff at the time and was present in the situation room when the abbottabad raid was discussed, said shortly after tuesday's forum that the meeting occurred as mr. Biden described it. The description of the meeting about the abbottabad raid was one of several moments when mr. Biden seemed to take swipes, at least indirectly, at mrs. Clinton. He did not mention mrs. Clinton as among those who had definitively supported the abbottabad raid, although she and mr. Daley said she had been. In a wide-ranging conversation with former vice president walter f. Mondale about his vice presidency, mr. Biden mentioned that he had flown more than one million miles to speak to world leaders. \"we've had two great secretaries of state, \" he said, \"but when i go, they know that i am speaking for the president. There is nothing missed between the lip and the cup. Whatever i say, the president is saying. \" at another point in the discussion, mr. Biden mentioned that he was the administration's primary interlocutor with capitol hill. \"and i still have a lot of republican friends, \" mr. Biden said, adding for the second time in two days, \"i don't think my chief enemy there is the republican party. This is"

Survivor felicia sanders told the court that the young white man sat with black parishioners in the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston, sc, for 45 minutes before opening fire, the citizen-times reports. She said she dove under a table with her 11-year-old granddaughter, and played dead, pressing the girl's face to her body so tightly she briefly thought she had suffocated her. Then, sanders testified, her injured son, 26-year-old tywanza sanders, rose to confront the gunman. She said he asked: \" why are you doing this? \" and roof replied: \" i have to do this. You are taking our women and you are taking over the world. \" sanders said her son told the gunman: \" you don't have to do this. We mean you no harm. \" then, sanders said, roof fired five bullets into her son and fled the church. \" i watched him take his last breath. I watched my son come into this world. I watched my son leave this life, \" the distraught mother said before the judge called a recess. When roof's lawyer asked her if he said he was going to kill himself, sanders said: \" i was counting on that, \" the new york times reports. \" he is evil. There is no place for him except the pit of hell. \" if roof is convicted of the june 2015 attack, the 22-year-old plans to represent himself during the penalty phase of the trial, the ap reports.

La occupiers responded with a list of demands that must be met first — including a ban on home foreclosures — but are also planning protests in other areas of the city, the new york times reports. In other occupy news, an occupy xmas splinter movement is calling for a new wave of protests over the holiday season, mediaite reports. According to its website, occupy xmas is not aiming to \"destroy … the great american tradition of christmas, \" but wants activists to protest outside major shopping venues — sometimes dressed as zombies, rt news reports. An earlier incarnation, occupy black friday, inspired protests around the country yesterday — but had nothing to do with a crazed woman who pepper-sprayed fellow shoppers.",

Bush during the aftermath of hurricane katrina. In the lengthy essay, brown seeks to set the record straight as he sees it: he tried to do the right things but was hamstrung by incompetent people on the local, state, and federal levels, and in the media. \" people are still saying now, as they said then, that what went wrong in new orleans a decade ago was all my fault, \" brown writes. \" they were wrong then, and they are wrong now. There were many dark moments in those three weeks on the gulf coast, and fema and the federal government certainly made some mistakes, but perhaps the worst part was being held responsible for the things that i didn't control at all. \" brown names names: he says former new orleans mayor ray nagin's \" incompetence cost lives, \" and he blasts anderson cooper of cnn for an \" isolated, out-of-context rescue \" — cooper found a home with people waiting for help — that established the narrative of rescue efforts being in disarray. He accuses time of a \" defamatory \" hatchet job about his resume, and also hits former sen. Trent lott, gov. Kathleen blanco, and homeland security chief michael chertoff. Most of the piece is devoted to brown defending his decisions and explaining why he didn't have the authority to do what he thought needed to be done. He also includes a regret where both his supporters and detractors will probably find common ground: \" had i left the federal emergency management agency in the spring of 2005, my life would be very different today.

            "When the president flew to the gulf coast on friday, sept. 2, 2005 to inspect the damage and the response efforts, i asked the white house chief of staff for private time with bush when he arrived in alabama to give him a heads up about the problems in new orleans and prepare him to deal with the media — especially for any questions he might get from the white house press corps. I'd kept the white house staff fully informed of the debacle unfolding in louisiana, but i felt compelled to privately inform bush of the difficulties with governor blanco and mayor nagin. The president's schedule included a brief meeting with me before the public briefing and photo op at the air national guard base. But that meeting was cut short and i wasn't able to fully explain the situation to the president. Without warning about the problems we were having in louisiana, he walked into the glare of the cameras.

Hurricane pam taught us too late that louisiana and new orleans were ill prepared. The state's emergency manager was under federal indictment, its emergency operations in disarray. The senator asked why, if we knew from the hurricane pam exercises in july, 2005, that new orleans and louisiana were ill prepared, why we didn't make the necessary changes to policies, procedures, statutes and funding, so that the city and state would be prepared for katrina in august 2005.

At a news conference, the prime minister said flight 370 went off course because of the \" deliberate action by someone on the plane, \" though najib razak did not go so far as to call it a hijacking. Investigators are now taking a closer look at the passengers and crew. What's more, razak revealed that the final signal picked up from the plane came nearly eight hours after takeoff, reports ap. But authorities don't know whether it might have gone north as far as kazakhstan ( which would be tricky given all the land-based radar systems to evade ) or south over the indian ocean. The new york times has details from radar signals suggesting that the plane rose to 45,000 feet, above the normal altitude for a boeing 777-200, just after it disappeared from flight controllers ' radar and turned west. It then dropped to 23,000 feet, below normal, as it passed above the island of penang on malaysia's west coast, before turning yet again to the northwest and rising to a higher altitude as it passed over the strait of malacca. All of which suggests that the plane was being deliberately manipulated. \"everything we have heard is consistent with the plane flying under the control of someone with at least some flying experience, \" an aircraft exec tells the newspaper.",

Unless you need a payphone. #serial, \" vulture reports. As those who are caught up know, the prosecution said adnan syed, the ex-boyfriend convicted of killing lee, made a critical call from a maryland best buy parking lot to tell a friend he'd committed the murder. But in a recent episode, koenig made the argument that the best buy in question may never have had a payphone. The ill-advised joke was retweeted 1,000 times ( including, at least briefly, by serial's twitter account, mashable reports ) before best buy pulled it and apologized, calling the tweet lacking in good judgment.",

Another promising area: pairing antibody drugs with doses of chemo, which results in the chemo getting delivered precisely to the tumor.

In studies being presented saturday, researchers said two experimental drugs by bristol-myers squibb co. Significantly shrank tumors in some patients with advanced skin, lung and kidney cancers. Especially promising was that the drugs worked against several types of cancer, researchers said of the early findings. Most of the patients whose tumors responded significantly to the treatment saw long-term results. The new drugs empower the immune system to recognize cancer cells as an enemy and attack them, although the treatments can have serious side effects. Building a new arsenal against cancer researchers are looking beyond traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatment to new strategies. Targeted therapy: drugs designed to attack specific genetic abnormalities that drive the growth and spread of tumors. When they hit the precise target, the drugs can have dramatic initial results, but tumors often develop resistance. Immunotherapy: drugs or agents not intended to attack tumors but to activate the body's immune system, allowing it to recognize cancer cells as the enemy and attack them.

At a press conference monday with attorney gloria allred, beverly young nelson said moore assaulted her in a restaurant parking lot in 1977, when she was 15 or 16, the hill reports. Nelson said moore, who was the district attorney of etowah county, ala., at the time, offered to drive her home after her shift at a diner but instead drove the car to a dark area of the parking lot and started groping her, pushing her head toward his crotch, and trying to take her shirt off. \" i also thought he was trying to rape me. I had tears running down my face, \" nelson said. At the press conference nelson said she feared retaliation from moore if she ever spoke about the encounter. \"i thought he would do something to me or my family so i decided to keep what happened to myself, \" she said. In a statement released before the press conference, the moore campaign denied \" any sexual misconduct with anyone \" and accused allred of being a \" sensationalist leading a witch hunt, \" the new york times reports. Earlier monday, the chairman of the national republican senatorial committee, sen. Cory gardner, said if moore wins the race, the senate should vote to expel him \" because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the united states senate, \" politico reports.",

University of cambridge scientists surveyed roughly 500,000 britons aged 40 to 69 for their birth dates, height, weight, and the age at which females had their first period, reports the times, per the australian. People born in june, july, and august were heavier at birth and about 1/8 of an inch taller in adulthood than those born in december, january, and february, while women born in summer had their first menstrual cycle weeks after those born in winter; like heavier birth weight, later puberty tends to positively impact health in later life, per a press release. Why the discrepancies? scientists suspect it has to do with the amount of sun exposure mothers received, and thus the amount of vitamin d passed to the fetus, during pregnancy. \" vitamin d is important for bone development and may act as a rate-limiting factor for growth, \" the authors write in the journal heliyon. And while earlier studies have shown a link between birth date and height, \" this is the first time puberty timing has been robustly linked to seasonality, \" says a researcher. Total sunlight exposure led to stronger effects in the later six months of pregnancy, and not in the first three months after birth, which supports the idea of \" fetal programming \": that the environment in the womb can affect a person's health later, per medical news today. Researchers note the study participants were conceived before pregnant women were advised to take vitamin d supplements. ( a lack of vitamin d may have killed this famous composer. )",

According to politico, the leaked executive order would have basically let people, groups, and some businesses claim religious objections in pretty much any situation. Civil liberties groups say the order would have legalized discrimination against lgbt people, cnn reports. If such an executive order is signed thursday — which a senior administration official says is \" definitely possible \" — it would be a big victory for vice president mike pence, whose attempt at religious freedom legislation while governor of indiana went poorly. The aclu and lambda legal say they're prepared to sue trump in federal court if the order he signs is similar to the leaked version. The aclu says the previous order would have violated the establishment clause of the first amendment and the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. Lambda legal says it \" will fight this with everything we have. \" pence and others have been reworking the original version of the order and pressuring trump to sign it. While sources in the administration say lawyers are still tweaking the order's language, one person who's seen it says it's pretty much unchanged from the leaked version. \" the language is very, very strong, \" the source tells politico.",

        "summary": "A study on \" ubiquitous but insidious \" lead exposure is being deemed a \" big deal \" after researchers found a link between lead exposure and the deaths of around a quarter-million americans annually from heart disease. In what usa today says is the first study using a nationally representative sample to look at how low-level lead exposure is tied to deaths in the us, scientists kept tabs on more than 14,000 adults who took a national health survey between 1988 and 1994, then again in 2011. After looking at how many people died during this period — about 4,400 in total, 1,800 of those from cardiovascular disease — the study in the lancet public health journal found about 256,000 deaths each year could be tied to lead exposure. The effects of lead on heart health had previously been thought to be much lower, especially at low levels of lead exposure, study lead author bruce lanphear tells cnn. Dr. Philip landrigan, a mount sinai epidemiologist not involved with the study, explains that lead — which can show up in old water pipes, paint in older homes, industrial sites, plane fuel, and even certain foods — damages blood vessels ' epithelial cells, which then ups the risk of plaque building up, possibly leading to a heart attack. The scientists also looked at all kinds of deaths, not just ones caused by heart disease, and found lead was tied to more than 410,000 us deaths annually — about 10 times more than what was previously believed to be the case, and not far off from the 480,000 smokers who die each year. The good news: today's lead-exposure levels are much lower, meaning the next generation should hopefully see a lower death rate linked to lead. Consumer reports offers some tips to keep you and your family safe. ( there may be lead floating around your local gun range. )",

A new study from the centers for disease control for prevention says most middle and high schools in america are starting classes too early, meaning teenagers aren't getting enough sleep, nbc reports. Less than a fifth of schools start at the recommended 8: 30am or later, according to the cdc, which says teens need 8 hours of sleep a night and going to bed earlier isn't the answer because in puberty, \" biological rhythms commonly shift so that adolescents become sleepy later at night and need to sleep later in the morning. \" the cdc says teens who don't get enough sleep are more likely to be overweight, to struggle in school, and to engage in \" unhealthy risk behaviors \" like drinking and smoking. Pediatrician byron whyte, who admits that he hates mornings, tells forbes that while early start times might be more convenient for schools and parents, in a \" child-centered context, \" he can't think of \" a single advantage to a very early school start time. \" the study found that more than 75 % of schools in alaska have later start times, but no schools at all started at 8: 30am or later in hawaii, mississippi, and wyoming.

        "summary": "Despite its very public failure to protect the data of about 150 million americans, equifax has landed a fat government deal to prevent fraud. Under the $ 7.25 million no-bid contract signed last month, the embattled credit bureau will provide the irs with taxpayer and personal identity verification services, politico reports. The agency says equifax alone is qualified for the job, despite the company's role in one of the worst data breaches ever. The irs defended the move to stick with equifax, saying it has an existing contract for similar services with the company and does not believe equifax poses a risk to irs data. Rep. Earl blumenauer, one of at least two lawmakers who wrote the irs protesting the deal, said that, \" i was initially under the impression that my staff was sharing a copy of the onion, until i realized this story was, in fact, true. \" as news of the deal triggered incredulity on twitter, the company's embattled ex-ceo told a bipartisan house panel on tuesday he was sorry hackers got their hands on so much private information, per the new york times. Richard f. Smith blamed a sole employee for flouting security warnings and failing to perform necessary software updates to keep billions of records safe. ( an equifax rep wouldn't tell the times if the worker was still employed. ) smith, who resigned last week, downplayed the crisis, but lawmakers weren't having it. \" how does this happen? \" asked gop rep. Greg walden. \" i don't think we can pass a law that … fixes stupid. \" ( feds are investigating equifax execs who dumped $ 2 million in stock before the scandal broke. )",

Doctors discovered it had begun to hemorrhage; they couldn't stop the bleeding; and no one thought an operation would be safe. So her family built an altar to the pope outside her home, and during his beatification shortly after her diagnosis, mora was watching the mass and looking at a photo of john paul when, she says, she heard a voice. \" i contemplated the photo of the holy father with his arms extended and i fixed my eyes on him, \" she recalls. \" in this moment, i heard a voice tell me, ' get up, don't be afraid.

Mora, who had also taken part in a religious procession and says she received a sign there of her imminent healing, showed journalists before and after pictures of her brain, the ap reports. She had to undergo more exams in rome so church officials could confirm the miracle. The neurosurgeon who diagnosed her denies the aneurysm was as serious as mora says, reuters reports, but he does find its disappearance \" remarkable, \" and adds, \" i had never seen this in my career. \"",

Bloomberg looked at the numbers and reports on the april slide: 2.2 % for the s&p 500, a drop that hasn't been surpassed since 1929's 2.5 % april fall. On a simple quarter-by-quarter analysis, things don't look so great, either, with equities suffering more than any other quarter's first day since october 2011. Volatility went up, and the s&p 500 fell below its 200-day moving average. What helped send equities \" into a tailspin, \" per bloomberg: china pushing back on tariffs, as well as a sell-off in consumer discretionary and tech stocks apparently driven by president trump's railing against amazon. Marketwatch notes amazon stocks could still be in trouble tuesday in the wake of a vanity fair report that trump plans to keep up his online assault on the company. The new york times assessment: the \" trump bump is becoming the trump slump, \" and the record highs recently achieved are \" done, \" though it adds the market is still up 20 % since trump won the election. Meanwhile, a qma portfolio manager tells cnbc, which reports us stocks have fallen into \" correction territory, \" that volatility fluctuations are \" normal \" and that \" at the end of the day it's got to be earnings that drive the market this year. \" ( trump is said to be \" obsessed \" with amazon. )",

Gilmore's last hurrah, but based on how well he was trending on twitter — apparently because of people trying to figure out who \" jim gilmore \" is — it was also likely his \" finest hour, \" says talking points memo. Perhaps the biggest line, or lines, came from fiorina about hillary clinton. \" she's escaped prosecution more times than el chapo, \" she said. \" perhaps sean penn should interview her. \" also: \" she's probably more qualified for the big house \" than the white house. Business insider rounds them up. Trump was a big theme, with santorum bashing host fox's coverage. \" the entire lead-up to this debate was talking about whether donald trump is going to show up for the next debate, \" he said. The hill has more. Abc rounds up the top five moments, including huckabee's mention of an uber driver named thomas who sent him $ 25.

But americans are making up for it by puffing on far more cigars and pipes. In fact, large-cigar consumption jumped more than 300 %. And pipe tobacco sales skyrocketed by over 600 % from 2008 to 2011, when tax changes made pipe tobacco cheaper than roll-your-own, abc news reports. An interesting tidbit: consumption of small cigars has also dropped, but only because manufacturers have increased their size to make them classified as large cigars that are taxed at a lower rate, the new york times reports.

And while nielson says it would be \" visionary \" for nordic countries to adopt this proposal, which doesn't define how long or how often adults would have to submit to schooling, he's aware there will be critics and \" expects many misgivings, conflicts of interest, and not least major difficulties when it comes to the allocation of costs and rights, \" as the nordic labour journal notes. But he points out the creation of a common nordic workforce in 1954 was a similarly \" out of the box \" move and that having all adults of working age well-trained will help the region remain competitive globally. As for what the 73-year-old nielson himself would study if he had to hit the books again: \" photography or more gardening. \" the nordic council is expected to directly address his proposal in november.",

Jordan had said it was willing to trade al-rishawi, who was sentenced to death for her role in a 2005 hotel bombing, for the captured pilot, but the country demanded to see proof he was still alive. Officials now believe he was already dead when negotiations were taking place, and that the horrific video of the pilot being burned alive in a cage was made on jan. 3, less than two weeks after his capture, reports the new york times. Security sources tell reuters that three other convicted terrorists will also be executed today. The capture of the 26-year-old pilot, a member of an influential tribe in jordan, had led to criticism of king abdullah ii for bringing the country into the us-led anti-isis coalition, but analysts believe the execution will now cause jordan to step up its involvement, the guardian reports.

In what a prime minister's aide calls a warning to syria, turkey's parliament today authorized military operations inside syria, even without the backing of turkey's arab or western allies. The move, which turkey stresses is not a declaration of war, could turn syria's civil conflict into a regional one, the new york times reports. For its part, syria \" has admitted what it did and apologized, \" according to turkey's deputy prime minister. Also in syria: reuters reports that rebels ambushed an army minibus and killed 21 elite republican guards today near damascus. But the rebels are struggling to draw new defectors to their side, the new york times reports. In the early days of the conflict, defections poured in, but they've slowed — leading some opposition commanders to give up on recruiting entirely, while others have been attempting to persuade or even trick syrian military troops into defecting. Some have even been drugged and kidnapped or forced to defect at gunpoint.",

In an interview on cnn's \" new day, \" the arizona republican also weighed in on the gop's infighting that escalated to new heights during the government shutdown. Follow @politicalticker follow @killoughcnn ' i even lost my mother ' mccain said there's no need to worry that another congressional impasse will lead to the same result, even though lawmakers face another set of deadlines in the coming months over the same fiscal issues. \" we're not going to go through the shutdown again. People have been too traumatized by it. There's too much damage, \" he told cnn's kate bolduan. \" we may still have some gridlock, \" he later added. \" maybe we ' ll have continuing resolutions that - we're not going to shut down the government again.

Tomorrow, the irish head to the polls to determine if their nation will be the first on the planet to approve gay marriage by a popular vote, and the ap notes that it's a debate that \" has pit the waning power of the catholic church against the secular-minded government of prime minister enda kenny. \" since cabinet minister leo varadkar came out as gay in january, a steady stream of the nation's political, sporting, and entertainment elite have since publicly followed, or told the tales of gay loved ones in support of the yes equality campaign. \" a yes vote costs the rest of us nothing. A no vote costs our gay children everything, \" former president mary mcaleese said this week, after the former catholic church legal adviser's only son came out. A well-known journalist came out at age 54 this month, writing that \" emotionally, i have been in a prison since the age of 17. \" it's an emotional debate in the deeply catholic country, with \" no \" campaigners raising fears about the plight of children raised by gay couples and the sanctity of marriage. \" two men can't replace a mother's love, \" reads one poster from mothers and fathers matter. The catholic church urged parishioners this weekend to vote against the measure; its bishops released a letter that said it would put \" the union of two men, or two women, on a par with the marriage relationship between a husband and wife which is open to the procreation of children. \" interestingly, dublin's archbishop — called \" politically savvy \" by the ap — urged congregants to examine their consciences, saying, \" the severity with which the irish church treated gay and lesbian people in the past makes it difficult for some to understand the church's position. \" pm kenny, meanwhile, is less coy, calling the referendum an opportunity to \" obliterate, publicly, the remaining barriers of prejudice and the irrational fear of the'them ' and ' us '. \" polls show the measure is likely to pass, though it's by no means a slam dunk as proponents have lost ground this month.",

Mehmet oz's medical advice, she writes at vox.com. Now she's got science to back her up, thanks to a study published in the british medical journal that analyzed health recommendations from oz's syndicated tv talk show, as well as nuggets from the popular the doctors. The researchers found that about half of the suggestions offered by these shows either contradicted what other scientific studies had found or had no verifiable evidence at all to stand behind them, and that potential conflicts of interest were seldom mentioned. The study looked at 40 random episodes from each show — instead of simply, as belluz points out, \" cherrypicking the worst offenders \" — to get the fairest assessment. In general, each episode offered up about a dozen health recommendations, so the researchers were able to cull 479 health tidbits from dr. Oz's show and 445 from the doctors. Most of the shows'suggestions involved dispensing general medical advice, followed by non-weight-loss dietary tips; the doctors professionals tended to repeat the mantra of seeking out a health care provider. But while the benefits of many of the claims were talked about in a general way, specific benefits and magnitude of those benefits, possible drawbacks, and costs were virtually ignored, the study found. The researchers ' conclusion? \" consumers should be skeptical, \" and we should ask ourselves \" whether we should expect medical talk shows to provide more than entertainment. \" ( dr.

        "summary": "Don't want your kid to end up divorced? provide him or her with multiple siblings. A new study suggests that for each additional brother or sister a person has, that person's chances of getting divorced go down by 2 %. But don't go too crazy; the effect wears off after around seven siblings, usa today reports. What could explain the effect? the researchers, who looked at general social survey data from more than 57,000 adults collected between 1972 and 2012, suggest siblings help nurture social skills that later come in handy during married life. Researchers were surprised to find little difference in divorce likelihood between those with no siblings and those with just one or two, us news &amp; world report notes. Of course, \" there are a lot of other factors that affect divorce that are more important than how many siblings you had, \" a co-author says. And other experts on divorce and family size aren't convinced. Two of them call the study \" interesting, \" but say more research is needed. And one adds that only children, these days, have a lot more interaction with the rest of the world. \" we're not in the 1950s, where [ an only child ] might live in a household and mom might stay home and you'd interact all day with an adult, \" he says. \" no kids do that anymore. \"",

            "Tuesday, aug. 13 ( healthday news ) -- the more brothers and sisters you have, the less likely you are to get divorced, a new study contends.

The findings come from an analysis of data collected from about 57,000 people in the united states between 1972 and 2012.

In fact, there are more than 1,200 \" solitary fringe presidential aspirants, \" as kevin hogan calls them in the atlantic, even though most of them will likely never make their way onto a state ballot. It's not hard to become a potus contender, hogan explains: all a candidate has to do is complete and send in forms found on the federal election commission's website. But whether you throw your lot in as a republican ( almost 200 of them so far ), democrat ( more than 130 ), another party, or as an independent, you can, \" for the rest of your life … claim, ' i ran for president! ' even if you only got 15 votes in new hampshire, \" a former senior legal analyst for cnn tells the magazine. There are way more contenders this time around than in the last election, which counted just under 420 applicants. The atlantic notes the publicity garnered by mr. Nuts may have upped interest in the gig, though many are obviously jokes — unless mickey mouse and the tom brady sketch really are making a serious run for the white house — and some are concentrating on decidedly niche agendas: for example, a democrat who contacted hogan has a foreign policy that revolves around swimming pools due to the heat exhaustion she's experienced. But then there are the ostensibly serious candidates who got \" acrimonious \" with hogan after getting pressed about their runs, including a 74-year-old man who says he first got a vision of becoming president when he was 4. \" i write books, \" he told hogan. \" i have a giant sense of words, world orders, and word hors oeuvres [ sic ] — a new word order.

The facebook campaign set up by silicon valley couple charlotte and dave willner — \" reunite an immigrant parent with their child \" — has as of this writing pulled in $ 3.95 million since saturday morning. Money reports the couple was moved to do something by this image of a young girl. \" it was the closest thing we could do to hugging that kid, \" dave tells the san jose mercury news, which notes the willners have a 2-year-old girl. All proceeds go to raices, a texas nonprofit that provides immigrants and refugees with pro bono legal representation. The campaign had a modest start, with the former facebook employees, who now work at pinterest and airbnb, hoping to raise just $ 1,500 in order to bail out one parent. Jenny hixon of raices explains to usa today just what a windfall the money is: \" our fundraising infrastructure is spartan. We have one development person on staff, which is me... And i ' m also responsible for overseeing our shelter, volunteer operations, media, community outreach, and refugee resettlement. \" still, money notes that its website states it managed to close 51,000 immigration cases last year. Now, raices is hustling to partner with other like-minded organizations in the state so that every federal court there is covered; it's also creating a database of separated families. \" this feels outrageously ambitious, \" says hixon, \" but we kind of feel like this is the moment to do the big things. \" politico notes both mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg have donated undisclosed amounts to the campaign.

A month after the election, republican incumbent pat mccrory conceded defeat as a recount was winding down, reports the news &amp; observer. Mccrory gave in monday afternoon when it became clear that he had no chance of overcoming cooper's slim lead of about 10,000 votes. The loss is an especially stinging one not only because donald trump carried the state, but because mccrory now has the distinction of being the first governor in state history to lose a bid for re-election. As the ap notes, a controversial law he signed into place that restricted lgbt rights played a role. Among other things, house bill 2 requires transgender people in schools and federal buildings to use restrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate, and the majority of state residents opposed it. Cooper has called for its repeal, though republicans control both houses of the state legislature. On that note, politico floats the possibility that mccrory may try to add two conservative justices to the state supreme court before he leaves office and thus end the court's liberal majority. The legislature has a special session planned in which that could happen, though its stated purpose is hurricane relief.",

In january of 1919, 2.3 million gallons of molasses burst out of an enormous holding tank in boston's north end, and a wave described as 40 feet high covered the waterfront at an astonishing 35 miles per hour, leveling buildings, toppling cars, and drowning people and horses in its wake, reports the new york times. ( in all, 21 people were killed and 150 injured. ) scientists announced at an american physical society meeting this month that the goo moved quickly at first but then hardened as it cooled, which slowed the wave but also attempts to rescue the dozens of people stuck. \" for the first 30 to 60 seconds or so, according to our calculations, that wave would have moved a lot like a tsunami, if you could imagine that, \" aerospace engineer nicole sharp tells the cbc. But then the viscous nature of molasses would have come into play, turning the fast-moving wave into something more like a \" seeping. \" people in its path had little chance to escape. Sharp says she initially couldn't fathom the speed. But \" i realized that because the molasses is one and a half times denser than water and there was so much of it in this tank, in fact, fluid dynamics and the physics equations predict that it would move at speeds that are... Totally in line with what the historical record says. \" unfortunately for those nearby, it was the perfect, sticky storm. ( earlier this year, a worker died in a molasses tank in the us. )",

            "Santa cruz ( kron ) — the santa cruz community continues to mourn the death of 8-year-old maddy middleton. She was allegedly kidnapped and killed by a 15-year-old neighbor she knew and trusted. Kron 4's alecia reid was at the district attorney's office monday night, where we are learning the suspect, adrian gonzalez may be tied to a death threat in 2014. \"crippling anxiety \" are the words adrian gonzalez used to describe himself on his instagram page prior to his arrest. Kron 4 visited his page before it was it was deleted, and on it, the 15-year-old said \"wears all black to try and look powerful … and hide the crippling anxiety towards the future, and the constant worry that i ' ll never find someone who loves me. \" in november, an unnamed individual sent a threatening email to santa cruz high school, claiming a high-powered rifle would be used to kill fellow students in the cafeteria. Gonzalez was a sophomore there. A day after the threat, someone anonymously reached out to the santa cruz sentinel newspaper claiming responsibility but said he was not \"homicidal, just a thrill seeker \". That person also said he was wracked with guilt and had \"crippling anxiety. \" that is the same phrase the teenager used on his instagram page."

These are all reactions you ' ll spot in a youtube video documenting a mexico city subway experiment that definitely caught commuters ' attention. In what's described as an empathy-building campaign, the city's government teamed up with un women to create the #noesdehombres campaign ( per the new york times, that translates to \" this isn't manly \" ), created to show how women regularly deal with sexual harassment. In the \" experimento asiento \" ad by the j. Walter thompson agency, the camera shows what happens when people riding the mexico city subway spy a repurposed seat, with the top half designed to look like a male torso, the bottom half like a penis, right where someone would sit. A sign in front of the seat reads: \" it is annoying to travel this way, but not compared to the sexual violence women suffer in their daily commutes. \" \" we need to make clear that [ harassment ] is violent, not flattering, \" ana guemez, the director of the mexican un women office, tells the times, which notes the goal was to put the onus on men for this behavior, not on women. Various surveys show women in mexico in general ( and in mexico city specifically ) are prone to feeling unsafe or reporting they were groped or harassed while on public transportation. The bbc notes the video, which has so far been viewed more than 1.7 million times, is receiving mixed reaction, with some hailing it and others calling it sexist. \" it's important not to stigmatize all men as violent and potential attackers of women, \" says the chief of a mexican group working to educate men on sexual harassment. J. Walter thompson also created a second ad showing men's butts. ( a mexican man was acquitted of sexual assault because a judge found no proof of \" desire. \" )",

        "summary": "\" rhabdomyolysis and bilateral peroneal and tibial neuropathies \" are as uncomfortable as they sound, and they can be caused by wearing skinny jeans for the wrong jobs, doctors say. According to a case study in the journal neurology, neurosurgery &amp; psychiatry, an australian woman who wore skinny jeans while helping a family member move — a job that involved hours squatting on the floor emptying cupboards — ended up hospitalized and unable to walk for four days, npr reports. The 35-year-old had apparently ignored increasing discomfort but ultimately \" noticed bilateral foot drop and foot numbness \" that led her to trip and fall while walking home, per the study. She was stranded for hours until someone found her and called an ambulance. A press release explains her calves were swollen to such a degree that her jeans had to be cut off; she didn't have normal movement in her ankles and toes, and the feeling was gone from her lower legs and feet. Doctors discovered she had muscle and nerve damage, apparently caused by reduced blood supply to the leg muscles. Dr. Thomas kimber of the royal adelaide hospital tells the ap that the long periods of squatting in the tight jeans caused a surprisingly severe amount of damage of a kind that hasn't been linked to skinny jeans before, although the woman was able to walk after four days and later made a full recovery. He says part of the problem with the jeans could be their \" non-stretchy nature, \" which leads to nerves and muscles being squeezed. ( the jeans can cause another problem. )",
