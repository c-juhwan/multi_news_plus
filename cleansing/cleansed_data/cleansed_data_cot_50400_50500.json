            "The american consumer got a surprise gift this holiday season: the dramatic collapse in the price of oil. The trend has sent gas prices down to a national average of under $ 2.20 per gallon, with rates under $ 2 per gallon in some states. The benefits of cheap gas are widespread, though the price declines are more of a mixed bag for economies in u.s. States with large energy sectors.

        "summary": "In may, the first fresh cup of coffee was brewed on the international space station. Today, iss astronauts will enjoy another fresh debut: a meal made with the first food grown in outer space. On the menu will be a salad made out of microgravity-grown romaine lettuce, washed with a citric acid sanitizer before the dinner bell, sky news reports. Half of the lettuce will be devoured by the crew, while the other half will head back to earth so scientists on the ground can check it out. Growing the red lettuce — nicknamed outredgeous by nasa scientists — was no small feat, the escapist notes: when there's zero gravity, water doesn't seep into the soil, dirt can just float away, there's limited sunlight, and the roots don't know which way to grow since there's no traditional \" up \" or \" down. \" the astronauts overcame these challenges by packing special \" pillows \" with soil, seeds, and stakes to help guide root and plant growth, per the escapist; the pillows were then placed underneath blue, red, and green led lights — the green light to turn the romaine the dark-red color that people are accustomed to, sky notes ( check out the nasa video that further explains the process ). There are some fringe benefits from space-garden fare other than a delicious meal: a nasa behavioral health scientist tells sky that gardening could help astronauts cut their stress levels, while a kennedy space center scientist says that \" having fresh food … in space could have a positive impact on people's moods and also could provide some protection against radiation, \" per zme science.

        "summary": "John kerry had to backpedal after he suggested that israel was on the path to becoming an apartheid state, and that's a sad commentary about the level of candor we have on the topic of our mideast ally, writes paul waldman at the washington post. Kerry didn't say israel was an apartheid state, he said it could become one — and that happens to be true, writes waldman. Given current birth rates, the number of palestinians will eventually exceed the number of israelis, meaning \" you have a minority government ruling over a majority population without citizenship rights. \" others have made this point before, but kerry took immediate flak from pro-israel groups and lawmakers, who seem more concerned with making sure \" all public officials are being sufficiently ' pro-israel ' in their every utterance \" than with making actual progress in negotiations, writes waldman. It's tantamount to censorship. At bloomberg, jeffrey goldberg writes that he has used the word \" apartheid \" himself in writing about israel's potential future — laying the blame on the settlement movement — though he spells out the reasons why he no longer uses the volatile term. For starters, \" deployment of the word doesn't start conversations, it ends them, \" he writes. Still, he's not going to criticize kerry. \" israeli leaders must open their minds to the possibility that he has their long-term interests at heart. \" click for goldberg's full column. Or for waldman's full column.",

Now the ex-naacp head is speaking out, telling vanity fair that she still identifies and connects with the \" black experience, \" and that her physical appearance is simply a manifestation of that connection. \" it's not a costume, \" she tells writer allison samuels, who corresponded with dolezal for a month with \" friendly \" phone calls, emails, and a visit to spokane, wash. \" it's not something that i can put on and take off anymore. … i've had my years of confusion and wondering who i really [ was ] … but i ' m not confused about that any longer. I think the world might be — but i ' m not. \" part of that confusion still swirls around what she considers herself in terms of race — and as samuels puts it, \" dolezal's claim on black womanhood still seems to be non-negotiable. \" to wit: \" it's taken my entire life to negotiate how to identify, and i've done a lot of research and a lot of studying, \" she tells samuels. \" i didn't mislead anybody; i didn't deceive anybody. If people feel misled or deceived, then sorry that they feel that way, but i believe that's more due to their definition and construct of race in their own minds than it is to my integrity or honesty … i wouldn't say i ' m african american, but i would say i ' m black, and there's a difference in those terms. \" samuels calls this a \" peculiar defense \" and also calls out dolezal for her \" i never misled \" statements by pointing out how dolezal ided a black man as her dad on facebook — \" a move that could only be characterized as misleading. \" dolezal, meanwhile, blames the whole brouhaha on timing, saying if she had simply had conversations with people and explained herself before she was exposed, none of this would have happened.

        "summary": "The french artist paul gauguin may be best known for his paintings — one of which sold just this month for $ 300 million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a work of art — but the printmaking he worked on toward the end of his life in the early 1900s is turning out to be so complicated and experimental that art conservators are \" blown away \" by the new findings, reports northwestern university. Computer scientist oliver s. Cossairt, who announced the findings in san jose over the weekend, worked with art conservation specialists at the art institute of chicago to reveal gauguin's surprising techniques, including layering, transferring, and re-using imagery. Since september, the team has been analyzing 19 of the artist's prints at the art institute — the most in-depth analysis being of the work \" nativity ( mother and child surrounded by five figures ), \" completed in 1902 a year before gauguin's death — using a process that dates back to the 1980s called photometric stereo. It entails taking a sequence of photos from a fixed camera while light on the subject jumps to a new position. Software then helps separate out color from surface shape to detail the paper's topography. Cossairt tells newsweek the process is \" simple \" but still \" labor intensive, \" with 20 million pixels processed for each print. One finding: gauguin made white lines by drawing on an ink surface, thereby removing the ink, and transferred the resulting lines to the print.

The taliban now controls more territory than at any point since 2001, and united nations officials say the kabul government is struggling to deal with the influx of returning refugees from pakistan, which has been pushing for afghan refugees to return home, the washington post reports. More than 800,000 refugees have returned from pakistan and iran so far this year, and tens of thousands more are expected to be sent back from the european union in the near future, reports voice of america. The return of tens of thousands of refugees every month while the taliban conflict creates more \" will add very much to the vicious cycle of insecurity and joblessness, \" afghan analyst bashir bezhen tells the post. He warns that the government appears \" incapable of creating jobs for these people or of improving the economy in the remote places where they live, \" meaning unemployed youths will be recruited by militants, pushing the country further into crisis. The un says only 13 % of its appeal for $ 150 million has been raised, and afghanistan faces a humanitarian crisis as winter approaches.

        "summary": "\" in most cases where human remains have been found in connection with … scenes of brutal violence, the bodies have been buried in mass graves. This is not the case at sandby borg, \" write the authors of a new study published in the journal antiquity. The swedish site, found on the island of öland in the baltic sea, was a once-thriving village that in the mid-fifth century was wiped out by attackers — who left the bodies to decompose where they fell. The guardian reports that after excavations over three years, just 10 % of sandby borg, located within the walls of a ring fort, has been uncovered. Archaeologists had been warned treasure seekers were messing with the site, and for good reason: roman gold coins, silver hair pieces, and glass beads have been found, likely left behind because they were hidden, and \" no one lived who knew of them and could recover them, \" archaeologist ludvig papmehl-dufay tells live science. But the more noteworthy finds were those of a more gruesome nature. Papmehl-dufay says no oral or written history of the massacre survived, but the 26 bodies thus far uncovered do tell a tale. The archaeologists believe there were a \" large number \" of attackers who struck \" simultaneously in several houses, and that several of the victims were not in a position to defend themselves. \" in one case, the remains of an elderly man were found with a smashed skull and charred pelvic bones, likely the result of him falling into an open fire after taking the blow to the head. Papmehl-dufay says the island was home to at least 15 forts ( archaeology.com notes \" borg \" means \" fort \" ) at the time, and speculates that \" another elite group on the island, possibly connected to another fort, \" may have been behind the attack.

The russian court moved the hearing following a band member's announcement in court today that a disagreement had prompted her to fire her lawyers. Yekaterina samutsevich said she'd found a new lawyer but hasn't signed a contract with the attorney, the ap reports. Prosecutors accused samutsevich of seeking to delay the legal process. The russian orthodox church yesterday changed its tune on the case, calling for clemency for the political punk rockers if they're willing to repent. But their lawyers say there's no way the band members will acknowledge guilt, the bbc reports. If the church means \" repentance in the sense of a crime... It definitely won't happen. Our clients won't admit guilt. A call for that is pointless, \" says one.",

        "summary": "Thoughts can be deadly. So posits new research published this week in the journal cell investigating the link between brain activity and tumor growth. Specifically, researchers at stanford found that activity in the cerebral cortex promoted the growth of high-grade gliomas; they account for four out of every five malignant brain tumors, and a stanford press release notes survival rates for those with the cancer have barely budged in the last three decades. To test the suspected link, the researchers implanted human glioma tumors into the brains of lab mice and then used light to increase brain-cell activity adjacent to those tumors. That increase did spur faster tumor growth, and the behavioral relationship — in which an organ's \" primary function \" fuels a tumor — is an unusual one. As lead author michelle monje puts it, \" we don't think about... Breathing promoting the growth of lung cancer. \" monje has spent more than a decade studying diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or dipg, which exacts a cruel toll: it typically strikes around age 6, and it afflicts some 200 american kids each year; most are dead within nine months. ( earlier this month, the new jersey record shared the story of a family who donated 6-year-old lily larue anderson's tumor to monje's team upon the girl's death; her battle with dipg lasted 11 months. ) a neuro-oncologist not involved in the study tells npr that monje's findings have \" potential implications across the entire family of gliomas in the brain... Not just pediatric tumors \" and could lead to new treatments. Monje tells npr one route that's not an option: using sedatives to reduce brain activity. \" we don't want to stop people with brain tumors from thinking or learning or being active. \" ( will tiny balls of gold help improve cancer treatments? )",

            "Monje's team identified a specific protein, called neuroligin-3, which is largely responsible for the increase in tumor growth associated with neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex. Neuroligin-3 had similar effects across the different types of high-grade gliomas, in spite of the fact that the four cancers have different molecular and genetic characteristics. \"to see a microenvironmental factor that affects all of these very distinct classes of high-grade gliomas was a big surprise, \" monje said. The identity of the factor was also unexpected. In healthy tissue, neuroligin-3 helps to direct the formation and activity of synapses, playing an important role in the brain's ability to remodel itself. The new study showed that a secreted form of neuroligin-3 promotes tumor growth. \"this group of tumors hijacks a basic mechanism of neuroplasticity, \" monje said. Using light stimulation to conduct the study, monje's team employed optogenetics, a stanford-developed technique that uses genetic manipulation to insert light-sensitive proteins into specific neurons, allowing the neurons to be activated with the flip of a light switch.

Media outlets report 32-year-old benjamin taylor of cottageville was charged with first-degree murder after the girl died of her injuries at a hospital wednesday. Taylor is the boyfriend of the victim's mother, but isn't the child's father. He was initially charged monday with first-degree sexual assault. A criminal complaint shows the baby had extensive bleeding. The complaint says the injuries indicated a violent sexual assault, as well as shaking or striking of the face.

            "A petition to publicly hang benjamin taylor, the west virginia man accused of brutally sexually assaulting a 10-month-old girl who died this week, was removed from the white house's website friday after receiving tens of thousands of signatures. The website did not specify a reason beyond stating that the petition violated its terms of participation. It was not immediately clear when the petition was taken down, but it had received at least 50,000 signatures before being removed. The petition on the white house's \"we the people \" calling for taylor to be publicly hanged was posted tuesday by a person identified as \"j.r. \" the petitioner wrote: \"prison is too good for child rapists and their ilk. I would move to say that our 'justice system ' is even a part of the problem, in that incarceration is hardly justice when it comes to such an awful act … let us hang these creatures publicly. Let us make examples of them, and allow the american people to attend these hangings so that the accused may be ridiculed. \" had the petition received the required 100,000 signatures by nov. 4, the white house would have had to issue",

Having married military police officer charles gaytan in early 2016, kayla gaytan learned just a week later that she had hodgkins lymphoma, and endured months of chemotherapy before the cancer went into remission. At that point, however, doctors told her it was unlikely that she'd be able to have kids after the grueling treatment, reports people. When they learned just a few weeks later they were expecting four — conceived naturally — the couple \" couldn't believe it, \" kayla gaytan says. All was going well until, 28 weeks into the pregnancy, she was told she'd need more chemo, and urgently. Initially, when charles gaytan started up a gofundme page to help cover their medical bills, he set a goal of $ 5,000, and they were surprised to see it gradually tick past $ 18,000. Then, after the family appeared on fox news last week, the floodgates opened; the eagle post reports that the story went viral in minutes, with several hundred thousand dollars donated in the first few hours. Now, a few days later, more than 16,000 people have donated more than $ 1.13 million, which includes one anonymous donation of $ 8,000. \" our family has truly been humbled and amazed by the kindness of people, \" says kayla gaytan, who has been given a 50-50 chance of surviving five years. \" we're just in shock. \" ( a 65-year-old woman went through in vitro fertilization to add quads to her 13 children. )",

By the time the news came out yesterday, joel was already recovering, and the 28-year-old daughter of billy joel and christie brinkley says in a statement that she's fine and just feels bad about the show: \" i was excited and determined to fulfill my final performance and i really wanted to end my run with a bang, but this was not what i had in mind. \" her rep tells people joel was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope, a condition that causes fainting by blocking bloodflow to the brain. Page six notes that the condition is typically harmless, and e! reports that joel will not need treatment. She's passed out at a show once before, when she fainted backstage in 2006. Then, in 2009, she made headlines after a suicidal overdose scare ( though she later insisted it was neither a suicide attempt nor an overdose ). Most recently, she was in the news earlier this month when the media noticed that she looks quite different nowadays ( see a before-and-after comparison here ) and rumors of plastic surgery surfaced. But joel put those to bed, insisting all she's ever had done is a nose job.",

Richard patterson believes jack the ripper, who killed five london prostitutes over 10 weeks in 1888, was actually poet francis thompson. According to the mirror, patterson read a book of thompson's poetry in 1997 and became convinced he was the legendary killer. He's spent the years since attempting to prove his theory. \" soon before and soon after the murders, he wrote about killing female prostitutes with knives, \" patterson says. And the daily news quotes a graphic short story by thompson about a woman being stabbed to death. In addition to thompson's grisly writings, patterson points to his experience as a surgeon and his troubled relationship with a local prostitute, the mirror reports. Patterson says thompson kept a dissecting knife under his coat and knew a rare surgical procedure that was used to mutilate some of the victims. He also lived with a prostitute with whom he began a romantic relationship. When that relationship ended, patterson says thompson \" snapped. \" \" i ' m excited that people are beginning to take the theory seriously, \" says patterson, who is publishing it in a book. The jack the ripper case was eventually closed in 1892, and thompson died 15 years later, according to the christian science monitor. In the years since the slayings, scholars, amateur sleuths, and others have identified up to 100 suspects. ( this hollywood director thinks jack the ripper was actually a popular singer. )",

The former al-qaeda branch — booted last year for disobeying osama bin laden successor ayman al-zawahiri — is attracting money and recruits that have helped it spread from afghanistan to west africa, even as an al-qaeda group in pakistan sold its laptops and cars to pay for food and rent last year, a former member tells the guardian. Zawahiri \" operates solely based on the allegiance. There is no organizational structure, \" says jihadi scholar abu muhammad al-maqdisi. Abu qatada, a preacher deported from the uk to jordan to face terror charges in 2013, agrees zawahiri is \" isolated \" and lacks \" direct military or operational control. \" he blames isis, which he calls a \" cancerous growth \" within the jihadi movement. The guardian reports al-qaeda's downfall began with zawahiri's ascension after bin laden's death. Zawahiri was forced to hide out near the afghanistan-pakistan border while fighters that would eventually form isis came together in syria and iraq. \" what is leadership, \" asks an al-qaeda associate, \" if your leader is in afghanistan and your soldiers are in iraq? \" insiders say isis, which won't accept another jihadi group in its territory, is winning the propaganda war as well as the war on the ground.

Though he is little known in the west, maqdisi's importance in the canon of radical islamic thought is unrivalled by anyone alive. The 56-year-old palestinian rose to prominence in the 1980s, when he became the first significant radical islamic scholar to declare the saudi royal family were apostates, and therefore legitimate targets of jihad. At the time, maqdisi's writings were so radical that even osama bin laden thought they were too extreme.

In an interview, sandford told agents he wanted to shoot trump and was prepared to die at the hands of police in the assassination attempt, according to the criminal complaint. Sandford was charged with an act of violence on restricted grounds and was assigned a court-appointed attorney. He has not yet entered a plea and was denied bail after a judge said he was a flight risk and posed a threat to the community. \" there may be some issues regarding the mental health of the defendant, \" the judge said during a court hearing monday, while sandford appeared to tremble in his seat. A public defender said sandford previously attempted suicide and once ran away from a hospital in england. Still, she believes he's competent to stand trial.",

The latest on blue ivy carter: the hospital where beyoncé gave birth denies rumors that she and jay-z paid $ 1.3 million to rent out an entire floor, and tells tmz the family paid the \" standard rate \" for an \" executive suite. \" but that doesn't mean the birth wasn't swank: the new york daily news notes that people were seen carrying takeout and lots of red wine into the wing on saturday night. The baby's life will also be swank: according to australia's news network, bey and jay have already spent $ 1 million on baby items including a swarovski crystal-studded high chair, a solid gold rocking horse, and a mini bugatti. Us adds that they also purchased a $ 3,500 lucite crib. Blue may not have been born on her own private floor of the hospital, but she does already have her own security detail, a family friend tells the huffington post. And controversy over that security continues: more patients complain to the new york times that they were kept from the neonatal unit, and tmz reports that a group of new mothers is considering filing a lawsuit against the hospital. Beyoncé and jay-z released an official statement on their daughter's birth yesterday, giving the world a little bit of tmi with their announcement that she was \" delivered naturally \" in an \" emotional \" birth. Of course, not everyone can just let them be happy with what they called \" the best experience of both of our lives. \" conspiracy theories abound, with bloggers speculating that beyoncé actually used a surrogate, and sandrarose.com reports that the singer wasn't even in the room when the surrogate gave birth.

A government statement said the 10 women who were issued licenses already held driving licenses from other countries, including the us, uk, lebanon, and canada. They took a brief driving test and eye exam before being issued the licenses at the general department of traffic in the capital, riyadh, the ap reports. A video of the first woman receiving her license quickly went viral on twitter, al arabiya reports. Other women across the country have been preparing for the right to drive on june 24 by taking driving courses on female-only college campuses. Some are even training to become drivers for ride hailing companies like uber. Saudi women had long complained of having to hire costly male drivers, use taxis, or rely on male relatives to get to work and run errands. The surprise move to issue some women licenses early came as activists who had campaigned for the right to drive remain under arrest, facing possible trial. Saudi arabia's prosecutor said sunday that 17 people had been detained in recent weeks on suspicion of trying to undermine security and stability, a case activists said targeted prominent women's rights campaigners. The prosecutor's statement said eight have been temporarily released, while five men and four women remain under arrest. Among the women held since may 15 are loujain al-hathloul, aziza al-yousef and eman al-nafjan, according to people with knowledge of the arrests. The three are among the most outspoken and well-known women's rights activists in saudi arabia.",

The social network is working with a developer to build a 394-unit rental community within walking distance of company headquarters, the wall street journal reports. And the 630,000-square-foot \" anton menlo \" certainly sounds like a place anyone would want to call home: amenities include an on-site cafe and sports pub; a pet spa, dog park, and doggy day care; a yoga and training facility and other wellness services; a resort-like pool, rooftop deck, spa, and cabana; and, of course, a bicycle repair shop. The nearly 10-acre property is a redevelopment of industrial land, cnet reports. A facebook rep says the $ 120 million project wasn't designed as an effort to retain employees ( \" we believe that people work at facebook because what they do is rewarding and they believe in our mission \" ), but that some employees had in fact asked for help finding places to live. Real estate prices are going up fast in silicon valley, and there's currently a housing shortage in menlo park. But the development can only house about 10 % of the local employees at most, and most of the units will be open to non-employees as well. The development will include 208 one-bedroom apartments, 139 two-bedrooms, 35 studios, and 12 three-bedrooms; it won't be complete for at least two years.

        "summary": "If you've ever wished you could burn a fair amount of calories just by sitting around, and you don't mind that just-jumped-into-a-swimming-pool feeling, a nasa scientist may have a solution: his cold shoulder calorie burning vest. Dr. Wayne hayes, who has studied both ice and the effects mild cold exposure have on calorie burn, designed the vest to take advantage of the body's tendency to try to warm itself in cold conditions. He tells the chicago tribune that wearing a freezing-cold vest may not be the only way to expose oneself to mild cold conditions, but it sure beats the pants off, say, running nearly nude in february, which he calls neither comfortable nor practical. But apparently a $ 199.99 vest with ice packs that feels \" just like jumping into a pool \" is a no-brainer, and earlier this year 1,524 backers raised an astronomical $ 281,319 for hayes ' idea on kickstarter. ( he originally asked for $ 13,500, reports cnet. ) hayes recommends wearing it for 60 to 90 minutes twice a day. A handful of testimonials from early cold shoulder testers suggest enticing results, but a larger sample size is about to put the vest to the test now that the first kickstarter orders shipped out in september. Being a scientist, hayes wants to make one thing perfectly clear: \" let's be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and the cold shoulder is no exception to that rule. The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. \" the vest, he proposes, is simply a way to accelerate calorie burn for those already eating well and exercising. ( is veganism the best weight-loss diet? )",

And plenty of scientists — stephen hawking included — fear that humankind may end up on the losing side of a meeting with extraterrestrials. Now a couple of astronomers from columbia university have put forth an idea they say could keep aliens from locating earth in the first place: use giant lasers to hide the planet. The paper by david kipping and alex teachy was published in the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society on march 31. ( \" despite the timing, \" the society's executive director tells afp, \" it's really not an april fool's joke. \" ) kipping and teachy's idea centers on the transit method, which is how humans, via nasa's kepler spacecraft, search for habitable planets, reports space.com. It involves detecting dips in the brightness of a star caused when an orbiting planet moves directly in front of it. A giant laser or group of lasers would \" fill in the missing starlight, \" teachy says in a video outlining the idea. Depending on how thoroughly you wanted to conceal the earth, it would take anywhere from 30 to 250 megawatts emitted for 10 hours, once a year. Lasers can even be used to cancel out attributes \" such as oxygen, \" teachy says in a press release, to make earth appear to be a \" dead world. \" but their idea could also be applied in reverse: the sun's light could be manipulated as we passed in such a way that would make it clear something artificial was happening, signaling our presence.

It examines potential changes in the premiums paid by medicare beneficiaries under a payment approach that caps federal contributions per beneficiary based on the cost of the second lowest-bidding private plan or traditional medicare, whichever is lower in their area. Under this approach, beneficiaries can choose among competing plans, but if they enroll in a more costly plan, for whatever reason, they would pay the additional premiums themselves. This differs from the current medicare system, in which beneficiaries generally pay the same medicare premium regardless of where they live, whether they choose traditional medicare or a private plan, or whether they live in a high-cost or low-cost area.

The mixed-breed pup was set to be put down that day, but a backlog meant his number was never called. Pwj took him in and trained him, and the group's efforts paid off recently: he made his first recovery amid the rubble of japanese landslides that killed dozens in mid-august, reports the asahi shimbun, as spotted by gawker. Yumenosuke wasn't a natural when he first started his rescue-and-recovery schooling: he wasn't assertive or overly curious, both necessary traits for the job, notes the paper. Over time, however, he gained confidence and learned to follow directions as he accrued experience performing mountain searches. When he made his first official find on aug. 20 in the yagi section of hiroshima, yumenosuke didn't raise a ruckus by barking: he simply fixed his gaze on a pile of lumber and didn't take it off until his handler checked out the pile. Sadly, a man's body was found under the wood, but yumenosuke had done his job. \" a dog abandoned by people is now rescuing them, \" his handler tells the paper. \"it is proof that yumenosuke deserves to live. \" ( in the us, a pit bull is being hailed as a hero. )",

Carly fiorina, who used to be the terrible ceo of hewlett packard, until she was forced out, has decided to run for senate as a republican, based on her extensive lack of political experience and longtime commitment to not voting in any elections.

Her body was found 17 months after she vanished, buried under a neighbor's porch, but the search for her killer eventually went cold, the ap reports. Now her mom, carolyn touisgnant, may finally have answers after a man called a local news station and confessed. Jose ferreira, 50, called wisn 12 on oct. 11 and described exactly what had happened on that march day. \" his story was very detailed — disturbingly so, \" the station's newsroom director told the ap; he says the station called cops because of \" several red flags, \" leading to ferreira's arrest on second-degree murder charges. Ferreira had also apparently called a crisis line and told an acquaintance about his crime, though it's still unclear why he came forward now. A more recent wisn 12 story says ferreira confessed to cops that when he was 17, carrie ann changed her mind about making out with him at a house party, so he shoved her down a flight of stairs, breaking her neck. He said he buried her body under the porch and then denied knowing anything about it for the past three decades, even after her body had been found. \" she spent two of her birthdays underneath that porch, \" touisgnant says, per the ap, adding that she sometimes still blames herself because she let carrie ann walk home from school that day instead of picking her up. Still, there's some peace in the prospect of getting justice. \" everytime [ i'd ] watch cold case or some other detective show, i would hope and pray one of these days [ we'd ] get the person who did that to carrie, \" she says, adding to wisn 12: \" now he's gonna pay for what he did to her. \" ( is this the 20th century's most baffling cold case? )",

        "summary": "Kissing a frog may not conjure a prince, but mucus from one colorful indian variety could one day lead to new ways to fight off the flu, the verge reports. A study published in the journal immunity details how scientists tested secretions from an indian frog known as hydrophylax bahuvistara and found that one distinct peptide was able to kill certain strains of the influenza virus without simultaneously decimating human red blood cells, as well as protect mice from the h1n1 strain. That molecule, called urumin, is named after the indian \" urumi \" sword that looks and acts like a whip and is found in the country's kerala region, which is also where this particular frog hails from. The scientists involved in the study first collected mucus from the frogs by applying slight electrical shocks to them, which causes them to secrete the substance, phys.org notes. From there, the researchers were able to pit 32 peptides in the mucus against various flu strains and discovered that four of the peptides were effective flu fighters, a significant statistical find that co-author joshy jacob says nearly caused him to be \" knocked off my chair. \" however, three of those molecules also destroyed human red blood cells, leaving just the urumin, which attached itself to a protein in the h1n1 strain called hemagglutinin. The urumin clung to the hemagglutinin as it set to work attacking the virus. The molecule doesn't appear to be a flu panacea — it didn't effectively fight off a current strain called h3n2, for example — but the researchers note its \" potential to contribute to first-line anti-viral treatments \" in an increasingly drug-resistant environment.

Of course, someone like ned stark would say the same thing about his sword. But the indian martial art of kalaripayattu has both of them beat with the urumi, a sword that acts like a whip. The urumi hasn't regularly been used as an actual weapon for generations, but even as a demonstration weapon, it is still incredibly dangerous. Especially to the user. The urumi ( which can be translated as \"curving sword, \" and is also known as a \"chuttuval \" ), hails from southern india. The historic weapon was saved from the erasure of time when it was incorporated into kalaripayattu martial arts, an indian fighting style that is considered one of the oldest in the world. Incorporating elements of yoga and performative dance, kalaripayattu movements look like violent but graceful choreography. Urumi fighting is no different, it is just far more dangerous to those who would attempt to learn the skill. Sparring with dual-bladed urumi. ( photo: zzvet/shutterstock.com ) like any sword, the urumi comes in a number of varieties, with a variable length, and even a variable number of blades, but they all follow the same basic construction."

Speaking to the annual values voter summit on saturday in washington, matt bevin said he was asked if the country could ever recover if clinton were elected president. \" i do think it would be possible, but at what price? at what price? the roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what? the blood, of who? the tyrants to be sure, but who else.

I have nine children. It breaks my heart to think it might be their blood that is needed to redeem something, to reclaim something that we through our apathy and indifference have given away. \" per the lexington herald leader, bevin continued, \" i want us to be able to fight ideologically, mentally, spiritually, economically, so that we don't have to do it physically. But that may, in fact, be the case. \" the comments are starting to get quite a bit of attention: democrats condemned bevin's remarks, with one candidate for congress calling for bevin's impeachment. However, any impeachment attempt would be unlikely, as the heavily republican state senate would have to vote to convict the governor. Amid that and other blowback, bevin's office provided a statement saying he was speaking about the sacrifice required of members of the military: \" today we have thousands of men and women in uniform fighting for us overseas and they need our full backing. We cannot be complacent about the determination of radical islamic extremists to destroy our freedoms. \" ' but the atlantic calls that \" pure spin, \" saying bevin was clearly implying an armed insurrection might be necessary should clinton be elected. It says his \" extreme \" comments \" underscore the apocalyptic attitudes aroused by this election, which has been unusually marked by fear. \" vox agrees: \" the text of his actual speech, however, is completely at odds with [ his statement ] — he is very clearly talking about patriots winning back liberty from the tyranny of democratic party governance. \"",

After the lengthy text-reading session, pistorius started to walk the court through the events of feb. 13 and 14. He says he put on his pajamas around 7pm, after having dinner with steenkamp. She did yoga on the bedroom floor; he called a cousin and discussed cars.

In the middle of his emotional and harrowing testimony on tuesday, the champion sprinter oscar pistorius stood up in full view of the packed courtroom, removed his prosthetic legs and demonstrated in a few ungainly steps how very vulnerable and exposed he can be with only his stumps to depend on. The moment came on a grueling day in which a shaky, tearful mr. Pistorius for the first time gave a full account of what he says happened the night he shot and killed his girlfriend, reeva steenkamp. And it went toward bolstering the case the defense is trying to make: that mr. Pistorius, the world's most celebrated disabled athlete, is at the same time an anxious and physically fragile man who sprayed bullets through the door of his bathroom in a panic because he believed someone had broken into his house. \"i was overcome with fear, \" he said of the moment he says he heard noises coming from outside his bedroom early on feb. 14, 2013. \"i started screaming and shouting for the burglars to get out of my house. I shouted for reeva to get on the floor. I shouted for her to phone the police. \" photo the trial has dominated the news here in south africa. Born without fibulae, bones that connect the knee to the ankle, mr. Pistorius lost his lower legs to amputation when he was a baby, but with his talent, perseverance and charm went on to become a bona fide south african hero. An inspirational sprinter who scooped up medals in able-bodied as well as disabled competitions, he carried the flag for south africa at the closing ceremony in the 2012 olympics in london. In addition to the attention surrounding a trial involving a high-profile star athlete, the case has raised other issues: about south africa's gun culture; about the country's laws covering self-defense and its no-jury trial system;"

The post notes there are already quarantine areas in existence at most major us airports. Nbc news reports cdc staffers will likely be installed at jfk, newark, o ' hare, and dulles. Though some republicans yesterday clamored for heightened screening ( gov. Rick perry ) or even a potential travel ban ( sen. Ted cruz ), obama remains in opposition to the latter.

Nbc news has learned that likely will mean adding cdc staffers at four airports: jfk in new york, newark in new jersey, chicago and washington dulles. They ' ll question travelers about where they have been and take their temperatures. A fever can be one of the first symptoms of ebola infection, although it's also a symptom of malaria, influenza and many other infections. The administration says it does not support blocking flights from west africa, in part because affected countries screen travelers on the way out. Dr. Thomas frieden, director of the centers for disease control and prevention, says 77 people have been pulled out of lines to board flights from affected countries thanks to screening. The world health organization says blocking flights would only worsen the problem by making countries poorer and by discouraging aid workers from coming to help.

            "Play facebook twitter embed white house weighs in on ebola 2: 29 the obama administration is talking about ramping up screening of travelers who come from ebola-infected countries. Many americans are concerned that the virus may spread now that a patient has been diagnosed in dallas. Nbc news has learned that likely will mean adding cdc staffers at four airports: jfk in new york, newark in new jersey, chicago and washington dulles. They ' ll question travelers about where they have been and take their temperatures. A fever can be one of the first symptoms of ebola infection, although it's also a symptom of malaria, influenza and many other infections. The administration says it does not support blocking flights from west africa, in part because affected countries screen travelers on the way out. Dr. Thomas frieden, director of the centers for disease control and prevention, says 77 people have been pulled out of lines to board flights from affected countries thanks to screening. The world health organization says blocking flights would only worsen the problem by making countries poorer and by discouraging aid workers from coming to help. But it's possible to add screening at u.s. Airports. \" we're also going to be working on protocols to do additional, faster screening both at the source and here in the united states, \" president barack",

Police found the 12-year-old during a patrol of the alpine village st gervais last month, asked what was up, and listened to his tale of woe. The boy described his kidnapper in some detail — about 5 ' 6 \", 30s, muscular, with ( of course ) a scar on his cheek — and explained how the abduction went down. He was supposedly headed for the dentist when the guy pulled up, asked for directions, dragged him in the car, and drove off. Only during a surprise stop was the boy able to run away. Well, police investigated for a month, drawing up an e-fit image of the suspect and following leads, midi libre reports — until investigators noticed that closed-circuit tv images from the boy's hometown of bagnols didn't quite match his story. So they pressed him further, and he admitted to concocting the whole thing because he was afraid of the dental chair. Exactly what his punishment will be isn't clear, notes inquisitr.

        "summary": "Days after five tiny golden-winged warblers finished their seasonal migration, flying 3,100 miles from colombia to tennessee, they vacated their new home to travel 400 miles south to the gulf of mexico. Some 24 hours later, on april 27, 2014, at least 84 tornadoes left a path of death and destruction throughout the central and southeastern us, the bbc reports. The birds ' flight was no coincidence, say researchers, who suspect the birds ' low-frequency hearing allowed them to pick up infrasound waves from a storm that was 560 miles away when they fled; they left before changes in barometric pressure, wind speeds, or precipitation registered, the guardian reports. By may 2, the birds had all returned. Some 20 warblers were tagged in may 2013 before they flew to colombia; roughly half returned to the us. Researchers were only able to capture five. \" the fact that they came back with the geolocators was supposed to be the great success of this season, \" says a researcher. \" then this happened! \" an expert adds, \" it's very unlikely that this species is the only group doing this. \" and the study indicates birds may be able to make quick and \" dramatic \" movements to cope with the \" predicted increase in severity and frequency of similar storms \" brought on by climate change, even after having just completed a long journey, says david andersen, who was part of the study published in current biology. But an ecologist not associated with the study advises that the findings be taken with a grain of salt, as the geolocators gauged location based on light readings rather than satellites.

Researchers noticed the behaviour after analysing trackers attached to the birds to study their migration patterns. They believe it is the first documented case of birds making detours to avoid destructive weather systems on the basis of infrasound. The golden-winged warblers had just returned from south america to their breeding grounds in the mountains of tennessee in 2013 when a massive storm was edging closer. Although the birds had just completed a migration of more than 2,500km, they still had the energy to evade the danger. The storm, which spawned more than 80 tornadoes across the us and killed 35 people, was 900km away when the birds, apparently acting independently of one another, fled south, with one bird embarking on a 1,500km flight to cuba before making the return trip once the storm had passed.

The accused, dell schanze, was allegedly featured in a since-deleted youtube video showing off his owl-harassing ways.

He might lose his motorized paraglider, too. Schanze is better known to utah residents as \" super dell, \" thanks to over-the-top tv commercials for his now-defunct totally awesome computers business, reports ksl. The station notes that schanze once spent eight days in jail on a reckless-driving charge. Kids were in the car at the time of his arrest, and schanze told police he was weaving in the road to entertain them.",

Now, a range of top retailers are trying everything from live music to off-duty police hires to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy. Among their strategies, via bloomberg: walmart last night handed out wristbands to shoppers for events starting at 6pm and 8pm. Those with the bands were allowed to come back two hours after the events began to pick up their goods. And last year, the company instituted a \" one-hour guarantee \": if you're in the store within an hour of a sales event starting, you ' ll be sure to get your item. Best buy workers actually went through dress rehearsals for today. The chain is also offering ticketed shopping, which sees workers distribute individual tickets for every item available in doorbuster sales. Shoppers are allowed one ticket per category of item. \" that prevents the need for a big rush to get to the pile of tvs or whatever the hot item is, \" says a rep. Target has security teams riding around the parking lot on segways so they ' ll be noticed.

        "summary": "Rats may not have the best reputation, but a new study suggests that they're actually pretty good citizens. Researchers found that if a rat is in distress in water, another will save it, according to a post in science daily. Researchers put one rat in a pool of water and another in a dry area, with the two separated by a door. The dry rats soon learned that they could let the other rat through the door, thereby rescuing it — and they hurried to open the door only if the other animal seemed to be in real distress. What's more, rats who knew what it was like to be soaked, having been through it themselves, learned about the rescue mechanism faster than others. \" this suggests that knowing that soaking is distressing enhances the rats ' motivation to help their cage mate, \" a researcher tells new scientist. \" we think this comes from empathy. \" in fact, those in the experiment seemed to care enough about their struggling brethren to forgo chocolate for them. Given the option of saving a fellow rat or getting a snack, they tended to opt for the rescue first. Previous studies have also pointed to empathy in rats, but further work is needed to be sure, researchers say. ( elephants, meanwhile, have been seen to console each other. )",

Hostilities between syria's more moderate rebel factions and the al-qaeda-affiliated islamic state of iraq and syria exploded into open warfare on friday, and it's been so costly that the head of another al-qaeda affiliate, the al-nusra front, is calling for an islamic court to be set up to settle disagreements, the new york times reports. Abu mohammed al-jolani said the fighting was the result of the \" incorrect policies \" of the isis, but that if there wasn't a ceasefire soon, \" the whole battlefield … will pay the price of losing a great jihad. \" other rebels accuse the isis — which wants to combine iraq and syria into one sunni-ruled country — of hogging resources, applying strict social codes, and kidnapping and killing its foes. So far at least 300 people have died in the rebel in-fighting since friday, including dozens of civilians, according to the syrian observatory for human rights, and rebels today captured a hospital-turned-isis base in aleppo, the ap reports. The infighting also highlights a challenge for saudi arabia, which is backing the rebels in hopes of ousting assad's shiite, iran-affiliated regime, but is uneasy about the potential for jihadist spill-over, the times adds.",

The town of southington, conn., originally planned to do just that on saturday, though the event has since been canceled. Past cultural bête noires — from comic books to gangsta rap to television — have seen similar burnings, but video games are a unique case. They're not consumed, they're played. \" the digital violence we witness on-screen comes from our own hands, \" leibovitz writes. That may sound scary, but as all gamers know, the experience \" has more to do with our thumbs than it does with our minds, \" resembling contact sports more than watching tv. What's more, it's \" not fundamentally different than what previous generations have done, when sticks served as swords or hands as pistols. \" it's play. Then, as ever, it helps people deal with intense experience in a safe, sublimated way. \" by confiscating and burning their games, parents risk extinguishing a critical outlet — and creating the very problem they were trying to avoid, \" he writes.

( ap photo/markus schreiber ) ( associated press ) berlin ( ap ) — chancellor angela merkel and her rebellious political allies broke an impasse over immigration that threatened to bring down germany's coalition government by agreeing on a compromise late monday that both sides said addressed their concerns. Merkel has been at odds for more than three weeks with interior minister horst seehofer over his insistence that migrants who have sought asylum elsewhere in the european union should be turned away at germany's borders. Seehofer leads the christian social union, the sister party to the chancellor's christian democratic union. Merkel was equally steadfast in arguing that such a unilateral action would cause other countries to close their borders and jeopardize the passport-free movement that is a hallmark of europe's schengen zone. But the two emerged from about five hours of talks saying they agreed to establish \" transit centers \" on germany's border with austria where asylum-seekers would be evaluated and, if it turned out they already had applied for",

Interior minister horst seehofer, who leads her bavarian csu allies, has now dropped his threat to resign. Mrs merkel agreed to tighten controls at the austrian border to stop people who have applied for asylum in other eu countries from entering germany. Transit centres will be set up to hold them until they can be sent back. Mrs merkel described the deal as a good compromise after tough negotiation. But her centre-left social democrat ( spd ) partners in the coalition voiced scepticism. Their spokesman on migration, aziz bozkurt, told the daily newspaper die welt that \" transit centres are in no way covered by the coalition agreement \". The spd rejected a proposal for such centres in 2015, when the migrant numbers entering bavaria from austria were far higher than now.

        "summary": "Maybe newt gingrich just ought to hold his tongue on terrorists and us law. Earlier this week the former house speaker said shoe-bomber richard reid was american, and therefore was properly read his miranda rights by the bush administration — but reid is british, and now gingrich says he meant would-be domestic terrorist jose padilla. So, we're good now, right? well, not quite. Because gingrich added on twitter: \"treating terrorists like criminals wrong no matter who is pres \" — in line with current republican talking points but exactly the opposite of what he said in 2005 about the bush administration moving padilla's case from military to civilian court. Then, gingrich agreed with the bush line that there's no set-in-stone, perfect way to try terrorists — the very stance, sam stein points out, he's now criticizing from president obama. Marc ambinder sees another angle — gingrich praising bush for originally holding padilla in a military brig and subjecting him to harsh interrogation. But, ambinder notes for the atlantic, padilla didn't talk before his eventual transfer to civilian court. \"so gingrich's reference — his proof that the bush administration used a different practice and that it worked — is so far removed from the point that he is trying to make that it is, to quote wolfgang pauli, not even wrong. \"",
