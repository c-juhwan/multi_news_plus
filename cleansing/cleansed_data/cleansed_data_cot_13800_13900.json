        "summary": "Gastric-bypass surgery sounds like a sure path to a new life. But for the obese who undergo such radical weight-loss surgery, the ups and downs post-operation can take a precious toll, the new york times finds after a year of tracking two of the 200,000 americans who undergo bariatric surgery annually. The low-risk surgery not only prevents patients from overeating, but it rewires their physiology so that food no longer tastes the same. Of three techniques used, the times followed two who underwent the most common, a gastric bypass, which removed most of their stomachs and rerouted their small intestines. Both saw their health improve and their weight initially plummet. For keith oleszkowicz, 40, joint pain disappeared along with his sleep apnea as pounds melted off of his 377-pound frame. Jessica shapiro, at 22, had never had a date and told the times that \" every day of my life, i ' m just aware of how overweight i am. \" she was thrilled when she lost 65 of her 295 pounds in three months. \" i have a waist! \" she crowed. Her acid reflux vanished. But both were disappointed when their weight loss slowed. Doctors say bariatric patients rarely attain their desired weight. ( dieting after surgery is actually harder than it was before. ) one year later, shapiro was down 112 pounds and oleszkowicz down to 284, but their enthusiasm had cooled. Both still saw themselves as fat. \" i have a fat brain, \" says oleszkowicz. Their experiences mirror those reported by 100 patients. Many were unhappy with excess flaps of skin. There were lots of ruptured relationships. Oleszkowicz even missed his old appetite. \" i just liked eating before, \" he says. Shapiro tried college classes but dropped out. She still has anxiety issues but says, \" i don't have an excuse anymore. \" ( read the full story here. )",

        "summary": "A story that is either kind of hilarious or totally gross is making the rounds: it seems james franco met a 17-year-old tourist in new york city on tuesday as he was signing autographs after performing in of mice and men, and later attempted — via instagram — to hook up with her. The teen posted photos and a video — in which franco can be seen and heard asking her to tag him — on instagram. Then things got weird. In screenshots the teen posted to imgur ( they've since been taken down ), franco, 35, appears to try and pick up on the girl. The screenshots were captured for posterity by daily dot, dlisted, gawker, jezebel, and other outlets. In them, franco ( or at least it appears to be franco ) asks the girl ( first through instagram direct messages, then in text messages ) how old she is, whether she has a boyfriend, and whether he should rent a room so they can get together in her hotel. The girl twice asked for proof of his identity, and he sent two selfies, one in which he's holding up a piece of paper with her first name written on it. He also asks her at one point not to tell anyone about the interaction, but to text when she wants to meet up. In response to the drama swirling around the story, franco tweeted, \" i hope parents keep their teens away from me. Thank you. \" he also briefly added a line to his instagram profile reading, \" please don't dm if you are under 18, thank you, \" but that has since been removed.",

Phil green of supermodel agency says, \" i can assure everybody that it was real and very frightening for all concerned. \" but ayling broke down in tears when confronted by investigators with a witness who said ayling had gone to buy shoes with the alleged kidnapper. According to a transcript of chloe ayling's deposition obtained tuesday by the ap, the 20-year-old model initially said she was held at a remote farmhouse for six days without ever leaving. But on the second day of questioning, she was confronted with witness testimony that said she and the main suspect had bought shoes for her the day before her release. The guardian reports she also allegedly went grocery shopping with him. She told investigators that she couldn't give a \" reasonable explanation \" about why she had omitted the shoe shopping, but she said she considered the alleged kidnapper to be her best chance at freedom. Police have arrested a suspect, lukasz pawel herba. Green said tuesday that ayling went to milan in july for a photo shoot that seemed legitimate. He said the person who made the booking had \" a website, previous pictures, details of his studio, details of what the shoot was going to be, times, locations, fee — everything. \" but the day after his client was due to return, green says he received a ransom demand for $ 300,000. Ayling was released at the uk consulate in milan on july 17. Cbs news reports it's believed that no ransom was paid.",

Final box-office counts have been reported for new kids on the block's total package tour, which wrapped last month after a nine-week run through 46 north american cities. Ticket sales from the live nation-produced trek surpassed the $ 40 million mark from more than half a million sold seats at 48 performances. The summertime jaunt lands in the second slot on the weekly tally of 10 top-grossing hot tours ( see list below ). The tour launch coincided with the release of thankful, the boy band's ep that bowed on may 12; the opening concert was held on the same day in columbus, ohio.

Sure, the script \" turns clunky, \" but the plot is \" full of deepening surprises. \" as for the actors, \" mcconaughey is on a roll. And he partners beautifully with the sublime [ jessica ] chastain. \" david thomson at the new republic strongly disagrees, arguing mcconaughey just doesn't fit the role of gary cooper in this \" entertainment disaster. \" mackenzie foy, who plays his young daughter, is \" the best thing in the picture, by light years. \" but on the whole, the movie is \" a horribly prolonged picture without adequate story or commanding spectacle, \" thomson writes. \" about 90 minutes in, i was seriously considering walking out. \" kenneth turan apparently saw a different movie. Interstellar is \" altogether remarkable, \" he writes at the los angeles times. \" it's a mass audience picture that's intelligent as well as epic, with a sophisticated script that's as interested in emotional moments as immersive visuals.

        "summary": "The parent company of the fox news says it knew a news analyst planned to file a sexual harassment lawsuit against bill o'reilly when it renewed the popular personality's contract in february. The new york times reported saturday the company renewed o'reilly's contract after he reached a $ 32 million settlement with the analyst, lis wiehl. In a statement, 21st century fox defended its decision because it said o'reilly had settled the matter personally, reports the ap. It also said o'reilly and wiehl had agreed the financial terms would be kept confidential. The company says o'reilly's new contract had added protections that allowed fox to dismiss him if other allegations surfaced. O'reilly was ousted months later when it was revealed fox had paid five women a total of $ 13 million to keep quiet about harassment allegations. An o'reilly rep said saturday that after 21st century fox fired roger ailes in 2016 following harassment charges, dozens of women accused scores of male employees at fox of harassment. 21st century fox paid out close to $ 100 million to settle all cases. Wiehl's allegations included repeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship, and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material, per people briefed on the matter. The settlement was by far the largest of a half-dozen deals made by o'reilly or fox. It was reached in january. A month later, fox granted o'reilly a four-year extension on a $ 25 million-a-year contract. In april, it fired him. O'reilly's rep said the report was false and taken out of context. The times stands by its reporting. \" ( the rep ) addresses everything but what the story actually says. This article...

Doctors said ruby wouldn't survive more than a few hours after her birth, but the little girl bunker calls his \" warrior \" has persevered, despite multiple brushes with death. Vantongeren shares the story of her \" miracle \" baby on facebook, explaining that the family, which also includes 11-year-old daron and 2-year-old tommy, is holed up for now in a 20-foot trailer until they can afford to upgrade to a bigger rv so they can move to utah, where the drier air will be better for ruby's health. \" our situation is not understood, \" ruby's parents write on gofundme, saying they've been unable to get state assistance.

Walter palmer, could spark a \" cascade of effects \" that ultimately result in the deaths of 10 cubs in cecil's pride. So say university of oxford conservation experts who've been tracking one of the continent's most photographed lions for seven years, reports nbc news. First cecil's brothers are now at risk as rival male lions seek to take over the pride, which may lead to \" the overthrow of his weakened coalition, and subsequently the death of his cubs, \" says david macdonald, the founding director of oxford's wildlife conservation research unit, which tracks lions. Cecil's death is a particular blow for macdonald, who says his team \" watched him for hours, indeed weeks, months, and years. Cecil was simply a magnificent lion. \" in terms of what's next for palmer, the us and zimbabwe do have an extradition treaty, but the department of justice has only said that it is \" aware of the situation, \" reports time. A us fish and wildlife service spokesperson says the service is \" deeply concerned \" about the killing and investigating further. Just last year the service proposed listing lions as an endangered species, and said in a statement, \" it is up to all of us — not just the people of africa — to ensure that healthy, wild populations of animals continue to roam the savanna for generations to come. \" meanwhile former spice girl geri halliwell has joined a slew of celebrities mourning cecil's death by tweeting a photograph of herself hugging the lion when he was a cub, reports the daily mirror.

But that may not be enough to keep them — or possible future executives — to run the two mortgage giants, says melvin watt, the fhfa director who's now calling to raise that compensation.

        "summary": "Toronto police pulled off an impressive rescue in the city swamped by flooding tuesday night. Six minutes after receiving a call about two men trapped in a flooded elevator with only a foot of air space, officers swam into the water-filled basement of a commercial building and used a crowbar to free the pair, both of whom were fine other than a minor hand injury. \" it's actually quite an amazing story and we're just happy everything turned out in a positive manner, \" a police spokeswoman tells the canadian press, adding the men were able to stand on the elevator's handrails to keep their heads above the water, which had reached six feet. \" the water was rising very, very quickly, \" she tells global news. Environment canada had issued a weather warning, lifted around 11: 30pm, with 2 to 4 inches of rain expected across the region. Per global news, a meteorologist says 2 to 3 inches or \" basically more than a month's rain \" fell in the span of a few hours, leading to flash flooding in the downtown core. Rain filled underpasses, submerging cars whose occupants were safely rescued. Photos shared on social media showed streetcars unmovable, while city news reports one was also submerged. Mayor john tory even felt the effects: staffers used at least 10 buckets to catch water from leaks in the roof outside his office at city hall, per cp. At least 16,000 people lost power in the city, though it has since been restored.",

Police in southern india say the 27-year-old nurse killed her husband, then poured acid on the face of her lover in an effort to pass him off as her spouse. And she nearly succeeded. Telangana police say reddy convinced her husband's parents that their son had been the victim of an acid attack, when the man lying in a hospital bed was actually her lover, rajesh ajjakolu, reports the bbc. But while the parents paid ajjakolu's medical bills — with plastic surgery to be included — their other son grew suspicious. Police say ajjakolu refused a meal of mutton soup, claiming he was a vegetarian though reddy's husband wasn't, per the khaleej times. When he couldn't identify relatives and began communicating with signs, the family went to police. After fingerprints revealed ajjakolu to be an imposter, authorities say reddy admitted she and ajjakolu killed her husband, sudhakar reddy. The murder is believed to have taken place on nov. 26. According to gulf news, reddy is accused of injecting her husband with anesthesia before hitting him on the head, with ajjakolu's help. Police believe the couple burned the man's body the next day. A day later, ajjakolu was admitted to hospital with facial burns police now say were caused by reddy deliberately pouring acid on his face to disfigure him. Reddy, who was arrested sunday, reportedly told authorities she was inspired by the 2014 indian movie yevadu, in which a person emerges from plastic surgery with the face of a deceased man, per the hindustan times. Ajjakolu is to be taken into custody upon his release from the hospital.",

It's the first time the threat level has been at this level in more than 10 years, cnn reports. May says salman abadi, the suicide bomber who killed 22 people at a concert in manchester, may have been part of a bigger network. She says abadi was born and raised in britain. The level previously stood at the second-highest rung of \" severe \" for several years. May says critical status means armed soldiers may be deployed instead of police at public events such as concerts and sports matches. May says raising the country's terror threat level and deploying soldiers to patrol key sites is a \" proportionate and sensible response \" to the suicide bombing.

Among them: \" old age should not afford immunity to murderers \" and \" every nazi victim deserves that an effort be made to hold their killers accountable. \" the bbc has a shortlist of some of the center's most-wanted suspects, which includes aribert heim, a buchenwald doctor who disappeared in 1962 and was last seen in egypt 21 years ago.",

        "summary": "If you liked the first installment of the divergent series, based on the books by veronica roth, you ' ll probably like the latest addition. Audiences are giving it a 72 % approval rating on rotten tomatoes, but critics are less impressed. Some say it's better than the first flick, but that's apparently not saying much. Here's what critics are saying: the first installment was \" tepid, \" but new screenwriters have \" done serious surgery to insurgent, streamlining the story line, changing key plot points,... And in general improving the narrative flow, \" kenneth turan writes at the los angeles times. \" the result — though admittedly it's a low bar to clear — is a more effective, adult-friendly film than its predecessor. \" still, the heart of the movie is in its action sequences, which \" are nothing if not traditional b-movie material. \" tom long at the detroit news writes that insurgent, \" while far from perfect, has a crackling energy that can't be denied. \" the visuals are \" mostly dazzling \" but the movie \" is all on [ shailene ] woodley ( the camera rarely leaves her ) and she's more than capable... Of pulling it off. \" naomi watts and kate winslet are also strong, but the franchise remains what long calls \" a poorer cousin of the hunger games. \" and the \" just-in-the-nick-of-time climax is fairly laughable. \" insurgent overcomes \" middle-book-itis \" and \" moves the story forward significantly, \" writes mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle. But it's \" ridiculous. \" the \" world of the film is so far-fetched that the mechanics of its functioning are of no interest. What's worse, the behavior of the characters often goes against the movie's own internal logic. \" interestingly, the good parts are \" saved for the end, and they leave the viewer with a feeling of, ' well, that was ok, ' even though most of it wasn't. \" at one point, woodley's character says, \" i know this doesn't make any sense. \" chimes in claudia puig at usa today: \" that sentiment pretty much sums up this listless sequel. \" it \" feels cobbled together and less focused than 2014's divergent, and lacks tension and excitement, \" she writes. Woodley and theo james \" seem merely to be going through the motions. Their ultra-seriousness, combined with lackluster performances, add up to a dreary experience. \"",

Julia strengthened from a tropical system into a tropical storm a few miles west of jacksonville, fla., around midnight on tuesday, marking the first time meteorologists have seen a tropical storm form over land in the state instead of offshore, nbc news reports. The last tropical storm to develop over land anywhere in the us was beryl, which formed over southeast louisiana in 1988, usa today reports. Tropical storms usually weaken, not strengthen over land, but florida apparently only loosely meets the definition of \" land \": the state \" is essentially one big swamp without mountains, \" and surface conditions 25 miles inland can be very similar to those 25 miles offshore, with plenty of moisture-rich air to power the storm, says meteorologist eric snitil at wsfa, giving julia the award for \" weirdest tropical storm of the year. \" julia is expected to meander up the atlantic coast over thursday and friday, bringing heavy rains and possibly flash floods to coastal areas drenched by hermine two weeks ago, the ap reports.",

        "summary": "Marijuana is a schedule i drug and it's going to stay that way, sources tell npr and the washington post in advance of the drug enforcement administration's announcement thursday on the subject. Some five years ago, two democratic governors petitioned the agency to rebrand the drug as one with accepted medical uses. The upshot, per dea head chuck rosenberg, as quoted by npr: \" this decision is based on whether marijuana, as determined by the fda, is a safe and effective medicine, and it's not. \" that's a reference to the fda's current stance: it \" has not approved marijuana as a safe and effective drug for any indication. \" this though half the country's states permit medical marijuana use in some capacity. What the dea is expected to loosen up are its research rules. The university of mississippi is the feds'sole pot grower, a distinction it has held since 1968. Going forward, there may be what npr calls \" new avenues \" for producing pot for scientific research. Again, rosenberg: \" we want to expand the availability, the variety, the type of marijuana available to legitimate researchers. If our understanding of the science changes, that could very well drive a new decision. \" reuters notes that outside of the petitioning process, the only other avenue to reclassification is through congress. There are currently five drug schedules, with heroin and lsd joining marijuana in schedule i. Had pot been moved to schedule ii alongside vicodin, adderall, and ritalin, it would have been \" subject to the standard prescription process, \" notes marketwatch.",

Police in springfield, mass., say the 1-year-old child was left alone for hours and apparently suffocated under the bag. Investigations are ongoing, but no charges have been filed and the massachusetts dept. Of children and families took no other children in the house into custody; they're staying with relatives instead. The grim tale began when officers responded to a saturday afternoon call about a child in the liberty heights neighborhood who wasn't breathing, police say. Officers were told the bag had slipped down over the girl's face and suffocated her when she fell asleep unattended, cbs news reports. A boy living in the house also had lice, but had his head shaved instead. The mayonnaise-bag remedy isn't considered a real medical treatment, but is fairly common as a home remedy: the mayo's oil apparently plays a role in suffocating adult lice even though doesn't kill lice eggs. The head lice center recommends covering the scalp in mayonnaise and plastic for as long as eight hours, but says a shower cap is safer than a bag when used on children. A north american study last year found that a majority of over-the-counter remedies are unable to kill most head lice because they carry a gene mutation, cbs 8 reports.",

            "Amman ( reuters ) - syrian troops and tanks poured into deraa on monday, seeking to crush resistance in the city where a month-long uprising against the autocratic 11-year rule of president bashar al-assad first erupted. A prominent activist said at least 18 people were killed in the first reported use of tanks inside a population center since peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations began in the southern city, close to the border with jordan, on march 18. The white house, deploring \" brutal violence used by the government of syria against its people, \" said president barack obama's administration was considering targeted sanctions to make clear that \" this behavior is unacceptable. \" a u.s. Official said that measures under consideration included a freeze on assets and a ban on u.s. Business dealings. Security forces have killed more than 350 civilians across syria since unrest broke out in deraa, rights groups say. A third of the victims were shot in the past three days as the scale and breadth of a popular revolt against assad grew. Assad lifted syria's 48-year state of emergency on thursday but activists say the violence the following day, when 100 people were killed during protests across the country, showed he was not serious about addressing calls for political freedom.

The baby boys succumbed to heart failure on wednesday before they could be moved abroad for life-saving treatment, the wall street journal reports. Joined at the abdomen, with their hearts sharing the same sac, moaz and nawras al-hishoysh weighed less than 12 pounds when they were born on july 23 in the ghouta region outside damascus. After repeated appeals and a social media campaign hashtagged #evacuatethetwins, the government allowed them to be moved to the capital on aug. 12. But damascus also lacks the medical facilities the babies needed, and with time running out, relief officials scrambled to get the boys out of syria. The syrian american medical society accuses the government of failing to grant the twins permission to leave the country in time because of political reasons, reports the bbc. The charity says it obtained commitments from hospitals in the us and saudi arabia ( both oppose president bashar al-assad ) to treat the babies, but the government stalled in granting them passports, the baby's father, muneer al-hishoysh, tells the journal. But a spokeswoman for the government-sanctioned syrian arab red crescent denies that syrian officials were uncooperative and says her agency had gotten the thumbs up to transfer the babies to an italian hospital on monday. But by that time, she said, the twins were too sick to travel. ( last week, the fate of two young syrian brothers made headlines. )",

At hsbc arena in rio de janeiro, the 135-pound american women's bantamweight champ faced off against undefeated brazilian bethe correia, who seemed confident she'd steal rousey's title. In the lead-up to the fight, correia had roused bad blood by suggesting rousey, an olympic bronze medalist in judo, might commit suicide if she lost; rousey lost her father to suicide at age 8, reports cnn. Rousey, 28, entered the octagon with a glare, delivered a knee to correia's chest, hit her with a left hook, then a right, then another left before the referee called a stop to the fight, reports the guardian. The battle — which rousey dedicated to \" rowdy \" roddy piper, per the wall street journal — actually lasted longer than rousey's two previous fights combined. Now 12-0, rousey is viewed by many as the best female mma fighter in the world. She ' ll likely next face miesha tate, whom she's already beaten twice. \" i think miesha is one of my greatest challenges because she already has an idea what she's getting in there with, \" says rousey, per mmajunkie.com.

He paid $ 6.9 million in federal income tax, making his rate about 17.4 %. ( the big difference in his gross and taxable income is due to deductions on donations to charity and local taxes, reports cnnmoney. ) he also paid $ 15,300 in payroll taxes. Buffett says he got off easy because much of his income came from investments as opposed to wages: \" people who make money with money are getting taxed at a far lower rate than people who make money by their own labor. \" he declined huelskamp's request to release his full tax return but said he would do so if other \" ultra-rich \" people did the same. Huelskamp called buffett's letter inadequate. \" by sheltering millions of dollars of income from taxation through charitable giving, mr. Buffett demonstrates that he doesn't trust washington with his own money either. \" for comparison: the nonpartisan tax policy center says people who make between $ 34,000 and $ 60,000 have a 12 % tax rate, including payroll and income taxes, notes the wall street journal. The rate is 20.4 % for those making $ 211,000 to $ 533,000.",

            "New york ( cnnmoney ) -- billionaire investor warren buffett this week showed a little more leg in his campaign to get congress to raise taxes on the uber-rich. In a letter to republican rep. Tim huelskamp tuesday, buffett revealed that his adjusted gross income last year was $ 62,855,038 and that his taxable income was $ 39,814,784. Buffett said he paid $ 15,300 in payroll taxes.

Buffett provided a copy of his correspondence with huelskamp to cnnmoney's poppy harlow. He said in an interview that the roughly $ 23 million difference between his agi and taxable income was due largely to deductions he took for charitable giving and local taxes. Two key reasons he only paid 17.4 %, however, is because a lot of his income came from investments, which are taxed at a lower rate than wages, and because payroll taxes are assessed only on wage income. \" people who make money with money are getting taxed at a far lower rate than people who make money by their own labor, \" buffett told cnnmoney. In his letter, buffett also repeated his offer to release his full tax return if other super-wealthy taxpayers -- like news corp.

Police in gloversville came upon the body dec. 29 after responding to a relative's request that ruller be checked on, reports the ap.

There's no indication, however, that that occurred in this case, though police have subpoenaed the family's financial records. ( in 2013, a corpse was found in a paris apartment eight years after the man's death. )",

The 47-year-old atlanta resident has battled the city so intensely that in september officials banned her entirely — from council meetings and all public property in statham's 3.5 square miles, the atlanta journal-constitution reports. \" i did ask for a lot, \" says corkren. It all began when her former partner, kelly pickens, was stopped in 2015 by former statham police officer marc loften for allegedly driving without a license plate and over the 25-mile-per-hour speed limit. But when she admitted to being on medication for anxiety and \" major depression, \" pickens balked at taking sobriety tests and was arrested on charges including disorderly conduct and dui-drugs less safe. In fighting the charges, corkren and pickens found that lofton had made 63 similar arrests over his first six months on the job, per the barrow news-journal. People accused the department of profiting from police work — indeed, the city's projected fines revenue rose from $ 71,000 in 2013 to $ 250,000 in 2015 — and several charges, including pickens ', were dropped. Then pickens sued the city for allegedly violating her rights, a battle corkren continued after pickens ' 2017 death by suing the city and demanding city records on a regular basis. Now officials literally want her off their lawn. \" it seems like the garden variety drama you see in any city or county, but they are taking aggressive, illegal action to suppress it, \" says her attorney. \" this is so far beyond the pale. \" ( meanwhile, a woman has sued her special forces ex over alleged revenge porn. )",

        "summary": "When looking for love, people with psychiatric disorders tend to look toward their own, one new study suggests. Researchers from the karolinska institute in sweden report in jama psychiatry that they combed the health histories of 707,263 people admitted to hospitals in sweden between 1973 and 2009 and who had at least one psychiatric disorder — 70,000 alone had schizophrenia, while 10 other major psychiatric disorders were also represented. Researchers also noted people with certain physical illnesses such as diabetes and ms. What they found is that those with psychiatric disorders are both far more likely to marry someone who also has a disorder as well as have children with them — a finding that did not carry over with people with physical illnesses. What drives the matchmaking? a psychologist tells live science that not only do people with psychiatric disorders often have a harder time building relationships, but people without such disorders are often less willing to accept partners with them. But, as wired notes: \" this doesn't mean that your future spouse's name is spelled out in the as, ts, cs, and gs of your genetic code. [ these ] numbers are significant, but the effect is tiny. Which is probably fine, because sharing the same psychiatric disorder might not necessarily convey compatibility. \" the researchers say a \" natural companion \" to this enormous trove of data is the psychiatric future of the offspring of these couples.",

            "About relics in christianity the adoration of relics is one of the oldest forms of devotion to saints and evidence is found already clearly in the mid-second century. This is remarkable because in the pagan antiquity adoration of relics was not desirable and body parts of even saints were seen as impure. The very existence and fame of great catholic cathedrals of the middle ages were based on the devotion to saints and the adoration of their relics – like the three kings in the dome of cologne. It is important to understand in this context that devotion is not worship of a saint or the relic but simply the appreciation and use of the contained healing power in the relics, which is a purely and ultimately a free gift of god. We can read about the use of relics already in the bible ( acts 19: 11-12 ): \"11and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul: 12so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. \" in marc 5, 21-34 ( s. Also mt 9,20-22 ) we read about the jesus relics: 25and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. 26she had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet",

North korea's supreme people's assembly has served as a rubber-stamp parliament, endorsing whatever decisions were made by the top leader and his inner circles, who dominate the top echelons of the ruling workers ' party, the people's army and the government. In the last parliamentary election, held five years ago when mr. Kim's father, kim jong-il, was still alive, a single candidate ran unopposed in each of the 687 districts, and all the deputies were elected with 100 percent support.

Analysis the north korean vote is a ritual, the result of which has already been largely determined. The supreme people's assembly meets rarely and has very little power but you would not know it from the official turnout. There is only one candidate for each district, and one name on each ballot paper. The democratic duty for the electorate is simply to write \" yes \" beside it. Writing anything else might be seen as treachery, rather than democracy. That is especially true if you live in the district of mount paekdu - the constituency of current north korean leader, kim jong-un. State media have devoted entire reports to the excitement of voters at the mount",

On richards'side, the goal was to clear up misconceptions about the organization, explaining that federal funding \" doesn't actually go to abortions, \" laguens says. But while the meeting was affable, their relationship has since turned ugly as the first daughter has kept quiet on women's issues, including abortion, politico reports. Supporters of trump — who has also met with leaders at the national women's law center and national partnership for women and family, per politico — say she wouldn't be able to convince the republican base to embrace planned parenthood even if she did speak out publicly. But richards clearly isn't on the same page. \" anyone who works in this white house is responsible for addressing why women are in the crosshairs of basically every single policy we've seen in this administration, \" she said wednesday at the women in the world conference in new york.

In an effort to mitigate a possible conflict of interest with clinton's candidacy, the bill, hillary and chelsea clinton foundation announced in a summary out today that it will accept foreign donations from just six countries — australia, canada, germany, the netherlands, norway, and the uk — that support the foundation's poverty, health, and climate change programs. The group will also suspend conferences abroad and increase the frequency of donor-disclosure reports, the wall street journal reports. But ethics experts say no foreign donations are acceptable, especially since at least some of those six countries are involved in hot-button topics: canada, for instance, wants approval for the keystone xl pipeline, the journal notes. An ap analysis of foundation donors between 2001 and 2015 shows between $ 55 million and $ 130 million was donated from foreign governments or agencies in 16 countries; these types of foreign entities ponied up a third of the foundation's donations of $ 1 million or more from 2001 through 2014, the washington post has reported. But critics point to blurred lines between the foundation and the clinton global initiative ( other countries can still work with that subsidiary ), the fact that there aren't restrictions on foreign individuals or private businesses, and the foundation's previous acceptance of funds from \" repressive regimes \" such as saudi arabia, politico notes. \" all of these countries appear to have a war on women, and i think it's unconscionable, \" rand paul said last month, per politico. \" i don't know how hillary clinton can accept that money. \" ( a woman shouldn't be president anyway, this female ceo says. )",

            "Washington ( ap ) — in spite of criticism over accepting money from foreign governments, the clinton foundation has decided to continue to look abroad for millions of dollars while limiting donor nations to a select group of six. The change in policy comes as former board member hillary rodham clinton undertakes her presidential campaign. In this april 14, 2015, photo, democratic presidential candidate hillary rodham clinton meets with local residents at the jones st. Java house in leclaire, iowa. The board of the clinton foundation says... ( associated press ) the foundation's reliance on funding from several mideast governments that suppress dissent and women's rights — concerns that the state department focused on during her stint as secretary of state — sparked criticism and gave the republican party a new offensive against the leading democrat. Clinton resigned from the foundation's board last week. The bill, hillary and",

( afp/afp/getty images ) since its creation in 2001, the bill, hillary and chelsea clinton foundation has raised close to $ 2 billion from a vast global network that includes corporate titans, political donors, foreign governments and other wealthy interests, according to a washington post review of public records and newly released contribution data. The total, representing cash and pledges reported in tax filings, includes $ 262 million that was raised in 2013 — the year hillary rodham clinton stepped down as secretary of state and began to devote her energies to the foundation and to a likely second run for president. The financial success of the foundation, which funds charitable work around the world, underscores the highly unusual nature of another clinton candidacy.

        "summary": "The company behind the lytro camera calls its technology \" the first major change in photography since photography was invented, \" and reviewers seem to agree. By analyzing and storing all the points of light in any given photo, the lytro allows users to refocus the subject, or focus on an entirely new subject in the frame — after you've taken the picture. An 8gb model, which holds 350 pictures, will run you $ 399; for 16gb or 750 pictures, you ' ll spend $ 499. A sample of the reviews: light field photography, the new tech behind the lytro, is \" hard to explain, but it's amazing, \" writes joshua topolsky in the washington post. \" being able to refocus an image after it's been uploaded to your computer will irrevocably alter your perception of what a photo is, \" and when he first saw a demo, he was \" awestruck. \" it's not perfect — its shape and size are particularly irksome, and there's no flash — but it's definitely a \" game-changer. \" in the new york times, sam grobart agrees that this is a big deal, calling lytro's capability \" astonishing \" and \" fairly mind-blowing. \" the camera \" makes photography almost like cinematography, revealing things vividly in the foreground and background. \" but he agrees that there are still quite a few problems, like the camera's touch screen, and says that he wouldn't shell out for one just yet. ( in a separate blog post, he also worries about the camera's effect on photojournalism. ) \" the consumer point-and-shoot camera has just been reinvented — not tweaked, or remodeled, but actually re-thought from top to bottom, \" declares walt mossberg in the wall street journal, noting that lytro has promised that in the future, you ' ll also be able to change the perspective of a photo or convert it to 3d. But he also cautions that the camera has drawbacks, and — like topolsky — recommends that a lytro should not be your sole camera. \" in many respects, lytro feels like a classic version 1.0 product, fresh and promising but light on features, \" writes edward c. Baig in usa today. Plus, \" there's a definite learning curve using the camera. \" the technology is \" exciting, \" but right now this is probably a product for \" seasoned photographers \" only.",

Speaking at the christian science monitor journalism forum this morning, dan pfeiffer warned reporters that the health care lawsuit initiated by the house speaker against obama was a catalyst for impeachment-happy republicans, according to the huffington post. Pfeiffer's reactions came one day after a house panel voted to authorize boehner's lawsuit, a move that former republican vp candidate paul ryan tells msnbc is necessary to harness the \" lawlessness of the [ obama ] administration. \" at this morning's breakfast, the white house aide cited a rabble-rousing sarah palin, a cnn poll released today showing 57 % of gopers in favor of impeachment, and the ongoing border immigration crisis as his main reasons for believing that an impeachment filing is a nearly done deal. Boehner's spokesman emailed an official sigh-and-eyeroll to pfeiffer this morning about the administration's \" inattention \" to the immigrant influx and the \" mixed signals \" from pfeiffer's breakfast banter, stating, \" it is telling, and sad, that a senior white house official is focused on political games … rather than helping these kids and securing the border. \"",

Matthew visinsky/icon sportswire via getty images the founder of a three-on-three basketball league who claims he was offered a bribe by a one-time qatari diplomat to arrange access to steve bannon said on monday that the former diplomat is the same person photographed with michael cohen at trump tower in december 2016. Big 3 basketball league co-founder jeff kwatinetz told slate that he recognized ahmed al-rumaihi in photos with cohen that were tweeted sunday by attorney michael avenatti. \"yes, 100 percent, \" kwatinetz said when asked if he thought the videos and photos were of ahmed al-rumaihi.

From there, slate took over, headlining a piece late monday night: \"michael cohen's meetings with michael flynn and a qatari diplomat might be the key to unlocking the steele dossier. \" viral speculation followed, with online detectives identifying al-rumaihi, the former head of a $ 100 billion wing of the qatari sovereign wealth fund, in the image and linking"
