Whatever the truth, a forger's \" astonishing \" claim in britain has the art world buzzing, reports the art newspaper. The claim comes from shaun greenhalgh in his new memoir, written while he was serving time for a host of forgeries, as first reported in the sunday times of london. He says that a drawing attributed to da vinci called la bella principessa was actually done by him. \"i drew this picture in 1978 when i worked at the co-op, \" he writes. \" the 'sitter ' was based on a girl called sally who worked on the checkouts.... She was a bossy little bugger and very self-important. \" the painting is currently in the hands of a private collector and would be worth an estimated $ 150 million if it is, in fact, a da vinci. Greenhalgh, though, claims he concocted special pigments and found old material for the canvas to fool the experts. But to make matters a bit more confusing, the telegraph notes that lab tests suggest the painting is about 250 years old, which would mean neither da vinci nor greenhalgh created it. The only thing for certain, argues jonathan jones at the guardian, is that this is not a da vinci — despite an oxford art historian's assertion to the contrary in 2008. \" there is a deadness to this woman's eye, a coldness to the way she is posed and drawn that has no resemblance to leonardo da vinci's energy or vitality, \" writes jones. \" this is a bad artist's impression of the leonardo style. \" ( a scientist unlocked some secrets about an unquestionably legit da vinci painting. )",

No pope before him visited as many synagogues. He met with local jewish community representatives whenever he visited foreign nations. No pope before him made more strides to improve the relationship with the jews – on so many levels. From beginning to end, pope benedict xvi has shown skillful leadership.

Texas a&m researchers explain the part of your brain known as the dorsomedial striatum contains neurons with spiny protrusions, each with two types of dopamine receptors. One type, called d1, encourages action but is structurally altered when large amounts of alcohol are consumed. The alteration causes the neurons to activate with less stimulation and the result is a vicious circle: drinking alcohol causes easier activation and activation tells your brain to keep drinking. \" if these neurons are excited, you will want to drink alcohol, \" lead author jun wang explains in a release. \" you ' ll have a craving. \" the study in the journal of neuroscience explains mice brains exposed to booze had more mature protrusions in d1 neurons compared to brains that weren't exposed to the stuff. Mice with more mature protrusions — where long-term memories are stored — downed large amounts of alcohol when given the chance. However, when the mice were given a drug to block the d1 receptor, cravings diminished. \" this is the major finding, \" says wang. \" d1 receptors are essential for alcohol consumption \" and \" if we suppress this activity, we're able to suppress alcohol consumption. \" wang adds his \" ultimate goal is to understand how the addicted brain works … and once we do, one day, we ' ll be able to suppress the craving for another round of drinks and ultimately, stop the cycle of alcoholism. \" ( get to know history's most high-functioning alcoholics. )",

A study, published in the journal of neuroscience by researchers at the texas a&m health science center college of medicine, finds that alcohol consumption alters the structure and function of neurons in the dorsomedial striatum, a part of the brain known to be important in goal-driven behaviors. The findings could be an important step toward creation of a drug to combat alcoholism. \" alcoholism is a very common disease, \" said jun wang, m.d., ph.d., the lead author on the paper and an assistant professor in the department of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at the texas a&m college of medicine, \" but the mechanism is not understood very well. \" now, wang and his team have helped come a little closer to that understanding. Using an animal model, the researchers determined that alcohol actually changes the physical structure of medium spiny neurons, the main type of cell in the striatum. These neurons can be thought of like a tree, with many branches, and many small protrusions, or spines, coming off of them. They each have one of two types of dopamine receptors, d1 or d2, and so can be thought of as either d1 or d2 neurons. D1 neurons are informally called part of a \" go \" pathway in the brain, while d2 neurons are in the \" no-go \" pathway. In other words, when d2 neurons are activated, they discourage action -- telling you to wait, to stop, to do nothing. Although it is well known that the neurotransmitter dopamine is involved in addiction, this study goes further, showing that the dopamine d1 receptor also plays an important role in addiction. The team found that periodic consumption of large amounts of alcohol acts on d1 neurons, making them much more excitable, which means that they activate with less stimulation. \" if these neurons are excited, you will want to drink alcohol, \" wang said. \" you ' ll have a craving. \" that is to say, when neurons with d1 receptors are activated, they compel you to perform an action -- reaching for another bottle of tequila, in this case.

( associated press ) singapore ( ap ) — north korean leader kim jong un arrived sunday in singapore ahead of one of the most unusual and highly anticipated summits in recent world history, a sit-down with president donald trump meant to settle a standoff over pyongyang's nuclear bomb arsenal. A jet carrying kim landed sunday afternoon amid huge security precautions on this city-state island. After shaking hands with the singapore foreign minister, kim sped through the city's streets in a large limousine, two large north korean flags fluttering on the hood, surrounded by other black vehicles with tinted windows and bound for the luxurious and massively guarded st.

The north korean autocrat's every move will be followed by 3,000 journalists who have converged on singapore, and by gawkers around the world, up until he shakes hands with trump on tuesday.

Krebs got interested in cybersecurity after being a victim of a worm in 2001. A few years later, he launched a blog at the post. Eventually, they asked him to expand its focus beyond cybercrime. He refused, was let go, and started a site of his own. Now he has an international reputation.

Perhaps more worryingly, experts warn this same weakness that let spammers hijack domains registered through godaddy also affects a great many other major internet service providers, and is actively being abused to launch phishing and malware attacks which leverage dormant web site names currently owned and controlled by some of the world's most trusted corporate names and brands. In july 2018, email users around the world began complaining of receiving spam which began with a password the recipient used at some point in the past and threatened to release embarrassing videos of the recipient unless a bitcoin ransom was paid. On december 13, 2018, a similarly large spam campaign was blasted out, threatening that someone had planted bombs within the recipient's building that would be detonated unless a hefty bitcoin ransom was paid by the end of the business day.

        "summary": "Our ancestors didn't choose monogamy out of anything so high-minded as love or religion, according to a new study published tuesday. Rather, it was most likely due to skyrocketing rates of chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea from all the polygamous sex being had. Within hunter-gatherer groups of 30 or fewer people, sti outbreaks would have a minimal effect on the larger population and be over relatively quickly, tech times reports. But as humans took up farming and settled in larger groups, infertility-causing stis would spread rapidly and hurt a group's ability to propagate itself, according to afp. Researchers were able to demonstrate this using computer modeling. \" this research shows how events in natural systems... Can strongly influence the development of social norms, \" researcher chris bauch says in a press release. According to researchers, men with multiple female partners would have greater rates of stis and less chance of reproducing. As monogamous men bore more children, their behavior was copied. It would also benefit monogamous men to punish non-monogamous men in order to secure the future of the group. The study could help explain the mystery of why multiple groups of ancient humans turned to monogamy despite its rarity in the natural world and difficulty in implementing. So, if science cures stis, will we see a return to our swinging ways? \" modern societies are more complicated, \" bauch tells afp. \" i think it is premature to speculate that marriage will disappear, or that polygyny will return. \" ( this study shows raising taxes on booze can reduce sti rates. )",

        "summary": "Pope benedict pledged to remain \" hidden to the world \" when he became pope emeritus and turned things over to pope francis, but some newly surfaced letters are changing that. In them, benedict sends a message to those who prefer his more conservative leadership over francis'relatively liberal style that they're carrying things too far, reports the new york times. A key passage, in a letter published in the german newspaper bild from benedict to cardinal walter brandmuller of germany: \"i can well understand the deep-seated pain that the end of my pontificate caused you and many others, \" he writes. \" but for some — and it seems to me for you as well — the pain has turned to anger, which no longer just affects the abdication but my person and the entirety of my pontificate. \" brandmuller was among the cardinals who signed a 2016 letter to francis seen as a rebuke to him for his position on church doctrine. The tablet assesses it like so: \" the overriding concern from benedict appears to be that his papacy is being devalued by those using it as a political weapon to undermine francis. \" in fact, those who signed that letter are now embracing the extraordinary new call for francis to resign over his handling of church's sex abuse scandal, notes the times. In his letter to brandmuller, the 91-year-old benedict also referred to the \" sadness about the situation of the church today, \" which the tablet notes could be interpreted as him agreeing with francis ' critics on the direction of the church doctrine. But he defended his decision to step down. \"if you know a better way [ i.e. Resignation ] and therefore think that you can judge the one chosen by me, please tell me. \"",

In private letters published on thursday by the german newspaper bild, benedict, who in retirement has remained studiously quiet through the controversies over francis ' fitness to lead the church, says that the \"anger \" expressed by some of his staunchest defenders risks tarnishing his own pontificate. \"i can well understand the deep-seated pain that the end of my pontificate caused you and many others.

The city wants the more than 5,000 subway workers to pay more toward their pensions and benefits in exchange for an 8 % pay hike, the san jose mercury news explains — right now, they're paid an average of $ 83,000 annually, and don't have to contribute anything toward retirement. Bart is the nation's fifth-largest rail system, serving some 400,000 people, the la times reports, but reports vary on how much of a disruption shutting it down has caused. The mercury news says commuters are \" scrambling \" with severe backups plaguing various highways and massive lines for buses and ferries. But the san francisco chronicle says that while buses were indeed packed, the roads weren't that bad. \" if i just awoke today and didn't know there was a bart strike, i wouldn't have thought anything was different, \" says one city official.

        "summary": "Perhaps the most anticipated supreme court case has been decided, and it's a yes for same-sex marriage throughout the land. In a ruling authored by justice anthony kennedy, the court voted 5-4 today that states cannot ban same-sex marriage, the ap reports. Kennedy wrote that gays and lesbians \" may not be deprived of liberty \" or of that \" fundamental right \" to marry, per cnn. Gay couples could already marry in 36 states and dc, but now the other 14 states will no longer be able to ban same-sex couples from doing so. The decision reveals the court's resounding \" yes \" to one of the most important constitutional questions posed in recent times, as worded by the wall street journal in january: \" does the 14th amendment, which guarantees ' equal protection ' and'due process ' of law, forbid states from treating gay couples differently than heterosexual ones? \" the opinion seems to purposely not state a \" standard of scrutiny, \" scotusblog notes. Instead, it asserts \" it is now clear that the challenged laws burden the liberty of same-sex couples.... This denial to same-sex couples of the right to marry works a grave and continuing harm. \" the court wrote an eloquent paragraph in its decision that's now making its way around social media: \" it would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness. \" president obama made his feelings clear as well, sending out a tweet right after the ruling: \" today is a big step in our march toward equality. Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry, just like anyone else. #lovewins. \"",

Today the federal government asked the justices to consider right away whether it can include the question, without waiting for the court of appeals to weigh in on the issue first.

That man was leo sharp, a world war ii veteran and renowned lily grower who had become a drug mule for the sinaloa cartel, writes sam dolnick in the new york times magazine. So how and why did sharp do it? his lawyer claimed dementia and said the cartel had threatened sharp at gunpoint, but a judge wasn't swayed and gave sharp three years in prison. \" it's not a victimless crime, \" the judge said, reports the detroit free press. \" this is a huge drug operation, and mr. Sharp was right in the middle of it. \" once a hugely admired lily hybridizer, sharp grew small flowers in brilliant reds, pinks, and yellows; nearly 180 are registered to his name. He even showed up at day-lily conventions in all-black or all-white suits with an entourage that handed out lilies to swooning fans. \" he was just a stud, \" says one gardener. \" he just had the air. \" one theory has it that when the internet blossomed, he stuck with a paper catalog for his lilies and lost too many customers. His woes intersected with the rise of the sinaloa cartel, which was smuggling massive amounts of cocaine from mexico into arizona safe houses. Sharp became their driver into detroit, and prosecutors say he earned about $ 1.25 million doing it, the detroit news reports.

            "The lincoln pickup truck with iowa plates was hurtling down interstate 94, headed for detroit. A dozen d.e.a. Officers in unmarked cars were scattered along a 70-mile stretch, from kalamazoo to jackson, mich. From on-ramps and overpasses, they watched traffic flash by as they tried to spot the truck. They believed it was carrying a major shipment of cocaine. Special agent jeff moore and his team in the detroit field division had spent months investigating a local branch of the sinaloa cartel, the world's most notorious and powerful drug-trafficking ring, led by joaquín guzmán, known as el chapo. With a sprawling network of distributors, couriers, wholesalers and street dealers, the organization had pumped thousands of kilos of cocaine from the mexican border through arizona safe houses and into detroit. It was by every measure the biggest cocaine operation detroit authorities had ever seen. In previous years, a significant bust might be a dozen kilos; now the cartel was bringing in 200 kilos a month. Moore's colleagues had wiretapped 11 phones and had spent so many hours listening to the drug traffickers ' coded spanish conversations that they knew all the leadership's tics: the wholesaler called juanito had a goofy, childlike giggle; the courier called tata was sometimes the butt of their jokes.

        "summary": "Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in 1922. Now, nearly a century later, a university of arizona archaeologist says that tomb may hold a long-buried secret: the remains of nefertiti. Nicholas reeves says he stumbled upon the possibility while analyzing scans posted online in early 2014 by spanish art-replication experts. The economist reports they were creating a way for tourists to \" visit \" the site without damaging it. \" unprecedented \" high-def color photos of the walls of tutankhamun's tomb — given the number kv 62 — were released, along with a scans of those walls, whose surfaces were painted to such a degree that the \" underlying architecture is almost wholly obscured, \" writes reeves. The long-running assumption has been that bedrock lay beneath. But eying them over the course of several months \" yielded results which are beyond intriguing, \" says reeves. He sees \" indications of two previously unknown doorways... Both seemingly untouched since antiquity. \" reeves believes one passage led to a storeroom, and the other to the former queen of egypt, the stepmother to tutankhamun. Reeves makes his case in a paper titled \" the burial of nefertiti? \" kv 62's modest size has long been considered much too small for a king, with egyptologists theorizing it was a private tomb that was enlarged for tutankhamun's use upon his sudden death. Reeves suggests kv 62 is actually the \" outermost portion of an extended, corridor-style'tomb-within-a-tomb. ' \" the economist writes that if reeves is correct, the treasures found in tut's tomb would be her leftovers, and would provide an intriguing explanation for his iconic funerary mask, which \" sports the strangely unmanly feature of pierced ears. \" the bbc notes egyptian authorities haven't yet commented; an american archaeologist tells the economist a radar scan would be able to confirm any open spaces. \" if i ' m wrong i ' m wrong, \" says reeves, \" but if i ' m right this is potentially the biggest archaeological discovery ever made. \"",

        "summary": "A \" rogue \" operative caused a nearly four-hour power outage across kenya on tuesday, the bbc reports. That agent of blackout chaos: a monkey that fell onto a transformer of the country's leading electric power-generating company, per the ap. In a statement on its facebook page, accompanied by a photo of the primate perched on the transformer, kengen ( short for kenya electricity generating company ) noted the animal had scrambled its way up the gitaru power station and onto its roof, subsequently falling onto the transformer and tripping it. This was the trigger for a domino-like effect in which other machines at gitaru started tripping as well, resulting in the loss of 180 megawatts of power. The ensuing blackout not only shut off the lights across the nation, but also cut access to the internet and \" paralyzed countless businesses, \" the new york times notes. \" kengen power installations are secured by electric fencing which keeps away marauding wild animals, \" the facebook post reads. \" we regret this isolated incident, and the company is looking at ways of further enhancing security at all our power plants. \" distressingly, cnn notes, most of the country probably didn't even notice the power went out: per the world bank, less than a quarter of kenya's population has electric access. As for the monkey, tentatively ided by the times as a \" pesky \" vervet, it didn't turn into a peter gabriel song: kengen says it survived its ordeal and has been turned over to kenya's state wildlife agency. ( could the monkey have been an agent from the chinese military? )",

The guardian has the backstory on the songs \" breaking news, \" \" keep your head up, \" and \" monster \": sony's epic record label professed its \" complete confidence \" in the vocals being jackson's, but sister la toya jackson said she wasn't so sure, and fans agreed, chief among them vera serova, who in 2014 filed a suit against sony, the songs ' producers, and the king of pop's estate. Here's the development: in an attempt to be dismissed as a defendant in the case, sony this week put forth a legal argument that fans have leaped on. In what sony says was a hypothetical, a lawyer for sony said in a hearing something to the effect of \" even if the songs weren't sung by jackson, \" per fortune. The guardian reports court documents contain the line: \" for purposes of the appeal, appellants [ sony ] accept that jackson did not sing all the lead vocals on the cascio tracks. But... Respondents must accept that appellants did not know that someone else was the singer. \" fans pounced, and sony responded, variety reports: \" no one has conceded that michael jackson did not sing on the songs. The hearing on tuesday was about whether the first amendment protects sony music and the estate, and there has been no ruling on the issue of whose voice is on the recordings. \" if jackson didn't sing the vocals, who did? vulture reports the money is on \" mj sound-alike \" jason malachi.",

He ended up dead, as did his 60-year-old father, who suffered a heart attack after trying to calm the situation. The new york times shares the tragedy as an example of india's rising tensions over a precious resource: water. Rahul kumar had been waiting in a line for clean water from a tanker in new delhi in march when the incident occurred, and on thursday, a policy think tank for the country released a report indicating things are on a dismal path — with the country already \" suffering from the worst water crisis in its history. \" at present, 600 million indians face high-to-extreme water scarcity, and the lack of access to safe water kills about 200,000 annually, per the report from niti aayog. By 2030, the country's needs are projected to be twice the available supply. \" we have 4 % of the global water and 16 % of the global population. The minute you bring this statistic into the equation, there is a non-rocket-science understanding of how this has happened, \" samrat basak, a director with the world resources institute, tells cnn. Per the report, 80 % of india's water is used for irrigation, and inefficiently at that. Pri in 2014 took a look at how subsidies to farmers — who in punjab were given free electricity to power the submersible motors required to extract groundwater and were growing water-intensive crops — have fueled the problem. That has some seeing a \" notional price for water, \" as a fix, per al-jazeera, while others counter that conservation efforts are the only feasible solution.",

The airstrike on saturday targeted the funeral of a yemeni official's father, reuters reports. According to al-jazeera, many high-level figures from yemen's houthi-led government were in attendance — some are among the dead and more are still missing. Blame for the airstrike has fallen on the saudi-led coalition that has been fighting houthi rebels in yemen since march 2015. Saudi forces categorically denied participation in the attack, saying their troops had instructions not to target populated areas. Nonetheless, the saudis agreed to cooperate on an investigation after us officials expressed their displeasure. \" us security cooperation with saudi arabia is not a blank check, \" said us national security council spokesperson ned price. \" in light of this and other recent incidents, we have initiated an immediate review of our already significantly reduced support to the saudi-led coalition. \" the tiny gulf nation of yemen has been in the throes of a civil war for well over a year.",

The strikes hit the well-known al-quds field hospital, according to opposition activists and rescue workers, and the city's last pediatrician was among those killed, the syrian observatory for human rights says, per reuters. Syria civil defense, a volunteer first-responders agency, tells the ap that the al-quds hospital and adjacent buildings were struck in four consecutive airstrikes; it adds victims are still buried under the rubble and rescue work continues. An agency video posted online shows a number of lifeless bodies, including those of children, being pulled out from a building and loaded into ambulances amid screaming. The un envoy for syria appealed early thursday for the us and russia to help revive the peace talks and a ceasefire, which he said \" hangs by a thread. \" the february 27 ceasefire has been fraying in the past weeks as casualty figures from violence mount, particularly in aleppo and across northern syria. Airstrikes earlier this week also targeted a training center for syria civil defense, leaving five of its team dead in rural aleppo.

Pat toomey of pennsylvania to vote against betsy devos as secretary of education when the vote is held monday, katherine fritz decided to \" buy \" his vote instead. Aware that devos has donated about $ 55,800 to the republican's campaign, the teacher at a philadelphia community college turned to gofundme to raise that exact amount, report mashable and new york. On thursday, her effort was \" getting more traffic than any other active campaign, \" a gofundme rep tells the huffington post. The campaign has now beat its target and raised more than $ 62,000. Toomey won't see any of it since bribing a politician is indeed a no-no — the money will instead go to three education groups — but fritz hopes to make a point anyway. The campaign is \" about using satire to point out the various ways in which our elected officials can — legally! — take money from the same people that now seek political office, \" she writes on gofundme. Of course, fritz still hopes toomey will vote no on devos; the huffington post notes the moderate senator had earlier this week been identified as the likeliest one to flip, though he has gone out of his way to quash that idea. Two republican senators have said they won't support devos. If one other colleague joins them and all democrats oppose her, devos ' confirmation would be denied.

This time it's former playboy model karen mcdougal, who says she was involved with trump in 2006 and 2007 — around the same time adult film star stormy daniels, who filed a similar lawsuit to break her own silence, says she was involved with him. Mcdougal is suing american media inc., which owns the national enquirer and allegedly paid her $ 150,000 for exclusive rights to her story — which it then never ran. Her current lawyer tells the new york times ami was part of \" a multifaceted effort to silence karen mcdougal \"; the lawsuit claims trump's personal attorney, michael cohen ( who allegedly paid $ 130,000 in hush money to daniels ) was secretly involved in the deal. Mcdougal says that when she started talking to ami representatives in 2016, she didn't know ami's ceo, david pecker, was friends with trump or that tabloids sometimes \" catch and kill \" stories to keep them from getting out. She also says she was misled about the nature of the contract and that her former attorney, keith davidson, colluded with cohen and ami to mislead her, the washington post reports. ( davidson also represented daniels during her $ 130,000 deal with cohen. ) as vox puts it, tuesday \" was a bad day in court for donald trump's efforts to silence women \": in addition to mcdougal's suit, a judge ruled tuesday that summer zervos'defamation lawsuit against trump can proceed.

According to nbc news, police had previously refused to identify tiller, a 10-year-veteran with no record of disciplinary action within the seneca police department, because he was a victim of \" attempted murder \" in the hardee's incident last month and over concerns for his safety. The new york times reports officers suspicious of a possible drug deal stopped hammond's car before tiller opened fire through the open driver's side window. Police say hammond tried to run over tiller prior to the shooting, but the official police report from the scene makes no mention of what happened before the shooting or why tiller believed his life was in danger, according to the post. Based on where the shots were fired from, hammond's family questions the use of deadly force and doesn't believe the officer feared for his life. Dash cam footage of the incidentexists, but it isn't clear when it will be made public, notes the times. A 23-year-old woman in the car with hammond at the time was arrested on suspicion of possessing 10 grams of marijuana.

            "Police said hammond allegedly tried to run the officer over before he fired, but his family disputes that deadly force was necessary, and an autopsy showed the shots came from the side, not from in front of or behind the vehicle. \" i hear them say he was feared for his life, but when you see where the gunshot wounds were in my son, it's hard to believe at that moment in time he was in fear for his life, \" hammond's father, paul hammond, told nbc affiliate wyff on wednesday. Tiller's attorney said in a statement friday that the car was so close that tiller had to \" push off \" the vehicle. \" in order to stop the continuing threat to himself and the general public, two shots were fired by lieutenant tiller in quick succession, \" the attorney, john musetto, said in the statement. There is police dash camera video of the incident, police said. The video has been turned over to the south carolina law enforcement division, which is investigating the shooting, seneca police chief john covington said. Covington had previously refused to release the name of the officer by claiming that he was the victim of attempted murder. Covington said tiller is a 10-year veteran of law enforcement and has been with the seneca police department since"

He told tmz yesterday he was blindsided by wife kim kardashian's decision to file for divorce, and insists he is \"committed to this marriage and everything this covenant represents \" and \"willing to do whatever it takes to make it work. \" kardashian, on the other hand, seems to be taking the harsher road: the huffington post reports that, according to the divorce documents, she wants the court to reject any spousal support requests from humphries. Huffpo also points to a june story from us that delves into the prenup: all kardashian's assets prior to the marriage, as well as her earnings during their time together, are protected, while humphries is entitled to nothing if the marriage fails. At the time, a source said, \"he agreed to that. He's not worried. \" adding insult to injury: kim also gets to keep the $ 2 million ring, tmz notes. Of course, the \"what happened?! \" stories continue to be trotted out: people points to a scene from an upcoming episode of kourtney and kim take new york in which kim gripes, \"how am i going to have my career and live in minnesota? \" ( watch at left for kris'response; it's a classic. ) but sources tell tmz the truth is that kris began \"chasing fame \" as soon as the marriage began to fall apart, and wanted to start \"branding \" his name and making nightclub appearances. Kim — who didn't decide until sunday night to file for divorce — was especially upset that kris hired a publicist, complaining, \"he's not in f**king hollywood. He plays sports. \" or maybe ( our vote is on this one ), the whole thing was a \"hoax and a publicity stunt, \" as sources tell radar. \"kim was never in love with kris. Kris certainly wasn't in love with kim, \" says one. \"it was pretty much an arranged marriage right from the start, \" says another. \"she was never particularly attracted to him, and by all accounts absolutely hated sleeping with him or even having to make out with him. \" click for an infographic showing where kim and kris fall on the list of shortest celebrity marriages.",

He's on the \" kill list \" of america and its allies, he explains in an essay for the independent, and his life is harrowing as a result. At age 6, his son told him he feared being killed by a drone. \" i tried to comfort him, \" jalal writes. \" i said that drones wouldn't target children, but hilal refused to believe me. He said that missiles had often killed children. It was then that i knew that i could not let them go on living like this. \" hence, his essay and his trip to england, where he went on bbc radio this week. His mission: convince the us and the uk not to kill him — and to reconsider their drone strategy. Jalal is a leader of the north waziristan peace committee ( nwpc ), a pakistani government-sanctioned body of community leaders attempting to keep peace between the government and the taliban, the independent explains. He insists that, though he is indeed an opponent of america's drone campaign, his group is a peaceful one — but, as reprieve, the human rights charity representing him, explains, western intelligence believes the nwpc is simply a front to create a safe haven for the taliban. \" singling out people to assassinate, and killing nine of our innocent children for each person they target, is a crime of unspeakable proportions, \" jalal writes of the us campaign. \" their policy is as foolish as it is criminal, as it radicalizes the very people we are trying to calm down. \" click for his full essay.",

Andrew cuomo may have just handed republicans a ready-made campaign ad for his rumored 2020 presidential bid – by declaring wednesday that america \"was never that great. \" the democratic star made the seemingly offhand remark as part of his rebuke of president trump's \" make america great again \" slogan during a bill-signing in new york. But the line drew gasps from the crowd. \"we're not going to make america great again. It was never that great, \" cuomo said, to an awkward blend of gasps and chuckles. \"we have not reached greatness, we will reach greatness when every american is fully engaged, we will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51 percent of our population, is gone and every woman's full potential is realized and unleashed and every woman"

By comparing genetic markers on 52 modern day native american populations and 17 siberian ones, they've concluded that while the americas were mostly populated in an initial wave 15,000 years ago, two smaller subsequent migrations brought the eskimos, aleutians, and the na-dene speaking peoples, the wall street journal reports. The three-migration theory was first put forth by linguist joseph greenberg in 1987, and has been hotly debated ever since, the new york times explains. The dna study is the most comprehensive yet on the topic. \" this is monumental work, \" says one anthropologist, praising \" the enormity of the database and the global approach. \" the study largely vindicates greenberg, but whereas greenberg imagined three completely distinct groups, the study shows that later waves intermingled with the first; eskimos, for instance, inherit about half their genes from first-wavers.",

The prince of wales has given his most open interview in recent years about how he sees the role of monarch compared to that of being heir to the throne, as part of a documentary to mark his 70th birthday next week. In the programme prince charles is asked how he sees the two roles as being different.

Inexplicable no more: it was the cia, reports the bbc. Actually, it was the cia itself that fessed up in this tweet, which reads in part, \" remember reports of unusual activity in the skies in the ' 50s? that was us. \" it then provides a government writeup about the sightings, which weren't caused by alien spaceships but by u2 spy planes being tested. The planes flew above 60,000 feet, which wasn't thought possible at the time, so commercial pilots who saw something so far above them couldn't explain it. The effect was more pronounced at different times of the day and night, and if the u2 planes caught the rays of the sun just right, even people on the ground would see silvery glints of light. The explanation was kept classified for decades, notes the bbc, picking up on a report in the foreign-language aftenposten.",

The post, which depicted buddha wearing dj headphones, was found in violation of burma's religion act, which bans damaging or insulting any religion, sky news reports. The owner of the vgastro bar in yangon, tun thurein, 40, and bar managers htut ko ko lwin, 26, and new zealander philip blackwood, 32, were found guilty of mocking religion today. One of his colleagues said the image was blackwood's idea, but he had apologized and removed it after angry complaints. The judge, however, said blackwood \" intentionally plotted to insult religious belief, \" though it was \" unreasonable only to blame the foreigner, \" reports the afp. Blackwood tells the bbc he is \" disappointed \" with the verdict and plans to appeal. Each of the men were sentenced to two years over the post, but an additional six-month sentence stemmed from resulting protests at the bar. The sentences would include hard labor. The director of fortify rights notes a buddhist nationalist, wirathu, recently called a un human rights envoy a \" whore, \" a comment some say harms buddhism, yet he hasn't been charged. \" these men expressed contrition for what they said was a mistake, but meanwhile extremists like wirathu have incited violence in the name of buddhism, \" he tells reuters. \" what this shows is freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever in burma just as the country heads into a pivotal election year, \" a human rights watch director adds. Burma will soon consider new laws on religious conversions and interfaith marriages, put forth by a buddhist nationalist group linked to wirathu.

As nbc news explains, blumenthal is a longtime ally of both bill and hillary clinton — in fact he covered bill clinton as a reporter in arkansas and later was hired as an adviser to the president in 1997. When hillary clinton tried to hire him at the state department, the white house blocked the move, but that didn't prevent him from exchanging plenty of emails with her. He even had her private email address, unlike ambassador chris stevens, who was killed in the benghazi attack. \"help us understand how sidney blumenthal had that kind of access to you, madam secretary, but the ambassador did not, \" said trey gowdy, chairman of the benghazi panel, reports the washington post. Because he's a friend and confidant, she answered. Blumenthal sent her lots of advice, she said, some of which she took into account and some she didn't. \" i think that the sharing of information from an old friend, that i did not take at face value, that i sent on to those who were experts, is something that makes sense, \" clinton said. \" but it was certainly not in any way a primary source of or the predominant understanding that we had of what was going on in libya and what we needed to be doing. \" gowdy pressed her repeatedly on whether the emails were \" unsolicited, \" reading off some of her responses to him such as \" thanks and keep them coming, \" reports mediaite. Clinton responded that they began as unsolicited, but she sometimes encouraged him to send more. \"i don't know what this line of questioning does to help us get to the bottom of deaths of four americans, \" clinton said. Afterward, gowdy and democrat elijah cummings got into a shouting match over the blumenthal emails, with cummings asking that all of them be released for context.

Now the conservative from utah apparently has another surprise: sources tell politico that he won't serve out his current term and will instead leave office on june 30. He's expected to make this announcement as soon as thursday, reports the washington post. The move will have ramifications given that chaffetz chairs the powerful house oversight and government reform committee, the chamber's primary investigative body. In recent days, the panel had gotten aggressive in its investigation of president trump, with chaffetz telling the fbi to turn over any memos by former chief james comey, including one that might get trump into hot water. As with last month's coverage, there's no real explanation for why chaffetz is leaving. He has said only that he wants to shift into the private sector, and politico's sources think a spot on fox news is a safe bet. Before trump took office, chaffetz had aggressively pursued investigations against hillary clinton and former president obama. House speaker paul ryan says chaffetz hasn't filled him in on any pending departure, but the salt lake tribune reports that it's already causing a political mess back in utah in regard to picking a successor.",

            "\" if we allow for the freelancing, the re-creation of times, places and manner of how an election will actually occur, \" hughes said, \" we are losing that legislative prerogative. \" at the center of the dispute is herbert's insistence that he wants to preserve the ability of 3rd congressional district voters at large to participate and for candidates to qualify for a primary election by collecting signatures. Legislative leaders instead have talked about allowing 1,000 or so party delegates to choose party nominees or even the replacement candidate. A new dan jones &amp; associates poll commissioned by utahpolicy.com found that 76 percent of utah voters prefer that all voters select nominees, and 19 percent favored leaving that decision to party delegates. Herbert could prevail in the argument simply by refusing to call a special session. But the house caucus warned such action would come with a cost. Hughes said leaders are weighing a lawsuit, arguing that any abbreviation of current procedure would violate law — unless the legislature approves changes. He warned \" that could cut off our nose to spite our face \" by causing further delays at a time he wants to see any vacancy filled quickly. However, he said, legislators could file for an expedited hearing with the utah supreme court, so it may not cause too much of a delay and help protect separation of powers. Gop lawmakers aren't alone in opposing the governor on this issue. House democratic leader brian king, d-salt lake city, released a statement urging the governor to call a special session. Hughes said the chairmen of both major state parties and senate leaders also support a special session. \"",

It's a case that npr sees as \" a worrisome new development in the polio end-game. \" live science and the guardian report the man was given an oral form of the polio vaccine at 5, 7, and 12 months. Unlike the injectable version, the oral vaccine uses a live virus that's typically excised from the child's gut within two months. But the man had an immune disorder that killed his gut's ability to kill the virus. And so it has lingered there, and in his stool: more than 100 samples taken over the past 20 years have returned significant levels of what had become a mutated virus. As for how potent that virus has become, live science reports that it was able to paralyze a mouse but was found to be harmless when tested on the blood of vaccinated humans. Just 73 cases of polio living long term in someone's gut have been found in the past 52 years, and only about 10 % of those extended beyond five years. Researchers write that the case \" represents by far the longest period of excretion \" known from \" the only identified individual known to be excreting highly evolved vaccine-derived poliovirus. \" but researchers believe there may be more individuals like him based on sewage samples taken in countries as varied as finland and israel. The implications, per the guardian: it sees the potential for immunocompromised patients like this man to spur a fresh polio outbreak and observes that \" before the disease can be completely wiped out, mutated strains of polio virus derived from vaccines must be tackled. \" ( meanwhile, the cia promises to stop using vaccine campaigns as a cover for spying. )",

        "summary": "Another woman who says indiana attorney general curtis hill inappropriately touched her has come forward, citing the courage of a state lawmaker who earlier went public with her story, as well as hill's refusal to resign. Gabrielle mclemore, a spokeswoman for the indiana senate democrats, told the ap on friday that the republican asked, \" do you know who i am? \" and cornered her at a bar after the state legislative session came to a close in march. She said he proceeded to massage her back, while she worried what people who witnessed it would think. Eventually she mouthed the words \" help me \" to her intern, who interjected by asking mclemore if she wanted to go to the bathroom. Mclemore said she never wanted to come forward. But she said hill's repeated denials were frustrating. She said she also wants to set an example for other women. Meanwhile, hill said friday he will not step down despite a surge of public officials from both parties calling for him to resign. Hill, a former elkhart county prosecutor, said in a defiant statement posted to twitter friday afternoon that he has been \" falsely accused \" and demanded the right to \" face my accusers \" and review any evidence. The first accuser, democratic state rep. Mara candelaria reardon, published her own account of the incident, which occurred at an indianapolis bar on march 15, in the northwest indiana times. She says hill leaned toward her, put his hand on her back, slid it down and grabbed her buttocks. The lawmaker says she told hill to \" back off, \" but he approached her again later, put his hand on her back and said: \" that skin. That back. \" candelaria reardon called on all indiana residents of \" good will \" to demand hill's resignation.",

Italian archaeologists discovered the ship off the coast of liguria in northern italy, near genoa, filled with clay jars containing a condiment once popular across the roman empire, the local reports. \" it's an exceptional find that dates to the first or second century ad, \" says team leader simon trigona. \" it's one of just five'deep sea ' roman vessels ever to be found in the mediterranean and the first one to be found off the coast of liguria. \" the ship might have gone unnoticed if fishermen hadn't pulled up jar fragments in 2012; archaeologists then spent two years looking for the wreck and eventually spotted it last october. The find was announced on thursday. Based on a retrieved sample jar — one of 2,000 to 3,000 on board — the vessel was transporting garum, a fishy, sweet-and-sour sauce that romans apparently poured on just about anything, discovery reports. Made from salted fish intestines, the nutritional condiment contained monosodium glutamate ( still a flavor enhancer today ) and was often used to replace pricier salt. The ship likely left rome for a city in southern spain called cadiz — where garum was mass-produced — and returned along the coasts of spain, france, and italy, \" possibly during difficult weather, \" says trigona. \" [ it ] sank...

And this holiday season he decided to share that obsession with a family he'd never met. It all started when the de peyster family of wellesley, mass., watched the new documentary california typewriter, in which hanks is just one of many luminaries talking up their affection for the old-school writing device. Inspired, the de peyster family patriarch, nick, wrote a letter to hanks asking him for one of his typewriters, saying he had challenged his son, rowan, to type one thank-you note a week, nbc reports. Three months later a package arrived from hanks ' production company, playtone, complete with an olympia typewriter and a letter. In the letter, hanks laid out the terms of the deal: the family has to type one letter a week and buy a typewriter for someone else, or else they have to send the gift back. Hanks also included a typed list titled, \" eleven reasons to use a typewriter, \" mass live reports. Among the entries: \" your penmanship is illegible, \" \" you are too thickheaded to figure out a computer, \" and \" typewriter = chick magnet. \" in uncommon type, his recently published collection of short stories, written on one of his more than 200 typewriters, hanks manages to slip a mention of a typewriter into each story, npr reports. \" short of carving words into stone with a hammer and chisel, not much is more permanent than a paragraph or a sentence or a love letter or a story typed on paper, \" hanks says.",

For archduke dominic habsburg, the romanian fortress is the former home of his grandparents, queen marie and king ferdinand i, who made it \" a happy place of light and flowers. \" today, however, few know anything about the castle except that it served as inspiration for dracula's lair in bram stoker's 1897 vampire tale and might've once held vlad the impaler. Habsburg, 79, who lives in new york, blames the romanian government, reports the wall street journal. After the fall of communism in 1989, the government played up the castle's links to dracula to boost tourism and portrayed its former royal inhabitants \" as the mean exploiters of the poor, \" habsburg says. In reality, the townspeople loved queen marie — who was queen victoria's granddaughter — so much that they gave her the 14th-century fortress in 1920, habsburg says. Since he and his sisters inherited the castle in 2006, they've tried to rid it of its sinister feel by adding furnishings and teaching visitors about its history as a royal residence. Soon, \" the queen's tea house, where she used to receive international visitors, \" will become a restaurant, habsburg says. Yet he knows bran castle's ties to dracula aren't going anywhere. Most of the 800,000 tourists who visit the castle each year — and pass through a parking-lot souvenir area selling everything from plastic fangs to dracula salad dressing — \" come for dracula, \" he says, \" but they leave with the queen. \" ( the castle just hosted a halloween sleepover. )",

The problem is that those rules decree that the mayo be 80 % fat and 7.7 % yolk, and today's consumers don't like that much fat, explains deredactie.be. They're opting instead for imports, which aren't bound by the rules. \" this situation is no longer tenable, \" declares a food industry rep. The government now plans to convene a sort of mayonnaise summit to figure out a compromise — perhaps a special category for \" traditional \" mayo. Stateside, the fda itself has a lengthy definition for mayonnaise, which specifies ingredients both mandatory and optional ( on the latter front, \" any spice [ except saffron or turmeric ] or natural flavoring, provided it does not impart to the mayonnaise a color simulating the color imparted by egg yolk \" may be added, for instance ). That definition matters here, too, which bloomberg pointed out in a november article that cheekily referred to the \" legal case of our time \": hellmann's maker unilever's false advertising suit against hampton creek, a company whose vegan product \" just mayo \" actually contains no eggs. The fda definition stipulates that a product called \" mayonnaise \" must contain egg yolk. Unilever pulled the suit in december. ( here's why you may want to stick with vegan \" mayo. \" )",

            "With all due respect to mustard and ketchup, no condiment has made the last few days in business news quite as delicious as mayonnaise. A week ago, as reported by victoria slind-flor in bloomberg's intellectual property column, the unit of unilever that makes hellmann's mayonnaise ( also sold under the name best food ) sued a competitor, hampton creek, for false advertising. The complaint: hampton creek's \"just mayo \" -- the vegan product with an egg on its label that won the startup company a coveted spot on the shelves of whole foods -- can't be called mayo, or mayonnaise, because it contains no eggs. The food and drug administration says mayonnaise contains eggs, plus a certain percentage of oil. Merriam-webster defines mayonnaise as \"a thick, white sauce used especially in salads and on sandwiches and made chiefly of eggs, vegetable oil, and vinegar or lemon juice. \" all of which should put unilever in the driver's seat -- legally, perhaps,",
            "A royal decree states that real mayonnaise should contain at least 80 per cent fat and 7.7 per cent yolk.

            "With all due respect to mustard and ketchup, no condiment has made the last few days in business news quite as delicious as mayonnaise. A week ago, as reported by victoria slind-flor in bloomberg's intellectual property column, the unit of unilever that makes hellmann's mayonnaise ( also sold under the name best food ) sued a competitor, hampton creek, for false advertising. The complaint: hampton creek's \"just mayo \" -- the vegan product with an egg on its label that won the startup company a coveted spot on the shelves of whole foods -- can't be called mayo, or mayonnaise, because it contains no eggs. The food and drug administration says mayonnaise contains eggs, plus a certain percentage of oil. Merriam-webster defines mayonnaise as \"a thick, white sauce used especially in salads and on sandwiches and made chiefly of eggs, vegetable oil, and vinegar or lemon juice. \" all of which should put unilever in the driver's seat -- legally, perhaps,",

Justin trudeau's government has reinstated a policy that allows doctors to prescribe diacetylmorphine — pharmaceutical-grade heroin — to severely addicted patients if other methods of treatment fail, abc news reports. In vancouver, bc's crosstown clinic, which currently runs the only such program anywhere in the us and canada, addicts come in daily for up to three injections, the washington post reports. Lead physician scott macdonald says his patients are hard-core, long-term users and that one has been using the drug for 50 years. The program \" is a kind of last resort to get them into care, to get them off the streets, \" macdonald says. \" we see them come to us every day rather than stay on the streets. \" giving addicts heroin clearly doesn't cure their habits, experts tell cnn, but it prevents many overdose deaths and reduces both health care costs and crime. Fatal overdoses of illicit drugs have soared in canada this year, and the vancouver sun reported in may that many of those deaths were caused by the cheaper and more potent drug fentanyl. It has almost completely replaced genuine heroin on the streets, although dealers still claim they are selling the real thing. ( an even stronger opioid is killing people in ohio. )",

        "summary": "As expected, president trump signed new russian sanctions into law on wednesday — \" quietly, \" reports the hill. And, it turns out, with loud reservations. Both the house and senate passed the sanctions by overwhelming, veto-proof margins — 517 in favor, just 5 against across both houses — as retaliation for russian interference in the 2016 election, reports the ap. Trump opted not to try to defy congress. But he did release two signing statements. What you need to know: politico reports the white house released two statements ( here and here ) nearly simultaneously. A line from one: \" in its haste to pass this legislation, the congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions, \" including one that \" purport[ s ] to displace the president's exclusive constitutional authority to recognize foreign governments. \" a line from the other: the bill \" remains seriously flawed – particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch's authority to negotiate... And will drive china, russia, and north korea much closer together. The framers of our constitution put foreign affairs in the hands of the president. This bill will prove the wisdom of that choice. Yet despite its problems, i am signing this bill for the sake of national unity. \" for context, bloomberg notes that signing statements are nothing new: george w. Bush and barack obama issued them in instances where they weren't thrilled with what they were signing. So what are the sanctions? the los angeles times has a primer: one set focuses on hobbling russia's ability to export weapons. Another involves its energy sector, and that's one instance where the eu is irked over the possibility of being unintentionally affected: russia and germany are currently working on a natural gas pipeline that would run between them. Two other facets of note, per the washington post: north korea and iran also see new sanctions imposed under the legislation, and no sanctions can be lifted without congress ' ok. Interesting side note from the lat: the bill was born out of concern over north korea and iran's nuclear weapons programs; russia wasn't included until later. Vladimir putin, who continues to deny any such meddling, previously responded to the proposed sanctions with us penalties of his own. One take from ryan lizza of the new yorker: \" trump has expressed more concerns about congress's russia sanctions bill than about putin's expulsion of us diplomats. \" and another from gop arizona sen.

The models cluttered the family home in the town of buhodle in the somali state of puntland. But now that 13-year-old guled adan abdi's motorized inventions have garnered for the boy the promise of a free education, hassan's opinion has changed. She tells the bbc she thinks her son is a genius and that his tinkering, all of which is self-taught, has been a good thing for the family. The teen says he started making plastic toys as a youngster. \" but later i said to myself, ' why don't you make them into a moving machine, ' \" he tells the bbc. So he went around town studying how vehicles work, \" and invented my toys with the same design. \" encouraged by his teacher, who also bought him his first set of batteries, guled has built motorized toys that are operated with a battery-powered controller, per the bbc. Hassan, whose husband died when guled was a baby, tells global voices that she used to leave guled with plastic items to assemble when she went out to work. \" i guess that's how all these wonderful inventions began, \" she says. Earlier this month, guled traveled 170 miles to show his inventions to the president of puntland, who made the promise to fund the teen's education. That's important because, due to family hardships, guled is about five years behind in his schooling, per the bbc. Guled says motorized toys are just a starting point. \" i would like to gradually learn how to become a producer of cars, \" he tells the bbc.",

Authorities were searching for bond, 40, and a man, michael mccarthy, 35, who the daily beast says are persons of interest in the girl's death. Officers say someone close to the girl's family contacted police yesterday because bella hadn't been seen in a while.

        "summary": "\" it felt as though nothing would ever work again — as though the anesthetist had removed everything apart from my soul. \" that's a quote from a woman who woke up during dental surgery some 15 years ago but was unable to move because of the paralyzing drugs she had been given to stop reflex movements. Her story serves as a sort of foreword to a report published last month on the largest-ever study of the nightmare phenomenon. Over a full year beginning in 2012, every patient who reported \" accidental awareness during general anesthesia \" ( aaga ) at a hospital in ireland or the uk had his or her case noted; 300 cases were then investigated, the new scientist reports in a piece picked up by the washington post. The worst part of the experience? in many cases, the aforementioned paralysis, not the pain. \" pain was something they understood, but very few of us have experienced what it's like to be paralyzed, \" the study author explains. \" they thought they had been buried alive. \" in most cases, aaga took place before or after the actual surgery, and didn't last more than five minutes. Even so, 51 % of people reported distress at the scenario, describing sensations of choking, tugging, or stitching, cbs news reports. Some patients experienced difficulty breathing; four said they feared they were dying, and two reported that they believed they were actually dead. Some reported an awareness without pain ( one said it felt like \" being in a crypt, \" with no working body parts beside the brain and ears ). But in another case, the patient \" reported auditory and tactile recall of laryngoscopy and intubation and the start of the surgery. The patient wanted to scream but could not move or speak. The patient developed nightmares, waking up crying in a cold sweat recalling events repeatedly. \" such lingering issues weren't uncommon: the report noted that in 41 % of cases there was moderate to severe longer-term harm. ( the aforementioned pain-free patient experienced ptsd, notes the report. ) the good news? the study found just one case of aaga per 19,000 surgeries using general anesthesia, whereas previous smaller studies found the rate might be as high as one in 500. But since this study only looked at cases volunteered by patients rather than questioning every patient, one anesthetist thinks it likely missed many incidents.",

( bigstock ) if you're facing surgery, this may well be your worst nightmare: waking up while under the knife without medical staff realizing. The biggest-ever study of this phenomenon is shedding light on what such an experience feels like and is causing debate about how best to prevent it. For a one-year period starting in 2012, an anesthetist at every hospital in the united kingdom and ireland recorded every case where a patient told a staff member that he had been awake during surgery. Prompted by these reports, the researchers investigated 300 cases, interviewing the patient and doctors involved. One of the most striking findings, says the study's lead author, jaideep pandit of oxford university",
            "For many people, undergoing surgery and other procedures that require anesthesia can be fraught with anxiety. Some people fear they won't ever wake up after being \" put under, \" a risk highlighted by the recent death of joan rivers after a seemingly routine procedure. Also rare, but worrying, is the possibility of regaining consciousness before an operation is over. This situation is known as \" accidental awareness during general anesthesia \" ( aaga ) and is feared by both patients and anesthesiologists. Now a new study -- the largest of its kind -- finds that approximately 1 in every 19,000 people wake up or become aware of their surroundings after receiving anesthesia. The incidences of accidental awareness during general anesthesia are actually not as high as was previously thought; in prior estimates, experts reported that 1 in 600 surgical patients experienced aaga.

            "Hospitals in the united kingdom and ireland tracked patients who reported regaining consciousness during surgery. \"i thought i was about to die, \" said a girl who was having a dental procedure. ( bigstock ) if you're facing surgery, this may well be your worst nightmare: waking up while under the knife without medical staff realizing. The biggest-ever study of this phenomenon is shedding light on what such an experience feels like and is causing debate about how best to prevent it. For a one-year period starting in 2012, an anesthetist at every hospital in the united kingdom and ireland recorded every case where a patient told a staff member that he had been awake during surgery. Prompted by these reports, the researchers investigated 300 cases, interviewing the patient and doctors involved. One of the most striking findings, says the study's lead author, jaideep pandit of oxford university",
            "For many people, undergoing surgery and other procedures that require anesthesia can be fraught with anxiety. Some people fear they won't ever wake up after being \" put under, \" a risk highlighted by the recent death of joan rivers after a seemingly routine procedure. Also rare, but worrying, is the possibility of regaining consciousness before an operation is over. This situation is known as \" accidental awareness during general anesthesia \" ( aaga ) and is feared by both patients and anesthesiologists. Now a new study -- the largest of its kind -- finds that approximately 1 in every 19,000 people wake up or become aware of their surroundings after receiving anesthesia. The incidences of accidental awareness during general anesthesia are actually not as high as was previously thought; in prior estimates, experts reported that 1 in 600 surgical patients experienced aaga. The latest study, published in the journal anaesthesia",

        "summary": "Despite the fact that none of ashton kutcher's two and a half men episodes have actually aired yet, he's already the highest-paid sitcom actor on tv, earning a whopping $ 700,000 per episode. That's massive considering lead primetime performers typically earn $ 125,000 an episode, reports tv guide, but it's still a far cry from predecessor charlie sheen's $ 1.2 million per episode. Speaking of sheen, his former men co-star jon cryer promised ktla yesterday that sheen's death would be \" funny, \" but said he couldn't reveal much. \" there is no meat explosion, just so you know; it's not some entrée that ends disastrously. \" he also spoke highly of his new co-star, saying, \" ashton just did the show on friday and just tore the roof off the joint. He was amazing. \" watch the video at the huffington post.",

            "A lot of people think tv is better than movies these days. For many actors, it certainly pays better. Unless you're able to play a superhero, it's tough to get super-rich from big-screen work, so more actors are moving to series tv. The expanded talent pool has given networks and studios extra leverage in negotiating salaries. \" there are so few gigantic stars in features and the rest are not making any money, \" says one industry executive familiar with this year's deal-making. \" that's helpful. \" the general rule across the tv business is to keep lead performers on new network prime-time series to $ 125,000 an episode. ( cable networks are going as high as $ 150,000. ) that's not charlie sheen money, but it's not bad. \" times that by 22, [ and ] you can maintain a pretty good lifestyle based on what you were making in features but now you're not, \" the executive says. There are always exceptions for established tv stars. Hit series vets tim allen and kiefer sutherland will get $ 225,000 an episode to go back to the weekly grind in new shows. But with long-running top shows getting more expensive as they get older, studios are serious about trimming budgets in the face of declining ratings.",
