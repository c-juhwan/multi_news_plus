Naresh jain is accused of running a worldwide money laundering empire from his dubai headquarters that handled over $ 2 billion a year from terrorist groups and drug traffickers, the independent reports. Jain, who skipped bail in dubai last year, was known as the \" hawala king \" because of his extensive use of the halawa system of informal, trust-based money transfers in the middle east. \" he operated beyond cultural barriers, money-laundering for various major criminal networks, and his arrest is hugely significant, \" an indian police source tells the telegraph.",

While she says it's \" entirely justifiable \" that we make our borders safer in the face of terrorism, \" our response must be measured and should be based on facts, not fear. \" for example, the idea that our borders are being flooded is all wrong, she says. The us takes in a tiny fraction of the world's refugees, and \" far from being terrorists, \" they are \" often the victims of terrorism themselves. \" and those lucky enough to get here undergo a thorough vetting, despite claims to the contrary. \" if we send a message that it is acceptable to close the door to refugees, or to discriminate among them on the basis of religion, we are playing with fire, \" jolie warns. \" we are lighting a fuse that will burn across continents, inviting the very instability we seek to protect ourselves against. \" it not only sets a dangerous precedent that other countries may follow, it's in complete opposition to american values — and as we learned after 9/11, \" every time we depart from our values we worsen the very problem we are trying to contain. \" click for jolie's full column.

No one apparently did, and preiss was apparently the passenger who'd paid the least, as she explained in a tweetstorm. \" they are kicking me off this flight, \" she posted. Per nbc washington, preiss didn't want to give up her seat because she was headed to a friend's bachelorette party. After calling united \" the worst \" and claiming the airline tried to get her to sign papers saying she willingly gave up her seat, preiss dug the knife in by referencing some of the airline's recent headline-makers: \" on the upside, i wasn't physically dragged off the plane and my dog wasn't killed on board, so i've got that going for me … which is nice, \" she tweeted. After going back and forth with staff on a possible cash reimbursement, united finally offered her a $ 10,000 travel voucher — and two $ 10 meal vouchers. United confirmed to abc that \" yes, we issued this voucher per our policy. \" as for preiss, she calls it \" the best flight delay ever \" and says she's \" pretty pumped \" about the voucher.

In return, a critical number of lawmakers who vowed to oppose pelosi will support her in a crucial jan. 3 house floor vote. Story continued below the proposal also limits the time her two deputies, minority whip steny hoyer ( d-md. ) and assistant democratic leader jim clyburn ( d-s.c. ), can stay in their posts, although those changes will likely have to be ratified by the full caucus. \"over the summer, i made it clear that i see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new members into positions of power and responsibility in the house democratic caucus, \" pelosi said in a statement announcing the agreement. The accord is a major triumph"

The florida man, who had served a decade in prison in connection with a 2001 road-rage incident that ended in a man's death, was himself killed in what police say was another case of road rage. The 40-year-old reportedly stopped his mazda pickup in the middle of dr. Martin luther king jr. Boulevard in plant city early wednesday morning, and robert padgett pulled up behind him. Why isn't clear, but what is clear is that an argument escalated, and padgett shot durham. Responders to the scene found the 42-year-old, who had called 911, giving durham cpr, but he died on the scene, reports wfts. Police are calling the death \" the end result of a road rage incident, \" reports the tampa bay times. On the earlier incident, the ap and st. Petersburg times reported durham and timothy james gibbs argued after their two cars nearly collided on oct. 24, 2001. The two traded hand gestures while driving, then ended up in a parking lot, where a single punch landed gibbs on the ground. Durham left the scene, and gibbs succumbed to a brain hemorrhage and skull fracture nine days later. The prosecutor said gibbs ' hands were by his side when he was hit. Durham was convicted of manslaughter the following year and released from prison in 2012. No charges have been filed against padgett pending a review of the case. What gibbs ' widow had to say to wfla: \" i know it's not the christian thing to say, but this is poetic justice. \" ( this judge handed out an odd sentence in another road-rage case. )",

I beg everyone to never eat there again pic.twitter.com/osblc6h2iv — jonah lupton ( @jonahlupton ) august 2, 2015 jimmy john liautaud has never shied away from controversy in business, but the emergence of these photographs has kicked off calls to boycott the sandwich chain, even though groups that dislike liautaud, trophy hunting, or both have been circulating the images for years: posted by boycott jimmy johns on friday, august 23, 2013 the first photos turned up back in 2011 in smile politely, an alt weekly based in champaign, illinois, which is where jimmy john's is headquartered. They show a man who looks strikingly similar to liautaud posing with a sideways elephant and holding a leopard up with a bear hug. Further, the big-game newsletter hunting report offers trip reports for liautaud's exploits in south africa and mongolia. But neither jimmy john '",
            "The ceo of sandwich chain jimmy john's is the latest target of social media outrage over trophy hunting after old photos emerged that appear to show the executive posing with the bodies of animals he killed on expeditions in africa. Users on twitter shared a hashtag calling for a boycott of the chain, #boycottjimmyjohns, over 500 times in the past two days, while pictures of the ceo, jimmy john liautaud, were retweeted thousands of times. The pictures being shared appear to show liautaud smiling and posing next to the bodies of african elephants, a rhinoceros, and a spotted leopard. There's no evidence that the hunts were illegal. It wouldn't be the first time that liautaud's hunting hobby has threatened to cost his business customers. Back in 2012, a boycott campaign on facebook and a petition on change.org had thousands of supporters who opposed to big game hunting. The boycott's biggest facebook group saw a resurgence in posts after two years of relative inactivity, with users attacking both the ceo and his sandwiches. One commenter declared: \"this man is a disgusting human being. And my only experience with his sandwiches is that they're terrible. Boycott jj every day. \" after an american dentist killed cecil, a beloved and protected lion in zimbabwe, in early july, activists have"

        "summary": "North carolina's governor-elect, roy cooper, will hold onto the traditional powers of the office — at least for a week — after a judge friday temporarily blocked a new law from taking effect, the news and observer reports. In what the ap calls a \" legislative power play, \" the republican-controlled general assembly passed a series of laws during a special session to limit the power of the incoming democratic governor. The law in question, which cooper filed a lawsuit over friday, concerns the state's elections boards. Traditionally, the governor's party gets three out of five seats on the state elections board and two out of three seats on county elections boards, wral reports. The new law splits an eight-member state election board evenly among both parties while giving republicans control of county boards during even-numbered years ( major election years ) and democrats control in odd years. The new law was set to take effect sunday, but judge donald stephens delayed it by at least a week until after another hearing. He says the delay is justified because of the law's potential impact on fair elections. Cooper argues the new law is unconstitutional because it gives too much power to one branch of government. A lawyer for republican leaders in the state's general assembly admits the law would give the general assembly greater control over north carolina elections. Cooper isn't the only one suing over the new laws. On thursday, the state's board of education sued over one that would transfer its power to a new republican state superintendent.

That video suggests zimmerman had a \" cozy \" and \" comfortable \" familiarity with police, an attorney for trayvon's family tells the huffington post. \" it means that he had a relationship with the sanford police department.

After the incident, the orlando sentinel reports, zimmerman urged members of sanford's black churches to come to a city meeting. At that meeting on january 8, 2011, zimmerman — then a criminal justice student — blasted police chief brian tooley, who was ousted from office over the incident. Zimmerman claimed he had witnessed \" disgusting \" behavior on ride-alongs, including officers who took naps and two lunch breaks, or attended parties while on the job. After the meeting, zimmerman turned down an offer for another ride-along. In august 2011, zimmerman began emailing the sanford police about a recent wave of burglaries, asking the department to host a neighborhood watch presentation in the community. At that point, the relationship between zimmerman and police had clearly turned \" cordial, even friendly, \" cnn notes. On september 18, 2011, zimmerman emailed then-chief bill lee ( who eventually stepped down in the martin scandal ) praising his department after working with the community volunteer coordinator on the neighborhood meeting. The meeting, held on september 22, urged residents to \" report suspicious persons... Activities... Or vehicles. \"",

Kennedy's 1960 speech calling for the rigid separation of religion and politics. \"what kind of country do we live in that says only people of nonfaith can come into the public square and make their case? \" mr. Santorum said on the abc news program \"this week. \" \"that makes me throw up, \" he said, adding later, \"i don't believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute. \" his rival mitt romney, who has struggled to persuade conservatives of his ideological commitment, made his own, subtler case to the same constituency on sunday.

        "summary": "Tesla and spacex founder elon musk's new venture isn't rocket science — it's brain surgery. The futurist entrepreneur's new company, neuralink corp., plans to merge human brains with computers, insiders tell the wall street journal. The computer interface would become part of the brain with the help of tiny electrodes and a technology called \" neural lace, \" a term first used in the sci-fi novels of scottish writer iain m. Banks. The technology would apparently be used initially to help people with intractable brain disorders like epilepsy. If it proves to be a success in that area, the journal's sources say it could be used to improve human brain function to keep up with artificial intelligence — and to download people's thoughts. In remarks last year, musk complained about the \" ridiculously slow \" human output level, especially when it's \" just two thumbs tapping away \" on a phone. \" our input is much better because we have a high bandwidth visual interface into the brain, \" he said. \" our eyes take in a lot of data. \" insiders say neuralink plans to start off by building on existing technology used to treat parkinson's disease, which techcrunch notes is the \" musk standard playbook \" for setting out a path to more ambitious goals, like landing on mars. The journal reports that neuralink has already hired some leading academics specializing in electrodes and neuroscience — and facebook is also hiring \" brain-computer interface engineers. \" ( in his spare time, musk is trying to solve an australian problem. )",

Neuralink, the new venture, officially broke cover thanks to a wall street journal article today, though it's been known for some time that musk was working on brain-computer interface tech as a means to help ensure humans can keep pace with the accelerating development of artificial intelligence.

But almost a century after the 400 pine trees were planted in what is now known as poland's krzywy las, or crooked forest, the reason for the deformity remains a mystery, reports the new york times. Officials in the nearby town of gryfino believe the trees were warped seven to 10 years after they were planted in the 1930s, reports weather.com. But, perhaps because gryfino was destroyed in world war ii, no record of the trees or reason for the shape has been uncovered, leading to theories ranging from heavy snowfall to witchcraft, per business insider. Others believe the trees may have been flattened by german tanks during the war. But as the crooked trees only appear on less than an acre in a larger forest, that seems unlikely, per weather.com. Genetic mutations have been known to warp other trees, including in canada's crooked bush. However, such trees don't suddenly grow smooth and straight after curving only at the base, as those in the crooked forest have done, an expert tells the times. Most are comfortable assuming that farmers bent the trees in the hope that they could use their wood for ship building, as gryfino lies just 50 miles from the baltic sea.

Yamato tanooka hasn't been seen since his parents say they left him for roughly five minutes in the woods and returned to find him gone. The guardian reports that a 180-person search party on the northern island of hokkaido was combing the area, which has been expanded; dogs and horses have joined the search as well. One thing that search teams did reportedly find: fresh bear droppings. Yamato had no food or water on him, and was wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and a jacket when he went missing, reports the afp. Sunday night saw heavy rain and temperatures that fell to 44 degrees; australia's abc news says heavy rain is again expected tuesday night. Whether the parents will be charged with neglect remains unclear. The boy's father, takayuki tanooka, tells tv reporters that what he and his wife did was \" an unforgivable thing...

And not by a little bit: in the world's most suicidal countries, the male suicide rate is often six or eight times the female rate ( quartz has a pretty staggering graphic here ). \" the mystery is why? what is it about being male that leads to this? \" for rory o ' connor, president of the international academy of suicide research, part of the answer is what he calls \" social perfectionism. \" it seems our definition of what a man is is \" stuck in the 1950s, \" storr writes — breadwinner, protector, stoic. And the absence or loss of that is devastating to men. \"we've found this relationship between social perfectionism and suicidality in all populations where we've done the work, \" says o ' connor, \"including among the disadvantaged and the affluent. \" some of the factors that o ' connor thinks are at work in a really complicated puzzle: the sense that manhood can be lost: \" when a woman becomes unemployed, it's painful, but she doesn't feel like she's lost her sense of identity or femininity, \" says a clinical psychologist. \" when a man loses his work he feels he's not a man. \" echoes a psychologist: \" a man who can't provide for the family is somehow not a man anymore. \" the man as an island: \" the first rule is that you must be a fighter and a winner, \" says the clinical psychologist. \" the second is you must be a provider and a protector; the third is you must retain mastery and control at all times. \" while this can benefit men generally in society, it isolates them further in their dark hours. \" although women might think about suicide very seriously, \" says a cambridge psych prof, \"because of their social connectedness, they may also think, 'my god, what will my kids do?'so there's forbearance from completing the act. \" men are less likely to flinch: while more women attempt suicide, stoll writes that in western society, more men actually succeed. Some of this is due to method: men often turn toward guns or hanging, while women often use pills. \" you can't act unless you also develop a fearlessness of death, \" says a florida state prof, who says that men aren't as likely to \" flinch. \" the full piece is worth a read.

Air force says it disciplined five former commanders at a texas base for not reporting problems quickly or taking appropriate action in what has turned into the military branch's worst sex scandal. The confirmation came as the 18th military trial in the scandal started wednesday. A former wing commander, a former group commander and three former squadron commanders, as well as a senior noncommissioned officer, were disciplined last autumn after an investigation into instructor sexual misconduct at joint base san antonio-lackland, said maj.

            "Arlington, va. — as the air force struggles to come to grips with sexual assault in its ranks, it endured another high-profile setback: the chief of its sexual assault prevention and response branch was arrested this weekend and charged with sexual battery. Lt. Col. Jeffrey krusinski, 41, of arlington, va., was arrested early sunday morning, according to the arlington police. He's accused of approaching a woman in a parking lot and grabbing her breasts and buttocks, according to the crime report. He has been removed from his position, said air force spokeswoman lt. Col. Laurel tingley. Krusinski was released sunday on a $ 5,000 personal recognizance bond. On capitol hill to testify on the defense budget, air force chief of staff gen. Mark a. Welsh iii told the senate armed services committee on tuesday that the air force has requested jurisdiction in the krusinski case from prosecutors in arlington, where he will be arraigned on one count of sexual battery. A decision on jurisdiction should be made at that time, welsh said. \"we have requested jurisdiction, which is standard procedure in cases like these, \" welsh said.

Deputies say they took a knife and stun gun from smith, and that once in custody he kept repeating, \" they killed my son \" ( he told them his son had been a us marine killed in afghanistan ); it hasn't yet been confirmed he had a son who was killed overseas. Smith also accused the students of \" making a ruckus \" and pulling a gun on him; deputies found no gun. A mcdonald's manager on duty said she was a witness and backs up the men's story. The deputy who filled out the police report also noted smith's breath smelled like alcohol. Smith faces charges of assault, trespassing, and burglary, and hate crime charges may also follow after the state attorney's office reviews the case.

        "summary": "Media attention from the justin ross harris case has placed citizens on high alert for children stuck in hot cars — and shoppers at a strip mall in katy, texas, are the latest to come to the rescue. The group smashed in a car window yesterday to free two young children trapped inside a jeep as temperatures outside rose into the 90s, but contrary to khou's initial report, this wasn't an instance of neglect. Khou initially spoke with gabriel del valle, who shot a video on his smartphone showing at least four people trying to free the boy and girl from the car and indicated that the mother had left them there while getting a haircut. Khou now talks to other witnesses who say the mother accidentally locked her kids in the car after finishing her shopping — with kids in tow — and pleaded with other shoppers for help. The owner of a postal store says he has surveillance video that proves the kids were with the mom in his store and all exited together. Further, khou spoke with the mother, who said that her insurance company told her it would take two hours to get someone to the scene to open the doors. At that point she reportedly returned to the store asking for help, per the video; a hammer in the store was used to bust the window, and the mother then enters the car through the broken window. Del valle refused to be interviewed a second time by khou. ( meanwhile, a toddler managed to save an elderly man who was stuck in his hot car. )",

Researchers started off by measuring animals ' eyelashes, which were always one-third the width of the eye. Such natural lashes apparently protect against dirt and drying by creating an area of stagnant air in front of the eye. Researchers then studied synthetic lashes attached to artificial eyes made from aluminum caps filled with water, science reports. When the lashes were natural length, they reduced particle accumulation and evaporation by half in a wind tunnel. But at longer lengths they actually funneled air into the artificial eyes, drying them out and carrying in particles like dust. Tests haven't confirmed the same long-lash effect on women, but one doctor says she often sees dry-eye cases when mascara is used to lengthen lashes. \" dry eye is multifactorial, but i think this could be a contributing factor, \" she says. A corneal surgeon in los angeles says other, worse problems can result from eyelash extensions. Acids in the glue used to attach fake lashes can hurt the cornea, she says, and extensions can point toward the cornea and cause \" corneal abrasions \" when eyelashes grow out. The study, presented at the society for integrative and comparative biology, has an odd side-benefit: it may also lead to self-cleaning devices on planetary rovers and other machines.

Eyelashes are important for keeping eyes moist and clean, and when lashes get too long they don't do these jobs as well, researchers reported here this week at the annual meeting of the society for integrative and comparative biology. Scientists have long thought that eyelashes either protect the eye from the sun or catch dust that might otherwise land in the eye. But researchers at the georgia institute of technology wondered if lashes did more. They first measured lash length and eye width in 22 preserved mammals ranging in size from hedgehogs to giraffes. In all species, lash length was about one-third eye width, suggesting lashes had evolved to be a particular size relative to the eye. The researchers then made artificial eyes, attaching synthetic lashes and other materials to small water-filled aluminum caps and monitoring the \"eyes ' \" water loss and particle accumulation in a small wind tunnel.

They first measured eyelash lengths in the animal kingdom and soon came up with an intriguing result.

They first measured eyelash lengths in the animal kingdom and soon came up with an intriguing result. No matter whether it was a giraffe or a hedgehog, the length of the eyelashes was always one-third the width of the eyes. To better understand this specialized ratio, they constructed a model eye with different lash lengths that they could subject to breezes in a wind tunnel. Lashes with the typical one-third ratio tended to protect the eye"

Politico takes a look at the small country in the horn of africa ( it's the size of new hampshire ) and the continually expanding military presence there. It hosts more foreign bases than anywhere else in world, a fact politico attributes to its strategic location at the mouth of the red sea, where it sees \" a large percentage of the trade and energy flows between europe and asia. \" france set up shop there first; italy and britain have a presence, per the new york times; china and japan have but one foreign base each, and it's there. Saudi arabia is coming, and there are whispers that turkey, russia, and india could, too. If we get to that point, bruno maçães writes that every big global power will have a presence there, and that raises some big questions for him. Here's one: what happens if two major players — say, china and india — go to war, and just happen to have bases near one another? here's another: would a country ever decide to avoid full-scale war but launch an attack on a rival's djibouti base? as a member of djibouti's intelligence service tells maçães, \" world war iii will start here. \" quartz also floats the idea that the situation could imperil djibouti itself. It has increasingly welcomed foreign militaries under current president ismael omar guelleh, who flung open the country's doors post-9/11 in exchange for hefty fees ( the us pays $ 63 million a year ). But the head of a think tank that's focused on the region warns that \" the horn of africa and the middle east are currently rough neighborhoods, and djibouti may find itself making enemies, not through any action of its own, but as a consequence of the actions of its military guests. \"",

President milos zeman and other officials announced this week that they plan to ask the united nations to update the name to \" czechia \" instead of the longer name it has been known by since czechoslovakia split up in 1993, the guardian reports.

The go czechia website makes the case for the new name by listing 16 myths, explaining that the name was used as early as 1634. It says that while the name \" might sound strange to some people the first time they hear it, \" so do names like massachusetts and utah.

Why now? \" the recession is ending — we think it's ending — for some people, so we might attribute a rise in the birth rate \" to the economy, says a demographer. \" i think as people feel their paycheck is more stable, it feels like a safe environment to have a child in, \" a researcher adds. The teen birth rate continues to decline, falling to a historic low of 249,067 births last year. That's a 9 % drop from 2013, when 305,000 teen moms gave birth. The birth rate among women 15 to 19 has now fallen by 60 % over 25 years. The study author called the result \" amazing. \" still, \" there remains room for improvement to help teens be in charge of their own fertility and only get pregnant when they wish to get pregnant, \" a researcher says. The birth rate among single young women also fell, alongside a 2 % drop among women in their 20s. As the data was gathered from us birth certificates, women's decisions for having children weren't considered. ( this country now has the world's lowest birth rate. )",

On top of that, deane's team found that copper accumulation in the brain causes inflammation in brain tissues. At low levels and for short durations, that may be a good sign that brain tissues are responding to the danger of excess beta-amyloid proteins and are trying to expel them, deane said.

            "New research finds that copper in amounts readily found in our drinking water, the foods we eat and the vitamin supplements we take likely plays a key role in initiating and fueling the abnormal protein build-up and brain inflammation that are hallmarks of alzheimer's disease. While the mineral is important to healthy nerve conduction, hormone secretion and the growth of bones and connective tissue, a team of researchers from the university of rochester medical center suggested that too much of it may be a bad thing, and they set about to explore copper's dark side. What they found, said neuroscientist rashid deane, is \" pretty scary \": a steady diet of copper, even at entirely allowable levels, breaks down the barrier that keeps unwanted toxins from entering the brain, and that it fuels an increase in production of beta-amyloid but impedes the performance of proteins that clear the stuff from the brain. On top of that, deane's team found that copper accumulation in the brain causes inflammation in brain tissues. At low levels and for short durations, that may be a good sign that brain tissues are responding to the danger of excess beta-amyloid proteins and are trying to expel them, deane said. In time, however, neuro-inflammation can overwhelm the brain and begin to damage cells, he added. Copper is found in"

He resigned from the weinstein company's board of directors tuesday, more than a week after he was fired from his role as co-chairman of the company following a reportedly explosive board meeting. Per tmz, weinstein's contract specified that if he was fired, the board must ratify the firing after a five-day \" cooling off period, \" which it did today; the contract states that if the firing is ratified, weinstein must resign from the board, and sources say he agreed to do so. It remains to be seen whether he ' ll take legal action for his termination; his lawyer has previously said she does not believe the company had the right to fire weinstein and the plan is to file a lawsuit if the company refuses to go into arbitration. It's also unclear what will become of the roughly 20 % stake weinstein owns in the company, the ap reports. Five other board members have resigned in the wake of the allegations of sexual assault and harassment against weinstein, the los angeles times reports. Business partners have also been cutting ties with the company, and on monday, a board member said it was exploring a total or partial sale to a private equity firm. Tmz says that firm plans to change the name and institute new partners, and adds that bob weinstein would no longer be in charge.

Tv series the mist, tells variety bob weinstein repeatedly attempted to romance her for three months around the summer of 2016, until her lawyer told weinstein co. Execs she would leave the show unless he stopped contacting her personally. Bob weinstein's rep says weinstein had dinner with segel once and never behaved inappropriately, but segel says during that dinner he asked her intimate questions and tried to get her to come back to his hotel room. She says from that point on he continued asking her out despite her repeatedly declining.",

Yep, the fox news host is shown posing with a soldier, at a basketball game with bill o'reilly, and reporting from what looks like the scene of a nasty storm — each time clad in a hoodie. Msnbc host melissa harris-perry yesterday unveiled a \" dress code for black safety...

The san francisco chronicle rounds up some of the best twitter reactions ( click to read all ). Our favorite: @mollycrabapple: \" according to geraldo, guns don't kill people. Racist gun owners don't kill people.

Paterno could have alerted the entire football staff, in order to prevent sandusky from bringing another child into the lasch building. \" the 267-page report, compiled over eight months at the request of university trustees, also points to \" critical \" emails from 2001 that were earlier reported by cnn about a proposed plan to report sandusky to police after learning about the shower incident. \" after mr. Curley consulted with mr. Paterno, however, they changed the plan and decided not to make a report to the authorities, \" says the report, creating \" a dangerous situation for other young boys. \" and a very dangerous situation for one boy in particular: \" they exposed this child to additional harm by alerting sandusky, who was the only one who knew the child's identity, about what ( mike ) mcqueary saw in the shower on the night of february 9, 2001. But the damning evidence goes back to earlier years. The report says spanier, schultz, paterno, and curley were well aware of a 1998 investigation into sandusky. No criminal charges were filed, but the four decided not to clue in trustees.

Though other zoo animals were evacuated, officials say no one anticipated how quickly the floodwaters would rise, and that euthanization was the most humane choice. But across cyberspace, angry commenters wondered why the zoo, which had two days to prepare, did not evacuate the bison earlier, the philadelphia inquirer reports. Usa today adds that the floods currently overwhelming the northeast are the worst in nearly 40 years. Elsewhere in pennsylvania, two buildings collapsed in the philadelphia suburbs, and flooding is expected to continue in that area and perhaps get worse, the inquirer notes. Meanwhile, three more people, including a 12-year-old boy swept away while playing in his backyard, died in flash floods as torrential rains also hit the dc region, the washington post reports. Major highways have been shut down, schools and government buildings closed, trains halted, and hundreds forced to evacuate as rain fell there, sometimes as quickly as four inches an hour.

The federal reserve's \" report on the economic well-being of us households, \" which surveyed 12,000 people nationwide in late 2017, found things aren't much better on the retirement horizon, with less than 40 % of non-retired adults thinking they ' ll have enough saved up once they retire; 25 % say they don't have a pension or other retirement savings at all. One in four adults had skipped medical treatment over the past year due to lack of funds. Greg mcbride, a bankrate.com analyst, tells cnnmoney these findings are \" troubling. \" \" nothing is more fundamental to achieving financial stability than having savings that can be drawn upon when the unexpected occurs, \" he notes. Still, the news isn't all bad. Nearly three-quarters of adults said they were living comfortably ( or, at the very least, felt \" ok \" about their finances ) — 10 more percentage points than in 2013. And that 40 % without $ 400 emergency cash on hand is actually better than the 2013 figure, which hovered around 50 %. These stats, however, come with \" notable differences … across various subpopulations, \" with blacks and hispanics having \" substantially lower overall economic well-being \" than whites. Mcbride says people can put more away for a rainy day by having money automatically funneled into a savings account on payday. A new figure of note: about 20 % of adults say they know someone hooked on opioids, with \" those who have been exposed to addiction [ having ] somewhat less favorable assessments of economic conditions \" than those who haven't.

The pentagon is toying with the idea of turning tinian and pagan — small us territories in the northern mariana islands — into a place to stage war 16 weeks a year. What locals ( who are us citizens ) think: pagan's mayor says the people are 100 % against the move, which some equate to an \" invasion, \" the guardian reports. While pagan has been uninhabited since a 1981 volcanic eruption, mayor jerome aldan says about 50 families aim to return to the 10-mile-long stretch of land. Tinian's 3,000 residents — some of whom own land already leased to the military — could be forced onto a 10-square-mile area. And the plan, which could be put into action by 2017, doesn't just affect people. Biologist mike hadfield describes pagan as a \" biological treasure trove \" boasting rare fruit bats and tree snails. A rep for the marine corps in the pacific told the los angeles times last month, \" we would protect it like it was our own. \" ( hadfield's response: \" anyone who believes the us marines and navy when they say they ' ll leave the place better than they found it must be slightly crazy. \" ) the weeks of war games could see major amphibious assaults, ground maneuvers, and the placement of bombing targets on mt. Pagan. Why here? the next decade will see thousands of marines relocated to guam from okinawa; the pentagon is scrambling for training sites in the region. Pagan is just 330 miles north of guam and has been ided as having beaches big enough for sizable amphibious assaults — though the times points out the marines haven't staged such an assault in a combat capacity since 1950.
