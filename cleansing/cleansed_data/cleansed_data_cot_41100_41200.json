The 12- and 13-year-old girls say they managed to flee to a neighbor's house when a 34-year-old man living in the house kicked in the door of their room while armed with a knife and threatened them; the neighbor called 911. Police found a 17-year-old girl in another locked room; the girls say she was kept separate from her younger sisters and they had not seen each other for as long as two years. The man and a 32-year-old woman, both described by the republic only as \" relatives \" of the girls, were arrested and charged with physical and emotional child abuse and kidnapping; the man was also charged with one count of sexual abuse. The arizona daily star says the man and woman are the girls ' mother and stepfather, and identifies them as sophia and fernando richter. The girls say they were only given food once a day and hadn't bathed in as many as six months. \" they were kept in filthy living conditions, \" says the police captain. A neighbor tells 3tv she didn't know anyone lived at the house. \" if there were kids, they never came out and played. \"",

Police say dna taken from the can matches dna from stavik's body. Bass, who now lives in everson, wash., was arrested tuesday on suspicion of first-degree murder, kidnapping, and rape, per the bellingham herald. His bail has been set at $ 1 million.

According to court documents, she said bass told her \" people have made me so angry before and i can see why people murder other people. \" his wife also said bass watched tv shows about cold cases and once told her, \" i wouldn't get caught because i ' m not that stupid. It would be easy to get away with it. \" bass ' wife filed for divorce around the same time. Both the divorce filing and protection order were retracted months later when the pair reconciled.

        "summary": "It's what the new york times calls \" one of the most intriguing literary mysteries in recent history. \" but now elena ferrante, author of several best-selling novels who has lived under that pseudonym since the early 1990s, appears to have been unmasked by italian journalist claudio gatti. In a lengthy piece for the new york review of books, he names italian translator anita raja as the true author behind books including my brilliant friend, those who leave and those who stay, and the story of the lost child. Citing mostly financial documents that point to raja, including payments from ferrante's publishing house and real estate purchases as the books became increasingly successful, gatti says raja, the daughter of a german-born mother who fled the holocaust, has left a trail of \" financial clues \" that \" leads directly \" to her, though the identification is not ( and may never be ) officially confirmed. Ferrante's name became a household one around the world in recent years with her novels selling in more than 40 countries, and others have previously speculated that raja, along with novelist husband domenico starnone, could be behind ferrante. This is by far the most thorough investigation, however. With the apparent outing of raja, ferrante publisher sandro ferri, who is one of the few said to know the author's true identity, tells the guardian that \" this kind of journalism is disgusting, \" and many seem to agree. Jezebel calls gatti's piece \" both grandiose and cruel, \" while ferrante herself said in the paris review last year that, \" what has never lost importance for me... Is the creative space that absence opened up. \" literature, she added, should not \" require ' external ' credentials. \" ( jk rowling also chose to write under a pseudonym. )",

Suddenly, all was not fine. An hour into the cruise, kim felt off. \" i had some cramping, and i thought it was maybe braxton hicks contractions. \" back at the hotel, kim's legs started \" shaking uncontrollably, \" she says. \" but i never thought it could be labor. \" once at a hospital, \" doctors started flooding into the room, \" she says, while fred was forced to wait in the lobby. \" everyone spoke portuguese so i had no clue what was going on. The only thing i understood was ' breathe, ' which a nurse kept repeating. \" eleven minutes after kim was admitted on mother's day, son hudson charles was born weighing just 1 pound, 12 ounces, followed by daughter hayden grace at 1 pound, 7 ounces. \" everyone kept saying how tiny they were and that they would do everything they could to save them, \" kim says, but hudson died on memorial day, reports usa today, adding the cost of expatriation to mounting medical costs and incredible heartbreak. For hayden, there are good days and bad. \" it's one moment, one hour, one day at a time, \" kim tells my fox philly.

The guidance issued in 2011 threatened schools with loss of funding under title ix if they didn't do enough to protect their students from harassment, assault, and rape. But devos says the new policy \" weaponized the office for civil rights \" against schools and students. She says she wants it replaced with a \" fair system, \" usa today reports. Devos said the obama-era guidance created \" kangaroo courts, \" relied on a lower standard of proof than criminal courts, and used an \" overly broad definition of sexual assault and harassment. \" \" if everything is harassment, nothing is, \" she said. It's unclear what the trump administration will replace the guidance with, though the process is expected to take months and the results to anger advocates for victims of sexual assault. Fatima goss graves, president and ceo of the national women's law center, says repealing the obama-era guidance is a \" blunt attack on survivors of sexual assault. \" \" it sends a frightening message to all students: your government does not have your back if your rights are violated, \" she tells politico.",

The story first leaked in 1975, but for decades the cia was tight-lipped about it — so much so that the phrase \" neither confirm nor deny \" is sometimes known as the \" glomar response \" in honor of the ship that conducted the salvage operation, the hughes glomar explorer, io9 reports.

The cia knew it needed a recovery ship with a secret opening bottom, a giant barge, and a \" capture vehicle \" to grab the sub. The agency's cover story for this massive setup: it was a hughes foray into deep ocean mining. Hughes, henry kissinger reasoned in a now-declassified memo, \" habitually operates in secrecy, and his personal eccentricities are such that news media reporting and speculation about his activities frequently range from the truth to utter fiction. \" the op was only partially successful — and abandoned after the press leak — but it did become the basis for a 1977 james bond movie.

The story begins in march 1968, when a soviet golf ii submarine — carrying nuclear ballistic missiles tipped with four-megaton warheads and a seventy-person crew — suffered an internal explosion while on a routine patrol mission and sank in the pacific ocean, some 1,900 nautical miles northwest of hawaii. The soviets undertook a massive, two-month search, but never found the wreckage. However, the unusual soviet naval activity prompted the u.s. To begin its own search for the sunken vessel, which was found in august 1968. The submarine, if recovered, would be a treasure trove for the intelligence community. Not only could u.s. Officials examine the design of soviet nuclear warheads, they could obtain cryptographic equipment that would allow them to decipher soviet",

The us national security agency ( nsa ) has been accused of intercepting emails and messages from ms rousseff, her aides and state oil company, petrobras. The allegations were based on documents leaked by fugitive former intelligence contractor edward snowden. President barack obama had promised to investigate the incident. The white house said he had telephoned ms rousseff on monday to discuss the matter.

The us national security agency ( nsa ) has been accused of intercepting emails and messages from ms rousseff, her aides and state oil company, petrobras. The allegations were based on documents leaked by fugitive former intelligence contractor edward snowden. President barack obama had promised to investigate the incident. The white house said he had telephoned ms rousseff on monday to discuss the matter. The allegations of widespread espionage against brazilian citizens were first published in july by rio de janeiro-based journalist glenn greenwald, a reporter for the british guardian newspaper. Mr greenwald alleged that the nsa accessed all internet content that ms rousseff had visited online. Analysis the brazilian president was caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.

A bill moving through the legislature there would prevent driver's licenses and other dmv documents from being issued to dead people. A march 2015 audit of its motor vehicle commission found that driving documents were released to more than 300 people who, according to the social security administration, were dead, reports nj.com. In response to the discovery, assemblyman wayne deangelo sponsored a bill that would require the mvc to check ssa's records on a monthly basis. The proposed legislation was released by the transportation committee yesterday and moves to the house, per an nj.com update. Unfortunately, ssa has its own issues with keeping track of who's dead or alive. About 9,000 living people are declared deceased by the agency each year, according to a report by cbs news published in march. There are also millions of deceased persons — including about 6.5 million over the age of 111 — that the office shows as still being alive. ( the ssa's inspector general guesses there are actually only 10 people over 111 who are alive in the us. ) and since social security numbers are used in just about every legal transaction, the problems at ssa pour into countless other government offices, banks, credit reporting agencies, and other life-affecting organizations. The ssa says it is working on it. \" we... Work very hard to correct errors when we learn of them, \" a spokesperson told cbs.",

        "summary": "\" you would think that the deepest part of the ocean would be one of the quietest places on earth, \" says noaa research oceanographer robert dziak, but it's not so. Noaa, with the help of partner scientists, recently listened in on the deepest point of the ocean and found what a press release calls a \" cacophony of sounds. \" some of those sounds were natural ( the moans of baleen whales, a typhoon that passed overhead, earthquakes, and, per the coast guard, underwater volcanoes ) while others were created by humans ( ship propellers and, per livescience, submarines and \" underwater construction projects \" ). The agency wanted to determine how noisy it is down there in order to establish a baseline, so that, as human-created noise continues to increase, future scientists can see if the noise level at the bottom of the ocean is also increasing — and, if so, what effect that increase might be having on marine animals that use sound to communicate, find their way around, and find food. In order to monitor the ambient noise at the bottom of the ocean ( which you can listen to here ), a ceramic hydrophone encased in titanium was dropped to the ocean floor — in the challenger deep, an underground trough in the mariana trench near micronesia that is \" deep enough to hold mount everest \" at more than 7 miles — where it recorded for 23 days in july. Scientists know human-created noise has been growing for decades now. Even so, the press release says they were \" surprised by how much they heard, \" and dziak tells the seattle times, \" this should be one of the quietest places in the world, but it was a lot noisier than we expected. \" as it turns out, he tells the christian science monitor now, \" sound doesn't get as weak as you think it does even that far from the source. \" \" i was surprised by just how cleanly we can record whales, ships, and all sorts of activity taking place at the surface, \" he adds to gizmodo.

        "summary": "The donald trump phone conversation that led to an official complaint from beijing was a calculated move, not an innocent congratulatory call or a blunder made by a man with no knowledge of foreign policy, insiders tell the washington post. Instead, the provocative conversation with taiwanese president tsai ing-wen was a deliberate effort to break with the previous 37 years of us policy on taiwan and had been planned for months, the sources say. They say the move was the product of talks between trump aides, many of whom are hawkish on china, and their taiwanese counterparts. In other developments: adding to the controversy, trump used his medium of choice to harshly criticize china on sunday. \" did china ask us if it was ok to devalue their currency ( making it hard for our companies to compete ), heavily tax our products going into their country ( the us doesn't tax them ) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the south china sea? \" he tweeted. \" i don't think so! \" hours before trump's tweetburst, mike pence tried to downplay the importance of the taiwan call, reports the guardian. \" he received a courtesy call from the democratically elected president of taiwan, \" the vice president-elect told abc's this week. \" they reached out to offer congratulations as leaders around the world have and he took the call, accepted her congratulations and good wishes, and it was precisely that. \" on nbc, pence described the furor as a \" tempest in a teapot \" and wondered why trump is getting a hard time now when obama was \" hailed as a hero \" for reaching out to a \" murdering dictator in cuba. \" analysts tell cnnmoney that trump's criticisms of china would have been valid years ago but are now outdated: the country is now fighting to keep its currency from falling further, not to keep the yuan low to boost exports. The south china morning post reports that the position trump has adopted on china is consistent with policies he has been advocating for at least 30 years. In the 1980s, he repeatedly slammed japan, then america's main economic rival, for allegedly dumping cheap goods on the us market. In 1987, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for more backbone in us foreign policy. The ap reports that china has responded fairly mildly to trump's latest comments, with foreign minister lu kang saying monday that the government won't comment on trump's personality or on his tweets, but that it continues to hope for a \" sound and a stable bilateral relationship. \"",

In a recent interview with the daily mail's event magazine, wood, the other hard-living, hard-partying guitarist in the rolling stones, says he refused chemotherapy as a treatment option because he wanted to keep his mane intact. \" ' i wasn't going to lose my hair, \" wood says. \" this hair wasn't going anywhere. \" doctors discovered the cancerous lesion in wood's lung in may as part of a routine checkup before the rolling stones tour this fall. Wood says he chain-smoked for 50 years but gave up cigarettes last year, before the birth of his twin daughters. After doctors discovered the cancer, wood underwent a week of tests to determine if it had spread to his lymph nodes or anywhere else in his body. The guitarist says he made up his mind then that if it had, he wouldn't put himself through chemotherapy. \" i wasn't going to use that bayonet in my body, \" he says. When doctors determined the cancer hadn't spread, wood immediately underwent surgery to have it removed. Wood, who says he drank, smoked, and did cocaine and heroin throughout his career, is cancer-free now but has to go for checkups every three months. The rolling stones kick off their 14-date \" no filter \" tour sept. 9 in hamburg, germany.",

        "summary": "Although still highly vulnerable, there are more western lowland gorillas than previously thought, a new study finds. Over a 10-year period, scientists scoured 72,000 square miles of western equatorial africa on foot patrols studying nests and other clues, reports the guardian. Earlier estimates placed the gorilla population at 150,000 to 250,000. The new data puts the number of gorillas at 361,900, more than doubling the low end of the previous estimate. Scientists also tailed central chimpanzees in the same region and found them more plentiful than expected. They estimate the central chimp population to be 130,000, which is 10 % to 80 % higher than previously thought. The animals surveyed represent 99 % of all gorillas in the world and about one-third of all chimpanzees. Researchers found poachers to be one of the biggest threats to gorillas. Dominant males will stand up to hunters in an effort to protect their group and get shot in the process; the surviving males then kill the dominant male's offspring, furthering the loss. Chimpanzees, on the other hand, \" are cleverer and sneak away very quietly, \" says fiona maisels, a professor at the university of stirling in scotland and one of the 50 researchers on the project. They are also helped by cultural taboos against eating chimpanzee meat. Gorillas are still endangered — in fact, despite the revised population estimates, their numbers are trending downward by 2.7 % annually, according to a press release, and most live in unprotected areas, leaving them vulnerable to hunters and illness. \"just because there are rather a lot of them does not mean they are not very, very vulnerable, \" says maisels.

Looks like — bing! — option three may be correct, according to a new round of media reports. \" beats by dre headphones are garbage, \" writes mario aguilar at gizmodo. \" besides their crappy sound, they're basically designed to break. \" for evidence, he points to a teardown of beats by dre headphones at medium, which says the product feels strong and durable partly because of a few metal pieces. \" in these headphones, 30 % of the weight comes from four tiny metal parts that are there for the sole purpose of adding weight, \" the report says. Designers also saved installation time by using screws minimally, says medium, and added generic drivers that likely don't deliver the promised extra bass. What's more, the parts without labor cost just $ 16.89, a far cry from the $ 199+ price tag. For audiophiles, lifehacker reports that \" beats are... Not great, \" delivering less quality sound and even less bass than other more affordable products — including sennheiser's urbanite and momentum lines ( $ 85 and up ), shure's srh750dj ( $ 149 ), and ultrasone's hfi-580 ( $ 183 ). Meanwhile, dr. Dre has been lying low and roughly half of beats employees have left the company since apple acquired it, pcmag reports. Perhaps, the magazine says, apple will cut ties with dre and leave the headphone business entirely.",

        "summary": "The american academy of pediatrics is considering allowing doctors to perform female genital \" nicks \" in order to be \" culturally sensitive \" and satisfy parents seeking female circumcision. The move has infuriated activists battling the practice. A recent academy statement said doctors should try to dissuade parents from seeking the controversial cutting. But to avoid driving families to other countries for the procedure, \"it might be more effective if laws enabled pediatricians to offer a ritual nick as a possible compromise to avoid greater harm, \" the statement added. \" pricking or incising the clitoral skin is no more of an alteration than ear piercing. \" the shocking position fails to recognize the procedure \" as gender-based violence performed to control women's sexuality, \" writes lakshmi anantnarayan in the guardian. The organization's \" casual comparison of ' nicking ' girls ' genitalia to ear piercing demonstrates how far \" the organization now stands from un agencies staunchly opposed to any such procedure. The new statement, backing off earlier strong opposition, was issued after ny rep. Joseph crowley introduced a bill making it illegal for parents to take girls out of the us to have their genitalia cut.",

They would like that american doctors be given permission to perform a ceremonial pinprick or \"nick \" on girls born into communities that practice female genital mutilation. Female circumcision is a custom in many african and asian countries whereby the genitals of a girl child are cut. There are roughly four procedures. First there is the ritual pinprick. This is what pediatrics refers to as the \"nick \" option. To give you an idea of what that means, visualize a preteen girl held down by adults. Her clitoris is tweaked so that the circumcizer can hold it between her forefinger and her thumb. Then she takes a needle and pierces it using enough force for it to go into the peak of the clitoris. As soon as it bleeds, the parents and others attending the ceremony cheer, the girl is comforted and the celebrations follow. Ali talks to the daily beast's editor-in-chief, tina brown, about \" nicking \" there is a more sinister meaning to the word \"nick \" if you consider the fact that in some cases it means to cut off the peak of the clitoris.

The move, which was rushed in order to get the draft approved before the court rules on sunday whether to dissolve the assembly, will likely further inflame tension between president mohamed morsi's supporters and the opponents who are angry over his recent power grab. An opposition rally is planned for today, the ap reports. Opponents say the new constitution, which the wall street journal reports will be put to a national referendum mid-december, could give too much power to muslim clerics and frequently refers to strict shariah law, thus restricting freedoms. Women's rights are a particular concern; though the draft declares all citizens equal, one article specifically protecting women's equality was dumped. The revolutionaries did get some of their demands, the new york times reports, including restrictions on torture and indefinite detention; but the new draft also gives much of the military's power back. Morsi says his new, controversial powers \" will end as soon as the people vote on a constitution, \" reuters reports.",

On jim romenesko's blog, last year's opinion editor reveals that the paper knew about the charges as early as november, as confirmed by multiple people who used to be or are still involved with the paper. And that's not all: during this period of time, the editor-in-chief of the paper actually considered running an editorial urging wealthy alumni to charter a private jet for witt, so he wouldn't be forced to make his seemingly heroic choice between the yale-harvard game and his rhodes interview. A member of the paper's managing board tells gawker the editorial never made it into the paper. Meanwhile, witt has denied that his rhodes candidacy was suspended over the allegations, and adds that he had made his decision between the game and the interview before the rhodes trust was aware of the accusation, the new york times reports. Deadspin has the full statement from witt's rep; it claims that after being made aware of the \" informal \" complaint against witt, the rhodes trust simply asked for an additional letter of reference from yale on witt's behalf, but witt had already decided to withdraw his candidacy at that point. Many questions remain, including whether those who endorsed witt's application in the first place knew about the allegations.",

A source close to the investigation tells the new york daily news it was five pages long, and quite focused on roberts: \" there were three pages of rantings that her sister drove her to do this. There was one page to her mom, telling her how much she loved her, and one page apologizing to [ her fiancé john dilbeck ], \" the source says. Dilbeck's brother, conner, has been slamming roberts on his facebook page, including a post that says motes \" was driven to take her life yesterday because of the pure cruelty of her sister, julia roberts( yes ms. Pretty woman herself ), that has done everything in her power to ruin her and my brothers lives. \" motes had long bashed her relationship with her sister in the press, talking — amongst other things — about roberts'disdain for motes ' weight problems, and claiming roberts blocked her from seeing their ill mother. The new york post reports that roberts was \" mortified \" at all the tabloid interviews motes did, and wondered if her half-sister was selling the stories for money. The daily mail — in an article conner dilbeck linked to multiple times on facebook — spoke to a close friend of motes ' fiancé, who says motes ' mother \" had cut her off entirely \" recently and that the family problems drove motes to suicide. In one link to the article, which he called \" the most accurate news report that i have read, \" conner dilbeck wrote, \" nancy wanted the truth to come out and she was willing to die to get her point across. \"",

        "summary": "It has been hailed as a super food, a nutrient-packed, gluten-free dish that even carb counters can get behind. But could quinoa feed a hungry planet? that's the hope behind a new effort by scientists who've unlocked the humble grain's genome. \" quinoa has great potential to enhance global food security, \" lead researcher mark tester tells the guardian. Because the plant has a high tolerance for salt, the bbc notes it can be grown in lower-quality soil such as that in saudi arabia, where the team is based. The problem with mass-producing quinoa is that the ancient staple — grown mostly in a few countries high in the andes mountains — is time-consuming to get from the field to the table. Plus, the fragile plant's small heads and long stalks make it vulnerable to high winds and rain. Writing in the journal nature, researchers identified genes that could be tweaked, such as those that control the production of saponins, which give quinoa a bitter, toxic coating unless washed away — a tedious process. The discovery is \" an important first step \" to producing a heartier form of quinoa, they write. Tester tells the bbc that new varieties of seeds adapted to various conditions will help make quinoa \" a designer plant. \" a favorite of foodies, the price of quinoa has skyrocketed in recent years as demand has increased. The us imported 70 million pounds in 2013, up from 7 million six years earlier, per quartz. But production has remained mostly flat. Increased production would drive down the price, which tester said needs to drop by five times to make quinoa a contender to boost the world's food supply.

        "summary": "There are all kinds of explanations out there for why zebras have stripes, ranging from tricking lions to putting off bugs. A new study helps clarify the situation: zebras'stripes appear to be linked to temperature, national geographic reports. Zebras living in warmer temperatures have more stripes than their cousins in colder weather, and researchers wanted to find out why. Investigating 16 different zebra populations, they looked at 29 features of their various environments, from soil to disease prevalence. Seeking a link between these features and the zebras ' various stripe patterns, they found the strongest connection involved temperature. The link was so strong that scientists, armed with temperature data, were able to predict stripe patterns among other zebra populations. One reason for the connection might be that the way air interacts with the different colors could help keep zebras cool. Because they're not so efficient at digesting food, zebras have to keep eating — under a hot sun — more often than other animals, making cooling important, livescience reports. The stripes may also keep away disease-carrying bugs, who like hot areas and don't like stripes. The specifics remain unclear, but the study sheds some light on the subject. \" what we really feel is important about our study is that most studies so far have only taken one hypothesis and studied it by itself, \" a researcher tells abc news. \" we made an effort to throw some of these ideas against each other. \" one thing that seems clear: stripe patterns aren't connected to the local lion population.

            "It's an age old question: why do zebras have stripes? there have been many theories -- four of them, to be exact -- according to researchers of a new study. The issue isn't so black and white, it appears. The four theories include confusing predators, regulating temperature, helping zebras recognize each other and avoiding biting flies. However, temperature has the highest correlation to the number of stripes on a zebra, the researchers reported in the journal royal society open science. They also found that the warmer it is, the more stripes a zebra has. Brenda larison, co-author of the study, told abc news that there are two ways temperature could affect striping. One is called the \"cooling eddy \" theory that suggests there are opposing airflows on a zebra's black and white stripes because of the different speeds heat rises on black and white fur. At the intersections of these currents, there are whirlpools of air that cool their skin. These cooling swirls of air could also repel biting insects that prefer the heat, such as tsetse flies.

Many african animals sport some stripes on their bodies, but none of these patterns contrast as starkly as the zebra's.

One sticking point is coverage of pre-existing conditions, with one blogger arguing that jimmy kimmel's emotional plea on monday night's show may have effectively killed the gop bill. Here's what's happening, much of which revolves around an amendment offered by republican tom macarthur of new jersey: president trump insists the gop bill will cover people with pre-existing conditions in its final form. In fact, \" it will be every bit as good on pre-existing conditions as obamacare, \" he told bloomberg, echoing comments he made over the weekend. He's basing that on the macarthur amendment, which states explicitly that \" nothing in this act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions. \" ( the full amendment is here. ) but that's not true, say critics, because the amendment allows states to grant waivers to insurers to set rates based on people's \" health status. \" the new york times explains it this way: \" rates for a person with cancer, diabetes or multiple sclerosis could be far higher than the standard rate, effectively pricing the sick out of the market without technically blocking coverage, critics say. \" the american medical association says that \" health status underwriting could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable to people with pre-existing conditions. \" politifact digs into the nuances and concludes that trump's statement is \" mostly false. \" ( cnn has more particulars on the waivers. ) politico takes note of a key gop defector, rep. Billy long of missouri. He's voting no, explaining that he thinks coverage of pre-existing conditions is one of the few things obamacare got right. \" the macarthur amendment strips away any guarantee that pre-existing conditions would be covered and affordable. \" defenders of the waivers say they give states necessary flexibility that will result in lower rates. \" people with pre-existing conditions today can't access health care because the premiums and deductibles are so high, \" says rep. Richard hudson of north carolina, per the wall street journal. A national review columnist also backs them. The vote count is razor-thin at the moment, and margaret hartmann at new york suggests that kimmel's monologue may have doomed the gop bill.

        "summary": "Have you ever used a shared password for netflix, hulu, or hbo go? if so, you might now be an \" unwitting federal criminal \" thanks to an appeals court's finding that people who share passwords are subject to prosecution under the computer fraud and abuse act, or cfaa, time reports. The july 5 decision stems from the case of david nosal, an employment recruiter who used his former assistant's password ( with that employee's permission ) to access the candidate database of his former employer as he prepared to launch a competing firm. Ultimately, nosal was sentenced to prison and fined nearly $ 900,000 for conspiracy and theft of trade secrets, along with three cfaa violations — namely, using the assistant's password to access data \" without authorization \" from the company. The ruling by the ninth circuit court of appeals could make \" password sharing among friends and family \" a federal crime, judge m. Margaret mckeown writes in the majority opinion, per techcrunch. However, she adds, \"the reality is that facts and context matter in applying the term 'without authorization. ' \" in his dissent, judge stephen reinhardt writes that, nosal's other crimes notwithstanding, he did not violate the cfaa by using a shared password, adding that the traditionally anti-hacking law \" does not make the millions of people who engage in this ubiquitous, useful, and generally harmless conduct into unwitting federal criminals. \" as techcrunch notes, \" don't expect the fbi to come knocking next time you stream on your boyfriend's account, \" as the court's decision leaves \" without authorization \" open to interpretation and allows for context to be considered.

Louis of london's city university tweeted that hunt said when women work alongside men in labs, \" you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticize them, they cry. \" hunt, joint recipient of the 2001 nobel for medicine, said he was trying to be humorous. He told bbc radio today that he was \" really, really sorry i caused any offense. \" then he added: \" i did mean the part about having trouble with girls. It is true that people — i have fallen in love with people in the lab and people in the lab have fallen in love with me and it's very disruptive to the science because it's terribly important that in a lab people are on a level playing field. \" some of the reaction: time headline: \" a nobel scientist just made a breathtakingly sexist speech at international conference \" and on that \" apology \": quartz calls it a \" kind of \" apology. ( and notes that hunt is in fact married... To a female scientist. ) the distancing begins: the official response from the royal society, of which hunt is a fellow: \" sir tim hunt was speaking as an individual and his reported comments in no way reflect the views of the royal society....

            "Nick saban is consistently ahead of the curve and should be used to blowback from critics that ofttimes include his peers, but apparently the alabama head coach had heard enough about one particular issue. Over the past month or so, it's come to light that saban had used some of his former players, including recent nflers trent richardson and blake sims, as stand-ins on his scout team during practices. The usage of former players is permissible up to a certain point; specifically, ncaa bylaw 14.2.1.6, which falls under the heading of practice requirement exceptions, states that \"[ a ] former student at the certifying institution [ e.g., former student-athlete ] may participate in an organized practice session on an occasional basis, provided the institution does not publicize the participation of the former student at any time before the practice session. \" saban's counterparts in the sec seemingly have no problem with the practice. One former sec head coach, ohio state's urban meyer, was openly intrigued when informed about what saban was doing and that the ncaa allows it. There have been critics of saban's usage of former tide players, chief among them brian kelly. \"i think it's absolutely ludicrous. Doesn't sound like college football to me, \" the notre dame head coach said late last week. I don't know if kelly's criticism was saban's tipping point, but the coach used his radio show thursday night to express his frustrations over being criticized for something that's well within the rules. \"now everybody is complaining that we did it and they want to change the rule, \" saban said by way of al.com. \"we didn't break any rules. If they want to change the rule, they can change the rule. I don't care what rules they change if it's the same for everybody. I just wish people would quit complaining about what we do — that's allowed by the rules — and why don't they just do it. I hear this all the time",

He adds the department's own procedures slowed things down as well and that they're trying to figure out what caused those delays. The dad isn't a suspect, craig notes, but he says he chastised him for being out so late with the baby and leaving her in the car alone. \" that's a recipe for what? a bad situation, \" craig says. Dakota didn't appear to be suffering from trauma, but she was taken to a nearby hospital as a precaution; the car and suspects still haven't been tracked down.

In a statement to journalist yashar ali, argento begins with the denial: \"i strongly deny and oppose the contents of the new york times article, \" she writes. \"i am deeply shocked and hurt by having read news that is absolutely false. I have never had any sexual relationship with bennett. \" the latter is jimmy bennett, now 22, who says argento paid him $ 380,000 to cover up a sexual encounter that occurred when he was 17, below the age of consent in california. Argento says the two had only a friendship, one that ended last fall when bennett \" unexpectedly made an exorbitant request of money from me. \" argento says bennett made the demand after argento came forward to accuse harvey weinstein, and she says he did so because bourdain was \" a man of great perceived wealth. \" she says bourdain, who committed suicide in june, decided to pay bennett the money. \" anthony was afraid of the possible negative publicity that such person, whom he considered dangerous, could have brought upon us, \" she writes. \" we decided to deal compassionately with bennett's demand for help and gave it to him. \" bourdain, she adds, \" personally undertook to help bennett economically, upon the condition that we would no longer suffer any further intrusions in our life. \" meanwhile, weinstein's attorney characterizes his client's reaction to the allegations against argento as \" almost relief, \" reports cbs news.",

            "Movie mogul harvey weinstein is reacting to a report that italian actress asia argento paid off a young actor who accused her of sexual assault. Argento was one of the first women to accuse weinstein of sexual misconduct and has since become a prominent figure in the #metoo movement. In a new yorker story last october, argento accused harvey weinstein of rape when she was 21 years old. While none of the charges weinstein is facing in court, including felony sexual assault, involve argento, his attorney believes this latest development is a win for him in the court of public opinion cbs news ' jericka duncan asked attorney brafman how weinstein reacted when he told him about the report that argento was accused of sexual harassment. \" i don't remember the first words. I remember the tenor of the conversation was almost relief, \" brafman said. He says his client was not surprised by the new york times article about arento's alleged payoff of the actor. \" the degree of hypocrisy that this development demonstrates is beyond stunning, \" brafman said. In october, argento told the new yorker weinstein forced himself on her in 1997. In the months following those accusations, argento reportedly arranged a $ 380,000 payment to 22-year old actor jimmy bennett after bennett accused her of sexually assaulting him in 2013. At the time, bennett was 17 – a year younger than california's age of consent. In 2004 bennett, then 7 years old, played argento's son in the \" the heart is deceitful above all things \" – a film argento also co-wrote and directed. Of whether the developments in argento's case might call into question the validity of other weinstein accusers, brafman said, \" well, i know for certain that other weinstein accusers will be outed, if you will, as not having told the truth based on the investigation we have done to date... Mr. Weinstein, i think, will acknowledge that there were times in the course of his life when he may have acted inappropriately.

            "Movie mogul harvey weinstein is reacting to a report that italian actress asia argento paid off a young actor who accused her of sexual assault. Argento was one of the first women to accuse weinstein of sexual misconduct and has since become a prominent figure in the #metoo movement. In a new yorker story last october, argento accused harvey weinstein of rape when she was 21 years old. While none of the charges weinstein is facing in court, including felony sexual assault, involve argento, his attorney believes this latest development is a win for him in the court of public opinion cbs news ' jericka duncan asked attorney brafman how weinstein reacted when he told him about the report that argento was accused of sexual harassment. \" i don't remember the first words. I remember the tenor of the conversation was almost relief, \" brafman said. He says his client was not surprised by the new york times article about arento's alleged payoff of the actor. \" the degree of hypocrisy that this development demonstrates is beyond stunning, \" brafman said. In october, argento told the new yorker weinstein forced himself on her in 1997. In the months following those accusations, argento reportedly arranged a $ 380,000 payment to 22-year old actor jimmy bennett after bennett accused her of sexually assaulting him in 2013. At the time, bennett was 17 – a year younger than california's age of consent. In 2004 bennett, then 7 years old, played argento's son in the \" the heart is deceitful above all things \" – a film argento also co-wrote and directed. Of whether the developments in argento's case might call into question the validity of other weinstein accusers, brafman said, \" well, i know for certain that other weinstein accusers will be outed, if you will, as not having told the truth based on the investigation we have done to date... Mr. Weinstein, i think, will acknowledge that there were times in the course of his life when he may have acted inappropriately. But there is a huge difference between acting inappropriately and engaging in intentional criminal conduct. \" more than 80 women have come forward to accuse weinstein of sexual harassment, assault, and rape.

If the fda goes along with the recommendation, as it usually does, the injections could win final approval in may and be available from dermatologists a month or two later. Reuters offers this explanation of how it works: the drug \" is a formulation of synthetically derived deoxycholic acid, which destroys fat under the chin, leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected. \" it would be the first such treatment designed to remove specific fat deposits, and the company's stock has tripled since it went public in 2012. Kythera hasn't released pricing, but the treatment — actually a series of shots that would be given in a doctor's office — would presumably be cheaper than than below-the-chin liposuction, which can cost more than $ 5,000. \"my biggest concern is once it is approved, people will start to use it for other areas of the face or for larger volumes ( of fat ) in other areas, \" the president of the society for aesthetic plastic surgery tells nbc news.

Now researchers say that bacterial colonies on pubic hairs appear to be so unique to an individual that they could be used much like a fingerprint, reports science. \" i can't believe that no one's thought about it before, \" the forensic biologist who led the study — published this week in the journal investigative genetics — tells australia's abc. Silvana tridico and her team analyzed the dna profiles of bacteria that live in scalp and pubic hair, and found the microbes tied to the latter to be much more \" specific to certain people. \" further, one couple she studied who lived together had more similar profiles 18 hours after intercourse than they did two months after living together. \" i thought i'd looked at the woman's sample twice, \" explains tridico, \" because her partner was showing lactobacillus species, \" which isn't typically found on males. Abc notes this could mean that the microbes can transfer even if hair doesn't. \" you could actually swab the victim's genital area and the suspect's genital area and see if the bacteria's transferred or not, \" says tridico. Still, results of the study are preliminary; only seven participants were analyzed and several questions remain, including how easily these bacteria transfer and how long they stay. But if future studies back up these findings, forensic scientists say they could identify even rapists who wear condoms. ( meanwhile, bite marks may be thrown out of court as evidence. )",

Rick snyder has, as promised, released hundreds of pages of emails relating to flint and its water crisis — and while there may not be anything in them that will cost him his job, members of his administration will have questions to answer about what appears to be a slow and seemingly dismissive approach to lead contamination in the city's water supply. Highlights from the emails, per the detroit free press and the guardian: \" once the city connects to the new system in 2016, this issue will fade in the rearview, \" an aide predicted in a feb. 1 memo. The same memo mentions the pipe corrosion that was later found to be responsible for lead contaminating the city's water supply, dismissing it as an aesthetic problem. \" discoloration is not an indicator of water quality or water safety, but we recognize that nobody likes it, \" the aide wrote. \" i can't figure out why the state is responsible except that ( then-treasurer andy ) dillon did make the ultimate decision so we're not able to avoid the subject, \" then-chief of staff dennis muchmore wrote in a sept. 25 email in which he called the issue a \" political football \" that those in flint were trying to dump on the state. The next day, muchmore wrote that while flint's water \" certainly has occasional less than savory aspects like color, \" the \" anti-everything \" group was looking at lead contamination and \" flint people respond by looking for someone to blame. \" in an aug. 31 email from a state employee to epa officials obtained by the guardian separately from the snyder emails, the employee says flint probably wasn't paying much attention to the contamination because the \" city has bigger issues on their agenda right now. \" not many of the emails came from snyder himself, who wasn't legally required to make them public. He has said that he tackled the problem aggressively when it was revealed how serious it was. In later emails, the republican governor demands daily updates on the flint situation until recommendations such as the distribution of water filters have been implemented, the free press notes. President obama addressed the issue when he visited michigan on wednesday, the new york times adds. \" the notion that immediately families were not notified, things were not shut down — that shouldn't happen anywhere, \" he said in a cbs interview that will air sunday.",

            "A new jersey woman who worked multiple jobs to support herself died monday while snatching a few minutes of sleep in her car. Maria fernandes, 32, succumbed to a deadly combination of carbon monoxide and fumes from an overturned gas container that she kept in her 2001 kia sportage, cops say. The woman worked shifts at dunkin'donuts shops in harrison, newark and linden. \"she used to work like three shifts every day, \" parth patel, who worked with fernandes at newark penn station, told nj.com. \"sometimes she wouldn't sleep for five days. \" one of her managers, sophia paches, said that fernandes had been an excellent employee during her four years at the linden store. The woman would sometimes finish an overnight shift at 6 a.m., sleep in her car for a few hours, and then move on to her next shift. Despite the grueling",
            "Elizabeth — maria fernandes worked four jobs, including shifts at two different dunkin donuts. Often she drove from job to job, stopping along the road to catch a couple hours sleep, police said. She kept a container of gasoline in her 2001 kia sportage because occasionally she ran out of gas, authorities said. Early monday, the 32-year-old newark woman pulled into a lot off route 1 &amp; 9 in elizabeth for a nap. She apparently left the car running and was overcome by carbon monoxide mixed with fumes from the gas can that had overturned, police said. Fernandes was found dead in the car about eight hours later. \" this sounds like someone who tried desperately to work and make ends meet, and met with a tragic accident, \" elizabeth police lt. Daniel saulnier said. An autopsy today failed to determine the cause of death, and police are awaiting results",
            "Elizabeth — maria fernandes carved out her own lifestyle, working at dunkin donuts shops in harrison, newark and linden, often sleeping in her car between work shifts. She never earned much, but she always had money to give others, friends said today. \" she helped me out when i was going through some tough times. She gave me money, \" said bruce jirinec of linden, who often hung out with fernandes when she worked the overnight shift at dunkin donuts in linden. Late tuesday night, after hearing that the 32-year-old fernandes had died while sleeping in her 2001 kia sportage in a parking lot in elizabeth, jirinec and a friend etched a chalk memorial to her in a parking space just outside the front door of the shop. Manager sophia paches blocked off the parking space to preserve the drawings. \" it's so sad. Nobody here can believe"

The sun and moon will be exactly 180 degrees apart in the sky during the lunar eclipse, but they will both be briefly visible at the same time because of a trick of the light in which refraction lifts their images above the horizon, reports livescience, which has some tips for viewing the eclipse during a two- to nine-minute early morning window. But while only those with a good view of both the eastern and western horizons will be able to witness the selenelion, the second \" blood moon \" of the year will have a reddish sheen visible to many. \" when the moon sets over the east coast of america, in places like new york, the moon will be in mid-eclipse and the sun will be rising, so there will be some dramatic photographs of a mid-eclipse red moon, \" an astronomer tells the independent. \" north carolina, delaware, and philadelphia should get some great views of the moon setting and the sun rising.

        "summary": "With president trump promising a decision on the deferred action for childhood arrivals program friday afternoon or sometime this weekend, a number of powerful republican lawmakers — including house speaker paul ryan — encouraged him not to end it. Daca — enacted by president obama in 2012 — allows immigrants brought to the us illegally as children to stay in the country without fear of deportation using two-year work permits. Ryan says the program was unconstitutional when obama created it with an executive order, but trump should still keep it in place while letting congress find a solution, reports the washington post. \" these are kids who know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don't know another home, \" ryan says. Republican sen. Orrin hatch also asked trump to let congress find \"a workable, permanent solution for individuals who entered the country unlawfully as children through no fault of their own and who have built their lives here. \" and politico reports republican sen. Jeff flake said \" congress needs to take immediate action to protect daca kids. \" republican lawmakers were joined by ceos in asking the president to keep the program. When asked friday if so-called \" dreamers \" had anything to fear, trump said: \" we love dreamers; we love everybody... The dreamers are terrific. \" trump had promised to end daca during the campaign. Immigration advocates say 97 % of the 787,000 dreamers in the us are either working or in school, according to nbc news.",

The workers had provided their official government accounts to yahoo as a backup in case their email became inaccessible. Account owners include everyone from fbi agents, white house staff ( past and present ), and service members from every branch to nsa and cia employees, among others. This new info was discovered when cybersecurity researcher andrew komarov stumbled across a database of pilfered yahoo user info being covertly sold online; he intercepted the database and alerted government officials ( who, in turn, told yahoo, which hasn't confirmed this report to bloomberg ). What this could mean for overseas spies is an easier time at their jobs, as they now may have an \" alphabetized hit list of targets. \" it could also throw a wrench in yahoo's sale to verizon. \" we will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions, \" a verizon rep tells the new york times.

The amoeba travels to the brain through the nose, and to minimize the risk of infection, health experts advise using nose plugs while swimming in lakes or to at least avoid dives that could get water up the nose, reports the ap, which notes that experts are worried by how far north the latest case is. The parasite is usually found in southern states, but this is the third infection in minnesota since 2010, and there have been three other unconfirmed cases in the state. \" prior to our 2010 case, the northernmost case was 550 miles south of us, \" the chief of the state health department's waterborne diseases unit tells the minneapolis star tribune. \" it should be assumed that it can be anywhere. \" she says that while adults are just as susceptible to infection as children, children \" are more adventurous and more likely to participate in activities that would get water up their noses. \" swimmers are also advised to keep their heads above water and avoid stirring up the lake sediment where the amoeba dwells.

According to a press release, a study published monday in nature climate change found \" significant greening \" over 25 % to 50 % of earth's plant-bearing surface ( some 4 % did grow browner ). \" the greening... Reported in this study is equivalent to adding a green continent about two-times the size of mainland usa, \" says dr. Zaichun zhu, the study's lead author. The reason for the greening is what is known as the carbon fertilization effect: an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means plants, which use the gas in photosynthesis, grow faster, science alert reports. In what's good news for plants, there's currently more co2 in the atmosphere than at any time in at least the past 500,000 years. \" this is a snapshot of humans ' global influence on the functioning of the entire global biosphere, \" study coauthor dr. Pep canadell tells abc. However, what's good news for plants isn't necessarily good news for anything else on the planet, as canadell cites fossil fuel burning and deforestation as \" almost exclusively \" causing the rise of co2 in the atmosphere. Co2 emissions are the main cause of climate change, the other effects of which — drought, rising seas, deadly weather — far outweigh the benefits of what scientists say is a temporary increase in plant life.

        "summary": "Amateur video appearing to show an israeli soldier killing an already wounded palestinian attacker sparked uproar in israel on sunday, reflecting the deep divisions in the country following six months of violence, the ap reports. As the israeli military pressed on with an investigation, nationalistic politicians accused the army of abandoning the soldier, while political doves bemoaned the erosion of the nation's morals. Palestinians, meanwhile, say the shooting proved their claims that israel is guilty of using excessive force and carrying out extrajudicial killings. The shooting took place last thursday in hebron, the volatile west bank city that has been a focal point of the latest wave of israeli-palestinian violence. The military says two palestinians stabbed and wounded an israeli soldier before troops shot and killed the pair. In a video released by the israeli human rights group b'tselem ( warning: disturbing content ), one of the attackers appears to still be alive after the initial shooting. The video, taken by a palestinian volunteer for the group, shows the wounded attacker lying on the ground, slowly moving his head. About a minute later, a soldier raises his rifle, cocks the weapon and fires. Blood is then seen streaming from the palestinian's head. But newly released footage of the shooting appears to show that a medic believed the man was about to trigger a bomb, and cried out for help, the times of israel reports. The israeli military quickly arrested the soldier and opened an investigation into what it said appeared to be a \" grave breach \" of its values. A military court has ordered the soldier to remain held until tuesday while the investigation continues.",

That check turned up his 2004 arrest for shooting out a car's tires, but alexis passed the low bar for \" secret \" clearance anyway. Secret clearance is generally good for 10 years, even if someone leaves the military. Alexis ' navy record included several unauthorized absences from duty, insubordination complaints, and failed inspections, an official tells the la times, but the navy discharged him honorably — albeit barely — anyway. His arrests never resulted in charges being filed that would show up on a background check, and he was never committed for his mental health problems, the new york times points out — though rhode island authorities did alert the navy about the \" microwave machine \" incident, cbs notes.

In other alexis revelations: alexis was so frustrated with america that he was \" ready to move out of the country \" last year, friend and former co-landlord kristi suthamtewkal tells nbc news. \" he was tired of dealing with the government. \" instead, he moved to virginia and joined the experts. Alexis was working in the shadow of the twin towers when the 9/11 attacks hit. Investigators can't verify his father's claim that he helped in the recovery effort, but suthamtewkal says he talked often about \" where he was and how the buildings had collapsed and … how he was upset with the terrorists for taking innocent lives. \"",

        "summary": "Too much sitting is already linked to a higher risk of anxiety disorder and certain types of cancer. Now you can throw liver disease into the mix, too. A new study out of south korea finds those who spend at least 10 hours a day on their behinds have a 9 % higher risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or nafld, than those who sit for less than five hours a day. The finding remained true even for those with a bmi of less than 23, which is considered normal. The study also found a link between nafld and exercise, as physically active participants were 20 % less likely to develop the disease, author seungho ryu tells live science. But physical activity should replace sitting time, rather than attempt to make up for it. \" our findings suggest that both increasing participation in physical activity and reducing sitting time may be independently important in reducing the risk of nafld, \" a co-author says in a release. It isn't clear how sitting affects the liver, but researchers say other health problems are unlikely to explain the link to nafld because the study was based on 139,000 generally healthy koreans with an average age of 40. The findings are important because \" the amount of time spent doing sedentary activity such as sitting at a computer or watching tv has increased dramatically in recent years, \" ryu says. An expert suggests getting 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week or taking 10,000 steps per day. \" the message is clear, our chairs are slowly but surely killing us, \" he says. \" our body is designed to move. \" about 19 % of americans suffer from nafld, which can cause the swelling and scarring of the liver, and most are forced to change their lifestyle.

        "summary": "The controversial concept of \" safe spaces \" on college campuses — a place where members of a marginalized group can feel secure and able to express themselves — has grabbed the media's attention over the last year, spurred by such high-profile cases as the racial strife at the university of missouri and a recent want ad posted by a black student at a california college seeking a non-white roommate. But those heading to the university of chicago this fall shouldn't expect such accommodations, according to a letter sent to incoming freshmen, inside higher ed reports. Although john ellison, the school's dean of students, says in the letter that no one should be harassed, the university is committed to \" freedom of inquiry and expression \" and students should be prepared that in a collegial environment, they may sometimes feel challenged and be exposed to a certain level of \" discomfort. \" toward that end, per ellison: the university won't support safe spaces or \" trigger warnings \" on provocative topics ( both terms that quartz says have become \" nebulous \" ) and has no intention of turning away speakers from campus if their ideas are polarizing. The chicago maroon, the student newspaper, documents three incidents that happened during the 2016 spring semester in which speakers invited to the school had to end their speeches or endure protester disruptions during their appearances. The paper also notes that reaction to ellison's letter has been mixed on social media, with some saying they applaud the college's support for academic freedom — \" it's about time that someone stood up against this pc nonsense! \" reads one comment on the maroon article — while others say the school's attitude toward supposedly \" open \" dialogue can serve as a cover for hate speech.",

However, the robot crucial to that find will be shelved until weather improves, meaning the search could slow. A rep for the national transportation safety board says it's unlikely the search would be abandoned even if the plane isn't found in the new area. \" this is so important, not to mention a matter of national pride \" to australia, malaysia, and china, he says. \" it's a big ocean, but i think they will find some wreckage at some point. \"",

Such allegations have been around for a while, but oceana says the problem isn't getting any better. It cites studies showing that fish is mislabeled 25 % to 70 % of the time, depending on the species. What's more, the fda inspects only a tiny fraction of us seafood, of which 84 % is imported.

        "summary": "Africa, home to the ethiopian wolf and the gray wolf, can now lay claim to the african golden wolf — the first new species of canid ( which also encompasses jackals, foxes, and coyotes ) to be discovered in 150 years, reports national geographic. The new species has long been misunderstood to be a golden jackal, which lives in both eurasia and east africa. But a new dna analysis reveals that in spite of their convincingly similar appearances, they've evolved over millennia into two distinct species, and that the east african jackal is actually a new type of wolf. \" i was very surprised, \" study leader klaus-peter koepfli says. The finding, however, isn't entirely without precedent. In 2012, a french biologist reported in plos one that an analysis of mitochondrial ( as opposed to nuclear ) dna suggested the african golden jackal may actually be a subspecies of gray wolf separate from its eurasian doppelganger. But rather than arrive at the same conclusion per his expectations, koepfli discovered that africa's golden jackal is a new wolf species altogether, the so-called golden wolf. It appears to have parted genetic ways from the eurasian jackal about a million years ago, he reports this week in the journal current biology, even though the two look so remarkably similar. That shared form was perhaps facilitated by \" intense competition from a uniquely diverse carnivoran community including species larger and smaller than jackals, thus inhibiting size divergence. \" while his findings need to be confirmed, some call it an \" airtight \" case, and thus the number of living canidae species could go from 35 to 36, reports physorg.
