Read on for more: andrew o ' hehir admits secretariat is a \"gorgeous film \" that he \"enjoyed immensely \" — but that doesn't stop him from declaring it, on salon, \"a work of creepy, half-hilarious master-race propaganda almost worthy of leni riefenstahl \" that presents \"a honey-dipped fantasy vision of the american past as the tea party would like to imagine it, loaded with uplift and glory and scrubbed clean of multiculturalism and social discord. \" roger ebert begs to differ, writing on his blog that o ' hehir's review is \"a fevered conspiracy theory \" and noting, \"i am a liberal who has found more than his share of the dark side in seemingly innocent films. But in my naïveté i attended secretariat and saw a straightforward, lovingly crafted film about a great horse and the determined woman who backed him. \" ( ebert's own review in the chicago sun-times is a glowing four stars. ) to see o ' hehir's response to ebert's response, click here. Most other critics seemed to like the film, including justin chang, who writes that it is \"conventional but rousingly effective \" in variety, and rex reed who writes in the new york observer, \"this is one terrific movie about one terrific horse. It enthralls on so many levels — emotional, cinematic, historic. \"",

        "summary": "A new study in the oft-overlooked field of hamster research tries to get at that nagging question: can hamsters be happy? two researchers with liverpool john moores university found that hamsters, like other animals, may exhibit judgment bias, according to phys.org, which boils that down to the idea that we behave \" more optimistically when [ we feel ] good emotionally. \" emily bethell and nicola koyama devised a study in which 15 syrian hamsters were placed in enriched cages featuring gnaw sticks, huts, and extra bedding, while 15 other hamsters lived in basic cages. Both types of cage contained water bottles that held sugar water in some cases, and bitter-tasting quinine water in others. More bottles were then added, with the researchers looking to see whether the hamsters who led the \" better \" life would be more likely to sample the new bottles in hopes of tasting sugar water. Indeed, those in the better cages were more likely to test the waters, while the less-enriched hamsters pretty much stuck with the bottles they knew contained sugar water. The researchers acknowledge they \" cannot say whether the hamsters in our study felt happy in their enriched housing, \" adding \" it is difficult to interpret animals as categorically ' optimistic ' or ' pessimistic ' as there is no reference baseline against which to assess this. \" still, they write in royal society open science that \" the changes in cognitive processing of ambiguous cues certainly suggests enriched hamsters became more optimistic. \" theirs is the \" first study to report evidence for emotion-mediated judgement bias in a species of hamster. \" ( france was threatened with a $ 24 million fine for not helping its hamsters ).",

Believe they have found a way to measure happiness in hamsters. In their paper published in royal society open science, emily bethell and nicola koyama describe behavioral studies they carried out with hamsters, what they learned and why they believe their results indicate that hamsters, like other mammals, have feelings, or moods. Anyone who has ever owned and cared for a pet hamster has faced the same problem — knowing if the creature is happy, or at least content with its living arrangements. Hamsters don't offer much in the way of feedback and because of that bethell and koyama looked to see if there might be any other ways to measure their \" happiness \" level, such as by using what scientists call judgment bias — where an animal ( including humans ) will tend to behave more optimistically when they are feeling good emotionally. Such studies have been conducted on many species, but not with hamsters. The new study consisted of training a group of 30 hamsters to associate water bottles placed in a certain locations in their cage with sugar-water, which the hamsters really like, in some places and bitter quinine, which they hate in other areas and then dividing the group into two — half of the group were transferred to really nice cages, with chew toys, wheels, nice wood chips underfoot, etc. The other half lived a much more austere existence. Then, the researchers added more bottles to the original cage, some with sugar-water, some with quinine and others with plain water, and then tested how all 30 of the hamsters reacted. The thinking was that happy hamsters would be more open to testing the new bottles to see if they held something sweet. Sure enough, the hamsters that had been living the good life were much more receptive to trying all the other bottles, while those, presumably less happy with their recent abode, moped and mostly only sipped at the bottles they knew would offer a sweet reward. The study doesn't prove that half of the hamsters were actually happier or sadder, but it does appear to show that hamsters do better when living under better conditions, which, in retrospect, likely doesn't come as a surprise, because who doesn't? explore further: bug vs. Bug: benign c.

Researchers say the data \" suggests that limiting sugary-beverage intake is an important step in reducing diabetes deaths. \" but the american beverage association says the report is \" more about sensationalism than science. The researchers make a huge leap when they take beverage intake calculations from around the globe and allege that those beverages are the cause of deaths which the authors themselves acknowledge are due to chronic disease. \" the american heart association recommends no more than 450 calories per week come from sugar-sweetened drinks.",

Johnny bobbitt's attorney, chris fallon, said he learned that the cash was gone during a call with lawyers for kate mcclure and mark d ' amico, the couple accused in a lawsuit brought by bobbitt of mismanaging donations they raised for him through gofundme. Fallon said he was \" shocked. Shocked. \" \" they raised this money to help johnny bobbitt get money for food. \" the couple, who started the campaign after bobbitt used his last $ 20 to help mcclure get gas after she ran out late at night, deny the claims in the suit, saying they're wary of giving bobbitt large sums because they fear he will buy drugs. Gofundme rep bobby whithorne says the company is working with law enforcement to ensure that bobbitt gets the money raised for him, the ap reports. The crowdfunding site says it will guarantee any misspent money, 6 abc reports. \" while we assist law enforcement with their ongoing investigation, gofundme is also working with johnny's legal team to ensure he's receiving support while the remaining funds are being recovered, \" whithorne said in a statement, adding that the company gave $ 20,000 to an account set up by bobbitt's attorney \" to provide assistance \" to him during the investigation. Mcclure and d ' amico's attorney, ernest badway, told the ap they have no comment. They have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. D ' amico has said bobbitt, a marine veteran, spent $ 25,000 in less than two weeks in december on drugs, in addition to paying overdue legal bills and sending his family money. They say they've given bobbitt about half the money raised, but fallon says bobbitt has only received about $ 75,000, including a camper and a 1999 ford ranger. The new jersey judge in the case ordered the couple to transfer the money into an escrow account by friday and hire an accountant to review records within 10 days; per nj 101.5, they missed that deadline.

            "Life legacy haverhill- kelsey grace endicott, age 23, passed away on april 2, 2016, from an accidental overdose. For many years, she fought a heroic battle with addiction. She had been sober for almost ten months, but her disease still had a powerful hold on her. We wish she had recognized the beauty and strength everyone else saw in her. Kelsey did not want to leave this world. She yearned for a life without fear and pain; a life that would permit her to realize that the world was open for her to explore and that change was possible. During her adolescence, kelsey hid her vulnerability with meticulously-crafted sarcasm, but in recent years, she had allowed her kindness and compassion to shine – she had found the courage to be herself. It is not true that everything happens for a reason. The reality of kelsey's death is devastating, and no possible reason can justify the loss of this beautiful young woman, who had so much to give to the world. Wherever she went, people loved her. The disease of addiction is merciless. It is up to us to open our minds and hearts to those who are still sick and suffering. Kelsey does not want us to cry for her. She wants us to fight for her. She wants us to",
            "When kathleen errico of haverhill found her 23-year-old daughter dead of a heroin overdose on april 2 — slumped over in bed, lips white, television turned on at 3: 45 a.m. — a devastating, years-long struggle had ended. The demons of opioid addiction finally took the life of kelsey endicott, the mother of a toddler who would soon turn 2. But errico's heart-rending discovery in the still of night also marked a remarkable beginning. Within days, errico wrote a death notice and delivered a eulogy that have been shared throughout the nation on social media and garnered international news coverage. Her words — of pain, endurance, and ultimately hope — have touched thousands of parents with core compassion for the person behind the addiction.

Gawker tipsters say phillips, who is also a member of president obama's economic recovery advisory board, has portrayed himself as divorced since at least 2003. But in his statement to nbc, philips claims his divorce proceedings began in 2008 — without explaining why he was attending high-profile events with his wife as recently as last month. Perhaps phillips was leading a double life, romancing yavaughnie out west while remaining married to his wife back east, ryan tate and adrian chen speculate on gawker. The billboards point to a \"charles and yavaughnie \" website ( currently down ) that, the web designer says, was commissioned as a \"gift \" from wilkins to phillips, but it seems more like a revenge scheme — perfectly timed to coincide with oracle's acquisition of sun microsystems and the jan. 27 event the company is hosting.",

During the dec. 23 episode of amazon's the grand tour, co-host richard hammond said there's just something gay about a \" grown man eating an ice cream, \" the bbc reports. According to buzzfeed the hosts of the car show were discussing some sort of fancy rolls royce in front of a studio audience when hammond says he doesn't eat ice cream because he's straight. The comment was — oddly — cheered by the studio audience, the guardian reports. But co-host jeremy clarkson seemed taken aback and asked if hammond believes all kids — being notorious ice cream eaters — are gay. ( video of hammond's comments here. ) hammond's bizarre statement was quickly met with condemnation and mockery from lgbt advocates and the internet. \" it's a perverse world when everyday pleasures like ice cream become the butt of homophobic innuendo, \" one advocate says. Lgbt rights group stonewall adds: \" hammond's choice of words were not just ridiculous, but chosen purposefully to mock and belittle. \" neither hammond nor the producers of the grand tour have commented. However, one social media user may have put it best: \" ' ice cream is gay ' might be the worst opinion i've ever heard and i ' m on twitter. \"",

But the wikileaker isn't exactly off the hook; he was convicted on 17 other counts, including at least five counts of violating the espionage act, and on amended versions of four others, the guardian reports. ( the bbc puts the tally at 20 convictions. ) manning was also acquitted of one espionage count stemming from the leak of a video of a us military strike in afghanistan, which manning had argued he was not the original source of, though he did later release a version. The aiding the enemy acquittal probably won't have any practical effect; the other charges he was convicted of carry a maximum of 130 years in prison, and according to reuters, government prosecutors are seeking the harshest sentence possible. ( manning also had already pleaded guilty to some lesser charges. ) but the washington post calls it a \" striking rebuke \" to military prosecutors.

        "summary": "Soliris is one of the world's most expensive drugs, running about $ 500,000 a year in the us. In canada, a year's supply of the drug, used to treat two rare blood diseases — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( pnh ) and atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome ( ahus ) — is even pricier at about $ 525,000 a year, reports the cbc. Canada's patented medicine prices review board argues soliris is in fact more expensive in canada than anywhere else in the world, which is why it began hearings in june to pressure connecticut-based manufacturer alexion pharmaceuticals to lower the drug's \" excessive \" price. Did alexion budge? no. Instead, it's taking the government to court in the hope that it can force the hearings to stop and block any order that might affect the price of soliris, which has earned alexion $ 6 billion in revenue over eight years. A health law expert calls alexion's decision to challenge canada's authority to regulate drug prices \" the single greatest threat to pricing of drugs in canada ever. \" the us and chile are the only nations in the organization for economic cooperation and development that don't control drug prices, reports the globe and mail. Alexion says soliris ' price has been unchanged during its six years on the canadian market and \" allegations of excessive pricing \" are instead based \" on exchange rate fluctuations in the value of canadian currency, \" per vice. As soliris mitigates the effects of pnh and ahus — which attack red blood cells, causing anemia, organ failure, and death — patients can pay millions for the drug over a lifetime, though some canadian provinces cover the cost. If alexion is made to lower the price, it may be forced to repay governments for past overpayments. ( raising the cost of a single pill backfired for this ceo. )",

A professor in health law at the university of ottawa, amir attaran, told the cbc that alexion's case is \" the single greatest threat to pricing of drugs in canada ever, \" because a ruling in its favor would hinder the country's power over the cost of patented drugs.

        "summary": "California has just become the first state to devise regulations for ride-sharing services, the fast-growing underground cab companies that have traditional taxis shaking in their boots. Services like lyft, sidecar, and uber technologies let you pay for a ride from people who use their own cars to drive you around. California's move will put restrictions on the services, but also lend them legitimacy, the la times reports. Under the new rules, drivers will have to undergo criminal background checks, get driver training, carry insurance with at least a million dollars worth of liability coverage, and agree to a zero-tolerance drug and alcohol policy — all of which sidecar and lyft already require. The move is designed to prevent cities from enacting their own regulations, or banning the concept completely, as traditional taxi companies would prefer.

        "summary": "\" without this dramatic breaching britain would still be a part of europe, \" says sanjeev gupta — and no, he's not talking about brexit. In what he dubs \" brexit 1.0 — the brexit nobody voted for, \" the imperial college london researcher reveals two massive floods were responsible for physically separating britain from europe about 150,000 years ago. Researchers say a chalk land bridge, perhaps 20 miles long and 330 feet high, connected england and france 450,000 years ago, per a release. It also acted as a dam, keeping a massive lake on the edge of an ice sheet stretching across the north sea from spilling into what is now the english channel — at the time, a dry, frozen tundra. Then the lake overflowed, researchers say, sending water crashing over the land bridge in a series of waterfalls. Researchers say the flow — perhaps caused by a chunk of the ice sheet falling into the lake — left its mark in a series of deep holes in the bedrock of the channel, including some a few miles wide, which were spotted by engineers surveying for the channel tunnel decades ago. The water also weakened the land bridge substantially so that a second flood about 150,000 years ago caused it to fail completely. Researchers say the resulting \" megaflood \" likely carved a valley in the bedrock as it breached the land bridge, per the guardian. Rising sea levels at the end of the ice age made britain's separation complete. \" this was really one of the defining events for northwest europe — and certainly the defining event in britain's history, \" gupta tells the bbc.

Namely, white house press secretary sean spicer said trump wasn't referring to wiretapping when he tweeted about wiretapping. \" i think there's no question that the obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election, \" spicer said. \" the president used the word wiretaps in quotes to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities. \" wiretapping is a narrowly defined surveillance activity that involves tapping into \" a telephone or telegram wire in order to get information, \" according to merriam-webster dictionary.

        "summary": "Denmark's center-right governing coalition has passed a law banning full-face veils in public places, starting aug. 1, reports npr. The ban makes it illegal for muslim women to wear a burka ( a head-to-toe garment ) or a niqab ( a face covering ) in public. Justice minister soren pape poulsen has said that women wearing burqas or niqabs would be fined or told to remove their veils or \" go home, \" according to reuters. Violators would receive fines of about $ 156 for a first-time offense, and up to $ 1,568 for the fourth violation. Supporters of the ban say that covering the face is a form of oppression for women and poses security risks. Pape poulsen says face coverings are \"incompatible with the values of danish society \" and that \"we must be able to see each other and we must also be able to see each other's facial expressions, it's a value in denmark, \" the bbc reports. But critics say the law will force muslim women indoors. \"if the intention of this law was to protect women's rights it fails abjectly, \" an amnesty international spokesperson says in a statement. \"instead, the law criminalizes women for their choice of clothing. \" zainab ibn hssain, 20, of copenhagen, wears a niqab and is concerned. \"it will mean that i won't be able to go to school, go to work or go out with my family, \" she tells reuters. The law does allow people to cover their faces for a \"recognizable purpose, \" such as protection from cold weather or when wearing a motorcycle helmet, and police officers will have to use \" common sense \" in enforcing it, pape poulsen says, according to the ap. Austria, france, belgium, bulgaria, the netherlands, and the german state of bavaria have also imposed bans or restrictions on full-face veils in public places. And last year, quebec passed north america's first \" burka ban. \"",

But he's worried that, thanks to gender inequality and the ongoing wage gap that still pays women only 78 % of what men make, his little lady isn't going to get a fair shake financially when she's older. So, he writes for elle, he came up with the idea for a \" jump the gap \" fund for ivy. Adjusting for inflation, ford figured out what salaries his kids would make upon entering the workforce in 2032 and how much in lost wages ivy would rack up by 2070 ( between $ 1 million and $ 3 million, by his count ), figuring in the years she might leave work to care for future kids. \" we can predict that, because of the systematic economic inequities, our daughter will not be on the same financial footing as our son. And so why not start now? \" ford writes, insisting he's not favoring ivy over abe, because if abe really needed financial assistance down the road, ford and his wife would \" go all in \" and do what they could. Ford also thinks his son won't be jealous if he and his wife do a careful job raising both kids with info about gender bias. Others are weighing in on ford's \" purchasing her equality \" initiative, as he puts it. Katy osborn writes for time that, despite his \" imperfect response... At least he's putting his money where his mouth is. \" but kelsey miller notes for refinery 29 that ford's \" mansplaining \" and his suggested solution \" reads like a modest proposal for the internet age. \" ivy's extra stash won't \" inoculate her from unequal pay or prejudicial hiring practices, \" miller writes, may create an unhealthy sibling rivalry, and isn't practical for most families. \" his solution is one that only an extremely privileged minority could possibly achieve, and so to present it as a viable option to the general public is so nonsensical that it borders on trolling, \" she notes.

        "summary": "One of the most common herbivores of the dinosaur era might have been, well, not an herbivore. Fossilized poop likely to have come from a duck-billed dinosaur that roamed southern utah some 75 million years ago contains ancient shellfish, shaking what researchers thought they knew about hadrosaurs and other egg-laying \" herbivores. \" the feces also contained bits of wood. Whereas a single poop sample might suggest the crustaceans were accidentally ingested when the dinosaur snacked on a piece of rotting log, crustaceans found in 10 of 15 poop samples spread at different times across a 12-mile area indicate \" a recurring diet, \" study author karen chin tells npr. In fact, chin believes the dinosaurs ate the wood only to get at the shellfish — possibly crayfish or crab, per nature. The crustaceans, which were at least 2 inches long, would have provided the extra protein necessary during the breeding season to produce healthy eggs. In other words, shell in, shell out. The rest of the time, the dinosaurs likely stuck to a typical herbivore diet, says chin, noting other egg-laying \" herbivores \" like triceratops, stegosaurus, and brontosaurus might have done the same thing; modern bird species are also known to take in more protein and calcium during the breeding season, the researchers say in a release. Chin, whose research was published thursday in scientific reports, notes the discovery of this \" totally unexpected behavior \" came as a big surprise, one that shows there's still \" a lot we just don't know \" about dinosaurs.

Another shooting was reported today — passengers in a minivan say someone shot out a window while they were at a red light — but police haven't said whether they think it's linked to the earlier shootings. Three people have been injured by bullets during the shooting spree, but all survived. Police say they've received more than 100 tips and were offering $ 10,000 if one led to an arrest.",

The app was followed up by a simple pasta with garlic and oil, using barilla-brand pasta out of a box, reports the philadelphia inquirer. Not surprisingly, people liked the good bruschetta better, but they enjoyed their pasta more when it followed the mediocre bruschetta.

That's what people thought had happened 35 years ago, when the animal was declared extinct — for the second time.

Now, there are about 500 of the creatures in the wild, says wildlife official peter gober. But things aren't easy for the only american ferret species, the colorado springs independent notes. Both they and their prairie-dog prey lack resistance to a foreign disease known as sylvatic plague, national geographic explains. \" due to drought and because of this plague, \" prairie-dog numbers rise and fall; the ferret population does, too, gober says. The animals \" come and go \" like \" lights blinking on a christmas tree, \" notes the official, who breeds 250 of them each year in colorado. Another problem: prairie dogs eat the same grass cattle do. The government is offering ranchers financial support in exchange for allowing the prairie dogs some room. \" we hope that from penrose to piñon and across the arkansas river, our holdings … will never be part of a development, \" one rancher tells the independent. \" these will be open spaces forever, where the ferrets can roam free. \" ( speaking of roaming free, people may have recently spotted a gray wolf in the grand canyon for the first time in 70 years. )",

        "summary": "Five ticks not native to alaska have been found on dogs and humans in our northernmost state, and at least one of them — the american dog tick — appears to be solidly \" established \" in the last frontier, randy zarnke, an ex-wildlife veterinarian with the state's department of fish and game, tells the alaska dispatch news. \" that is not a good thing, \" he says of the fact that some of the ticks don't seem to have come from out-of-state dogs or alaska canines that may have traveled to other locations. \" [ the american dog tick ] attaches to humans and can spread diseases that we haven't had to worry about up until now. \" this news emerges out of a study published this month in the journal of medical entomology, which lists brown dog ticks, rocky mountain wood ticks, lone star ticks, and deer ticks as the other four species concerning scientists in their apparent new frigid home. From 2010 to 2016, researchers collected ticks sent in from vets, biologists, and residents — gathered from the bodies of humans and their four-legged friends, as well as at least one found just crawling around — from nine alaskan communities, including anchorage and juneau. The fact that non-resident ticks have popped up among the samples is concerning in a state whose experts and citizens often brag, \" we don't have ticks in alaska, \" co-author kimberlee beckmen said in a june 2012 feature on the fish and game department's website. This misinformation can lead to improper diagnosis of such tick-borne diseases as rocky mountain spotted fever ( carried by the american dog tick ), a serious illness that can cause paralysis and even death in dogs and humans. As for whether these migrating ticks can ultimately endure alaska's cold temps: \" probably, \" says lead study author lance durden. \" at least the milder coastal regions. \" ( the lone star tick could be linked to red-meat allergies. )",

And so his nicotine-related choices while meeting with south korean president moon jae-in on friday are attracting notice: though ashtrays were provided for kim while meeting outdoors with moon in panmunjom and in a reception room at peace house, south korean media says he refrained from smoking, apparently as a respectful gesture.

Perhaps any complaint of his public smoking would constitute a grave challenge to his almighty authority. But during last week's inter-korean summit, nobody saw the third-generation north korean leader in his early 30s smoking in public. Kim might have felt a spike of smoking desire ― a typical symptom of smokers in stress ― during the high-stakes political showdown with his south korean counterpart moon jae-in, 65. But smoking kim was nowhere to be seen on live tv coverage of the summit and even unheard of in free-flowing post-meeting hearsay. Then a question arises: how could kim control his nicotine cravings? another question is: why did he do",

Over the course of their meetings, kim, who is known to be a heavy smoker, did not light up once in moon's presence, apparently out of respect for the south korean president, who is 31 years his senior. The absence of a lit cigarette at any point in the proceedings came as a surprise. In official north korean photographs, kim is often seen with a cigarette dangling between his fingers, even on visits to a school and children's hospital and, last july, during a missile launch.

            "Image copyright kcna image caption no more cigarettes: has kim given up, or is this a subtle change in his image? north korean leader kim jong-un appears to have undergone a minor media makeover as he prepares for a series of meetings with former sworn enemies. He's due to meet south korean counterpart moon jae-in next week for the first inter-korean summit in over a decade, and us president donald trump within the next couple of months. North korean state media are toning down their traditionally hostile rhetoric, and presenting the north korean leader as a warmer man, with a cleaner image. The once ever-present cigarette between mr kim's fingers is now conspicuous by its absence, and his wife, ri sol-ju, may be set to play a more active role in the traditionally male-dominated regime, now being referred to as the \" first lady \". Perhaps in attempt",
            "By park si-soo a tenacious self-control or etiquette for a negotiation counterpart who is nearly double his age? north korean leader kim jong-un is a proven heavy smoker who would find nobody challenging his free cigarette puffing whenever and wherever he wants in his kingdom-like homeland. Perhaps any complaint of his public smoking would constitute a grave challenge to his almighty authority. But during last week's inter-korean summit, nobody saw the third-generation north korean leader in his early 30s smoking in public. Kim might have felt a spike of smoking desire ― a typical symptom of smokers in stress ― during the high-stakes political showdown with his south korean counterpart moon jae-in, 65. But smoking kim was nowhere to be seen on live tv coverage of the summit and even unheard of in free-flowing post-meeting hearsay. Then a question arises: how could kim control his nicotine cravings? another question is: why did he do",
            "Kim jong-un confirmed that he enjoyed a drink during friday's historic summit with moon jae-in, but it was his refusal to give in to his other vice that has caught the attention of the south korean media. Over the course of their meetings, kim, who is known to be a heavy smoker, did not light up once in moon's presence, apparently out of respect for the south korean president, who is 31 years his senior. The absence of a lit cigarette at any point in the proceedings came as a surprise. In official north korean photographs, kim is often seen with a cigarette dangling between his fingers, even on visits to a school and children's hospital and, last july, during a missile launch. But on friday, the cigarettes were nowhere to be seen, including during his lengthy al fresco bonding session with moon on"

The chicago tribune reports that trump appears to have taken his figures from a story it ran on monday and there have now been 247 people shot in the city in 2017, with 44 killed. The tribune notes that during his campaign, trump claimed to have spoken with top chicago police officials who told them they could stop the violence in a week with tougher measures, though the campaign declined to identify the officials he spoke to. In an interview with wttw tuesday, mayor rahm emanuel noted that the federal government already has a presence in chicago, with fbi and atf agents, among others, assisting local law enforcement, but he would welcome help from trump in areas including gun tracking and funding the hiring of more police officers. \" over the years the federal government's stepped back their resources, which we have stepped up, \" the mayor said. \" the federal government can be a partner, and to be honest, they haven't been for decades. \" trump's remarks came a day after emanuel publicly criticized trump, telling reporters that the president should be focusing on jobs instead of the size of his inaugural crowd, the chicago sun-times reports.",

His name is kevin edson, according to the ap. A barefoot edson approached the finish line last night wearing a black veil over a floppy hat and chanting, \" boston strong! \" police stopped him and pulled off his veil to find his face painted blue and yellow. He told police there was a pressure cooker in his backpack, and indeed there was — filled with confetti. Here's what we know about edson so far: online he goes by \" kayvon, \" and he's posted loads of youtube videos of himself. In one spotted by daily intel he describes himself as \" a fashion designer, an entrepreneur, a performance artist, a mental patient, a blogger bloggerist, a jailbird, a college dropout, and a drag queen. \" later in the video, he laments, \" i really need exposure. \" his twitter bio reads, \" kayvon is a total avantgardster and a fashion dinosaur. He makes mad f@$ h10n and will tell ' ya straight- even though he's a total f*g. \" yesterday on his blog, he posted a series of photos of dzhokhar tsarnaev with what we're guessing are supposed to be funny meme-style captions. \" sexy til proven innocent, \" read one. Another photo, which he yesterday made his facebook cover photo, reads, \" had a blast at the marathon!!! y u stalin 2 call me??????? \" edson's mother tells the ap that he has bipolar disorder. Edson may be referencing that condition in a video the new york post spotted in which he appears in a makeshift padded cell. Edson's brother posted on facebook to disavow his actions, writing, \" my brother is a different kind of sick. What he did at the finish line earlier today is absurd and shameful. It should not be considered art or condoned in any way. … he thought something like this could get him that fame he always chased. \" police detonated the backpack, along with another that had been left unattended — which necn revealed actually belonged to their news crew. The reporters had left it behind when the area was evacuated, and weren't allowed to go back for it. Edson will be arraigned today on charges of disorderly conduct, possession of a hoax device, and threats to commit a crime, among others.",

        "summary": "\" the absence of a hypothesis of a possible common cause does not make it possible to hold further investigations. \" such is the pronouncement of france's public health agency after investigating a rash of cases of babies born without arms, forearms, or hands. The guardian reports the focus was on three clusters: three babies born as such in mouzeil in 2007 and 2008; three born in guidel between 2011 and 2013; and seven born near the village of druillat over the 2009 to 2014 period. In that last cluster, all lived within a roughly 10-mile radius of the village in an area where maize and sunflowers are grown. Epidemiologist emmanuelle amar heads remera, described by the local as a public body that studies malformations; it surveyed the mothers in that last village. Its researchers found just one commonality: the very rural nature of where the women live. The same holds true for the two other locations, which has led some to suspect pesticides or something agricultural was at play. But the health authority's director says the theory just doesn't hold up: \" we have listened to their parents and their grandparents and visited their homes.... We have not identified a common exposure to the occurrence of these malformations. \" but contention remains: the health authority says the druillat-area cases are within what you'd normally expect to see; the local reports about 150 children are born annually in the country with such birth defects. Remera contends it's 58 times higher. As for the other two clusters, the health authority did consider them to be an \" excess of cases. \"",

            "Officials say they cannot find any link between cases and will not investigate further french doctors have admitted they do not know why clusters of babies have been born with limbs missing, saying they cannot find any link between the cases and will not be investigating further. Thirteen children have been born missing hands, forearms or arms in three rural areas of france between 2007 and 2017. The public health authorities had initially said the incidences of abnormality were \"probably down to chance \". But doctors at a research organisation said the likelihood of it being coincidental was \"more than infinitesimal \" and demanded a full investigation. They believe the clusters may be linked to the use of pesticides and described the french authorities ' lack of action as a \"health scandal \". Emmanuelle amar, an epidemiologist and director of the group remera told the guardian it would be scientifically remiss not to continue research. \"these malformations are very rare, but also very specific. There is something, some product, that is cutting the limbs at the time the embryo is developing. We must search for it. We must ask ourselves, what could be capable of halting this development and find it. \" amar said the most likely cause of the anomalies was \"environmental or medical \", but warned against making presumptions. \"we have to have a social conscience. These are future children",
            "What's the story? there have been several reports circulating in the french press over the past week about an unusually high number of babies born without hands and in some cases, without part of their forearms, in three specific areas of france. A total of 13 babies were born without arms between 2007 and 2017 in three specific rural areas of the country that have come under the microscope.

            "Officials say they cannot find any link between cases and will not investigate further french doctors have admitted they do not know why clusters of babies have been born with limbs missing, saying they cannot find any link between the cases and will not be investigating further. Thirteen children have been born missing hands, forearms or arms in three rural areas of france between 2007 and 2017. The public health authorities had initially said the incidences of abnormality were \"probably down to chance \". But doctors at a research organisation said the likelihood of it being coincidental was \"more than infinitesimal \" and demanded a full investigation. They believe the clusters may be linked to the use of pesticides and described the french authorities ' lack of action as a \"health scandal \". Emmanuelle amar, an epidemiologist and director of the group remera told the guardian it would be scientifically remiss not to continue research. \"these malformations are very rare, but also very specific. There is something, some product, that is cutting the limbs at the time the embryo is developing. We must search for it. We must ask ourselves, what could be capable of halting this development and find it. \" amar said the most likely cause of the anomalies was \"environmental or medical \", but warned against making presumptions. \"we have to have a social conscience. These are future children",
            "What's the story? there have been several reports circulating in the french press over the past week about an unusually high number of babies born without hands and in some cases, without part of their forearms, in three specific areas of france.

Mother jones also points out that when the \" mohammed cartoon \" riots sprang up in 2006, george w. Bush put out a similar statement, saying, \" we find them offensive, and we certainly understand why muslims would find these images offensive. \" romney's capitol hill allies have largely left him out to dry, politico reports. John boehner, mitch mcconnell, and eric cantor all declined to even mention obama in their remarks. For that matter, the washington post observes that paul ryan didn't either. Sensing a brewing disaster, the romney campaign hastily distributed talking points to republican leaders, urging them to attack obama's \" foreign policy of weakness, \" in general, but to dismiss questions about romney's attacks, cnn reports. But not everyone sees it as a disaster; gop strategist and cnn contributor alex castellanos called it a potential \" game changer, \" urging romney \" to go at this. \"",

Dozens more foreigners have fled in recent weeks, most caught as they tried to cross the frontier, as isis's capacity to hold ground in syria and iraq collapses. Some – it is not known how many – are thought to have evaded capture and made it across the border into turkey. Aristidou, who is believed to be in his mid-20s, surrendered at the kilis crossing in southern turkey along with his wife – said to be a british woman of bangladeshi heritage – and kleman, 46. The american had arrived at the border with a syrian wife and two egyptian women, whose spouses had been killed in syria or iraq, turkish officials said.

In a piece accompanied by this attention-grabbing cover ( via the huffington post ), he looks at evidence from scientists to insurance agencies suggesting that though sandy would have happened regardless, her strength and size would not have been as devastating if it weren't for global warming. He goes on to criticize mitt romney for his shift from an environmental advocate to a \" climate change agnostic. \" obama's not off the hook, either, since he's distanced himself from the debate in his bid to win reelection, and his first term saw only moderate progress on the environment. To say that environmental regulation adversely affects the economy, as some claim, is \" both shortsighted and dangerous. \" the problem will eventually demand global action, and the us, barrett argues, needs to lead the way for countries like india and china.

Fungi on the covered trees formed a sort of cement that allowed the sand to keep its hollowed out shape as the wood decayed and collapsed inward, leaving holes more than 10 feet ( 3 meters ) deep in the dune known as mount baldy at the indiana dunes national lakeshore, according to a study published in december by erin argyilan, who heads indiana university northwest's department of geosciences.

It's the first time people are drinking less alcohol since euromonitor started tracking that stat in 2001 — and likely even before that. The telegraph reports the world drank 1.7 billion fewer liters of alcohol in 2015 than it did in 2014. In a remarkable show of moderation, we only managed to put away 248 billion liters total last year. Experts blame the drop in alcohol consumption on slumping economies across the globe, according to the week. China, the biggest alcohol consumer in the world, drank 3.5 % less booze in 2015. Major drops were also seen in russia ( 8 % ) and the ukraine ( 17 % ). In terms of specific alcohols, rum and vodka had the worst 2015. Not even beer was safe, as consumption dropped 1.3 %. But it wasn't all bad news. People actually drank more english gin, irish and japanese whiskey, and dark beer last year. And cider consumption rose 4.5 %. \" it is no coincidence that those also happen to be the segments gaining further momentum with the ever-important millennial demographic, \" euromonitor's senior alcoholic drinks analyst says.

Brazil, which is facing political corruption and an economic slump, saw its consumption drop by 2.5 percent. The two drinks that are suffering the most from the slumps are rum and vodka, which landed top spots for the worst performing drinks in 2015.

Now, more controversy regarding the nbc anchor's memory issues: the new orleans advocate says claims he made while covering hurricane katrina in 2005 — including an account of contracting dysentery and watching a man's body float by — have \" raised eyebrows. \" \" when you look out of your hotel window in the french quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in … indonesia, and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country, \" he said of new orleans conditions post-storm in a 2006 interview with michael eisner. But the french quarter is elevated, the advocate notes, and largely wasn't hit by floodwaters that devastated much of the city — though new york magazine does point out reported instances where french quarter areas did appear to have been flooded. In an interview with tom brokaw last year, williams also revealed he had \" accidentally ingested some of the floodwater \" and \" became very sick with dysentery. \" but a former city health director tells the advocate that \" i don't recall a single... Case of gastroenteritis during katrina or in the whole month afterward \"; he adds he also doesn't know of anyone who consumed floodwater, but \" my dogs drank it, and they didn't have any problems. \" also questionable, as per new york, is williams'story of witnessing a suicide in the louisiana superdome. In the brokaw interview, williams says he witnessed the suicide firsthand; in nbc's in his own words documentary, he says, \" we'd heard the story of a man killing himself falling from the upper deck. \" is it possible that williams is really just having unintentional mind melts? according to memory researchers interviewed in new york, it's unlikely, but still possible. \" memory is totally weird like that, \" one says.",

And now, according to a new report out by the national highway cooperative highway research program, rural areas across the country are intentionally ripping up stretches of pavement in a return to gravel, reports wired. The bar is, indeed, low: the report uncovered a widespread sentiment among residents that in spite of the extra dust and other nuisances, depaving is fine because at least the worst roads are getting some form of attention. The phenomenon isn't exactly new. Back in 2010 the wall street journal took note of the trend and reported that south dakota had recently turned about 100 miles of asphalt road to gravel; nearly half of michigan counties had converted at least some roads in this way; some counties in alabama and pennsylvania were further downgrading asphalt to chip-and-seal \" poor man's pavement \"; and some counties in ohio were so broke they were letting roads naturally erode to gravel. John habermann of purdue university warned at a seminar he called \" back to the stone age \" that no roads are free roads, and that in the long run gravel's need to be graded and smoothed can actually cost more than regular asphalt maintenance.

He spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the pending investigation. Kakehi has denied involvement in the deaths and has not been formally charged. Her latest marriage lasted one month before her husband died in december. Cyanide had also been found in the blood of a 71-year-old partner who fell while riding a bike in 2012, officials said.

Media won't talk about leftist professors advocating white genocide! \" but as of monday, ciccariello-maher wasn't backing down, mainly because he says the \" white genocide \" concept is an \" imaginary \" one created by white supremacists and \" used to denounce everything from interracial relationships to multicultural policies, \" he said in an email to the inquirer. \" it is a figment of the racist imagination, it should be mocked, and i ' m glad to have mocked it, \" he added, noting he's received \" hundreds of death threats. \" the university says it wants a meeting with the professor to \" discuss this matter in detail. \" \" while the university recognizes the right of its faculty to freely express their thoughts and opinions in public debate...

But there won't be any more christmases in august for the man behind the store's name: eddie antar, the ex-owner of the now-defunct chain, died saturday, the new york times and new york daily news report, citing confirmation from family and a local memorial provider. No cause of death was given. Antar built up his business from one brooklyn store to more than 40 stores in new york, connecticut, new jersey, and pennsylvania. People today still remember the crazy eddie commercials from that era, featuring frenetic pitchman jerry carroll ( who many people thought was eddie himself ) bouncing around the set with high-energy enthusiasm and promising bargain prices that were \" insane. \" but despite the success of his retail chain — sales peaked at $ 350 million, per the times — things started to fall apart in 1987, when investors staged a hostile takeover of the company and prosecutors went after antar for securities fraud and insider trading. Antar disappeared to israel for a few years but was extradited back to the us in 1993. He eventually accepted a plea deal to a racketeering conspiracy charge and served about seven years in prison. The new owners of the retail chain, meanwhile, had declared bankruptcy in 1989, and while antar tried to get the business back up and running as an online venture once he got out of prison, it never took off. \" he was very charming, charismatic, very powerful, very decisive. He was an incredible leader. … and then there was the dark side that got him into trouble, \" a former business associate who helped antar develop his famous ads tells the times.",

Both women had dated adam davies ( the llama-keeper ), and westlake was said to have hit sanders in the face with a wineglass after an argument. But while the lower court had found westlake acted \" recklessly but not intentionally \" in injuring sanders ( the guardian notes sanders needed three stitches on her cheek to close up the wound ), the high court justices also took \" recklessly \" out of the equation, noting that the lower court had used an erroneous test for recklessness.

The flag had been lowered to half-staff in the wake of sen. John mccain's saturday afternoon death. The ap reports the us flag code states that flags be lowered \" on the day of death and the following day for a member of congress, \" meaning the flag's current position checks out. But politico points out president trump, who had a famously rocky relationship with mccain, has not yet issued a flag proclamation, which often occurs in the wake of such prominent deaths and would see the flag remain lowered. The site's email to the administration asking if that would occur was not answered. These presidential proclamations, which have been issued by trump following the deaths of barbara bush and sen. John glenn, generally hold that the flag should stay at half-staff until interment occurs; in mccain's case, that will be saturday. Some flags elsewhere in the capital, including at the capitol, remain lowered. The washington post reports the washington monument's flags were raised mid-morning on monday. The post highlights a monday tweet from a rep for chuck schumer, who writes, \" senators schumer &amp; mcconnell have requested that the @deptofdefense provide necessary support so that us flags on all government buildings remain at half mast through sunset on the day of senator mccain's internment. \" read more on mccain's funeral arrangements, including who he ' ll be buried next to, here.",

        "summary": "North korea now considers itself at war with all 15 members of the united nations security council, according to a blistering statement issued after the council unanimously approved tough new sanctions. The country's foreign minister described the latest round of sanctions as an \" act of war \" that was \" rigged up by the us and its followers, \" cnn reports. \" those countries that raised their hands in favor of this'sanctions resolution'shall be held completely responsible for all the consequences to be caused by the'resolution ' and we will make sure for ever and ever that they pay a heavy price for what they have done, \" the statement said. Un resolution 2397, issued in response to pyongyang's ballistic missile tests, slashes north korea's fuel imports by around 90 % and requires the return home of all north koreans working overseas within 24 months. North korea's statement said the sanctions were introduced because the us is frightened of its power. The us is \" completely terrified at our accomplishment of the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, is getting more and more frenzied in the moves to impose the harshest-ever sanctions and pressure on our country, \" it said, per the bbc. \" we will further consolidate our self-defensive nuclear deterrence aimed at fundamentally eradicating the us nuclear threats, blackmail, and hostile moves by establishing the practical balance of force with the us. \"",
