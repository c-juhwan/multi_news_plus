        "summary": "Amid the fallout from the release of the gop-produced memo on alleged fbi surveillance overreach, house democrats are pushing for the release of their own memo. Democrats, who are expected to call for a vote in a monday afternoon meeting of the house intelligence committee, say their document will serve as a rebuttal to claims in the gop document and adds context to the fbi and doj decision to wiretap former trump aide carter page, the new york times reports. The gop-controlled committee voted against releasing the democratic memo at the same time as the republican memo, but they now say they're willing to release it, which would require the approval of president trump. Senate minority leader chuck schumer urged trump on sunday to approve the release of the memo, saying failure to do so would \" confirm the american people's worst fears that the release of chairman nunes ' memo was only intended to undermine special counsel bob mueller's investigation, \" cnn reports. Republican sources, meanwhile, tell axios that there are several more memos to come detailing \" areas of concern, \" including political bias and possible efforts to aid hillary clinton's campaign, at agencies including the fbi and the state department, and that releasing them won't require the same extensive declassification procedure as the russia memo. House intelligence committee chief rep. Devin nunes said friday that they are now in \" phase two \" of their investigation.",

The move means that rousseff will be suspended from office while a trial that could last six months gets under way, reports the ap. But given the lopsided vote to proceed with the trial, 55-22, rousseff stands little chance of prevailing in the end, reports the new york times. She's accused of improperly borrowing from state banks — not to enrich herself personally, but to cover up budget shortfalls to improve her re-election prospects in about two years. \"given the polarization in brazil, if she sticks to her guns and fights this all the way to the end, it's going to prolong the agony for the country, \" says a professor of international management at the university of pennsylvania. \" the best thing she could do for her country is to bite the bullet and step aside. \" rousseff will be replaced as president in the interim by vice president michel temer. Stories and headlines suggest that rousseff already has been \" impeached \" because of thursday's vote, but there's disagreement about that in legal circles, notes the times. \"in brazil, the term impeachment is used only after a conviction is made in the trial, \" says a law professor in rio de janeiro.",

And not every case turned out badly for the politician who was targeted. In the united states, two presidents have been impeached — andrew johnson in 1868 and bill clinton in 1998 — but neither had to step aside during his trial. Both were acquitted. But in brazil, ms.

Then, in 2016, he was set free after a prosecutor and a judge determined he could not have committed the crime. Now, the investigation into that man, jack daniel mccullough, is itself under investigation, reports the daily chronicle. While testifying against mccullough in 2012, seattle detective irene lau said that when questioned about ridulph — who had been mccullough's neighbor in 1957, before he moved to seattle — mccullough answered as if he were \" deeply, deeply in love \" with the little girl, calling her \" stunningly beautiful \" and \" lovely, lovely, lovely, \" per cnn. A special prosecutor has now been appointed to investigate whether she committed perjury when she said that. The inquiry will focus on lau and on how the state's attorney handled evidence and witnesses, but it could expand to address other allegations, such as whether police and prosecutors purposely hid a 78-minute video of mccullough's questioning. In her report summarizing the questioning, which includes the \" lovely, lovely, lovely \" line and others that later appeared in her testimony, lau wrote that the conversation was recorded, but a year later, an illinois prosecutor appeared to say that it had not been recorded. No recording was turned over to mccullough's defense team, as is required if a tape exists. But a recording has since been discovered; in it, mccullough is never heard to utter the \" lovely, lovely, lovely \" line. He also denied killing her, saying, \" i loved that little girl, like the whole neighborhood loved that little girl. \" ( the family of a girl murdered in 1984 is hoping for justice at last. )",

The friedmans eventually traveled europe and asia advocating for environmental issues and world peace for washington-based groups earthkind and promoting enduring peace. After the chernobyl disaster, louis friedman even raised money for victims and organized tours to stress the importance of clean energy. \" we've had many people tell us that what we do is too intense and depressing, \" louis told the new york times in 1992. \" well, if anything, we feel invigorated. \" as one friend puts it, \" they set an example for all of us. \" says another: \" they were awesome, they were just rocks, solid rocks.

        "summary": "Hurricane irma continued to sweep through the caribbean with devastating force early thursday, knocking out power to an estimated 1 million people in puerto rico. The storm didn't make landfall on the island, but the national hurricane center says it could still get up to 20 inches of rain, making flooding a serious danger, nbc news reports. Before the storm's arrival, authorities warned that the poor state of much of puerto rico's infrastructure meant that the storm could lead to some areas losing power for up to six months. Irma is expected to move north of the dominican republic and haiti later thursday and approach the bahamas by evening. The latest: the storm dealt what antigua and barbuda prime minister gaston browne called \" heart-wrenching \" devastation to barbuda, the smaller of the country's two islands, the new york times reports. He said the island, home to around 1,600 people, is \" literally rubble, \" with 95 % of all structures damaged or destroyed. He said a 2-year-old child was killed as a family tried to escape a damaged home. French interior minister gerard collomb said thursday that at least eight people were killed and 23 injured in the french territories of st. Martin and st. Barthelemy, though daybreak could reveal a far higher toll, the ap reports. \" it's a tragedy, we ' ll need to rebuild both islands, \" he said. \" most of the schools have been destroyed. \" the british territory of anguilla was also hit hard by the storm, the guardian reports. \" anguilla is utterly devastated. We are very familiar with hurricanes, but this particular one, hurricane irma, was off the charts in terms of strength, \" says josephine gumbs-connor, a lawyer from the territory who accuses the british government of doing little to help. The national hurricane center says the chances of a direct hit on florida have increased. \" south florida and central florida will be impacted. We're confident with that right now, \" a center spokesman tells the miami herald. \" what we're not confident with is exactly where that center is going to go. But remember a hurricane is not a dot on the map. They're large storms that cover a large area. \" in florida, the polk county sheriff's office warned sex offenders and people with arrest warrants against going to storm shelters, the tampa bay times reports. \" if you go to a shelter for #irma and you have a warrant, we ' ll gladly escort you to the safe and secure shelter called the polk county jail, \" the office tweeted.",

Just two weeks ago, trump was torn in trying to choose from one of four leading contenders: rudy giuliani, mitt romney, bob corker, or david petreaus. Then the name of rex tillerson surfaced. The washington post reports that while a stymied trump was speaking with former defense chief robert gates, he asked gates if he had a different name to suggest. \" i recommend rex, \" responded gates. The previous day, former secretary of state condoleezza rice floated tillerson's name in a meeting with mike pence. Rice and gates are partners in the international consulting firm ricehadleygates, and they know tillerson because exxonmobil is a client. Trump \" seemed intrigued, \" gates tells the post. \" it was not something he had considered. \" cnn reports that stephen hadley, former national security adviser to george w. Bush and the third name in that consulting group, also expressed his support for tillerson to pence. Former secretary of state james baker, who knows tillerson because his firm has represented exxonmobil on various business deals, similarly voiced support. Trump then met with tillerson twice. \" as soon as he met him, he told people that tillerson is the kind of guy that walks in a room and commands respect, \" a transition official tells politico.

It's unclear why, though he notes a warrant is needed without compliance from the property owner. But if inspectors didn't see the inside of the property, former tenants, visitors, and neighbors say police and fire officials certainly did. They say fire officials had entered the building at least twice in the last two and a half years — oakland's fire chief couldn't confirm the visits, per cnn — while police officers went inside at least six times, reports reuters.

Though police had some clues to work from — ozy reports the children were seen speaking to a blond man, bought a meat pie with money their parents say they didn't leave the house with, and were seen heading home by a postman — the truth of their disappearance persists more than 50 years later in a case that forever altered the way australians parented. In january, international coverage amped up again as the 50-year anniversary approached; one particular development led authorities to hunt down details of an already deceased suspect. It didn't pan out. But the coverage may have had an effect: news.com.au in january reported that over the past two years, police have fielded 159 calls about the case, or one every four days on average. Two months later, australia's abc reported that 246 calls had been received so far in 2016.

It's all the more remarkable because her husband was one of those firefighters rushing to get there. The drama began tuesday night when rachelle flatt of spokane valley put her three kids to bed about 9: 30, noticed flames on the patio, and called 911, reports khq. Then came the explosion — flames ignited a propane tank, and the blast sent smoke and flames into the home. Flatt first got her 3-year-old girl out the front door and into the hands of neighbors, reports the spokesman-review. Then she went back and got her 15-month-old girl, and back a third time though the thick smoke to get her 6-year-old boy. \"that's when i really started to panic, \" she says. \" i was running out of air. \" she made it, though, with husband pete on the way with his fellow firefighters. \" my heart just dropped, \" he recalls, upon hearing the address. The house suffered heavy damage, but it was insured. The one sad note was the death of faithful hank the tank, one of the family's dogs. \" he followed me back to my son's room and didn't make it out, \" says rachelle.",

Coakley asked an oklahoma county district court judge \" to halt the desecration \" of a stolen \" eucharistic host, \" scheduled to be sacrificed on sept. 21 at the oklahoma city civic center music hall, reports the oklahoman. Adam daniels, who paid $ 420 to rent a basement theater in the civic center for five hours, is organizing a tamer version of a traditional black mass, or the inversion of a catholic mass, for dakhma of angra mainyu syndicate, but it still involves a sacrifice to the devil. \" a host is simply a piece of bread, \" the lawsuit reads. \" however, a consecrated host — including the consecrated host that is the subject of this action — is a host that has undergone the transubstantiation and is now the body and blood of jesus christ. To catholics, the consecrated host is the most sacred, respected, and revered thing in the world. \" daniels, meanwhile, wouldn't tell the ap how he came to possess the wafer, but he says he didn't steal it and he shot back at coakley, saying he'd sue for defamation.

Earlier today, germany called for \" an end to the restrictions on mr morsi's whereabouts, \" reports globalpost.

        "summary": "A new survey only adds to the growing perception that there's a rape crisis in us colleges, the washington post reports. According to 150,000 students responding at 27 schools, more than one in five female undergraduates have been sexually assaulted ( including forced kissing or groping ) and 11 % experienced unwanted penetration, half the time by force. Conducted by westat, a social science firm that sent out electronic questionnaires for the association of american universities, the survey data jibes with another poll out earlier this year. \" it is shockingly bad, but it is the truth, \" says education secretary arne duncan when told about the data. \" it's just like gun violence.... We can either hide from that reality, or not. \" among the survey's other findings: the rate of sexual assault varied by school. It was 23 % overall, but hit 13 % at one school and 30 % at another. School-specific data isn't out yet, but most of the schools say they ' ll release that information this week, the huffington post reports. Only one in four students said they reported rape or sodomy to law enforcement or university authorities. Their main reason was that \" it wasn't serious enough, \" says huffpo. But 63 % said they believed campus officials would take such a report seriously. Sexual harassment was even more prevalent, with at least 49 % of female undergrads reporting it at every school in the survey. Among lgbtq students, that number rose to 75 %. One in twenty undergraduate guys say they were sexually assaulted or experienced sexual misconduct. Only 19.3 % of students responded to the survey — less than was expected — and some of its data includes encounters that lacked \" affirmative consent, \" or ongoing approval by both people throughout a sexual encounter. But the message seems clear, and \" the leaders of our universities are deeply concerned about the impact of these issues on their students, \" says aau president hunter rawlings.",

But when he started to load the paintings from the ho-ho-kus, nj, locker in his truck, he was blown away. \"i see these huge boxes that say de kooning on them, \" he said. \"what are the odds of finding a de kooning in a storage unit? it's unheard of! \" killen ended up finding six total paintings that he's confident are by the abstract expressionist, along with a nice bonus — a painting he believes to be by swiss-born modernist paul klee. De kooning paintings can bring anywhere from $ 30,000 to tens of millions of dollars, killen said. The artist's \"untitled xxv \" fetched a staggering $ 66.3 million at a 2016 auction. And a",
            "New york ( ap ) — a new york city art dealer who bought the contents of a new jersey storage locker filled with paintings for $ 15,000 says he got more than he bargained for. He found half a dozen paintings he believes were done by artist willem de kooning, whose works have sold for millions of dollars at auction. The new york post reports david killen bought the contents of the ho-ho-kus ( hoh-hoh ' -kuhs ), new jersey, locker last year. The paintings were originally from the studio of art conservator orrin riley, who died in 1986, and his partner, susanne schnitzer, who died in 2009. The paintings aren't signed, but killen reached out to an expert who's confident they were done by de kooning, an abstract expressionist from the netherlands who moved to the united states and died in 1997. ___ information from: new york post, http://www.nypost.com"

        "summary": "Amazon on friday announced it is buying whole foods in its biggest deal by far: one valued at about $ 13.7 billion, including debt, reports the ap. Amazon will pay $ 42 per share of whole foods in a deal that is targeted to close in the second half of 2017. Bloomberg reports amazon's biggest acquisition thus far was its $ 970 million purchase of video-game service twitch interactive in 2014. As of the end of march, amazon had about $ 21.5 billion in cash and equivalents. More: amazon founder jeff bezos issued a statement that gives little insight into the buy: \" millions of people love whole foods market because they offer the best natural and organic foods, and they make it fun to eat healthy. Whole foods market has been satisfying, delighting and nourishing customers for nearly four decades — they're doing an amazing job and we want that to continue. \" wall street journal financial editor dennis berman's take, per twitter: \" amazon did not just buy whole foods grocery stores. It bought 431 upper-income, prime-location distribution nodes for everything it does. \" per the press release, there won't be much boat-rocking at the outset: whole foods co-founder and ceo john mackey will stay on as ceo; the headquarters will remain in austin, texas; and whole foods market will continue to operate stores under the whole foods market brand. In the june issue of texas monthly, mackey had this to say about jana partners, the hedge fund that in april revealed its 9 % stake in whole foods and called for the company to make drastic changes or even sell itself: \" these guys just want to sell us, because they think they can make 40 % or 50 % in a short period of time. They're greedy bastards. \" the magazine notes the april surprise was preceded by a november one: the co-ceo structure that saw 25-year whole foods veteran walter robb serve alongside mackey for 6 years was being eliminated. It writes, \" mackey... Had acted less as a traditional executive and more as a kind of spiritual leader, with robb handling more of the day-to-day matters. By january, the founding-father-philosopher was running things alone, which made some investors nervous. \" the news comes a day after bloomberg reported that amazon was eyeing another acquisition: corporate messaging startup slack, worth an estimated $ 9 billion or more.",

The 610-foot-long vessel, the first of a new class of destroyers, features an angular shape ( gary robbins describes it as \" knife-like \" for the san diego union-tribune ) designed to make it appear like a small fishing boat on enemy radar. Among the $ 3 billion vessel's many other advancements, per the ap and business insider: onboard technology that targets submarines and minefields, a single and secure network that the captain can use to control the vessel's systems from any point on the ship, and the use of electric propulsion ( a first among navy ships ); its power production will allow it to support the futuristic electromagnetic rail gun, which will be tested at sea in 2016. Another advancement, and a cost-reducing one at that: fewer sailors. Thanks to its technological systems, the zumwalt need only be manned by about about 130 sailors, as opposed to the crew of 210 aboard the navy's arleigh burke-class destroyers, which are about 100 feet shorter. Robbins adds that it takes a page, physically-speaking, from \" the steam-powered ironclad warships that played a role in the american civil war \": its low profile and narrowing hull will allow it to sail quietly in both shallow depths and the wave-filled ocean. At business insider, paul szoldra calls it \" a swiss-army knife for missions of the future, \" noting that it is designed to handle long-term operations targeting those at sea or on land.

        "summary": "Roman emperors not only had war, jealousy, and political infighting to worry about — there was also the rain. A new study linking climate data to roman history finds that lower average rainfall boosted the odds of an emperor being murdered during the empire's roughly 500-year run, from 27 bce to 476 ce, the smithsonian reports. The reasoning: low rainfall in what is now france and germany ( then the roman frontier, where many troops were stationed ) would cause low harvests and starve soldiers, who became more likely to mutiny. \" that mutiny, in turn, would collapse support for the emperor and make him more prone to assassination, \" study co-author cornelius christian, an assistant economics professor in canada, tells live science. Relying on a 2011 study of oak-tree rings, researchers found that a 20 % drop in annual rainfall created a 0.11 standard deviation increase in the chance a roman emperor being murdered the following year, the economist reports. Those most in danger lived during the gordian dynasty from 235 ce to 285 ce, when 14 emperors were killed. \" we're not trying to claim that rainfall is the only explanation for all these things, \" says christian. \" but usually there is a drought preceding the assassination of the emperor. \" their study is part of a growing field linking historical events to climate data, like a nature study last year about how volcanic activity may have created drier conditions and crippled egypt's ptolemaic dynasty.

As the planet warms, global heatwaves and associated droughts will become increasingly common. History offers numerous cautionary tales about the effects that these weather-related shocks can have on society and politics. One such lesson is how drought affected the stability of the roman empire 1,500 years ago.

            "During the past two months, the world has been stifled by exceptional temperatures. Deadly wildfires have ripped through parts of the united states and greece; japan has declared its heatwave a natural disaster; drought in britain has led to hosepipe bans and caused farmers to slaughter their cattle for lack of feedstock. As the planet warms, global heatwaves and associated droughts will become increasingly common. History offers numerous cautionary tales about the effects that these weather-related shocks can have on society and politics. One such lesson is how drought affected the stability of the roman empire 1,500 years ago. In a new paper published in economics letters, cornelius christian of brock university and liam elbourne of st francis xavier university identify a strong association between rainfall patterns and the duration in power of roman emperors. The academics",

The eruptions took place in october 1902 ( santa maria, guatemala ), june 1912 ( novarupta, alaska ), march 1963 ( agung, indonesia ), march 1982 ( el chichón, mexico ), and june 1991 ( pinatubo, philippines ) ( fig. 1b ). The 1912 eruption is the only extratropical eruption, so the cmip5 model response is likely more representative of the response to tropical eruptions. The p-e response is computed by averaging over may – october of 1903,",

            "The man credited with honing donald trump's populist message and guiding him into the white house has grown frustrated amid continued infighting in the west wing, so much so that in recent weeks a top donor had to persuade him to stay in his position. Five people, including a senior administration official and several sources close to the president, tell politico that steve bannon, one of trump's closest advisers, has clashed with the president's son-in-law, jared kushner, who's taken on an increasingly prominent portfolio in the west wing. Bannon has complained that kushner and his allies are trying to undermine his populist approach, the sources said. Story continued below republican megadonor rebekah mercer, a longtime bannon confidante who became a prominent trump supporter during the campaign, urged bannon not to resign. \"rebekah mercer prevailed upon him to stay, \" said one person familiar with the situation. Another person familiar with the situation, a gop operative who talks to mercer, said: \"bekah tried to convince him that this is a long-term play. \" bannon has worked closely with mercer not only at the right-wing website breitbart news, where her family is a major investor and where he served as executive chairman until joining the trump campaign in august, but also at cambridge analytica, the data-analytics firm owned largely by the mercers"

A sampling of columnists'takes on his response: in the new yorker, jelani cobb says this is one of the weakest responses to nazism america has seen. Even the eventual white house clarification wasn't much better than trump's original response. \" when questioned about the rationale for trump's evenhandedness, the white house clarified that both the protesters and the counter-protesters had resorted to violence.

They are punching downwards out of irrational hate. \" at fivethirtyeight, julia azari points out why it's interesting trump isn't specifically condemning white supremacy.

For one, trump repeatedly denounced his predecessor, barack obama, for refusing to use the phrase ' radical islamic terrorism'to refer to attacks by islamist radicals.

        "summary": "April 20 isn't just a holiday for stoners: in a world where recreational marijuana is legal in eight states, it's basically the entire christmas shopping season rolled into a single day for pot businesses. \" we're just expecting to get slammed, \" the owner of a smoking room in colorado tells cnn. One expert expects to see an increase in business of 30 % to 40 %, especially as some marijuana retailers are offering discounts of up to 50 %. It's no wonder thursday is being called a \" really good time to stock up \" for potheads. Here's what else you need to know about 4/20: there's a lot of incorrect information floating around about the origin of the term \" 420. \" mental floss sets us straight, revealing that it started in 1971 with a group of california high-schoolers whose personal slang — referring to the time of day they met up to smoke — caught on with the grateful dead. But do we really need 4/20 as a rallying point anymore? that's the question rolling stone asks as the legalization of weed goes mainstream. Snoop dogg, for one, says yes, calling it one of his \" favorite days. \" rolling stone also has a list of the best country songs to play while smoking pot. Willie nelson obviously makes an appearance. With the majority of americans now believing marijuana should be legal, according to a recent poll, quartz looks at where in the us you can get high without worry. ( hint: go west, young pothead. ) gizmodo runs an old article explaining the science behind the munchies. Finally, the stranger takes a look at \" the booming world of $ 100,000 bongs. \" basically, one could argue that if you're going to spend a small fortune on a piece of art that won't get you high, why not spend it on art that will?",

In one sense, the case is moot because the teen in question already had an abortion. But the justices tossed a lower-court ruling that allowed the abortion to take place, thus preventing the ruling from being used as a precedent by future immigrant teens who find themselves in a similar situation, reports the washington post. A story at reuters agrees and sees the ruling as a \" legal victory \" for the trump administration. The ap, however, is a little more restrained, suggesting that the ruling is narrow and \" doesn't appear to disrupt ongoing litigation about the ability of immigrant teens in government custody to obtain abortions. \" the case involved a 17-year-old who crossed from mexico into the us and sought an abortion while in a federal detention facility. That request led to a legal fight, and an appeals court in washington eventually sided with the teen, ruling that immigrant women in custody have the same right to an abortion as us citizens. The teen had her abortion before the justice department was able to appeal the decision to the supreme court, explains upi. The feds went ahead with the case anyway, resulting in monday's ruling. The justices, however, rejected the government's suggestion that aclu lawyers who assisted the teen be sanctioned. The feds had accused the aclu legal team of misleading them about when the abortion would occur.",

They fed the starch-heavy water to mice and were surprised to find that the rodents ended up losing weight, as well as experiencing lowering liver mass and cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The apparent cause: the sweet potato peptide ( spp ) created by enzyme digestion of proteins in the wastewater, per a press release. The mice in the experiment were split into three groups, all given high-fat diets, but with only two of the groups also fed spp ( one group received a low concentration, the other a higher one ). After 28 days, mice who took in the spp enjoyed \" significantly lower body weight and liver mass, \" and their cholesterol and triglyceride numbers dropped. The study indicates that spp may set off hormones in mice that reduce hunger; it may also help control lipid metabolism. More research is needed to see if the findings also apply to humans, but lead scientist dr. Koji ishiguro calls it \" promising \" in the release, saying spp may offer \" new options for using this wastewater instead of discarding it. \" ( another type of potato is used for...

Per cnn, the findings out of georgetown university medical center suggest that the sort of radiation to which such travelers would be exposed has the potential to cause major intestinal issues, including cancer. It's called galactic cosmic radiation, or gcr, and consists of so-called heavy ions that we're protected from by the magnetosphere that surrounds earth. Deep in space, as well as on mars, there is no such protection and scientists say there is no way yet known to prevent exposure with shielding or medications. Per inverse, the study bombarded mice with doses of ionizing radiation that mimicked what's found in deep space. Researchers found that long exposure permanently altered the gastrointestinal tracts of the mice in a way that caused them to lose their ability to absorb nutrients. What's more, the mice also developed cancerous growths in their intestines, leading researchers to further worry about the effects of space radiation after previous findings suggested it poses a danger to the brain. \"we have documented the effects of deep space radiation on some vital organs, but we believe that similar damage responses may occur in many organs, \" wrote senior investigator kamal datta. \"it is important to understand these effects in advance so we can do everything we can to protect our future space travelers. \"",

Facebook's response is that everything is above-board because people opt-in to such sharing — for example, by being asked whether they want to share their contact information in the name of improving the friend-search function. \"the most important part of apps and services that help you make connections is to make it easy to find the people you want to connect with, \" says a spokesperson. \" so, the first time you sign in on your phone to a messaging or social app, it's a widely used practice to begin by uploading your phone contacts. \" still many users have been surprised by just how much data facebook has on them, reports ars technica. Facebook says the data is secure and not sold to third parties, but the company's blog post \" doesn't address why it would be necessary to retain not just the numbers of contacts from phone calls and sms messages, but the date, time, and length of those calls for years, \" writes sean gallagher. Forbes explains how to download your own facebook data, starting ( on a desktop ) with \" settings > general >'download a copy of your facebook data.

The poll released yesterday puts ford, who emerged from rehab at the end of june, in second place at 31 %, just three points behind front-runner john tory. Ford told reporters last week that he is \" sober as a judge \" and he ' ll be happy to take a drug test before the election — as long as the other candidates do, too. The poll, however, was taken before yet more embarrassing allegations surfaced. Newly released school board documents state that while coaching a high school football team, the mayor ordered players to roll in goose poop when he was unhappy with their efforts, notes the cbc. The school — which fired the mayor as coach last year — also accuses the mayor of using the team as a \" human shield \" to deflect reporters, backing out of a promise to pay $ 5,000 for new helmets, threatening to beat up a teacher, and showing up drunk and \" incoherent \" at practice. Yesterday was the final city council meeting before the election, and possibly ford's last as mayor, global news reports. Ford apologized for embarrassing the council and putting it through \" some challenges. \" before they broke for lunch, he rose to dance by himself as a reggae version of leonard cohen's \" hallelujah \" was played.",

The unsuspecting chief executives, along with citigroup consumer-banking chief stephen bird, responded to emails sent by a prankster posing as bank executives over the weekend, according to both goldman and citigroup, though none revealed any sensitive information. In fact, it seems the goal of the scheme was to embarrass the bankers rather than steal information, reports the wall street journal, noting one email sent to blankfein referred to a comment he'd made about president trump, not bank dealings. The bankers were just the latest high-profile victims of the prankster, known on twitter as @sinon_reborn. Last month, the same individual got bank of england gov. Mark carney to joke about his predecessor's drinking habits, reports the guardian. Around the same time, british bank barclays was forced to tighten its email security after ceo jes staley responded to a dubious email he believed was from his chairman, per the financial times. The prankster told the paper he included \" sent from iphone \" in emails so the absence of legal jargon wouldn't raise suspicions. \" keep it short … and ideally reference something that will ring true, \" he said. \" people accept a bit of bizarre once they feel they're in the saddle of the communication. \" ( watch out for this scam. )",

            "Computerworld - a $ 199 nexus 7 tablet from google would raise the stakes for amazon's kindle fire and barnes &amp; noble's nook tablet, which sell at a similar price and screen size. But since the 7-in. Touchscreen device is reportedly a quad-core tablet with other costly hardware, the nexus 7 might also in some ways compete with the popular apple ipad or perhaps the microsoft surface tablets unveiled last week. The ipad starts at $ 499; pricing for the surface has not yet been announced. To offer high-end features at a low cost with the nexus 7, google seems to be acknowledging that the android strategy of having third-party companies make tablets hasn't worked. And that means google must take aggressive pricing steps to make up the difference. \" if google wants to jump-start the android tablet market, which has been weak to date, then a low-priced, high-quality device could do that, \" said jack gold, an analyst at j. Gold associates. \" google certainly has an incentive to make the android tablet a competitive product in the market, and maybe driven more by wanting to capture a bigger share of the pie, than by supporting its oems ( original equipment makers ). \" google could be subsidizing the nexus 7 to the tune of hundreds of dollars per tablet, some analysts said"

But nikolas cruz says he doesn't want it. \" he would like that money donated to an organization that the victims ' families believe would be able to facilitate the healing in our community, \" cruz's public defender, melissa mcneill, said wednesday during a broward county circuit court hearing. The 19-year-old was there as judge elizabeth scherer tried to hash out whether he should continue to be represented by the public defender's office or actually has the means to retain a private attorney. The proceedings revealed that cruz may be able to collect $ 25,000 from his late mother's life insurance policy — and potentially much more. An annuity payment of $ 3,333 was deposited into lynda cruz's account in september; she died in november, and no payments have been deposited since. It's not clear if future payments are pending or whether they would go to nikolas cruz if so, reports the sun sentinel. If those payments continued regularly, they could total $ 800,000, reports abc news, but mcneill says \" it is my understanding there has been a delay in the administration of the estate, that it is ongoing. Mr. Cruz is … potentially a beneficiary of those funds. \" mcneill and her team, meanwhile, say they can't help cruz expedite his financial situation. \" we represent mr.

Brown, writing for fusion, describes girls night in.

Prospective members need recommendations from three women in the group. And once you're in, breaking the rules — say, by sharing something from the group with a nonmember — \" will result in expulsion … and public shaming. \" but girls night in is more than just gossip, brown writes, it's a place to get objective advice, moral support, and real-life help, such as when members raised $ 20,000 for another member whose house burned down. \" it's an interactive, communal diary, and a support group for womanhood. \" that can come at a price, though, brown writes. Members spend up to six hours a day on the group, which can create \" rifts with their best friends and romantic partners. \" when it comes to secret facebook groups ( they don't show up in search results ), girls night in isn't alone, writes alyson krueger at forbes. Take, for instance, lolo's logic, a group of women who talk sex. Members may be ostensibly \" june cleavers, \" the founder says. \" but in there they are little freaks. \" another group caters exclusively to \" right-leaning conservatives, \" who, the founder tells forbes, \"want to post whatever we want without fear of being called racist, bigot or stupid. \" some groups offer support for specific issues, such as drug abuse. No matter a group's theme, the common denominator is that they all have strict internal rules. And lolo's logic requires new members to post a topless photo.

As for weiner, what's he been up to lately? well, in an interview with the new york daily news, he answered the question of whether he's still sexting with anyone thusly: \" i mean, oh yeah, all that stuff is behind me. You can quibble about you know, beginnings, middles, and ends, but it was basically a year ago. \" all of this has, not surprisingly, hurt his new york city mayoral campaign: a new poll finds 53 % of new yorkers think he should drop out of the race, the guardian reports. But another poll finds that with women between ages 18 and 26, he enjoys a 78 % approval rating.",

        "summary": "People don't get flesh-eating bacteria very often, but it happens — and it's good to know it when you see it, livescience reports. A south carolina man nearly lost an arm this week after contracting the infection while swimming, per wspa, and usa today reports on nine cases in virginia this summer, including one fatality. One study found roughly four cases for every 100,000 americans every year. That said, here's what you need to know: people usually contract the ailment, known by doctors as necrotizing fasciitis, with a break in the skin that allows bacteria to enter. Think burns, scrapes, cuts, and surgical wounds, says the cdc. Watch out for \" pain that's out of proportion \" with the wound, says one doctor. Patients may also notice crackling sensations or noises caused by air beneath the tissue. At the outset, look for a red or swollen patch of skin surrounding the wound that expands faster than usual, and pain beyond the red patch. Such symptoms will begin within hours and should send you to a doctor right away. Other possible side-effects include chills, body aches, stomachache, nausea, diarrhea, and fever — in other words, flu-like symptoms. Later on, watch for possible black spots, oozing pus, blisters, or ulcers. If allowed to spread, the bacteria may cause confusion and even delirium. The pain might also subside as necrotizing fasciitis destroys the person's nerves, according to experts at the national institute of health. Anyone can get flesh-eating bacteria, but it's often people with other health issues that diminish their power to stave off infection, like liver disease, cancer, kidney disease, or diabetes. Wounds exposed to seawater are also risky. Anyone with necrotizing fasciitis should get aggressive treatment immediately. Mortality rates usually hover between 25 % and 35 %, but sometimes reach 50 %. One boy died from flesh-eating bacteria after falling off his bike.",

When hrcf was founded in 1980, it was primarily a fund for supporting pro-fairness congressional candidates. The rebranding in 1995 announced to the country that, in the words of then- executive director elizabeth birch, \" we're so much more than a fund. \" the logo was the final touch on a complete reorganization of hrc. In addition to the well-established lobbying and political action committee capabilities, new foundation programs — including the workplace project and family project — were added. All of hrc's research, communications, marketing and public relations functions were broadly expanded. Hrc began a long period of robust growth and became respected as one of the largest and most effective mainstream advocacy organizations in the country.

Most of those — 126,000 — are in massachusetts, though that's a big improvement from the more than 400,000 who initially lost power there. Here's a state-by-state look at the damage the storm caused: connecticut was perhaps hardest hit, with as much as 3 feet of snow and five weather-related deaths reported. President obama has declared a state of emergency, and the national guard has been brought in to help clear out new haven. Massachusetts was blasted as well, with boston getting up to 2 feet and other places getting as much as 30 inches. Two people are believed to have died of carbon monoxide poisoning while trapped in running, snowed-in cars. The state imposed its first travel ban since 1978. In new york, police had to use snowmobiles to reach ambulances, fire trucks, police vehicles, and passengers stranded on the long island expressway. Many long island residents remain trapped in their homes, and they're furious about the official response, the new york post reports. \" i haven't seen a single plow today, \" said one resident yesterday. \" there was a little bit of déjà vu with sandy, \" added another. Maine's portland was buried under a record 31.9 inches of snow; the state saw one fatal crash as snow reduced road visibility.

One other tidbit to know about the storm: as bad as it was, david epstein at the boston globe points out that it wasn't technically a \" blizzard, \" which requires frequent gusts of 35mph or more amidst low visibility. Of course, he adds, \" it doesn't matter really if we give it a name. … nature doesn't care what we humans call the events she dishes up. \"",

            "As you settle back into work, i am sure one of the more popular subjects around the water cooler will be last weekend's snowstorm. I had an interesting email exchange over the weekend with one of my fellow meteorologists concerning whether or not we should have called this storm a blizzard. This is what meteorologists do. We love to talk about the details of what the models are showing before a storm and then recount what actually happened when it's over. I am incredibly fortunate to be able to chat with some of the best forecasters in the business and what's more, this region is lucky, because we have some of those forecasters working both in front of and behind the scenes of both the public and private sector. It doesn't matter really if we gave it a name. The storm happened. It was windy, snowy, power went out, and some damage occurred along the coast.

The national weather service ( nws ) is responsible for putting out warnings and watches to the general public; private originations don't take on that role.

        "summary": "Justin bieber, apparently determined to keep spawning ridiculous headlines, leased a private jet that was searched friday — and now nbc news has the crazy story behind the incident. Bieber and his entourage, including his father, were flying from canada to new jersey for the super bowl — and smoking so much pot on the plane that pilots had to wear oxygen masks. As if that wasn't classy enough, a flight attendant also says bieber and his dad harassed her and were \" extremely [ verbally ] abusive, \" according to an official report. The captain asked bieber multiple times to stop smoking and stop harassing the flight attendant, to no avail. The flight attendant eventually fled to the cockpit and stayed there for much of the flight, sources say. Dea agents, customs agents, and police met the plane in new jersey, and bieber admitted to smoking pot and drinking alcohol, but though the plane still reeked of marijuana, no actual drugs were found and the group was allowed to leave. In other \" not great for bieber \" news, tmz reports that selena gomez secretly went to rehab for two weeks last month — and sources say she blames her problems ( which apparently include alcohol, marijuana, and ambien ) on spending so much time with bieber and his entourage. But gomez's rep tells radar the rehab stint was not for substance abuse; the huffington post reports that it was for \" emotional issues. \"",

After the second attempt, she handed the ambulance drivers a note that, she claimed, he had written. In it, her 70-year-old \" husband \" asked not to be resuscitated because he wanted to die with \" dignerty. \" police, noticing the misspelling, asked patrick to spell the word \" dignity, \" and she misspelled it as \" dignerty, \" thus providing the fateful clue. Patrick ended up being arrested and, on monday, sent to jail for 15 years after she pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder, the guardian reports. The couple's 21-year-old daughter also admitted to urging her mother to poison dear old dad ( who ultimately survived ), and was sentenced to three years in jail.

        "summary": "New islands are being born along the border of arizona and utah. That's an ominous thing, reports the guardian in a look at lake powell, the country's second-biggest reservoir. Due to dwindling snow falls in the rockies — which has spurred a crisis for the colorado river, which feeds the lake — today it stands at just 45 % capacity. That's brought new islands to the surface and turned established ones into \" towering sandstone pillars, \" chris mcgreal writes. As one aquatic biologist puts it, \" there's still a lot of water out there, but... People hit rock islands all the time. \" those people, some of the 3 million boaters and other tourists who come to lake powell each year, are hardly the only ones affected. That's because in addition to acting as a reservoir for four states, it sends additional water south to lake mead. That's america's largest reservoir — and one that factors into a new new yorker piece. David owen writes of being at the lake mead marina with two men who \" were concerned about what [ one of them ] called ' apocalyptic reporting, ' and they wanted to be sure i understood that the lake is still gigantic. That's certainly true, but if you know lake mead you can't help noticing that most of it is missing: the surface of the lake is about 130 feet lower than it was in 1998. \" mcgreal puts it in starker terms: the april levels at lake mead were the lowest \" since 1937 when it was still being filled. \" drought is to blame, with one expert telling him the \" 15-year drought that we're in is the worst drought in the last 100 years \" — and noting the area has, in the last 1,000 years, suffered a drought that lasted six decades. For much more, check out the guardian or the new yorker. ( meanwhile, the west's dry spell has brought about \" drought shaming. \" )",
