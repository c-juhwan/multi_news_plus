        "summary": "It is by now a well-worn piece of nutritional advice: skip breakfast and you ' ll end up gaining weight in the long run. In fact, you ' ll even find that nugget in the official us dietary guidelines. The only problem is that science doesn't support the assertion, writes peter whoriskey at wonkblog in the washington post. In fact, several studies conducted in the last few years have reached precisely the opposite conclusion: \"in overweight individuals, skipping breakfast daily for 4 weeks leads to a reduction in body weight, \" says one last year from columbia university. So how did the feds end up with their recommendation? whoriskey explains that they relied on results from \" observational \" studies, the less rigorous cousins of those with control groups and the like. In 2010, the us guidelines warned people that \"not eating breakfast has been associated with excess body weight, \" and health reporters around the country began writing stories to that effect. \" the trouble with all these pronouncements is, aside from raising doubts about the credibility of other dietary advice from the government, that they might actually cause people to eat breakfast when they otherwise wouldn't, potentially leading to weight gain, \" writes whoriskey. New guidelines will be rolled out later this year, and it's not clear whether the apparently bogus breakfast advice will remain. ( click for the full post. )",

        "summary": "Former librarian harriet klausner died on oct. 15 at age 63, leaving behind 31,014 book reviews on amazon and a host of critics. Klausner, who started posting reviews on the site in the 1990s and published her last three days before her death, described herself as a \" freaky kind of speed reader \" who \" read two books a day. \" she typically posted two to three reviews per day, though sometimes as many as 20, which raised the eyebrows of many. Some argued she was paid to post fake reviews since she never gave a book less than four stars and used words like \" fabulous, \" \" superb, \" and \" adrenaline pumping, \" per the washington post. But klausner denied any wrongdoing in a 2006 time interview — she was included in the mag's \" people of the year \" issue — and later explained to the new york times, \" if i can make it past the first 50 pages, that means i like it, and so i review it. \" others, including some who reviewed klausner's reviews, criticized her posts as uninformative and noted her many grammatical errors. Still, klausner had her supporters — among them, publishing houses. \" i ' m sure there are people who go online and think, ' i wonder what harriet has to say about this book, ' \" a rep for publishing house knopf told the wall street journal in 2005, adding he sent klausner every fiction title published there. She long held the title of the top reviewer on amazon, but in 2008 amazon began tweaking its \" top reviewer \" algorithm; in basing it on how helpful readers found reviews, rather than how many a user posted, klausner lost her perch. She now sits at 2,447 on the list — though she was handed a \" #1 hall of fame \" badge. ( this hilarious amazon review went viral. )",

With herman cain out of the race, gingrich now has the support of 33 % of likely gop voters, with ron paul and mitt romney tied for second place with 18 % each, the poll found. Some 11 % of those polled said they'd vote for rick perry, 8 % for ames straw poll winner michele bachmann, 7 % for rick santorum, and 2 % for jon huntsman. More than half of the likely caucus-goers say they might still change their mind before the jan. 3 vote, but pollsters expect gingrich to stay in the lead because he doesn't have the big negatives voters see in romney and paul. Some 45 % considered romney's health care reform in massachusetts a reason to oppose him, and 46 % cited paul's opposition to us military intervention overseas as a major negative. For gingrich, his views on immigration and his marital history were seen as a negative by just 15 % and 16 %, respectively.

        "summary": "A maryland mom who made a food run while vacationing in rehoboth beach, del., probably wishes she had just microwaved some pizza bagels. Rehoboth beach police lt. Jaime riddle says 55-year-old susan terrillion was arrested tuesday and charged with endangering the welfare of her 8-year-old and 9-year-old kids after she left them in their vacation rental while she went to pick up their dinner order at an eatery about 5 miles away, the news journal reports. She was gone for at least 45 minutes, which was enough time for the kids to go outside and lose control of their dogs, who then apparently dashed in front of a man's car, riddle says. That witness tells cops he helped the kids rein the animals in, then found out there was no adult around supervising them. Woman's day points out such a situation can often prove tricky from a legal standpoint: there's no federal law mandating a minimum age at which kids can be left alone, and state rules vary. In delaware's case, there's no \" appropriate age \" to use as a gauge, but the \" division of family services will accept for investigation any report of a child under the age of 12 being left alone. \" terrillion was arrested and released on $ 500 bail; the kids and dogs are said to be ok. In another case of child endangerment in rehoboth beach, per delaware state news: a canadian dad was arrested last week for allegedly letting his 13-year-old daughter lure a seagull into a hole with food, then hit it with a plastic shovel, killing it. ( pretty sure leaving a toddler alone to go play pokemon would warrant an investigation in any state. )",

        "summary": "Three missions, 20 years in space, 4.9 billion miles traveled, and nearly a half-million photographs taken. Those are just a few of the figures space.com throws out about the day of what it deems the \" bittersweet \" demise of the cassini space probe, which, on its last fumes of fuel, hurled itself into the depths of saturn friday morning in a mission of self-destruction. During its space run, cassini gathered valuable information about the planet, including data on dust particles, reports on saturn's plasma, and the ins and out of the planet's electromagnetics. It also dropped about 8,000 pounds over the long haul — mostly due to its dwindling fuel supply and dumping another probe onto the moon titan. More coverage on the probe's \" grand finale \": vox dives more into what cassini culled during its missions, noting the probe \" completely transformed our understanding \" of saturn. It also laments what it says \" will be our last look at the planet for at least a generation, \" as no saturn-bound missions are planned for the near future. Live science rounds up the 7 oddest finds of cassini, including one rarity: the spacecraft appears to have documented the birth of a small new saturn moon in 2014. Scientists named it peggy. Cassini may have done too good a job at data-gathering, with the washington post noting it was a \" victim of its own success. \" the probe had discovered that two of saturn's moons — titan and enceladus — may be conducive to life someday. That meant if cassini were left to drift in space after running out of fuel, it could have accidentally knocked into one of the moons, scattering the surfaces with earth microbes and possibly contaminating the moons. Meaning: cassini had to be sacrificed. Nasa features emotional interviews with the veteran leads behind each of cassini's systems, revealing their backstories and their feelings on saying goodbye to the probe. \" i've never watched a spacecraft die, \" one says. Another talks about how, to increase his chances of being hired for the project in the mid- ' 90s, he did what he thought would be a sure in: he bought a saturn, then a new car model from gm, as a conversation starter. An awe-inspiring interactive journey of cassini's \" final moments \" and \" triumphant end \" is featured on nasa's jet propulsion laboratory website, with facts about its mission and a timeline of its last 24 hours. The nasa and cassini saturn twitter feeds were also in overdrive friday morning, showing off pics from mission control, interviews with key players",

As for the alleged \" moron \" comment, he didn't issue a straightforward denial, notes politico. \" we don't deal with that kind of petty nonsense, \" was his reply to a question about it.

Now sajudin's attorney says that after talks with ami, which is owned by david pecker, the former doorman no longer needs to abide by the contract. So what does the november 2015 contract say? read it here, but a key phrase is: \" source shall provide ami with information regarding donald trump's illegitimate child... \" the contract adds that sajudin will only be paid if the story is published, but an amendment on the third page says he ' ll get $ 30,000 regardless.

        "summary": "Environmentalists have a new bone to pick with the trump administration, this time over bottled water. A six-year-old policy that encouraged national parks not to sell bottled water has been overturned by trump, reports the guardian. Per npr, the obama-era policy put in place to reduce waste and pollution wasn't exactly a ban, but a guideline adopted by 23 national parks including grand canyon national park and zion national park. In 2011, the national parks service began encouraging parks to enact the policy to act as an \"exemplar of sustainability. \" parks that stopped the sale of bottled water had to provide water filling stations and information to visitors on where to find them. Per the guardian, plastic bottles can make up the majority of a park's litter and trash – at the grand canyon alone, they comprised 20 % of waste before water sales ended. Critics say overturning this policy favors the bottled water industry, which has been lobbying against it. ( the international bottled water association has spent $ 80,000 arguing against the \" bottle ban \" since trump took office. ) but others say the original policy was flawed since it still allowed the sale of other bottled drinks, like soda — while eliminating sales of the healthiest drinking option. \"it should be up to our visitors to decide how best to keep themselves and their families hydrated during a visit to a national park, particularly during hot summer visitation periods, \" acting national park service director michael reynolds said in a press release; he added that parks would still encourage visitors to use the free water filling stations \"as appropriate. \"",

Andree was sentenced to a one-year prison sentence, which he has served, and 360 lashes, which his family was \" led to believe \" would be voided because of his age and health, his daughter tells the bbc.

He's not very well, \" she says. Andree remains behind bars awaiting the lashes. A government rep says \" we are actively seeking his release as soon as possible, \" noting cameron will write to the saudis directly. The rep adds embassy staff have been visiting andree regularly. Andree's son, however, says his father didn't receive any visits for six months and fears the government isn't doing enough to ensure his release. \" my mother has dementia and is deteriorating quite rapidly and my father really wants to come back and see her, \" he says.

            "Johnny depp, after a purported drinking relapse months back, blamed a missed media conference in tokyo on tuesday on a chupacabra attack. The 51-year-old, in japan to promote his new film mortdecai, told reporters wednesday, \"i was attacked yesterday morning by a very rarely seen or experienced animal called 'chupacabra. ' photos: 40 of the biggest secrets &amp; scandals of 2014! \"i fought with it for hours: they're very persistent, very mean. And i ' m pretty sure it came into my suitcase. I threw him off the 23rd floor, so we ' ll never see him again. Thank you for understanding. \" while the tongue-in-cheek explanation was amusing — depp purportedly was actually suffering from a cold — the no-show from the usually-reliable actor might have sparked some concerns: after a slurred, profanity-laced speech during the hollywood film awards in november, sources last month told the national enquirer that depp relapsed in battling his alcohol demons. And after depp missed the dec. 8 premiere of his movie into the woods, he was compelled by family, friends and associates to seek help. Sources said he tried a home rehab program to set things straight. Photos: hollywood bodyguards tell all — who steals, sexts, does drugs &amp; more star secrets revealed the quirky hollywood veteran, in 2013, told rolling stone that he never had \"the physical need for the drug alcohol, \" but more of a \"self-medication. \"i just decided that i pretty much got everything i could out of it. I investigated wine and spirits thoroughly, and they certainly investigated me as well, and we found out that we got along beautifully, but maybe too well. \"",

Khamenei did, however, add that he supported the effort, and his foreign minister sang a different tune. \" we have come here with the political will to reach a final agreement, \" mohammad javad zarif said after meeting with eu officials, according to the guardian. Us officials were also downplaying their chances. One senior official said it was \" probably as likely that we won't get an agreement as it is that we will, \" reuters reports. He also said that iran's recent oil export spike, and possible oil deal with russia, would have \" no impact in particular \" on talks or sanctions, the la times notes.

        "summary": "The ss central america's watery grave 160 miles off the south carolina coast is indeed a golden one. Odyssey marine exploration last month explored the wreck of the ship, which went down in 1857 laden with so much gold that its sinking triggered a national financial panic, and the new york times reports that the robot it sent to plumb the depths surfaced with quite the load: five gold bars clocking in at 66 pounds — or about $ 1.2 million. As for what remains, odyssey thinks there could be as much as $ 85 million in riches underwater. But in this case, what's come before is just as notable, and intriguing, as odyssey has an unexpected partner in its search: a court-appointed receiver. The wreck was first explored in 1988 by a team backed by investors and led by ohioan thomas thompson, who recovered what would today be worth $ 76 million in gold, about two tons all told. A wild legal battle followed after a range of claimants emerged from the woodwork, among them insurance companies who had paid out claims related to the gold more than 100 years prior. In 2000, thompson was finally able to sell the portion of the gold he was left with, for a reported $ 52 million — and gave none of the windfall to his 251 investors. In 2012, thompson skipped out on a court hearing; he and his female assistant vanished from their florida mansion ( leaving behind, among other things, a book on how to adopt a fresh identity ) before he could be arrested. In may, columbus lawyer ira kane was named receiver and instructed to recover what gold he could on the investors ' behalf; he selected odyssey to help him do so. Its odyssey explorer is now surveying the wreckage, and the columbus dispatch reports the entire operation could take as long as 150 days, with rotating crews working 24 hours a day during the recovery. ( odyssey managed to make a major discovery in 2013 involving silver. )",

And his meeting with a russian lawyer. \" my son is a high-quality person, and i applaud his transparency, \" the president said in a statement read by deputy press chief sarah huckabee sanders. It came after his son tweeted out his full email exchange with a supporter in russia that set up last year's meeting with natalia veselnitskaya. Illegal? the washington post assesses whether trump jr. Did anything illegal. One key question is whether he conspired, or attempted to conspire, with a foreign nation to sway the election, and the fact that he went ahead with the meeting after being told the information coming from the russian government could hurt hillary clinton. \" it's a shocking admission of criminal conspiracy, \" says a cornell prof. But what about clinton? as twitchy points out, trump supporters are wondering why this is such a huge scandal, but news that ukraine tried to help clinton is not. See this politico investigation from january. The statute: the one in question is here. One key part states, \" a foreign national shall not, directly or indirectly, make a contribution or a donation of money or other thing of value \" in a federal, state, or local election. In this case, \" thing of value \" could apply. Another part says, \"no person shall knowingly solicit, accept, or receive from a foreign national any contribution or donation, \" and here \" contribution \" could be broadly defined. Smoking gun? at the election law blog, rick hasen has been digging into the specifics of campaign finance law and concludes that it's \" hard to see how there is not a serious case here of solicitation \" from a foreign entity. It's \" pretty close to the smoking gun people were looking for. \" president's role: the white house has said trump did not participate in the meeting or even know about it. If evidence to the contrary surfaces that he knew of his campaign's dealings with the kremlin, \" the comparison to watergate wouldn't overstate the severity of the trump-russia scandal; it would understate it, \" writes yochi dreazen at vox. The t-word: sen. Tim kaine, clinton's running mate, said trump jr.'s action goes beyond something such as obstruction of justice and is \" moving into false statements, perjury, and even potentially treason, \" per cnn.

It had been left on a briefcase on top of a table, along with birkar's cellphone and wallet. The briefcase was later recovered, minus the medal. Organizers say security footage has been reviewed and they are working with authorities to get the 14-karat gold medal back, the ap reports. The organizing committee says it \" profoundly regrets \" the disappearance of the briefcase. The theft was a major embarrassment for organizers of the event, which is being held in latin america for the first time, cbs reports. Birkar was one of four men to win the award, which is awarded every four years to mathematicians under 40. The mathematician, who was born in a kurdish region of iran and moved to britain as a refugee 20 years ago, said his achievement was a win for the kurds and hopes \" this news will put a smile on the faces of those 40 million people. \" ( in 2014, a woman won the prize for the first time. )",

The dow was down about 100 points in the first minutes after wednesday's open. \" given the recent roller coaster ride in equities was sparked in good part by inflation fears accelerating rate hikes, the latest inflation data will be seen as increasingly important and telling, to date, \" the chief economist at stifel economics wrote to clients ahead of the report. The overall cpi rose 0.5 % in january, the most in four months, while core prices — which excludes the food and energy sectors because they're so volatile — rose 0.3 %.

So what's the point of an app that's \" essentially instagram redux \" when you've just bought instagram? well, developers were probably working on facebook camera before the social network planned to buy instagram, writes mike isaac. What's more, the instagram deal is still technically under ftc investigation. Perhaps zuck and co.

            "My friend john fugelsang likes to say that the democratic party is like an s&m submissive who forgot his safety word. After the lame performance of democrats in the immigration reform markup, i would say fugelsang is being generous. Republicans are incredibly skilled at holding no actual power but nonetheless making wildly effective threats. Democrats on the other hand display the unique and vexing ability to have every political advantage and still cave on their own goals, more often than not preemptively. I've said it before and i ' ll say it again: i would not be surprised if the modern democratic party's strategy is secretly being bankrolled by eli lilly as a ploy to sell prozac to liberals. In the latest example of this disconcerting trend, sen. Orrin hatch ( r-utah ) proposed an amendment to the senate immigration markup that would arguably harm american workers. In fact, it wasn't just democrats and labor unions that opposed this amendment; republican sen. Charles grassley also opposed the amendment. But democrats nonetheless backed the change in order to woo hatch's committee vote. Meanwhile, not only was hatch's committee vote not needed to approve the bill but hatch has explicitly said he may still not vote for the legislation unless other changes are made.

        "summary": "Think young people are knocking boots left and right? you're actually way off. In fact, millennials'sex lives are most similar to those about 75 years ago, a new study finds. In a survey of 26,000 adults from 1989 to 2014, people born in the 1980s and ' 90s reported being less sexually active than baby boomers and generation xers born in the 1960s and ' 70s, and with fewer sexual partners, reports the washington post. About 15 % of people 20 to 24 reported having no sexual partners since age 18, compared to 6 % of generation xers at that age. Why such a discrepancy? jean twenge of san diego state university tells cnn there could be a number of factors in play, from busy schedules to a preoccupation with technology, but the finding is \" part of a general theme of later maturation that's been pretty well-documented. \" recent cdc data, for example, shows 41 % of high school students said they'd had sex in 2015, down from 54 % in 1991. Twenge says there's now less pressure on young people to form relationships early and \" more ways to entertain yourself \" with technology, so sex may not be as important as it was to previous generations. Millennials — who live with their parents longer and get married later — are also more aware of safety concerns, which may hold them back in the bedroom. After reviewing data from a nationally representative survey, researchers concluded that millennials'reputation as the \" hookup generation \" is misleading. \" there are some teens and young adults who are using hookup apps and are very promiscuous, \" twenge tells new york. \" it's just they are the exception. \" ( more on millennials'sex lives here. )",

One thing they have determined, however: \" we are fairly certain we have over a million burials within this cemetery.

Dubbed fag el-gamous, the grounds are full of bodies that date to between the 1st and 7th centuries ad, live science reports. The remains don't belong to royalty, and most weren't actively mummified by people — but the dry surroundings led to what could \" loosely \" be called mummies, says muhlestein, who has blogged about the findings. Brigham young researchers have dug up more than 1,700 burials over the past three decades, they write in studia antiqua, noting that they're not the first researchers to investigate the site. Among recent findings are the remains of an 18-month-old from about 1,500 years ago. \" there was some evidence that they tried much of the full mummification process. The toes and toenails and brain and tongue were amazingly preserved, \" researchers say. As for where the child, or countless others, came from, researchers aren't sure. Interestingly, a database reveals that blond people appear to have been buried together, with red-headed ones elsewhere; this could be due to families being buried together, researchers note. They also found one body that was more than seven feet tall — particularly surprising given poor nutrition at the time. ( perhaps they should alert this giant hunter. )",

Elizabeth ramirez, kristie mayhugh, cassandra rivera, and anna vasquez were declared innocent after being wrongfully convicted of sexually assaulting two of ramirez's nieces, then aged 7 and 9, in 1997 in what the state's expert witness then described as a \" satanic-related \" ritual. The alleged victims told police in 1994 that the women, who are openly gay, assaulted them at ramirez's apartment but their testimony varied wildly, reports the san antonio current. Ramirez was later sentenced to 37.5 years in prison, while the others were sentenced to 15 years. Vasquez was paroled in 2012, while the others were granted bail a year later, after one of the two alleged victims recanted and the state's witness retracted her testimony. Earlier this year, a state district court judge overturned their convictions, which came at a time of anti-gay bias and \" national hysteria … over satanic sexual abuse, \" reports ksat. But the judges on wednesday found the woman, all in their 40s, \" have unquestionably established that they are innocent, \" and noted the father of ramirez's nieces \" has engaged in a pattern of threatening behavior towards the complainants and false allegations of sexual assault. \" \" we have so much more to be thankful for, \" rivera tells the guardian, which notes each woman is now eligible to receive up to $ 80,000 for every year spent in prison.",

The norridgewock man was taken into custody after he turned up at a deputy's house drunk, armed, and crying, according to the morning sentinel. Smith told police he had a fight with his ex-girlfriend and had stolen prescription narcotics from her, authorities said. Smith was charged with stealing drugs and his gun was confiscated. Police say he was carrying a.40-caliber glock but he won't face gun charges because maine is an open-carry state and his weapon was visible, the ap reports. He made headlines in march when tree-service workers he shouted at when shirtless mistook his tattoo for the real thing. When officers arrived and asked if he had any weapons, smith told them, \" yeah, i got this gun on me all the time. It's tattooed on. \"",

But drake laroche, the 14-year-old son and constant companion of first baseman adam laroche, was there just a little too much for his liking — \" he had a locker, \" williams notes — so he asked the elder laroche to cut back on father-son time on white sox premises. Instead, laroche abruptly announced tuesday he'd be retiring and leaving his $ 13 million salary behind, the ap reports. Laroche tweeted later that afternoon, \" thank u lord for the game of baseball and for giving me way more than i ever deserved! \" accompanied by a #familyfirst hashtag. But williams tells fox sports ' ken rosenthal that the team's policy on bringing kids to the clubhouse hasn't changed, that \" everyone loves \" drake, and that \" in no way do i want this to be about [ drake ]. \" instead, williams notes, he simply wanted laroche to \" dial it back. \" \" i don't think [ drake ] should be here 100 % of the time, \" he tells rosenthal, adding to the ap, \" even 50 % is probably too much, but there is a wide range between zero and 50 %. \" but some feel that drake, called the team's \" 26th man \" by his dad last year, has been more blessing than burden. \" drake would clean cleats... Help out in drills... He didn't say boo to anybody and was never a trouble in the clubhouse, \" white sox outfielder adam eaton tells fox. In a follow-up, rosenthal says some players see williams ' point ( e.g., players might not want a kid around if they've had a bad day or may feel compelled to censor themselves ), but he wonders if williams would have issued the mandate if laroche had had a better 2015 season. Meanwhile, player support for laroche continues, per sports illustrated, with brewers pitcher blaine boyer telling rosenthal, \" i honestly think this is between good and evil. I know which side adam lives on. \" ( a bullfighter took his baby to work. )",

The only downside to doing yoga with goats? the animals tend not to hold their poop until after class and will occasionally try to eat the yoga mats.

But a new study reduces that number to just four by combining \" angry \" with \" disgusted \" and \" surprised \" with \" afraid. \" those pairings share the same biological roots, the glasgow researchers suggest. Their conclusion is based on subjects'responses to computer animations of facial expressions, the atlantic reports. Participants were supposed to divide the animations into the six classic emotional categories. But the subjects saw \" angry \" and \" disgusted \" as the same when the emotion first appeared on a face; both included, for example, a wrinkled nose. Both \" surprised \" and \" afraid, \" meanwhile, featured raised eyebrows. The distinctions didn't become apparent to observers until some time had gone by. To the researchers, that indicated that the differences between the emotions were more social than biological, leaving four basic emotions: happy, sad, angry/disgusted, and afraid/surprised. \" over time, and as humans migrated across the globe, socioecological diversity probably further specialized once-common facial expressions, altering the number, variety and form of signals across cultures, \" the study's head says, per the bbc.",

Later in the signalling dynamics, facial expressions transmitted signals that distinguished all six \" classic \" facial expressions of emotion, they said. In comparison, the facial expression signals of happiness and sadness were clearly distinct across time.

        "summary": "The internet is aflutter over two rather bizarre photographs of what appear to be daisies taken near the fukushima nuclear disaster site in japan. We say they appear to be daisies because the flowers in nasushiobara city actually feature multiple stems and mutant centers. While many have claimed the plants are proof of radiation there — the level in the area of the daisies is slightly above normal but considered safe, reports the independent — experts are much more restrained. They seem to agree that, yes, radiation could have caused the deformities. But a random mutation, insects, disease, physical damage, global warming, or environmental toxins could just as easily be to blame. What the pictures show is fasciation — a deformity of the plant stems that can cause plants to appear fused or flattened. The phenomenon is certainly not exclusive to japan. A rep for britain's royal horticultural society notes it receives \" lots of examples of fasciation \" each year and the new york botanical garden says it sees plenty of weird stuff, too. Though fukushima diary is a popular source for photos of unusual plants found near the fukushima site, people share photos of their own mutant flowers worldwide, reports the christian science monitor, indicating there's no need to be totally spooked. A post on gardeningknowhow.com per the international business times notes it's impossible to correct fasciation on affected stems, but perennials \" may be perfectly normal next year, so there is no need to destroy the plant. \" ( speaking of flowers, some roses may soon have a different scent. )",

        "summary": "We're all familiar with that sluggish feeling after a bad night's sleep. Now researchers believe sleep disturbances spark changes in the brain that may lead to dementia, according to a new study. The key to this connection is low oxygen in the blood during sleep. The culprit? conditions that interrupt breathing — like sleep apnea or emphysema, cbs news reports. About 170 elderly japanese-american men were monitored during sleep as part of the study; after they died, brain autopsies showed that the quarter of them who showed very low oxygen levels during sleep were four times more likely to have signs of \" very small strokes … correlated with memory loss and thinking skill problems in aging, \" one expert tells wcvb. Lack of slow-wave sleep — the kind that helps your brain refresh and save new memories — may also cause atrophy in brain tissue. Both atrophy and the small strokes, called microinfarcts, are \" more common, and more severe, in people with dementia, than in people without memory problems, \" study leader dr. Rebecca gelber tells cbs. One alzheimer's expert cautions that the results merely show \" linkage, not cause-and-effect \" between sleep disturbances and dementia. More studies are needed, but gelber believes poor sleep \" may actually contribute to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia. \" ( scientists recently created alzheimer's in a dish. )",

Researchers with the va pacific islands healthcare system studied nearly 170 japanese-american men. They found that people who don't have as much oxygen in their blood during sleep, which occurs with sleep apnea and conditions such as emphysema, are more likely to have tiny abnormalities in brain tissue than people with higher levels of oxygen in the blood.

Reportedly, one-third of young adults believe that their sexuality falls somewhere between homosexual and heterosexual, and some under-30 celebs, when questioned about their sexuality, are now choosing to identify their sexual orientation in less exact terms. Below are a few who are out and proud about their fluid sexuality: lily-rose depp: when the 16-year-old model and daughter of johnny depp and vanessa paradis decided to pose for a photo for a lgbtq campaign called the self evident truths project, she made a statement about her sexuality without having to say a word. The project's creator wrote on instagram: \" i ' m so proud of my baby girl @lilyrose_depp. She decided she wanted to be in @selfevidentproject because she falls somewhere on the vast spectrum, and i couldn't be happier to welcome her to the family. \" miley cyrus: in an interview with paper magazine, the singer defined both her gender and sexuality as fluid: \" i am literally open to every single thing that is consenting and doesn't involve an animal and everyone is of age. Everything that's legal, i ' m down with. Yo, i ' m down with any adult — anyone over the age of 18 who is down to love me... I don't relate to being boy or girl, and i don't have to have my partner relate to boy or girl. \" kristen stewart: having dated both men and at least one woman, stewart addressed her sexuality for the first time in nylon magazine. \" google me, i ' m not hiding, \" she said when asked about her sexual preferences. \" i think in three or four years, there are going to be a whole lot more people who don't think it's necessary to figure out if you're gay or straight. It's like, just do your thing. \" cara delevingne: \" i haven't made a concrete decision about anything, \" the model and paper towns star said recently about her sexuality. Despite being in a relationship with singer st. Vincent, aka annie clark, delevingne told vogue over the summer that she was open to future relationships with men as well.

            "In 1993, donald trump's senior political adviser attended santa monica's franklin elementary, where he was \" off by himself all the time. \" i can still picture him sitting in my classroom. Do you remember that character in peanuts, the one called pig pen, with the dust cloud and crumbs flying all around him? that was stephen miller at 8. I was always trying to get him to clean up his desk — he always had stuff mashed up in there. He was a strange dude. I remember he would take a bottle of glue — we didn't have glue sticks in those days — and he would pour the glue on his arm, let it dry, peel it off and then eat it. I remember being concerned about him — not academically. He was ok with that, though i could never read his handwriting. But he had such strange personal habits. He was a loner and isolated and off by himself all the time. At the end of the year, i wrote all my concerns — and i had a lot of them — in his school record. When the school principal had a conference with stephen's parents, the parents were horrified. So the principal took some white-out and blanked out all my comments. I wish i could remember",

Russian foreign minister sergei lavrov today said that russia is consulting ban ki-moon and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons as it drafts the plan. France, for its part, intends to put that plan to the test: it will tonight present a draft resolution to the un security council so that the world can \" judge the credibility of the intentions that were expressed yesterday, \" per its foreign minister, the guardian and new york times report. ( as reuters puts it, france is \" turning a russian idea into a full-blown diplomatic proposal. \" ) among the \" nonnegotiable \" elements of france's resolution, per the guardian: all chemical weapons would have to promptly be turned over for destruction, and those behind the aug. 21 attack must be brought before the international criminal court. The resolution would notably invoke chapter 7 of the un charter, which makes it binding and militarily enforceable. The wall street journal notes, however, that russia previously refused to get on board with a similar, secret syria proposal because it was also made under chapter 7. Russia and china have also previously pushed back against icc involvement. Syria's main opposition group is not on board with russia's plan. The guardian reports that the syrian national coalition today called the proposal \" a political strategy that aims to stall for more time, which will allow the regime to cause more death and destruction. \" but the plan did gain another supporter today, reports reuters: china. Meanwhile, human rights watch today released a 22-page report that places the blame for the aug. 21 chemical attack at the regime's feet. It notes \" human rights watch and arms experts... Have not documented syrian opposition forces to be in the possession of the 140mm and 330mm rockets used in the attack or their associated launchers. \"",

        "summary": "Hillary clinton dodged one obstacle in her quest to the democratic nomination wednesday when joe biden opted not to run. Can she remove another thursday? she ' ll be testifying before a house panel investigating the benghazi attack, an investigation that incorporates her use of a private email server as secretary of state. The daylong hearing begins at 10am eastern. Some things to know: the basics: the panel is looking into whether the state department should have been able to prevent the 2012 attack on the us compound in libya that left ambassador chris stevens and three other americans dead. Democrats say it's a political witch hunt, a point reinforced when house majority leader kevin mccarthy suggested the panel was set up to hurt clinton in the polls. New emails: committee chair trey gowdy says the panel has reviewed thousands of previously unseen emails from stevens and plans to use them to grill clinton on why security wasn't bolstered in advance, reports abc news. But he says his approach may \" shock you with fairness, \" reports the ap. What both sides want: for republicans, it's to \" placate their base without appearing overly partisan, \" writes the new york times. They'd love to induce a clinton gaffe, but being \" overzealous \" will give critics ammunition and undermine that. For clinton, the \" biggest challenge is to appear composed and patient during many hours of questioning. \" in 2013 congressional testimony on the same issue, she got exasperated at points. No joke: one piece of advice for clinton in a politico roundup is to avoid joking about the email server. She's done so previously, with poor results. More serious: don't lie or even mislead, because a future indictment could result. At stake: an nbc/wall street journal poll finds that 44 % of americans are not satisfied with clinton's benghazi response, and 47 % say her email server is an important factor in their vote.",

Whether they'd bring their fixer upper skills to a gay couple is also unclear — buzzfeed tried to get an answer on the question from the couple's reps and couldn't. So kate arthur came at the questions from a different angle in an article published tuesday: by looking at the devout christians ' \" nondenominational, evangelical, mission-based megachurch, \" antioch community church, and its pastor, jimmy seibert. She writes that seibert, a self-described \" good friend \" of the gaineses, takes a \" severe, unmoving position \" on gay marriage and believes in conversion therapy. Reaction to the piece: writing for the week, peter weber calls it a \" lame hit-piece \" and suggests the overall question isn't one worth asking. If the gaineses \" aren't talking about gay marriage, who cares what they think? they host a home-rejuvenation-and-flipping tv show. \" at the washington times, kelly riddell takes issue with the side-door approach. \" essentially, ms. Aurthur hasn't done any reporting to know how the gaineses actually feel about the topic, she — and buzzfeed — just want to drum up a digital mob against the couple. \" the daily caller lets one buzzfeed commenter do the talking: \" this is the dumbest story i have ever heard. It's like a witch hunt for their beliefs, to try an stir the oil from a pot into the flames of the stove. \" cosmopolitan, however, suggests buzzfeed has raised a question worth answering: \" given the diversity of fixer upper's audience, this is a startling revelation that has left many wondering where chip and jo stand. \" at hotair, allahpundit sees an error of execution: \" it's odd that a story that's supposedly about discrimination, not belief, would focus up front on belief rather than discrimination. It's also odd that the bulk of the story maintains that focus. \" megyn kelly addressed the article on her fox news show wednesday night, saying, \" they haven't gone out there to the pulpit and said anything. They just attend a church that buzzfeed decided to investigate. \" an earlier profile of the gaineses was decidedly more flattering.",

Andrew cuomo was one of the victims. Cuomo says carey gabay, 43, recently promoted to first deputy counsel of the empire state development corporation, was shot in the head at around 3: 40am today in brooklyn, nbc new york reports. Gabay was rushed to the hospital, where's he's said to be in critical condition and \" fighting for his life, \" according to mayor bill de blasio. And he wasn't the only victim: wabc notes that during the j ' ouvert festival, a pre-parade celebration that starts before dawn, a 21-year-old was shot in the buttocks, another 21-year-old was grazed on his hand by a bullet, and a 39-year-old was shot two times in the torso. Meanwhile, a 24-year-old man died after being stabbed in the torso, the news station adds. Cuomo — who the ap notes hadn't been at the same public event as the mayor since july, underscoring a long-simmering feud between the two — called gabay, a lawyer schooled at harvard, a \" kindhearted man \" and an \" outstanding public servant, \" wpix reports. \" this was a beautiful man, a sweet man, a man who was giving back to his community, a gentleman, who was involved in nothing, just walking down the street with his brother, wife pregnant with his first child, \" cuomo tells wabc. \" we have to commit ourselves to justice in partnership with the police and in partnership with one another, that the crime, the violence on those streets stop, because enough young people have died.

Morell, who spent 33 years at the cia, also aims to dispel three myths about the agency — specifically that it's \" rogue, \" has any resource at its disposal, and \" that we can't get anything right, \" morell says. \" we get many things right but we also make mistakes. \" one such error related to saddam hussein. \" we said he has chemical weapons, he has a biological weapons production capability, and he's restarting his nuclear weapons program, \" morell tells cbs news. \" we were wrong on all three of those. \" morell also touches on the attack in benghazi, suggesting the state department should have increased security at the consulate just as the cia did in libya. As for seymour hersh's claim that the us lied about the killing of osama bin laden, it's \" absolutely not true, \" morell says. \" his source has no idea what he's talking about. \"",

No more than 10 babies in the us are thought to have it at any given time, and like purnell sabky, they're only given a few months to years to live, reports whdh in boston. \" the worst news you can get is that your child is dying and there's nothing you can about it, \" his mother says. \" it is a place of utter helplessness. \" determined to save him, or at the very least help future children who receive the grim diagnosis, the sabky family is trying to raise $ 750,000 to fund a gene therapy treatment that is in development. They've raised a third of that so far on gofundme. The funds will go to the wylder nation foundation, a non-profit a family started after their boy died of the disease in 2009. The foundation is working with researchers at uc san francisco's bankiewicz lab; they need to finish that development, complete safety studies, and get the green-light from the fda to begin a clinical trial. \" time is of the essence, \" say purnell's parents, and fox 25 explains why: the declines typically start between 15 and 18 months, and doctors say it's unlikely purnell will see his 3rd birthday.

He continued his funny note ( there was even a golden girls reference ) by documenting his disappointing diagnosis and acknowledging the airline might have \" 356 reasons you can't refund [ the change fee ] to me, \" but asking for it anyway — even sending along a bunch of photos of him and mia. His signature may have clinched the deal: \" with gratitude, alex hamberger, frequent flyer, brother, uncle, formerly sick person, currently healthy person, grateful flyer. \" finally, he sent his note via the old-fashioned postal service. His tactic worked, with an airline rep informing him the fee would be dropped and writing of his niece, \" she sure is a lucky little girl to have such a loving uncle al! \" hamberger tells wivb the reply \" just brightened my whole day, and even the days since then. \" ( another heartwarming airline story: when these babies cried, passengers clapped. )",

But he sent customer relations a letter that impressed them. \" she just makes the best faces, and she's really easygoing, \" said alex hamberger, who loves being an uncle to his niece mia, but he doesn't love that she lives all the way in kansas city. \" she was born last september, \" he said. \" and then i was back out there in november. And then she was home for christmas so i have seen her three times. \" the fourth time was supposed to be in march, when hamburger planned a weekend trip to see his sister, brother-in-law and niece, but a sudden illness grounded him. Hamberger's ticket was non-refundable, and cancelling meant he would owe american airlines $ 200. He decided to write them a letter to explain: \" dear most kind and benevolent american airlines customer service staff member, i write to you with the hopes that you may take mercy",
            "( cnn ) the next time an airline hits you with a fee, you can either go on an epic rant about \" big \" business and their \" evil \" ways. Or you can do what alex hamberger did. He took the honey over the vinegar approach and look where it got him. Back in march, a sudden illness forced hamberger of buffalo, new york, to cancel a flight to see his 9-month-old niece in kansas city. He had to rebook, and we all know what that means: a $ 200 change fee. Ouch. So hamberger reached out to american airlines ' customer service department to request the airline drop the change fee. He did it in the form of a letter. An actual snail-mailed letter. And what a letter it was! he used all of his considerable wit and charm to request the airline drop the change fee. Laying it on thick \" dear most kind and benevolent american airlines customer service staff member, i write to you with the hopes that you may take mercy on me and afford a little sympathy for this flyer who was taken quite ill and had to postpone his trip to see his beloved niece. \" he told them all about his postponed trip, his precious niece and how he hoped they'd cut him some slack. He signed"

        "summary": "Act of valor certainly has an attention-grabbing premise — it's a fictional war movie, but it stars real navy seals, was shot using live ammo, and says it is based on true events. But critics aren't exactly lining up to salute. Here's what they're saying: \" the film began as a recruitment video for the navy and more or less wound up that way, \" writes kyle smith of the new york post. \" i ' m not going to say act of valor oversimplifies manly bravado, but sylvester stallone just called to say there's more to war than square-jawed warriors shooting villains in the teeth. \" \" the villains come across as individuals rather more compellingly than do the film's ostensible heroes, \" writes nick pinkerton of the village voice. The seals don't get any individual characterization, and their dialogue \" has, one suspects, the same relation to the real thing as the network-television mic'd talk of football players does to an actual, unobserved huddle. \" roger ebert couldn't help comparing the movie to the documentary hell and back, which features real combat scenes, and focuses on a soldier actually wounded in afghanistan. \" if you asked sgt. Nathan harris what he thought about using live ammo in a hollywood movie … my best guess is, he would say they were damned fools. \" but wesley morris of the boston globe liked it. Sure the acting is wooden — \" when these men speak, you suddenly realize how uniquely good those ents were in lord of the rings \" — but the action is thrilling, and, thanks to the grace of the seals, \" there is beauty in this movie that you'd never experience in any film starring chuck norris or michael dudikoff. \"",

Lawyers say the detainees include two iraqi men detained at jfk friday night, the new york times reports. One of the men worked for the us as an interpreter and engineer in iraq for a decade after the 2003 invasion. Lawyers tell the times they were not allowed to meet with the men and when they asked a border agent who they could speak to, they were told: \" call the president. Call mr. Trump. \" in other coverage: lawyers for the two detained iraqis, hameed khalid darweesh and haider sameer abdulkaleq alshawi, are suing trump and the us government in what cnn reports is the first legal challenge to the executive order. Darweesh, the former us employee, had a special immigrant visa and alshawi had a visa to join his wife and son, who were granted refugee status because the wife worked for the us military. The lawyers say it is unlawful for the us to detain people with valid visas. The arab anti-discrimination committee says people from the countries named in the trump order — iraq, iran, syria, sudan, somalia, yemen, and libya — are being held in the us or banned from boarding us-bound flights even if they have green cards, the new york daily news reports. The group says it has warned people from those countries already in the us to avoid leaving the country. The order trump signed friday bans entry for 90 days, but it could be extended indefinitely. The ap reports that officials in cairo say seven migrants, six from iraq and one from yemen, were prevented from boarding a us-bound egyptair plane after officials at cairo airport called the us for guidance. The move has caused anger in the affected countries, with some saying they have already scrapped plans to study or work in the us. \" this is a stupid, terrible decision which will hurt the american people more than us or anybody else, because it shows that this president can't manage people, politics, or global relationships, \" najeed haidari, a yemeni-american security manager for an oil company, tells reuters.

Seyed emami, a canadian-iranian, died in a high-security prison on feb. 9, weeks after he was arrested on accusations of spying for the us and israel. After receiving a call to present himself to the prosecutor's office in chalous on jan. 24, seyed emami was grabbed by 15 people who emerged from cars, his sons tell the new york times. He was handcuffed, hooded, driven around, and eventually landed at evin prison. A prosecutor would later show his sons a video of seyed emami entering a prison bathroom with a shirt around his neck, seven hours before his lifeless body was brought out. Prosecutors say it was a suicide by hanging, but ramin and mehran seyed emami can't believe their father killed himself. The truth may never be known because, in what amnesty international says \" smacks of a deliberately orchestrated attempt to cover up any evidence of torture and possible murder, \" authorities did not allow an independent autopsy. In an op-ed published thursday, the washington post editorial board argues seyed emami was just the latest victim of \" iran's repressive regime, \" which shows only \" xenophobia \" and \" cruelty \" in using \" dual citizens as pawns in international diplomacy. \" though spying charges against seyed emami referenced cameras set up \" to monitor iran's missile activities, \" his sons say they were part of his work with the persian wildlife heritage foundation and only recorded endangered animals in the wild.",

Instead of being taken to see her husband she was closeted in a room with a prosecutor and four intelligence agents from the islamic revolutionary guards corps and interrogated for several hours. Cooperate, they told her, or you, too, will end up in prison. In recounting the experience for their two sons, ramin and mehran, ms. Seyed emami said that the agents had asked about the couple's friends and parties they had attended. They showed her family pictures and asked her to describe who and what were in them.

        "summary": "Tech pundits aren't exactly swooning over apple's worldwide developer's conference presentation, in which it showed off an ios revamp, a new streaming music service, and a cylindrical computer. Here's what the nay people are saying: apple really needed a new ios, and \" thanks to these upgrades, the iphone will be pretty again, \" writes rolfe winkler at the wall street journal. But the core apps are essentially the same, and \" plenty of these just aren't very popular with users. \" in the end, a \" hot new paint job \" can only do so much. The iphone \" still needs some more horsepower under the hood. \" farhad manjoo at slate agrees. \" the company's heart is in design — when it hits a bump in the road, its instinct is to rejigger how its products look. \" he also points out that \" in some places, ios 7's design is a straight rip-off \" of windows phone. The motto might as well be \" designed by apple in california, with an assist from redmond. \" apple's stock fell after the announcement, forbes points out, and analysts say that's because design only gets you so far. Its \" online services are lagging more and more behind the state of the art by google, \" one developer says. \" they have shown apple's style, \" a researcher agrees, \" but they didn't necessarily stoke any new consumer behavior. \" \" i couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing, \" writes kevin roose at new york. Apple's new products seem perfectly fine, but \" none of them had the x factor that defined early apple products. \" these days, it's the galaxy s4 garnering the \" oohs \" and \" ahs \" the iphone used to. Of course, apple's new mac pro was oozing x factor with its sleek cylindrical design, and had plenty under the hood, as the most powerful computer apple's ever built. But \" it also costs thousands of dollars and is way more machine than most people will ever need, \" cnn points out.",

            "Photo by stephen lam/reuters near the beginning and the end of the keynote address at apple's developer conference on monday, the company showed off a couple of slick corporate branding videos. This isn't unusual for apple; every new product comes with a fancy marketing campaign. But to me, these videos seemed to telegraph a new, larger vision for the firm, as ambitious an effort at rebranding as any we've seen from the company since the old think different campaign. Set to text, the videos read a bit like dime store pop-business philosophy, but on screen, they're a powerful distillation of how apple thinks about itself.",
            "Photo: seongjoon cho/bloomberg via getty images back in 2007, when the first iphone was launched, it was common for complete strangers to stop iphone owners to gawk openly at the shiny new device, ask how they liked it, and sheepishly ask if they could try it out for a minute or two. So great was the iphone's sex appeal that it became a sort of conversation piece for early adopters, one that could make its owners cool by proxy. A similar type of interaction has been happening to me recently, but it isn't an apple product drawing attention. It's the galaxy s4 – samsung's much-hyped new smartphone",

According to the oregonian, the trees were planted in the mid-1800s, but developer everett custom homes wanted to remove them to build two houses. Neighbors reached an agreement with the developer to buy the land for $ 900,000 in june but failed to actually pay the money. The president of the neighborhood association tells the oregonian they didn't realize how hard raising nearly $ 1 million would be. Fortunately for the trees and lorax dave, a new deal — for an undisclosed sum — was reached yesterday. Katu reports neighbors once again agreed to buy the property — reportedly for much less than $ 900,000 this time — with the help of an anonymous second developer, who plans on keeping the trees, and what koin calls a \" substantial gift \" from south park co-creator matt stone. But the trees aren't out of the woods yet. Just as the deal was being finalized, a crew from everett custom homes showed up to cut the trees down, forcing neighbors to form a human blockade, katu reports. \" this is absolutely ridiculous that he would send these people here, \" neighbor arthur bradford, who works with stone, tells katu. \" this is unbelievable. We should not have men with chainsaws on our street around our homes. \" needless to say, lorax dave plans to stay in his perch until he's certain the trees are safe.",

One of the largest data leaks in facebook history let cambridge analytica, which had ties to trump strategist steve bannon, to develop techniques that formed the basis of its work on the campaign, the new york times and the guardian reported. Facebook said it suspended cambridge analytica over allegations it kept the improperly obtained user data after telling facebook it had been deleted. In a blog post, facebook explained that cambridge analytica had years ago received user data from a facebook app that purported to be a psychological research tool, though the firm was not authorized. Roughly 270,000 people downloaded and shared details with the app. Cambridge analytica certified in 2015 that it had destroyed the information, although facebook received reports \" several days ago \" that not all data was deleted. Facebook has suspended cambridge analytica's parent company, strategic communication laboratories; university of cambridge psychology professor aleksandr kogan, who created the app; and christopher wylie of eunoia technologies, who also allegedly received user data. Wylie is a former cambridge analytics employee who is a primary source for the times report. Trump's campaign denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the rnc for its data. Cambridge analytica is backed by billionaire donor robert mercer. The firm had wooed bannon with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of american voters and influence behavior, but lacked data to make its products work.
