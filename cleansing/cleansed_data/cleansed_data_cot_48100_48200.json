Feng — who claimed to have forgotten the passcode — pleaded guilty late last year, but the government and apple kept the legal fight over the phone going in the hope of setting a legal precedent for such cases, the guardian reports. The government had been about to appeal a recent ruling in favor of apple which said officials didn't have the authority to force companies to allow investigators into devices, the wall street journal reports, which makes the sudden end of the case a big setback for the government. Sources tell the journal that the person who provided the passcode was feng himself, who appears to have had a sudden flash of memory after recently discovering that his phone was still involved in a legal battle. ( fbi director james comey hinted it cost more than $ 1 million to pay hackers to crack a phone in a similar but unrelated case. )",

Those statistics, per the post's internal database of us fatal police shootings, show that 43 people with \" ultra-real-looking pellet guns, toy weapons, and non-functioning replicas \" were killed in 2016, as well as 43 people in 2015. Of those killed, 54 were white, while 81 were male. But just because the guns were fake, they weren't obviously so — the post points out that \" almost all \" of the recovered weapons in these 86 fatal shootings were \" highly realistic \" likenesses of the real deal, including bb and pellet guns, airsoft guns, and replicas. Sig sauer, for example, manufactures airguns that it promotes as \" carbon copies \" of its actual weapons. Because these phony firearms are a ) \" red hot \" now, per an industry consultant, and b ) \" virtually impossible \" to identify as being fake from far away, cops are in a dilemma where they're left with \" little choice but to assume the guns are lethal, \" the post notes. \" people don't really understand the dynamics of a police-involved situation, \" says kim jacobs, the police chief in columbus, ohio. \" they all have families, they want to go home at the end of their shift. \" there have been efforts to push laws that would make airguns look noticeably different from real ones, but those efforts have been stymied by gun rights groups. And two studies done 25 years ago showed that adding markers to fake weapons didn't substantially cut down on police shootings. One sheriff in alachua county, fla., wants to circumvent aesthetic changes altogether. \" part of the solution is to ban the sale of toy or replica guns, \" he says.",

The celebrity chef posted on twitter what the telegraph calls an \" unorthodox \" recipe for paella — a hodgepodge of rice, meats, veggies, and spices — incurring the wrath of spanish culinary experts across the internet. \" good spanish food doesn't get much better than paella. My version combines chicken thighs &amp; chorizo, \" oliver cheerfully tweeted tuesday. The naked chef's crime: including the chorizo, which is apparently frowned upon by many who don't consider the sausage-leaning version an authentic spanish dish. Reaction was spicier than the meat he threw into his inadvertently insulting concoction. \" thanks for destroying our most famous recipe, \" one user commented, while another noted, \" your paella is an abomination, \" per the telegraph. The bbc points readers to wikipaella, a site dedicated to real-deal paella, whose founder once listed the dish's \" golden rules \" for the independent, including using only spanish rice and \" no garlic. No peas. No potatoes. No stock. No chorizo. \" ( the rules also indicate that, for \" ultra-authenticity, \" paella should only be cooked by men, specifically spanish ones from valencia, so take those rules for what they're worth. ) marketwatch notes that oliver is something of a \" serial offender \": a couple of years back, his jollof rice recipe irritated west africans.

Police say jonghyun ( full name kim jong-hyun ), said to be in his late 20s, was found unconscious in a seoul residence hotel and taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, per the ap. While police haven't confirmed the death of the lead singer of shinee was a suicide, yonhap reports that investigators discovered incinerated coal briquettes in a frying pan in kim's room, suggesting he died from inhaling the carbon monoxide that's emitted when coal is burned. Police ended up there after his sister called 911, worried kim might be killing himself based on texts he'd sent her, per afp. \" this is my last farewell, \" one of the texts reportedly said. Another: \" please let me go. Tell me i did well. \" per a separate yonhap report, a close friend of kim's posted on instagram what she says was his suicide note; she says kim's family was ok with her doing so. \" i ' m broken from the inside, \" kim wrote. \" the depression that has slowly nibbled me away has now devoured me, and i couldn't overcome it. … no one alive is more tormented nor weaker than myself. \" he also noted being famous likely wasn't for him, asking himself: \" why did i choose that? \" the ap reports south korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. The guardian adds his note underscores the pressures of being a young entertainer in south korea.

Indeed, there is no \" safe \" level of air pollution as pollutants cause an increased risk of premature death even when detected at a fraction of the legal limit set by the epa, a new study finds. \" we are now providing bullet-proof evidence that we are breathing harmful air. Our air is contaminated, \" francesca dominici, the lead author of the harvard study published in the new england journal of medicine, tells npr. Researchers used a computer model to assess levels of ozone and fine particulate matter by us zip code, then determined what effect the pollutants had on one's risk of premature death using data on 97 % of americans 65 or older, reports the los angeles times. The risk of death climbed when seniors were exposed to as little as 5 micrograms of fine particulate matter per cubic meter of air, though the legal limit is 12 micrograms. Researchers found lowering the limit to 11 micrograms would save 12,000 lives per year. Similarly, the risk of death grew with exposure to ozone at 30 parts per billion; the epa limit is 70 parts per billion. Researchers found cutting the legal limit to 69 parts per billion would save 1,900 lives annually. However, an editorial accompanying the study notes the trump administration is favoring policies that would give us \" dirtier air \" which is \" going to kill a lot of people. \" trump ally scott segal counters that environmental rules can also \" adversely affect public health \" by increasing health care costs, per npr.

        "summary": "Al franken knows how ridiculous the cost of college textbooks can be, and he want to do something about it. That's why the minnesota senator and illinois sen. Dick durbin on thursday introduced the affordable college textbook act, a bill that would give grants to higher-ed institutions so they can create textbooks accessible for free online — which would, in turn, ostensibly push the costs of textbooks down, the chicago maroon reports. \" the traditional publishing market is not providing students the materials they need at a cost they can afford, \" said durbin, who introduced a similar bill in 2013 that never went anywhere. These \" open textbooks \" would be available for professors, students, and pretty much anyone who wanted to use and distribute them, city pages reports. Franken noted the cost of textbooks has risen 82 % ( three times the inflation rate, per us pirg ) over the past 10 years and that a student coughs up an average $ 1,200 for books and supplies each year, northern public radio notes. And, per a 2014 us pirg report, 65 % of students say they've opted not to buy a text because it was too much money; nearly half the respondents said textbook cost impacted how many and which classes they registered for. \" students would say, ' i have to pay $ 150 for this paperback book, ' and the professor of the course — who was in the room — said, ' $ 150?!'she didn't [ even ] know, \" franken says, per northern public radio. \" isn't that amazing? \" a higher-ed advocate for us pirg tells city pages that \" for students and families that are already struggling to afford a college education, it's not just an expensive textbook anymore. It's a serious barrier. \" durbin expects opposition from at least one group, per the maroon: textbook manufacturers.

It turns out that cosby's defense team wanted to introduce her sexual orientation as evidence in the trial, but the judge denied that motion this week, nbc news reports. More on that and the developments in the trial: according to the prosecution's filing, cosby's defense team says that constand did not tell cosby she was gay during their 2004 interactions, which amounts to \" conceal[ ment ] and deceit. \" the da's office's response to that? \" defendant puts a new twist on an old argument: that because ms. Constand did not reveal this most personal detail about her life she must have been asking for defendant to drug and sexually assault her. \" tmz's take on the issue of constand's sexual orientation? cosby should be grateful the judge denied his team's motion. \" if she wasn't into guys, the prosecution could have destroyed cosby's argument she consented to sexual contact with the comedian, \" and if the issue was brought into the trial as evidence, it \" could have nailed cosby's coffin shut. \" thursday's proceedings involved the jury hearing that cosby admitted to police during a deposition years ago that he fondled constand after giving her benadryl, though he insisted she consented to the behavior and showed no ill effects from the medication. Jezebel has an extensive rundown of a police investigator \" sassing \" the defense attorney who cross-examined him thursday. There's more coming from the deposition on friday, day five of the trial, usa today and the new york times report in previews of the day's proceedings. Notably, jurors will hear that cosby admitted to obtaining quaaludes to give to women with whom he wanted to have sex. Already friday, jurors have heard that in the deposition, cosby feared he looked like a \" dirty old man with a young girl \" when constand's mother called him in 2005, per the washington post. He said he apologized, \" but my apology was, my god, i ' m in trouble with these people because this is an old man and their young daughter, \" per the philadelphia inquirer. Nbc notes that cosby's wife has yet to make an appearance in the courtroom, but it has a list of supporters who have shown up. Forbes takes a look at the millions cosby has lost",

Prosecutors say expert diver gabe watson killed his wife in the waters off australia during their 2003 honeymoon to collect $ 130,000 in life insurance. He turned off her air long enough to kill her, turned it back on, then let her sink to the ocean floor, they charge. Watson says his wife panicked underwater and knocked off his face mask. By the time he adjusted it, she had sunk too far away for him to help her, according to his attorney. Watson then swam to the surface for help and later \" calmly \" explained what happened to authorities, an australian police officer testified yesterday, reports abc news. But he became agitated when police refused to return his mini dive computer, which helps track a diver's activity underwater, the officer added. Other divers, one of whom apparently took the underwater photo of watson, challenged him after the dive that he didn't help his wife, prosecutors allege. Watson has already served 18 months in an australian prison for negligent manslaughter for failing to save his wife of 11 days.

French education ministry officials say that school administrators first brought in the boy's father, and summoned police only after the father became angry, reports the wall street journal. The family's lawyer disputes that and calls the entire affair \" insanity. \" the lawyer says the boy, identified only as ahmed, acknowledged to police that he said, \" i am with the terrorists. \" but when police asked him what \" terrorism, \" meant, the boy said he didn't know. A group called the collective against islamophobia in france released a statement after the incident criticizing \"the collective hysteria that has engulfed france since early january, \" reports france24. No charges have been filed in the case, but that could change: a spokesperson for the education ministry says social services are investigating allegations the boy was abused at home, and police are investigating the father's complaint that the school's director slapped him during an argument.

        "summary": "Centuries ago, bulls, rams, and other animals led into an ancient cave for religious ceremonies died of seemingly mystical causes, while the priests accompanying them suffered no such fate. Scientists say they've now figured out the secret behind this \" gate to hell \" in the ancient city of hierapolis, per bloomberg, and it has nothing to do with gods of the underworld. Instead: carbon dioxide. A study in archaeological and anthropological sciences reveals that the cave located in modern turkey, which was rediscovered in 2013, sits over a fissure that releases the gas. Volcanologist hardy pfanz and his team used a portable gas analyzer to figure out the phenomenon. So how did the priests survive? because carbon dioxide is heavier than oxygen, it sinks — meaning animals closer to the ground succumbed, while the humans were ok. Or mostly ok: ancient accounts depict the priests sometimes emerging and struggling for breath as spectators watched from a nearby site. Iflscience explains that the old-time priests likely understood that concentrations were diluted during the daytime by sunlight and wind — and so they held sacrifices before dawn for a quicker kill — and were also smart enough to climb up on stones around the doomed animals to show off their supposed powers. \" at this height they could stand for 20 [ to ] 40 minutes without being endangered, \" pfanz says. Without the stones, he adds, \" nobody could enter the gate to hell without getting asphyxiated. \" ( an incredibly old human fossil was recently found in a cave in israel. )",

        "summary": "Taylor swift's new video for \" wildest dreams \" was shot partially in africa, so of course, it features giraffes, zebras... And lots of white people. As far as james kassaga arinaitwe and viviane rutabingwa, writing in npr, can tell, there's not a single black actor in the video. ( etonline points out that there are, but they're only background players and appear very briefly. ) the storyline involves swift and her male love interest, decked out in colonial-era garb, filming an old-timey movie in africa, and the whole thing is very romantic and glamorous. The problem? as arinaitwe and rutabingwa point out, \" colonialism was neither romantic nor beautiful. It was exploitative and brutal. The legacy of colonialism still lives quite loudly to this day. \" \" to those of us from the continent who had parents or grandparents who lived through colonialism ( and it can be argued in some cases are still living through it ), this nostalgia that privileged white people have for colonial africa is awkwardly confusing to say the least and offensive to say the most, \" they continue. They're not the only ones upset: \" the truth: the african continent endured unspeakable brutality under european colonial rule, \" writes zak cheney-rice at mic. \" millions of people were enslaved, tortured or killed under violent systems of european law enforcement, forced labor and segregationist policies, fueled by a ravenous export economy that plundered much of the continent's natural resources and left many african nations indebted to — and often financially dependent on — their white former enslavers. \" \" instead of the cultural appropriation that has become almost status quo in today's pop music, swift has opted for the bolder option of actually just embodying the political exploitation of a region and its people, \" writes lauren duca at the huffington post. \" it's brave, really. \" \" it's the exact african safari paradise that we were promised! \" writes madeleine davies at jezebel. \" lions! elephants! shirtless scott eastwood! and, bizarrely, nary a black person in sight. \" \" even the most casual observer would have noticed that — for a clip that's set in africa — it's about as white as a sunday morning farmer's market, \" writes nico lang at the daily dot.

But clark's story shares one devastating similarity to the fictional character: it ends in tragedy -- as she, too, said goodbye to the man she loved that night. Clark also left behind an 18-carat gold locket, which was discovered inside a small carry-on bag that was recently recovered from the titanic's wreck site. Poker chips, several pieces of jewelry and a gold-plated toiletry item were also found inside the bag that belonged to clark and her husband, walter. Walter, his father and his uncle, prominent u.s.

        "summary": "The antics of north korea's kim jong un are officially no longer funny in hawaii. State officials are rolling out a civil-preparedness campaign in case of a nuclear attack by north korea, reports hawaii news now. Part of that means public-service announcements about what people should do if pyongyang launches a missile. As the honolulu star-advertiser explains, the warnings wouldn't be those of the \" duck and cover \" variety from the cold war era, but would be similar to those of an active-shooter situation. They would advise people to \"get inside, stay inside, and stay tuned. \" more details are to be unveiled on friday about the campaign, which comes in the wake of north korea's test this month of an intercontinental ballistic missile. If the north launched one, hawaii residents would have, at most, about 15 minutes of warning. A second part of the campaign will be once-monthly tests of a new emergency siren; the tests are slated to begin as soon as november and will take place on the first workday of each month. \" we do not want to cause any undue stress for the public; however, we have a responsibility to plan for all hazards, \" says the director of hawaii's emergency management agency, which says the current threat assessment is low. A post earlier this month at the respected 38north.org said north korea \" has an unreliable missile that can reach alaska or hawaii with a single nuclear warhead, \" but is probably a year or two away from posing a threat to the west coast. One group not thrilled with the state's new initiative: tourism officials. A spokeswoman for the hawaii tourism agency says the chances of an attack are \" very remote \" and thus the new campaign sounds alarmist.",

            "After the frenzy of technical speculation over the successful launch of north korea's hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ), the dust seems to be clearing and the emerging reality is that the north has an unreliable missile that can reach alaska or hawaii with a single nuclear warhead, and would be lucky to hit even a city-sized target. However, with a year or two of additional testing and development, it will likely become a missile that can reliably deliver a single nuclear warhead to targets along the us west coast, possibly with enough accuracy to destroy soft military targets like naval bases. In perhaps five years, north korea may be able to incorporate a modest suite of decoys and penetration aids to challenge us missile defenses. Let's hope us missile defenses are up to that challenge.

Garibay says they scooted off the balcony and called workers. \" they were totally shocked and asked us to step away and then proceeded to start calling staff and techs and i don't know who else, \" says garibay. \" when we pulled our phones to start recording and take pictures they asked us to leave right away. \" tower officials say it's no big deal and in fact the glass was doing what it was supposed to do: \" occasionally this happens, but that's because we designed it this way, \" says a rep. \" whatever happened last night is a result of the protective coating doing what it's designed to. \" he says that it was that top coating that cracked, and not anything structural; regardless, the chicago sun-times notes that one of the ledges was indeed roped off this morning, its floor covered with carpet.

The lowline, as it has come to be called, is the brainchild of james ramsey, owner of the lower east side design firm raad studio, and dan barasch, who had been exploring installing underground art in the new york city subway system. What started off as a super-idealistic vision of the world's first subterranean park replete with filtered natural sunlight has now been given a green light by the new york city economic development corporation. The park's open date is projected to be in 2021. The project technically goes back to 1908, when a 1-acre williamsburg bridge trolley terminal opened on delancey street to help transport residents of the lower east side to brooklyn. By 1948 it was closed to the public and never used again, even though it's right next to the city's j/m/a subway line. At the heart of the redesign is the use of very forward-thinking solar tech that uses a \" remote skylight, \" where sunlight is collected and passed through a glass shield, reflected and gathered to a focal point, and directed down through fiber-optic cables to a reflective surface that redistributes the collected light — just enough to enable photosynthesis. To be built in what mother nature network describes as an already \" tree-deprived lower east side, \" the project enjoyed two successful kickstarter campaigns with thousands of supporters worldwide. \" we're channeling sunlight the way they did in ancient egyptian tombs, but in a supermodern way, \" ramsey told new york in 2011. In fact, when the sun is shining, the entire park will be solar powered, not just the greenery. ( check out the \" sidescraper \" proposal for new york's central park. )",

The company is also debuting an eight-week transition period that lets new birth moms and primary caregivers ease back into work using flextime. Bloomberg notes the new benefits count for births or adoptions after oct. 1. When asked by the new york times if these new perks are a response to the company's scathing back-and-forth with the paper, a rep simply pointed to a line in its announcement that said: \" we review our benefit programs annually and began considering our leave policies in early 2015. \" even more surprising, however, is the company's second bit of news: the opening tuesday of a brick-and-mortar bookstore in seattle's university village mall, the seattle times reports. Although local booksellers are meeting this news \" with some befuddlement, \" notes the new york times — why would a successful online retailer take on high overhead? — amazon books is different from traditional bookstores in a couple of important ways. First, patrons will see each book displayed facing outward, with a customer review and rating below it, per the seattle times. \" we felt sorry for the books that were spine out, \" vp of amazon books jennifer cast tells the paper.

Reporting in the journal plos one, researchers write that they had 98 healthy participants aged 20 to 50 abstain from any food or fluid intake overnight before eating toast and jelly. At this point the subjects rated their thirst as \" strong \" and were allotted five minutes to drink 13.5 fluid ounces of water that was either room temperature or cold and either flat or bubbly. Five minutes later, they could drink as much plain water as they wished. Turns out those who drank the cold seltzer water felt the most quenched and required less water later, confirming that the combo provides the greatest \" sensation of relief, \" the study's lead author says. So even though the bubbles aren't actually more hydrating, as mashable reports, the fizz is more convincing, a trick that could prove useful in situations where thirst must be quenched with limited supply.

On dec. 9, she was supposed to work at the livermore premium outlets — she traveled across the country for her job — but police say she may never have made it inside. She was found in the parking lot in broad daylight with traumatic injuries to the back of her head and her face, and a week later, she died of those injuries. Baffled police are asking the public for any information. There were no witnesses and there is no surveillance footage; it's not clear whether hillerman was assaulted or fell, but there were no signs of robbery. One of the only clues: a four-door sedan was spotted leaving the area at the time of the attack. The independent mystery shoppers coalition ( hillerman was a member and would often speak at conferences ) issued a safety warning following the incident, and some of her friends and colleagues think foul play was involved. \" we don't believe she just fell. She wasn't that type of person. She was just too on top of things, \" says the president. A gofundme account aims to help hillerman's husband with the cost of returning her remains to arizona.

Cnn reports that the girl, who is a minor, had said her pregnancy was making her suicidal. But instead of being granted permission to terminate her unwanted pregnancy, she was told that an abortion was \" not the solution for all the child's problems at this stage, \" and the mental health act was invoked — sending her to a mental health facility against her will. A few days later she was cleared by another psychiatrist and released after a court determined she didn't have an actual mental health disorder, per jezebel. Ireland has the strictest anti-abortion laws in europe. The 8th amendment, passed in 1983, declares the life of a fetus equal to the life of a mother, and prohibits abortion in all cases — including rape, incest, and the mother's health — unless, under the 2014 protection of life during pregnancy act, the mother's life is in immediate danger. In this case, the mental health act seemed to be used as \" a tool to force a child into continuing an unwanted pregnancy because of...

Resident erika murray, 31, will appear in court today on charges related to the condition of the house, but her connection to the children found living in the home hasn't been revealed. A rep for the department of children and families says four children, ages 13, 10, 3, and 6 months, were taken from the blackstone home after a call from a neighbor, who was told by one of the children that the baby wouldn't stop crying; the 6-month-old was found covered in feces, the ap reports. Authorities now \" have to ascertain who was living in the house, \" early says, noting investigators will be working at the home in hazmat suits for several days, searching for more remains. A neighbor says she believes a woman and her boyfriend lived at the home with two children, who sometimes played outside. \" in seven years i've never even seen her pregnant, \" another neighbor adds. \" i never even heard a baby cry. \"",

Thanks in part to game of thrones being set there, five or six times the number of local residents ( only 1,500 people live within the old city ) storm the gates every day in the summer. And that's not counting the thousands of tourists already staying in hotels and rentals; nearly all the city's stone houses are now devoted entirely to housing tourists. France24 reports that access to the old city may soon be restricted. \" when i first got here, i'd stand back if i saw that people were taking photographs of each other, \" says the editor of the dubrovnik times. \" now there are so many people that i know if i did that, i'd never get anywhere here. \" a local official chimes in that \" you can't fit a liter-and-a-half into a liter pot. \" in barcelona, per the local, the situation has become so dire that more locals cite tourism as a problem than unemployment and working conditions. The deputy mayor says it's not \" tourist phobia, \" but rather that, with some 30 million visitors spending at least one night in barcelona last year, there's a \" concrete malaise caused by overcrowding. \" even in a more out-of-the-way destination like iceland, tourists far outweigh the tiny local population.

The mandrills cover their eyes — much like in the \" see no evil \" gesture — when they desire solitude, and their fellow monkeys respect the signal, the telegraph reports. Researchers believe that a member of the group invented the sign and other monkeys picked it up in a never-before-witnessed example of monkeys creating sign language within their own community. The researcher who observed the phenomenon says he has been observing mandrills for years and never seen the gesture used anywhere else. Further research is likely to turn up more monkey gestures invented for cultural reasons, suggesting that \" the capacity to communicate with the hands in a meaningful way may have existed a long time before humans came on the scene, \" he tells scientific american.",

            "The colchester zoo in england is home to a community of mandrills, the largest of the monkeys. One of these mandrills, a female named milly, began covering her eyes with her hand when she was three. A dozen years later milly and her zoo mates continue to perform this gesture, which appears to mean \"do not disturb. \" the signal is the first gesture with cultural roots reported in monkeys. Culture accounts for behavioral differences that are geo­graphic, rather than genetic or environmental. Gestures — nonvocal, communicative actions — are often cultural in humans and sometimes in apes, notes mark e. Laidre, an evolutionary biologist now at the university of california, berkeley. Laidre observed the colchester mandrills for a total of 100 hours during the summers of 2007 and 2008. As re­ported in plos one in february, he found that mandrills performing the eye-covering gesture were approached and touched by other mandrills significantly less than when they were not using the gesture. \"animals who didn't want to be bothered used it, \" laidre says. Laidre and other researchers studying mandrills have not seen the eye-covering gesture in other populations, indicating it is a local phenomenon. Laidre also ruled out alternative explanations for the gesture's appearance. Milly does not have any medical issues with her eyes that might have prompted her to cover them, nor is the gesture more com­-mon on sunny days. It is also unlikely that human activity influenced the mandrills because monkeys — in contrast to apes, dolphins and dogs — do not mimic human behavior, laidre says. All this evidence suggests that the eye-covering gesture arose naturally and that it conveys information within the mandrill community. Having brought attention to the colchester mandrills ' gestural abilities, laidre expects researchers will now find other monkeys using cultural gestures. If gesturing is per­formed more broadly among primates than previously thought, laidre says, \"the capacity to communicate with the hands in a meaningful way may have existed a long time before humans came on the scene. \" this article was originally published with the title a signal for solitude.",

Naples, florida luxury real estate broker cliff donenfeld, 51, started writing the memoir last fall after exposing the relationship to the new york post's page six. Donenfeld initially decided to reveal his long-term affair with older-woman turney, 56, when she declined to give him a reference for a job in fashion.

He alleged she planned to leave her husband for him after he \"opened a door [ for her sexually ], \" then became \"instrumental in every aspect of her life \" during a two-year affair, which ended in 2010. After the scandal broke last fall, donenfeld began writing a book. But sources tell page six that turney has tried to block the embarrassing tome that could tell much more than just victoria's secrets. \"after the article, cliff noticed black suvs outside his house, \" said a source. \"he was then contacted by a victoria's secret private eye who wanted to meet with him and their lawyer. \" a friend added, \"they've been trying to shut cliff down and convince him not to include her in his book.

President obama has signed a secret order, approved earlier this year, allowing the cia and other american agencies to support rebels seeking to oust bashar al-assad, sources tell reuters. It's not clear how much clandestine support the agencies are offering, but they have apparently stopped short of providing the rebels with lethal weapons. Obama signed a similar order during the libyan conflict allowing covert support for rebels battling moammar gadhafi's regime. The state department has authorized $ 25 million for \" nonlethal \" support for the rebels and another $ 64 million in humanitarian aid. Foreign policy experts told a senate panel yesterday that the time has come for the us to start arming the rebels, cnn reports. \" at this point, given the direction of the conflict, i think that what we need to do is assess which groups could we and should we arm at what point, and make that decision, \" an expert from the washington institute for near east policy testified. \" i think that we're actually at that decision, given where the conflict is going. \"",

For a long time, the identity of the pair remained a mystery. It certainly looks passionate and romantic enough, with many speculating that they were a couple – a sailor and a nurse, celebrating and sharing their joy. This year, however, historians have finally confirmed that the woman is greta zimmer friedman, a dental nurse at the time, and george mendonsa, a sailor. Have a look at some articles about it. Do you get the feeling that something is not quite right? huffington post daily mail cbs news a few facts have come to light. Far from being a kiss between a loving couple, we learn that george and greta were perfect strangers. We learn that george was drunk, and that greta had no idea of his presence, until she was in his arms, with his lips on hers. The articles even give us greta's own words: \"it wasn't my choice to be kissed. The guy just came over and grabbed! \" \"i did not see him approaching, and before i knew it",

The articles even give us greta's own words: \"it wasn't my choice to be kissed. The guy just came over and grabbed! \" \"i did not see him approaching, and before i knew it",

This higher price tag will be reflected both at the grocery store and in us restaurants that are finding creative ways to serve the trendy fruit. We break down why you ' ll be forking over a pretty penny for that tasty avocado toast: us consumption of avocados has sky-rocketed. Mexico provides 82 % of the avocados consumed in the united states. Since 2000, shipments have increased from 24 million pounds to a whopping 1.76 billion pounds in 2015. This astronomical rise has raised ethical questions around the crop's environmental and social impact. Worldwide demand is up, too. The avocado trend is going global, with european countries as well as china asking for more of the fruit. Shortages in new zealand even sparked avocado thefts, reports the bbc, while mexican exports to china are especially booming, growing at a rate of 250 % per year. Avocado growers had a bad year. Avocado crops tend to vary, yielding more growth one year, less growth the next. A smaller crop is expected this season in mexico as well as california, where a 44 % decrease has been predicted. And a growers strike in mexico last year did not help matters. ( here's why you might not want to eat an avocado when you're stressed. )",

But when it uncovered a 1964 supreme court decision that found royalties could cease once a patent expired, marvel in 2010 halted payments. It's a ruling that's perhaps garnering more headlines than usual, thanks to the number of comic-book jokes elena kagan incorporated into the opinion she wrote for the court.

        "summary": "A community in suburban pittsburgh is grappling with the loss of a 12-year-old boy who committed suicide, his family says, because he was bullied. Evan ziemniak of north fayette, pa., hanged himself on march 23 and was declared dead at a nearby hospital, the new york daily news reports. Hundreds attended a prayer walk in his honor three days later, and teachers and police officers went to his funeral, but the spotlight has fallen on apparent bullying at west allegheny middle school. The suicide \" was his response to stop the pain, \" evan's grandmother, debbie long, tells the pittsburgh post-gazette. Long says evan was shoved and stabbed with pencils on the school bus, and others in his family say bullying continued throughout the day. They told the school about it several times, they say, to no effect. School officials admit they need a better anti-bullying policy, but an optional \" kindness workshop \" for eighth-graders in january triggered a backlash when it left some students in tears, wtae reported at the time. The workshop had students cover their faces with multicolored masks and answer personal questions by standing in a circle; some questions involved sexual orientation and family problems. \" the damage they've done to our kids, \" said an angry parent. \" all they did was give the bullies more ammunition. \" now evan — who loved animals, minecraft, and collecting old coins and antiques — is forcing his community to face a hard issue. The implications \" are far-reaching, \" says evan's father, matt. He and his wife \" are prepared to do what is necessary to make sure other parents do not have to face the worst tragedy a parent could ever face. \" ( the family of a bullied teen sued his town when he committed suicide. )",

The inmate, john colwell, has been in prison since 1991 and is serving life without the possibility of parole. He had cataract removal surgery for his left eye in 2001 but developed a cataract in his right eye later that year and has been blind in that eye since 2002. He said the loss of perception has caused him some problems: he's run his hand through a sewing machine twice while working in the prison mattress factory, run into a concrete block and split open his forehead, and bumped into some other inmates, twice getting into fights. Several prison doctors have recommended cataract surgery, but the prison has refused, saying colwell had 20/20 vision in his left eye so the treatment wasn't essential.

Though tourism represents 14 % of the spanish city's economy, a tourism plan presented by mayor ada colau this week lays out measures meant to dissuade tourists from rubbing elbows with barcelona's 1.6 million residents, reports fast company. The proposals include blocking licenses for new vacation rentals and taxing those that already exist at the highest property tax rate. The city also has banned hotel construction in the city center and is seeking permission to regulate room rentals at hostels, b&bs, and other accommodations. There are even plans to increase parking fees for tourist buses. Why are such measures necessary, according to city officials? for one, local businesses like dry cleaners and hardware stores are suffering as those catering to tourists are taking over. Jobs in these establishments are seasonal — a major issue given spain's 43 % unemployment rate for young people. Property prices and rental rates are increasing, to boot. \" the number of tourist flats in the city is staggering … and has pushed long-term rental prices to stratospheric levels, \" one expert tells the telegraph. All of this has spawned \" anti-tourism groups, \" per npr — and they aren't just on the fringe.

Go the f**k to sleep is a bedtime book for parents who live in the real world, where a few snoozing kitties and cutesy rhymes don't always send a toddler sailing blissfully off to dreamland.

Loehmann, who'd been with the cleveland police department for less than eight months when tamir was shot, was allowed to resign from his previous department after six months when supervisors determined he had \" an inability to emotionally function. \" loehmann had an emotional breakdown at the gun range and had also failed a test to join another department years earlier.

Neither officer was charged in connection with tamir's death. Constance hollinger, a 911 operator, was suspended for eight days without pay for relaying incomplete information to police. She mentioned a \" guy with a gun \" at a recreation center without the added details that it was \" probably a child \" and the gun was \" probably fake. \" loehmann shot tamir within three seconds of arriving at the scene.

The 54-year-old, who for years was one of bollywood's top actresses, died late saturday while in dubai for a wedding. Her brother-in-law sanjay kapoor had told an indian newspaper that she died of a cardiac arrest. In a tweet, the dubai police said that her death was \" due to drowning in her hotel apartment's bathtub following loss of consciousness, \" the ap reports. They added that the case had been handed to the public prosecutor's office, \" which will carry out regular legal procedures. \" two dubai police officials added, though, that she was under the influence of alcohol. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters. Sridevi, who was at her peak in the 1980s and ' 90s, was seen as the first female superstar in india's male-dominated film industry. She was known for her impeccable comic timing as well as her dancing skills — a serious asset in country where song-and-dance melodramas are a movie staple. Sridevi began acting as a child in regional cinema in india's south and made her debut in hindi-language bollywood films in the late ' 70s. She stopped acting for several years after her marriage to film producer boney kapoor but made a well-received comeback in 2012 with english vinglish. Her last performance was the 2017 film mom, where she played a woman seeking vengeance after her stepdaughter is raped. She is survived by her husband and two daughters.",

Gold's mother, the singer marni nixon. Advertisement continue reading the main",

His versatility also made him a highly regarded session player for such folk-rock musicians as james taylor loudon wainwright iii and j.d. Souther as well as the producer of recordings by stephen bishop, nicolette larson and others. \" andrew was so enormously talented it almost seemed effortless, \" ronstadt told the times on saturday. \" he was a real cornerstone of those early records. \" he met ronstadt as a high school student in the 1960s when her country-rock band the stone poneys performed at oakwood school in north hollywood. \" he came up to talk, \" ronstadt said. \" he was so bubbly and so smart and we were so impressed with what a good musician he was. \" after the stone poneys disbanded after their hit \" different drum \" in 1967, founding member kenny edwards teamed with gold and singer-songwriters wendy waldman and karla bonoff to create the folk-rock band bryndle.in an email to the times, gold's former high school classmate waldman"

        "summary": "It's looking more and more likely that us farmers will be getting back into the hemp-growing business. The latest hopeful sign for advocates came when the house passed an amendment that would make it legal for universities to grow hemp for research purposes — an important step if farmers ever hope to make it a successful agricultural crop, reports the wonkblog at the washington post. The bad news is that the amendment was part of the larger farm bill, which unexpectedly failed. But sponsor jared polis of colorado says he's so encouraged by the 225-200 vote that he will tack the hemp amendment onto some kind of agricultural bill in the near future, or even make it a standalone measure. What he and other advocates — including mitch mcconnell, from farm state kentucky — are talking about is industrial hemp, which has low levels of thc, the active ingredient in marijuana. It can be used in the manufacture of a wide variety of projects, but the dea remains worried about its use as a drug. In fact, the huffington post obtained the talking points that the dea circulated to members of congress as it tried to kill the farm bill amendment. They seemed to fall on deaf ears.",

That measure never found its way into the senate version of the bill. The house may vote on polis ' amendment as soon as tuesday evening. The huffington post has obtained a copy of talking points the dea is circulating among members of congress to press them to oppose the amendment -- raising the seemingly incongruous specter of the government using its resources to lobby itself. The talking points, paradoxically, represent a step forward in the debate. In the senate, hemp advocates were left only to counter vague \" law enforcement concerns \" that senators told huffpost were a factor in their willingness to support reform. With the dea laying out those specific concerns, hemp backers will attempt to rebut them point by point.

            "Washington — a former navy reservist killed at least 12 people on monday in a mass shooting at a secure military facility that led the authorities to lock down part of the nation's capital — even after the gunman was killed — in a hunt for two other armed men spotted by video cameras, officials said.

But while obama was chatting up and taking in a baseball game with brother raul castro, the 89-year-old former revolutionary was penning what the ap calls a \" long, bristling letter. \" \" we don't need the empire to give us any presents, \" fidel writes in the 1,500-word missive monday in el granma, the newspaper of cuba's communist party, per politico. In his \" el hermano obama \" ( \" brother obama \" ) essay, castro launches into a cuban history primer, including spanish colonialism, then addresses its interactions with the us, such as the doomed 1961 bay of pigs invasion, us trade embargo against cuba, and obama's relative youth — all in what the ap calls reminiscent of the lengthy, \" all-encompassing \" speeches castro used to deliver. Going over obama's speech with a fine-toothed comb, castro rails against his rival's supposed insults and rolls his eyes at obama's statement that \" it is time, now, for us to leave the past behind. \" \" i imagine that any one of us ran the risk of having a heart attack on hearing these words from the president of the united states, \" castro writes. Moving onto the bay of pigs, he notes, \" nothing can justify this premeditated attack that cost our country hundreds of killed and wounded. \" and as for obama speaking at all about cuba and its people, castro offers this dig: \" native populations do not exist at all in the minds of obama. Nor does he say that racial discrimination was swept away by the revolution; that retirement and salary of all cubans were enacted by this before mr. Barack obama was 10 years old. \" he gives a final piece of advice to obama: \" my modest suggestion is to reflect and do not try now to develop theories about cuban politics. \"",
