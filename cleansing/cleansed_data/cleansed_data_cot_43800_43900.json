Two 20-something men in line for beers at a festival in southern russia, got in a heated dispute about 18th-century philosopher immanuel kant. The feud \" deteriorated into a fistfight, \" police said today, and one of the men eventually shot the other in the head with an air gun — multiple times, the ap notes. The victim survived; the attacker could be in prison for a decade, ria novosti adds. Police arrested a 36-year-old woman after she allegedly stabbed another woman at a birthday party; the 21-year-old victim was apparently dancing with the attacker's boyfriend, ria novosti reports. The alleged attacker \" took a knife, approached the dancing woman, and stabbed her twice, \" investigators say. The victim died in the hospital. A guilty verdict could mean 15 years in prison for the suspect. A man has been convicted of killing his mother, brother, and father in a cemetery. They were reportedly living in the graveyard after he evicted them, and when his mother accused him of the eviction, he hit her. His brother stepped in, and the man ended up stabbing both of them — and killing his father, who'd seen the attack. The suspect has been sentenced to life in prison, ria novosti reports.",

Per business insider, rick, who plays the mad-scientist title character, revealed his innermost motivations, and they involved a plum sauce the fast-food chain hasn't offered in nearly 20 years. \" i want that ' mulan ' mcnugget sauce.... That's my series arc, morty, \" he tells his grandson. \" if it takes nine seasons, i want that mcnugget szechuan sauce. \" what the deranged patriarch referred to is a condiment mcdonald's offered as part of a co-branding effort with disney in 1998 to push its movie mulan. The special sauce is now making an appearance on ebay — though the listings mostly appear to be rick and morty-inspired jokes — and the show's writers even put out a plea on twitter, asking mcdonald's: \" you wanna get in on this? call me. \" the restaurant account's reply: \" mcnugga lubba dub dub \" ( a twist on one of rick's catchphrase ); a top mickey d's chef also said, \" i ' ll see what i can do. \" business insider notes a live-action version of mulan is due out in late 2018, so...

            "By joe rauch charlotte, north carolina ( reuters ) - anonymous, a hacker group sympathetic to wikileaks, released on monday emails that it obtained from someone who said he is a former bank of america corp employee. In the emails dating from november 2010, people that appear to be employees of a balboa insurance, a bank of america insurance unit, discuss removing documents from loan files for a group of insured properties. Neither the emails nor correspondence released by anonymous indicate the reason behind the electronic record keeping discussion. A representative of anonymous told reuters on sunday the documents relate to the issue of whether bank of america has improperly foreclosed on homes. The representative added that he had not seen the documents, but he has been briefed on their contents. Consumer groups have accused major u.s. Lenders of foreclosing on many homes without having proper documentation in place. A bofa spokesman said on sunday the documents were clerical and administrative documents stolen by a former balboa insurance employee, and were not related to foreclosures. \" we are confident that his extravagant assertions are untrue, \" the spokesman said.",

In a chilling videotaped interrogation, corporal jeremy morlock recounts being ordered to kill civilians during heroin-, opium-, and hash-fueled raids. At one point, sergeant calvin gibbs tossed a grenade at an unarmed civilian and ordered: \" wax this guy, \" morlock recalled. \" gibbs had pure hatred for all afghans and constantly referred to them as savages, \" he added in a statement. Another witness said that \" if gibbs knew that i was sitting in front of this camera right now, there's no doubt in my mind that he'd f***king take me out, \" reports cnn. The family of another of the five soldiers charged with murder, specialist adam winfield, said he told his parents to report gibbs because winfield feared he'd be killed if he did, reports abc news.

Schmidt controls the vehicle through head movements registered by four infrared cameras mounted on the dash. He accelerates by breathing into a tube and brakes by inhaling.

Shortly after becoming the first person in the nation to receive a restricted driver's license for a semi-autonomous vehicle, the paralyzed former indycar driver blew into a tube that allowed him to speed off in a modified 2016 corvette z06. \"my dream since i was 5 years old was to be an indy race car driver, \" said schmidt, a henderson resident who made 27 career starts until he crashed during a test run in january 2000 at the walt disney world speedway in orlando, florida. The accident severely injured his spinal cord, and he was diagnosed as a quadriplegic. \"it wasn't my wife's dream, it wasn't my family's dream, but what that dream has put them through these last 17 years hasn't been great, \" schmidt said. \"to work as hard as we've worked, and have them stick by me and to do this today is enough. \" lt.

Mark hutchison presented schmidt with the special driver's license in front of about 100 spectators gathered for a ceremony and demonstration held in the shadow of the las vegas motor speedway, where schmidt logged his first victory as an indy racing league driver in 1999. Schmidt was giddy as a teenager, likening the experience to receiving his first driver's license at the age of 16. Arrow electronics, a fortune 500 company in colorado, began developing the technology in 2014 that now allows schmidt to drive. Schmidt has demonstrated the vehicle at several high-profile events, hitting a top speed of 152 mph at the indianapolis motor speedway in may. A headset worn by schmidt will largely control the vehicle, a semi-autonomous motorcar known as sam. Blowing into a tube attached to the headset allows schmidt to accelerate; inhaling allows him to brake. Four infrared cameras mounted on the corvette's dashboard follow schmidt's head movements, allowing him to steer. \"when you think a car like this is only helping one person, you quickly find out it helps many and it even helps our country, \" said mike long, president and ceo of arrow electronics. \"together, we've rapidly taken the sam car from 'might-be-possible'to fully practical, \" long said. \"innovation provides freedom, and that's what sam just got and that's what the state of nevada is helping us give him. \" over the"

Shortly after becoming the first person in the nation to receive a restricted driver's license for a semi-autonomous vehicle, the paralyzed former indycar driver blew into a tube that allowed him to speed off in a modified 2016 corvette z06. \"my dream since i was 5 years old was to be an indy race car driver, \" said schmidt, a henderson resident who made 27 career starts until he crashed during a test run in january 2000 at the walt disney world speedway in orlando, florida. The accident severely injured his spinal cord, and he was diagnosed as a quadriplegic. \"it wasn't my wife's dream, it wasn't my family's dream, but what that dream has put them through these last 17 years hasn't been great, \" schmidt said. \"to work as hard as we've worked, and have them stick by me and to do this today is enough. \" lt. Gov. Mark hutchison presented schmidt with the special driver's license in front of about 100 spectators gathered for a ceremony and demonstration held in the shadow of the las vegas motor speedway, where schmidt logged his first victory as an indy racing league driver in 1999. Schmidt was giddy as a teenager, likening the experience to receiving his first driver's license at the age of 16. Arrow electronics, a fortune 500 company in colorado, began developing the technology in 2014 that now allows schmidt to drive. Schmidt has demonstrated the vehicle at several high-profile events, hitting a top speed of 152 mph at the indianapolis motor speedway in may. A headset worn by schmidt will largely control the vehicle, a semi-autonomous motorcar known as sam. Blowing into a tube attached to the headset allows schmidt to accelerate; inhaling allows him to brake. Four infrared cameras mounted on the corvette's dashboard follow schmidt's head movements, allowing him to steer. \"when you think a car like this is only helping one person, you quickly find out it helps many and it even helps our country, \" said mike long, president and ceo of arrow electronics. \"together, we've rapidly taken the sam car from 'might-be-possible'to fully practical, \" long said. \"innovation provides freedom, and that's what sam just got and that's what the state of nevada is helping us give him. \" over the"

Uber's ride-hailing service has added two additional safety features for customers in india after once again coming under fire due to a sexual assault allegation against one of its drivers. Following the charges, uber and all other web-based taxi services were banned in several cities in india, including the capital, delhi. Despite frequent claims that is a technology company, not a transportation service, uber applied for a taxi license and is back in business. The additional safety features add two levels of security that riders can choose to use. One is the \"send status \" feature which allows drivers to send a message providing the driver's photo, vehicle details, and gps tracking location to up to five pre-selected emergency contacts. Recipients will then be able to track the location of the car without incurring any additional sms charges. This is essentially an extension of the \"send my eta ( estimated time of arrival ) \" feature that was added last year. The second safety precaution is the sos button.

        "summary": "President trump visits west virginia tuesday, and it's a safe bet he ' ll be trumpeting the proposal his administration just unveiled to ease up on coal plants. The affordable clean energy rule would roll back an obama-era plan on emissions deemed too heavy-handed by the trump administration, reports the washington post. Under the trump plan, states — and not the federal epa — would have the authority to regulate the emission of co2 and other greenhouse gases, per the ap. \" the ace rule would restore the rule of law and empower states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide modern, reliable, and affordable energy for all americans, \" says acting epa chief andrew wheeler in a statement. The new york times, meanwhile, digs into the fine print and finds one aspect of the new rule unlikely to be celebrated: a prediction of more premature deaths. For starters, within the reams of technical analysis accompanying the plan is the assertion that, when compared to the obama plan, \" implementing the proposed rule is expected to increase emissions of carbon dioxide and the level of emissions of certain pollutants in the atmosphere that adversely affect human health. \" and while the obama plan said it would help prevent up to 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030, the epa now predicts the nation will see between 470 and 1,400 premature deaths annually by that same year. The reason is an expected uptick in particulates in the air known as pm 2.5, which have been linked to heart disease, lung disease, asthma, and bronchitis. ( meanwhile, the trump administration is preparing for a big fight on fuel standards with california. )",

With a recent salmonella outbreak being linked to tuna scrape — ground backmeat scraped from the bones of the fish — people are asking whether this fish product is fit for human consumption, reports npr. Raw meat, after all, is generally riskier than cooked, and ground products are at greater risk for contamination. \" i don't think enough research has been done on these products, \" one food safety expert says. But others say the comparison is unfair. While tuna scrape comes from the leftovers bones of fish, much the way pink slime comes from meat left over on a cow's carcass, the similarities end there, says food safety news. Tuna scrape is removed with a spoon-like device and no further processing occurs, unlike pink slime, which is cooked, sent through a centrifuge, and sprayed with ammonia. \" i don't think it's a fair comparison at all, \" said one seafood expert.",

        "summary": "Most guys probably don't sit around the locker room pondering the finer points of how the male penis evolved, so leave this one to harvard researchers: the mystery is solved thanks to … lizard limbs. Yup, harvard scientists investigating the origin of external genitalia have found a link relating to the development of limbs in a variety of animals. Scientists initially hoped to discover why snakes didn't grow limbs, the boston globe reports. But they instead found that embryonic cells — which produce hind limbs in lizards, limb buds in snakes, and \" tail-bud \" tissue in mammals — form genitalia with a signal from something called a cloaca. As discovery reports, cloaca is \" tissue that eventually develops into the urinary and gut tracts. \" when they transplanted a cloaca onto hind limb cells in a chicken embryo, eureka — genital-like buds formed. \" it demonstrates that there is a flexibility with what kind of cells can get recruited during development to form genitalia, \" the lead author tells the bbc of his research in nature. He says the link may help explain why \" babies that are born with malformations in their limbs often also have malformations in their genitalia. \" while snakes and lizards have two penises, \" it appears that the way all amniotes, including reptiles, birds, and mammals, build their genitalia is very similar, \" a researcher says. The globe adds that external genitalia developed when animals moved from sea to land, rendering water-borne fertilization obsolete. ( another study finds sex is 385 million years old. )",

        "summary": "Warren jeffs must pay $ 16 million to a woman he pressured to marry her cousin when she was just 14. Elissa wall, a child bride within the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, was awarded $ 4 million in damages and $ 12 million in punitive damages tuesday, some 12 years after filing an initial lawsuit, reports the salt lake tribune. It accused jeffs of arranging the 2001 marriage of wall to her 19-year-old cousin, allen steed, and pressuring the pair to have children. Wall went on to have miscarriages and a stillbirth. Utah judge keith kelly said the conduct of jeffs — who didn't defend himself — \" was so extreme that it went beyond all possible bounds of decency and is regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized society, \" per fox 13. Jeffs — serving life in prison for child sex assault following a trial in which wall testified against him — was previously convicted as an accomplice to rape for presiding over wall's marriage. However, that conviction was overturned in 2010 over improper instructions given to the jury, per the deseret news. Steed pleaded guilty to solemnization of a prohibited marriage and pleaded no contest to unlawful sexual activity with a minor in 2011; he received 30 days in jail, three years of probation, and was ordered to pay $ 10,000, the deseret news previously reported. Following tuesday's decision, wall's lawyer suggested the $ 16 million come from flds assets across north america \" so the church feels the pain of what their doctrine has been as to the rape of young girls. \" ( a year after a slippery escape, jeffs ' brother was caught in june. )",

If you're struggling to visualize that weight, the bbc helps out: that's as heavy as 25,000 empire state buildings or 1 billion elephants. The researchers behind it — who hail from the university of california-santa barbara, the university of georgia, and the woods hole oceanographic institution, reports cnbc — call theirs \" the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. \" their paper, published in science advances, is replete with numbers: for instance, some 4.3 billion of the tons, or nearly half, were produced in the last 13 years alone. In 2014, 24 % of plastic waste was incinerated and 18 % recycled. But the long view isn't pretty: when looking at all plastics made through 2015, only 12 % had been burned and 9 % recycled, meaning 79 % of plastic waste was left sitting in landfills or other locations ( like in our oceans ). The us recycling rate, meanwhile, is behind that of europe ( 30 % ) and even china ( 25 % ). In the case of packaging, the \" end of [ plastics ' ] useful lifetimes \" comes in less than a year; for building and construction, it's decades. The researchers'somewhat gloomy assessment: \" without a well-designed and tailor-made management strategy for end-of-life plastics, humans are conducting a singular uncontrolled experiment on a global scale, in which billions of metric tons of material will accumulate across all major terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems on the planet. \" ( plastic bottles could rival the threat of climate change. )",

        "summary": "Negotiations over iran's nuclear program resumed in switzerland today but were almost immediately beset by competing claims, just hours after diplomats abandoned a march 31 deadline to reach a deal outline and agreed to press on. Eager to avoid a collapse in the discussions, the us and others claimed late yesterday that enough progress had been made to warrant an extension after six days of intense bartering. But the foreign ministers of china, france, and russia all departed lausanne overnight, although the significance of their absence was not clear, and the prospects for agreement remained uncertain. Iran's deputy foreign minister said lead negotiators would release a joint statement by the end of the day declaring that progress had been made but containing no specifics. A senior western official quickly pushed back, saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. As the wall street journal notes, nuclear talks with iran have now passed their intended deadline three times in less than a year — and the paper calls the three aforementioned overnight departures \" a sign that a breakthrough wasn't imminent. \" but senior western officials are still saying they're hopeful they can do what's needed to finalize the framework that would carry them toward a comprehensive deal by june 30, and iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zari pledged to stay \" as long as necessary \" to clear the remaining hurdles. The bbc sees four: how long the restrictions last: iran wants limits completely lifted after a decade; the six world powers involved want to lift them gradually after that decade mark. When sanctions will be suspended: iran wants relief quickly; the six again favor a gradual approach. What will happen if iran doesn't comply with the deal: un sanctions, and quickly. Russia is apparently on board but wants to retain its security council veto rights. Last but not least, centrifuges: iran wants to be able to enrich more uranium, more quickly.",

However, a number of foreign ministers have left the talks and china warned compromise was essential, otherwise \" all previous efforts will be wasted \". A deal would curb the nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Negotiations between the so-called p5+1 - the us, uk, france, china and russia plus germany - and iran continued on wednesday at lausanne's beau-rivage palace hotel after overrunning the self-imposed deadline of 31 march to reach a deal. On wednesday evening, a us state department spokeswoman said: \" we continue to make progress, but have not reached a political understanding. Therefore, secretary kerry will remain in lausanne until at least thursday morning to continue the negotiations. \" french foreign minister laurent fabius is also returning to lausanne. He had previously said he would return to the talks as soon as it was \" useful \". The p5+1 deal seeks to ensure iran could not assemble a nuclear weapon in less than a year.

            "Image copyright afp image caption the talks at lausanne's beau-rivage palace hotel will be extended to thursday talks on iran's nuclear programme will continue until at least thursday morning, two days after the original deadline, the us says. Us secretary of state john kerry has extended his stay to continue negotiations, officials say. However, a number of foreign ministers have left the talks and china warned compromise was essential, otherwise \" all previous efforts will be wasted \". A deal would curb the nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Negotiations between the so-called p5+1 - the us, uk, france, china and russia plus germany - and iran continued on wednesday at lausanne's beau-rivage palace hotel after overrunning the self-imposed deadline of 31 march to reach a deal. On wednesday evening, a us state department spokeswoman said: \" we continue to make progress, but have not reached a political understanding. Therefore, secretary kerry will remain in lausanne until at least thursday morning to continue the negotiations. \" french foreign minister laurent fabius is also returning to lausanne. He had previously said he would return to the talks as soon as it was \" useful \". The p5+1 deal seeks to ensure iran could not assemble a nuclear weapon in less than a year. The iranians insist that they have no such ambition. ' fingers crossed ' earlier, uk foreign secretary philip hammond told the bbc: \" i think we have a broad framework of understanding, but there are still some key issues that have to be worked through. \" some of them are quite detailed and technical so there is still quite a lot of work to do but we are on it now and we ' ll keep going at it. Mr hammond stressed again that he would not sign up to a \" bad deal \".

The youngsters, whose ages ranged from 5 to 13 or 14, were said to have been distraught after their parents left them in their rural home in one of china's poorest provinces, while they sought work in urban areas. \" i dream about death, and yet that dream never comes true, \" china news service says the note read, per the guardian. \" today it must finally come true. \" meanwhile, china premier li keqiang has demanded an inquiry, proclaiming \" such a tragedy cannot be allowed to happen again. \" the guardian notes there are about 60 million of these \" left behind \" children in china, abandoned when their parents leave them with relatives or on their own so they can find work in cities. The new york times points out china's rigid social-benefits system, which prevents children from receiving certain benefits, like health care and schooling, if they live outside their hometowns. In the case of these four children, their mother was said to be working in a toy factory in guangdong province and had been afraid to come home for at least a year due to past domestic violence incidents, per both the guardian and xinhua; the times cites a government report that says the kids were beaten by both parents, and that the father also \" regularly \" beat the mother. The father left the family home in march to find work elsewhere, the guardian notes. The children's mother came back to see her children's bodies before they were cremated friday and told xinhua that \" i did not shoulder my responsibility for them, \" adding to the china youth daily newspaper that \" i have truly failed them.

Prosecutors accused abu hamza al-masri — who is partially blind and has no hands — of trying to build a terrorist training camp in oregon, shipping off a young jihadist recruit to afghanistan, defying us sanctions imposed on the taliban, and aiding in the 1998 yemen kidnapping of 16 tourists, cnn reports. He had pleaded not guilty and stood trial for four weeks in new york city, facing a jury of four women and eight men. Now the 56-year-old may spend the rest of his life in prison. The prosecution focused on connecting abu hamza to events half-way around the world, often using witnesses who hadn't met him and appeared in exchange for leniency or protection. Taking the stand in his own defense, the cleric accused prosecutors of using \" pay-as-you-go witnesses \" who took his remarks out of context. Much of the trial focused on his anti-western statements, and videos were shown of abu hamza praising the 9/11 attackers, the telegraph reports. His defense attorney portrayed him as an \" independent thinker \" who was seeking a \" third way \" between the philosophies of george w bush and osama bin laden, but prosecutor ian mcginley described the cleric as a man who \" devoted his life to violent jihad. \"",

Scientists made that clear using what they have dubbed, in the journal analyst, a \" sniffer-camera. \" researchers placed a combination of chemicals on a mesh strainer, which they put on wine glasses. The camera, which showed images of ethanol vapor, revealed how that chemical was distributed in the wine. And ethanol concentrations, upi reports, can influence the taster's perception. Turns out that wine in researchers ' wine glasses, at about 55 degrees fahrenheit, had a lower concentration of alcohol in the middle of the glass than around the rim, scientific american reports. But wine in a martini glass, a straight glass, or served warmer didn't have the same \" ring phenomenon, \" which, a researcher says, \" allows us to enjoy the wine aroma without interference of gaseous ethanol. Accordingly, wine glass shape has a very sophisticated functional design for tasting and enjoying wine. \" the team's work could eventually help us choose the right glass, and temperature, for each drink.

Astronomers recently discovered a second spot located high in jupiter's atmosphere, according to a study published tuesday in geophysical research letters. According to a press release, astronomers are calling this new spot the \" great cold spot. \" ars technica reports it's similar in size to the great red spot — up to 100 million square miles or so — and is about 360 degrees fahrenheit cooler than the surrounding atmosphere. The great cold spot is also a lot more temperamental than its more famous sibling: it changes shape and size over the course of weeks and can even disappear at times. The great cold spot was first detected with data from chile's very large telescope, space.com reports. After that, astronomers were able to go back through 15 years of data to find evidence of the spot, which has likely been around for many thousands of years. Astronomers say the discovery was \" unexpected, \" and there's still a lot we don't know about jupiter's atmosphere. They believe the great cold spot's existence may have something to do with jupiter's strong auroras.

Now, researchers have found that it has a second great spot, almost as large — this one, a great cold spot caused by the planet's vibrant auroras. Researchers first detected the ever-changing great cold spot in data from the very large telescope in chile, and went back to track its existence over a 15-year period in observations from another telescope. The cool patch stretches up to 15,000 by 7,500 miles ( 24,000 by 12,000 km ) across at its largest, and it's about 400 degrees fahrenheit ( 200 degrees celsius ) cooler than the surrounding area in the planet's upper atmosphere. Although it disappears from time to time it seems to always re-form, just offset from the planet's bright aurora. \" the great cold spot is much more volatile than the slowly changing great red spot, changing dramatically in shape and size over only a few days and weeks, but it has reappeared for as long as we have data to search for it, for over 15 years, \" tom stallard, a planetary astronomer at the university of leicester in the u.k.

            "Jupiter is famous for its great red spot, a storm twice the diameter of earth that rages on the gas giant's surface. Now, researchers have found that it has a second great spot, almost as large — this one, a great cold spot caused by the planet's vibrant auroras. Researchers first detected the ever-changing great cold spot in data from the very large telescope in chile, and went back to track its existence over a 15-year period in observations from another telescope. The cool patch stretches up to 15,000 by 7,500 miles ( 24,000 by 12,000 km ) across at its largest, and it's about 400 degrees fahrenheit ( 200 degrees celsius ) cooler than the surrounding area in the planet's upper atmosphere. Although it disappears from time to time it seems to always re-form, just offset from the planet's bright aurora. \" the great cold spot is much more volatile than the slowly changing great red spot, changing dramatically in shape and size over only a few days and weeks, but it has reappeared for as long as we have data to search for it, for over 15 years, \" tom stallard, a planetary astronomer at the university of leicester in the u.k.

The discovery increases the known global forest cover by about 9 %. The study — published friday in science — focused on \" drylands, \" areas that lose more water through evaporation and plant transpiration than they receive in precipitation. Trees in drylands aren't very dense, which can make it difficult to measure possible forest cover. According to a press release, old estimates of dryland forests were off due to a number of factors, including low image resolution from satellites and the methods of mapping used. The new study used high-resolution images of more than 210,000 dryland sites from google earth engine and combined them with observations on the ground. Researchers found between 40 % to 47 % more forest cover in the world's drylands than previously reported. New forests were found on all continents — besides antarctica. Abc reports the research, led by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations, gives a new tool in the fight against climate change; it boosts estimates of the amount of carbon stored in plants globally.

Audio of the agonized child crying when she was separated — first published by propublica — galvanized opposition to the separation of families. Alison pleaded with border patrol agents to call her aunt, whose phone number she offers from memory. President donald trump reversed course on the splitting up of families on june 20 after a \" zero tolerance \" policy on illegal entry took effect in the spring. The joyful reunion occurred early friday in houston. Madrid, 29, was released on bond from an immigration detention center in port isabel, texas, not far from where she was arrested. Alison told reporters that she felt desperate after being separated and that it felt good to reunite. Her mother echoed that sentiment. \" we are beginning to recover the time we lost, \" madrid said. \" we are very happy to be together as family again. \" the mother and daughter plan to live with family in houston and the mother will seek asylum, garcia said.

He was eligible for salary arbitration and could have been a free agent after the 2014 season. Instead, he will be the long-term leader of a rotation that",

            "The los angeles dodgers and clayton kershaw have agreed on a seven-year, $ 215 million deal, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. It is the richest deal for a pitcher in major league baseball history, eclipsing the seven-year, $ 180 million contract detroit gave justin verlander last winter, and his average annual salary of $ 30.7 million is the highest ever for any baseball player. Kershaw will also have the opportunity to become a free agent again in five years, if he chooses. Sources told espn's buster olney, that because kershaw agreed to an $ 18 million signing bonus, with just a $ 4 million salary for 2014, his salary for 2014 -- for salary arbitration purposes -- is at $ 6.57 million ( calculated as $ 18 million divided by 7 years and adding $ 4"

When he suspected his wife was having an affair, instead of snooping through her phone himself, jones thought it would be a good idea to ask a friend in the sheriff's office if copies of text messages between his wife and another man could be obtained through police channels — which is illegal without a warrant and suspicion of criminal activity. In exchange for the warrantless surveillance, jones offered his \" friend \" two cases of bud light. Perhaps offended by the low-quality beer on offer, the deputy reported the judge for corruption. The jury deliberated for only 33 minutes before finding jones guilty, fox news reports. Jones was convicted on three felony charges. He will face sentencing on jan. 23. His defense plans to appeal the verdict. Jones'defense team argues that he was never informed his request was illegal, but his long career as a judge — including time as the chairman of the north carolina innocence inquiry commission — would seem to make it unlikely their appeal will be successful. Also working against jones: he ended up paying $ 100 cash for the information instead of beer.",

The national weather service has issued a flash flood warning for the entire territory, where authorities say the storm, the strongest to hit the island, knocked out electricity for 100 % of customers, nbc news reports. The latest: gov. Ricardo rossello, calling the storm a major disaster, imposed a 6am to 6pm curfew on the island, citing the danger of floods. The storm is expected to dump 20 to 30 inches of rain on the island friday. The storm moved toward the east coast of the dominican republic early thursday and is expected to hit the turks and caicos islands later in the day, reports reuters. After weakening to a category 2 as it passed over land, it is now a category 3 storm again, with maximum winds of 115mph. Communications have been cut with dozens of municipalities in puerto rico, meaning the true scale of the devastation is still unknown, especially in the southeast of the island, where the storm hit first, the ap reports. So far, the only death reported has been that of a man hit by flying lumber. Fema administrator william long tells the washington post that the government is preparing to help puerto rico and st. Croix, the us virgin island hardest hit by maria. \" right now we're in wait-and-see mode, \" he says. \" we know that st. Croix took a tremendous hit, and we know obviously puerto rico took the brunt of the storm. Once the weather clears and the seas die down, we ' ll be in full operation. \" the mayor of catano in northern puerto rico says 80 % of the homes in one neighborhood were destroyed and it will take \" months and months and months and months \" before they can recover from the storm, the guardian reports. Rossello said wednesday that many homes had \" no chance, \" though those built after stricter building codes were introduced in 2011 could survive the winds. In dominica, which suffered a direct hit from the storm earlier this week, authorities say conditions are dire, the new york times reports. At least 14 people were killed and maria destroyed many people's stockpiles of food as well as cut off power and running water.

In addition to castro describing his thoughts of suicide, nbc news reports the tapes reveal a shocking confession: castro once called amanda berry's mom — using berry's cellphone — to tell her her daughter was safe and now his \" wife. \" he hung up before she could respond, castro said. Castro also explains on the tapes that it was his own young daughter ( born to berry ) who pleaded with him to unlock his house's doors, ultimately leading to the three women's escape: \" i let my guard down, \" he said, when he left a bedroom door open, allowing berry to yell for help from the front door. Nbc news notes that castro seemed surprised he got away with his crimes for so long, telling police they missed a chance to catch him on surveillance cameras outside gina dejesus'school. \" you could have broke the case right then and there, \" he said, per the ap. And though he wouldn't commit suicide for another nine years, a 2004 note shows castro long battled suicidal thoughts. \" i want to put an end to my life, \" he wrote, \" and let the devil deal with me. \" during the interrogation, he told police, \" i just want to crash through the window. \"",

Among the races to watch: in kentucky, senate minority leader mitch mcconnell faces off against matt bevin, and there's little doubt mcconnell will win the primary. The key is whether he can win big in evangelical areas; if he can, it's good news for him in the general election, the wall street journal reports. In pennsylvania, democrats are battling for a chance to run against gov. Tom corbett, seen as perhaps the gop's \" most vulnerable governor, \" politico notes. Businessman tom wolf has spent $ 10 million of his own money on the race, and he's leading rep. Allyson schwartz. In georgia, there will almost definitely be a runoff vote in july for the republican senate spot. The question is who will be in it. Businessman david perdue looks likely, the washington post reports, while rep. Jack kingston and former georgia secretary of state karen handel are fighting to face him. Kingston has the chamber of commerce's backing, but handel is supported by sarah palin. In oregon, a senate race may hinge on a stalking report. Last week, politico revealed that republican neurosurgeon monica wehby's ex-boyfriend said she'd stalked him and harassed his workers; similar accusations from her ex-husband were subsequently revealed. Polls, however, still put her ahead of rep. Jason conger. In idaho, tea party candidate bryan smith is challenging gop rep. Mike simpson for his seat. Simpson is a major john boehner ally, the journal notes, while smith got a big push from the club for growth. But the club has stopped advertising in the race, and mitt romney has backed simpson, who looks likely to win.",

Authorities say they need time to determine if the crash — which involved mcclendon's suv crossing the center line, traveling across a grassy area, and slamming into the base of an overpass — was intentional, the ap reports. However, police capt. Paco balderrama says, \" there was plenty of opportunity for him to correct and get back on the roadway and that didn't occur. \" the former ceo of chesapeake energy and part owner of the nba's oklahoma city thunder wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Per the doj, mcclendon allegedly orchestrated a conspiracy between two unnamed oil and gas companies in which, rather than bidding against each other, they'd decide ahead of time who would win certain oil and gas leases. \" his actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land, \" a prosecutor said in the doj's release. In a tuesday statement, mcclendon claimed he had \" been singled out as the only person in the oil and gas industry in over 110 years since the sherman act became law to have been accused of this crime \" and vowed to fight the charges. Bloomberg reports the 56-year-old faced up to 10 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine. Mcclendon, who leaves behind a wife and three children, is being recalled as a fracking pioneer; npr reports that while most americans wouldn't know his name, \" his impact on his industry, region — and actually, the whole country — was huge. \" the new york times shares how t. Boone pickens, who knew mcclendon for 25 years, categorized him: \" charismatic … a true american entrepreneur, \" adding, \" no individual is without flaws. \"",

But that's far from the oddest firing hollywood has ever seen: tom cruise went the opposite way, firing his publicist in favor of a family member — in his case, he gave his scientologist sister the job. But just eight months later, his sister resigned and he hired a new publicist. Sometimes it's the family members who get the stars fired: the new york times reports that after thora birch's father ( a former \" adult star \" who became his daughter's manager ) threatened one of her co-stars during a rehearsal, birch was fired from an off broadway production of dracula. Charlie sheen fired his anger management co-star selma blair — via text message — after she complained about how difficult he was to work with. Lionsgate quickly followed suit and made the termination official.

She was even more upset when it almost got her fired from law &amp; order: svu, msn reports.

Jeff sessions is donald trump's pick to be the next attorney general and the alabaman is expected to bring some major changes to the justice department, the washington post reports. Aides predict sessions — a leading opponent of closing guantanamo bay — will make national security his main priority, reversing the obama administration's focus on civil rights. In what some see as a disturbing sign of things to come, he argued passionately last year against a senate resolution that the us shouldn't ban people from the country because of their religion. If trump goes through with a ban on muslim immigration, it will be sessions ' job to help put it into effect. In other coverage: former officials in the justice department's civil rights division tell politico that the appointment of sessions, who has long faced accusations of racial bias is a \" particularly troublesome \" one that could cause an exodus from the department. Sessions'defenders say his critics are ignoring his efforts to fight racism in alabama. Senate minority leader chuck schumer says he is \" very concerned \" about sessions ' civil rights policy. Legal experts tell reuters that while sessions has a reputation for being pro-business, his record suggests that he won't shy away from prosecuting corporate wrongdoers. He has argued in favor of being tough on corporate crime and sending white-collar criminals to prison. Forbes reports that the marijuana industry is very worried about what sessions might do as ag. He has expressed strong anti-marijuana opinions and will have the power to crack down on the drug even in states that have legalized it. It \" is false that marijuana use doesn't lead people to more drug use, \" he once said. \" it is already causing a disturbance in the states that have made it legal. \" the new york times notes that the choice of sessions reflects trump's view that security is a more important concern than civil liberties. Beyond gitmo, sessions has also argued in favor of waterboarding and george w. Bush's warrantless wiretaps. The bbc reports that trump will meet mitt romney saturday for talks, despite harsh words between the two during the gop primaries. Romney is rumored to be a candidate for secretary of state. \" the president-elect wants the best and brightest people to put this country forward: people who supported him, people who didn't support him, \" a trump spokesman says.",

At the moment, it appears the coral was damaged by the tatoosh dragging its anchor chain, notes the compass.

        "summary": "The white house is rolling out its new travel ban after the first one got hung up in the courts. The big difference, as expected, is that iraq is no longer on the banned list after promising to beef up screening, reports the ap. That leaves six muslim-majority nations: syria, iran, libya, somalia, sudan, and yemen. The new directive, scheduled to take effect march 16, will prohibit new visas from being issued to travelers from those nations for 90 days, but those with current visas won't be affected. The revised order generally makes more exceptions than the first one, notes the washington post, including for those who are permanent legal residents of the us. President trump signed it monday, though not in a public ceremony as with the first. \" if you have travel docs, if you actually have a visa, if you are a legal permanent resident, you are not covered under this particular executive action, \" adviser kellyanne conway told fox news on monday, per cnn. The order also will suspend the nation's refugee program for 120 days, making exceptions for those already cleared, and it will cap the total number of refugees at 50,000 for fiscal 2017, down about half from last year. So will the narrower scope appease critics? early reaction suggests not. \" the president has said he would ban muslims, and this revised version — in these preliminary fact sheets — still does that, even if they have removed iraq from the list, \" says the director of advocacy for the american immigration lawyers association.",

He huffs up and down the court in a gold tank top with a number 10 on it, maroon shorts, and nike ( nke ) high-tops that make it look as if he's got black-and-white hams strapped to the ends of his legs. The crowd is feisty, love shack pulses from the speakers, and the winded, increasingly sweaty republican senator from one of the most democratic states looks annoyed as he misses a pair of foul shots. \"this isn't soccer, senator! \" someone shouts from the stands, after brown goes flying, for the second time, onto his butt. The silhouette of two men jabbing at their blackberrys from the sidelines is a subtle reminder that this carefully staged display of athleticism is more than just an effort to raise money for troubled youth on a steamy august afternoon. Scott brown's race against democratic candidate elizabeth warren to hold on to his senate seat — formerly occupied by ted kennedy and narrowly won in a 2010 special election — has become one of the most closely watched congressional elections in the country, as well as the most expensive, with more than $ 53 million raised so",

The new york times reports prime wardrobe represents the latest in amazon's ongoing process of eliminating every barrier to shopping online. It works like this: amazon prime customers can order three to 15 items of clothing at a time without actually buying them and will be charged only for the items they keep. Customers have seven days to return the unwanted items in a resealable box with a pre-printed shipping label before they're charged, according to usa today. And the verge notes customers won't even have to go to the post office to return the unwanted clothing, because the service includes free scheduled ups pickups. To sweeten the deal, amazon will give customers 10 % off if they keep at least three items. If they keep at least five items, the discount is 20 %. Other online clothing retailers have long offered free returns to customers, but few only charge customers for the items they keep and those that do — such as stitch fix — choose the clothing they send to customers. It's unclear when prime wardrobe will be available, but amazon has already taken over the books and electronics markets — and is working on the grocery market — and analysts expect it to be the biggest apparel retailer in the us by the end of the year.",
