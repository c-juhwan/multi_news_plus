The new york times reports a 35-year-old man named brandon kiehm was charged tuesday with using tinder to defraud two kind-hearted women out of $ 26,000. Kiehm — using a fake name — met the first alleged victim on the dating app in july and told her he worked for goldman sachs, according to the new york daily news. He allegedly went on to borrow $ 14,000 from her over the next three months, at one point claiming he lost his wallet and needed money to pay for his sister's cancer treatment. He eventually gave the woman two checks worth $ 30,000 to repay her, but authorities say both checks bounced. Kiehm allegedly pulled a similar trick with a second woman in october, telling her he was robbed and needed cash to pay for his mother's cancer treatment. She gave him $ 12,000, and authorities say he attempted to repay her with $ 10,000 in bad checks. Kiehm's mother says neither she nor her daughter have ever had cancer. One of kiehm's alleged victims, however, is a cancer survivor. In addition to the tinder scams, kiehm allegedly stole a debit card from a man who hired him as a dog walker, using it to set up a venmo digital payment account and pay himself $ 13,000 over the next two months, pix 11 reports. He also allegedly used that victim's last name for his fake tinder account. Kiehm pleaded not guilty to grand larceny, identity theft, and scheme to defraud on tuesday and was released without bail.",

The body of the 20th century fox executive, who went missing on may 1, 2012, was discovered by hikers in california on oct. 26 and has been positively identified as smith's, the ap reports. The body was found in angeles national forest, according to the hollywood reporter; although results of the autopsy aren't finalized, smith's disappearance was already being treated as a murder after his mercedes-benz was found in february 2013 in a storage building belonging to drug dealer john creech, the reporter noted at the time. Smith was officially declared dead in may of this year, abc 7 originally reported. Smith, a film distributor for fox, was last seen at a friend's house in southern california, where he had reportedly gone to spend the night, abc news reports. When he didn't show to pick up his son from school the next day, his wife reported him missing. Local media reported a sighting of him with another woman on may 7, 2012, and his son was said to have tweeted smith had ditched his family ( that tweet was reportedly deleted later on ). However, his family said he had last been seen wearing his son's purple workout pants, a clear indicator he had no intention of being seen in public. His wife, lisa, acknowledged in an october 2012 interview with inside edition that her husband had a history of extramarital activity and drug abuse ( he was alleged to have had an affair with creech's wife, notes the hollywood reporter ), but she said she thought he had been murdered. \" i don't picture him walking in and saying, ' i ' m sorry, i just needed a breather.

A spokesman for costa cruises said: \" the company is trying to do everything they can for those passengers directly affected. \" the company is not only going to refund everybody but they will offer a 30 per cent discount on future cruises if they want to stay loyal to the company. \" costa's chief executive, pier luigi foschi, who estimated that the impact of the disaster on his firm was £ 60 million, had expressed confidence that the group would be able to \" find a solution that, in the material sense, would satisfy \" the passengers. However, brian page, 63, a retired accountant from southampton, who survived by sliding from one side of the deck to another to find a lifeboat, said: \" it is a ridiculous and insulting offer. I ' m very disappointed in them. \" they are not accepting their responsibilities at all. Our only back-up is separate legal action. \" costa cruises",

The nation will get its first aircraft carriers since world war ii, reports the guardian. The plan is to retrofit two existing helicopter carriers so they can be used by fighter jets, too. It dovetails with tokyo's recent decision to buy more than 100 f-35 jets from the us, on top of 42 previously purchased. The move is likely to draw criticism that japan is moving even further away from the pacifist aims of its constitution. As reuters notes, the constitution technically bans the maintenance of armed forces, though it has been interpreted more liberally to allow for a military on self-defense grounds. Japan's move is largely seen as a response to china's efforts to step up its own navy. Beijing acquired its first aircraft carrier in 2012, and it is currently building its third, reports the south china morning post. The tokyo development is indeed \" a major departure from japanese postwar military policy, \" writes kyle mizokami at popular mechanics. But don't expect to see the carriers anytime soon. Mizokami runs down the logistics involved with the retrofitting — including the possible addition of ramps — and figures the ships won't be operational for at least five years.

The result would be japan's first fixed-wing aircraft carriers since world war ii. The report in nippon news network says that japan has finalized plans to purchase 40 f-35b joint strike fighters. Unlike its siblings, the f-35b is capable of taking off and landing vertically by rotating its exhaust nozzle ninety degrees down. This makes it capable of taking off from ships not fitted with aircraft-launching steam or electromagnetic catapults. Japan has already agreed to purchase 42 f-35a fighters, the same version used by the u.s. Air force,",

Bureaucrats and elected officials have entire staffs devoted to writing and submitting pro forma letters. There's an elaborate choreography to them. Any deviation from norms, then, is noteworthy — especially if it involves an epithet or appears to advocate for the impeachment of a sitting president of the united states. Besides, so much political communication is predictable, performative, and phony — oftentimes all three at once. A glimpse into what someone really thinks can be thrilling, and doubly so when it seems designed to be subliminal. Yet there's something to be said for directness. Consider my personal favorite in the growing genre of surprising-messages-on-otherwise-boring-government-letterhead. The year was 1977. Neil abercrombie, then a state representative in hawaii, wrote a letter to the chairman of the board of education to register his frustration about a stalled plan for a local library.

Romney got it done in massachusetts without tearing the state apart — contrast that with the \" widespread bitterness \" of obamacare and the general state of dc dysfunction under obama. Romney \" learned much from the experience about what works locally and can work nationally. It's actually not a story to avoid, it is a story worth telling. \" be funny: romney needs a \" home run joke \" or two, writes roger simon in politico. It worked like a charm for reagan, who, when asked about his age at one debate, promised not to \" exploit for political purposes my opponent's youth and inexperience. \" romney's comedic record is, er, spotty, but that's why he's got speech writers. Go big: charles krauthammer's advice isn't specific to the debate, but he castigates romney in the washington post for playing it safe and squandering opportunities. The president's \" naive \" response to the libya consulate attack, for example, demanded substance but got boilerplate, writes krauthammer. \" go large, \" he pleads. \" about a foreign policy in ruins. About an archaic, 20th-century welfare state model that guarantees 21st-century insolvency. And about an alternate vision of an unapologetically assertive america abroad unafraid of fundamental structural change at home. \" or not? eh, all that advice is well and good, but the debates have never mattered as much as their reputation might suggest, writes michael cohen in the guardian.

According to an al-shabab statement, it \" carried out the airborne operation as a retribution for the crimes committed by the coalition of western crusaders and their intelligence agencies against the muslims of somalia. \" the militant group believes the attack was a success despite its failure to bring down the plane because it \" struck terror in the hearts of the crusaders, \" al jazeera quotes a statement from al-shabab. The group, which aims to overthrow the somali government, states the bombing was only one part of an attack on \" dozens of western intelligence officials and turkish nato forces. \" al-shabab claiming responsibility for the bomb confirms earlier us suspicions. It appears the suicide bomber was actually meant to board a turkish airlines flight, but it was canceled due to bad weather. The bomber is believed to have used a wheelchair to smuggle the bomb past security, which the flight's pilot claims is \" zero \" at the mogadishu airport.",

A rep for the company says its planes are removed from the water to undergo checks every 100 flying hours and engines are replaced every 1,100 flying hours. The dhc-2's engine had done just 200 flying hours, he says. A preliminary report on the crash is due within 30 days.",

Others who missed out: robin williams, chris rock, ben stiller, kiefer sutherland, james earl jones, kathleen turner, and more. However, al pacino, edie falco, and ellen barkin did score nominations.

I say thank you to the cashier at the coffee shop. I say thank you to the stranger who holds the door open for me at a restaurant.

When i first moved to the united states, all this took some getting used to. I didn't know i was supposed to thank someone who took my money for something i bought at a store. I didn't know i was supposed to thank people when they asked how i was doing ( and almost everyone who walks by me says \"hyadoin \" to me ).

            "To keep josh powell from being buried near the sons he killed, crime stoppers of tacoma-pierce county purchased the plots around charles and braden powell's grave. Josh powell's family reportedly wanted him interred in the same cemetery on a hill overlooking his sons, whom he attacked with a hatchet before killing them and himself in a gas-fueled explosive fire feb. 5. Det. Ed troyer of the pierce county sheriff's office, who is also director of the nonprofit crime stoppers, said he and pierce county sheriff paul pastor placed a down payment on the plots surrounding the boys ' grave. \" we might not be able to keep josh powell from being buried in the cemetery, but we can keep him away from the boys, \" he said in a phone interview with the times. \" bottom line is, it's not fair for murder victims to have the murder suspect laid to rest next to them. It's hurtful to the community and dishonors the boys. \" crime stoppers, a nonprofit that tries to help solve and prevent crimes, announced the news prominently on its website and asked for donations to help cover the cost of the plots, which is expected to be about $ 5,000.

But that's what she witnessed on tuesday during sentencing for 16-year-old jordyn howe, who pleaded guilty to the accidental shooting of lourdes \" jina \" guzman-dejesus, 13, on a school bus two years ago, the miami herald reports. Howe had brought his stepfather's pistol aboard the bus in november 2012 and began showing it off to friends, including jina — letting them cock it, aim, and pull the trigger. At one point, howe shot it at the floor, but no bullet fired. He then pointed the gun at jina and pulled the trigger. A bullet struck her in the neck, killing her. Howe immediately confessed, pleading guilty as a juvenile to manslaughter with a deadly weapon and other charges. But the courtroom embrace isn't the story's only remarkable detail: jina's mother, ady guzman-dejesus, gave her blessing to a lighter sentence, a plea deal that will have jordyn spend a year at a youth facility and speak to schools about the dangers of guns — alongside guzman-dejesus, who told reporters, \" that was jina's friend, too, and i know she wouldn't want the worst. \" jordyn had faced up to 22 months in prison, abc news reports, and guzman-dejesus initially wanted him handed a stiff sentence. In court on tuesday, her lawyer said the family had, after intense therapy, come to see that the plea \" meets the best needs of the community. \" \" justice is already done, \" guzman-dejesus said, per people. \" i really do forgive him. \" ( another moving courtroom scene recently involved a widow and the driver who killed her husband. )",

In what the ap calls a \" stunning move, \" senate majority leader mitch mcconnell announced on the senate floor that he was pulling ryan bounds ' nomination to be a judge on the 9th us circuit court of appeals. Bounds, an assistant us attorney in oregon, had come under fire for writings during his years as a student at stanford university that critics say are intolerant. Bounds wrote that activism on behalf of racial minorities and gays and lesbians was a \" pestilence \" threatening \" to corrupt our scholastic experience, \" per usa today. He also argued against expelling students for sexual assault. It's rare for a judicial nomination to be withdrawn at so late a stage unless the nominee lacks the support to be confirmed. The two senators from bounds ' home state, democrats jeff merkley and ron wyden, had both returned what's known as a negative blue slip, objecting to bounds ' nomination because of the writings as well as the fact that, they say, they were not consulted by the trump administration before bounds was nominated. The republicans have a 50-49 voting edge in the senate, but two republicans — tim scott of south carolina and marco rubio of florida — had voiced concerns about bounds, with scott announcing he couldn't support him thursday. According to cnn's sources, several other senators then said they felt the same way; merkley credits scott's decision with forcing the white house to withdraw bounds ' nomination.",

Chambers was able to whisper words to firefighters when they found her with burns over 98 % of her body, the clarion-ledger reports. Champion won't reveal the words, but tells cnn that they have \" certainly given us a lead we're following up on. \" the fbi has joined the atf and us marshals service in investigating the case. The activist hacking group anonymous is also involved, posting on twitter that gangs played a role in chambers'death. Inquisitr posts the tweets with links to alleged gang photos. Surveillance video of the gas station where chambers was last seen shows someone filling up what looks like a jug of gasoline beside her car about 90 minutes before she died, nbc news reports. Earlier, someone calls her off camera before she returns to pump gas. A store worker says chambers pumped an unusually high amount of gas that night — $ 14 instead of the usual $ 5, tech times reports. Chambers told the worker she was \" going somewhere, \" but he says that \" if she knew she had a problem with somebody, she would have told me. \" chambers'dad, ben chambers, tells nbc news that she had been in a battered women's shelter a few months ago. \" she was getting on the right track, \" he says. \" she had learned her lessons from being in bad relationships. \" read about a \" person of interest \" in the case or the possible importance of chambers ' phone.",

The cyclist took a couple of pictures, uploaded them to social media, gawkers came and gawked, and lots of speculation ensued about what the critter might've eaten, reports livescience, ranging from small warthog to the presumably tongue-in-cheek \" errant child. \" a week later, however, the snake was found dead and park officials decided to have their answer. Upon cutting the python open, they found a 30-pound porcupine, mostly undigested. The python's cause of death, however, is something of a chicken-and-egg game: while eating a massive, prickly porcupine probably wasn't its best career move, pythons have been know to eat both porcupines and larger prey and that alone probably wasn't enough to kill it. But the snake apparently fell down onto a ledge, notes livescience, and the porcupine's quills likely pierced something critical in the fall, like the snake's digestive tract. As gizmodo puts it: \" now we know who wins when a snake fights a porcupine. Nobody. \" the lake eland game preserve posted all the grisly photos on facebook.",

The pro-isis raqqa media center published photos to facebook showing a bleeding man they claim is the jordanian pilot, reports the bbc. The photos show a man in a white shirt being taken out of a body of water by armed men, as well as an image of a military card and a caption identifying him as royal jordanian air force flight lieutenant moaz youssef al-kasasbeh, the bbc notes. The lieutenant's father confirmed to a syrian newspaper that his son's plane went down in syria and passed a message along to isis: \" may allah plant mercy in your hearts and may you release my son. \" it would be the first warplane shot down by the islamic state since airstrikes began three months ago, and the first foreign soldier to fall into the group's hands, notes the ap. Activists from the syrian observatory for human rights claim isis used an anti-aircraft missile. Some worry what this incident means for how well isis fighters are armed, how well us-led aircraft can protect themselves, and whether arab nations will be more reluctant to join. In its air mission against syrian isis sites, the us has been joined by jordan, saudi arabia, bahrain, and the united arab emirates, with qatar lending logistical aid, the ap notes.

According to mediaite, the reporter hopped on social media to air his frustration, tweeting that the white house should have the \"backbone to answer questions on camera. \" his rant began with a cheeky tweet and photo of his anchor-print socks, which he said he was able to snap in place of a photo of the press secretary. Acosta accused the white house of \"stonewalling the news media \" and claimed spicer took questions from a russian news outlet, but not cnn. Per the hill, acosta doubled-down on his sentiments when he appeared on cnn newsroom with brooke baldwin. \"it just feels like we're sort of slowly but surely being dragged into what is a new normal in this country where the president of the united states is allowed to insulate himself from answering hard questions, \" he told baldwin. Acosta asserted that spicer is getting \"kind of useless, \" and wondered why the media is going along with the white house's no-recording rule. \"this isn't how we do things in this country but, for whatever reason, we're all going along with it. I don't understand why we covered that gaggle today, quite honestly. \" no response from spicer yet, but politico reports that he may be looking for his own replacement behind the white house podium.",

Two members of local group la excelencia were murdered in a guadalajara bar early monday morning after refusing to play more songs past closing time, el occidental of mexico reported. Jonathan martinez, 22, and gustavo alejandro, 35, were pronounced dead outside the vida divina nightclub, gunned down by unidentified assailants with suspected ties to the country's notorious drug gangs. A third victim, identified as bar patron leslie soltero, 26, was taken to a local hospital with a gunshot wound to her ankle. When la excelencia's performance came to an end around 4 a.m. Local time, four reportedly intoxicated and aggressive audience members demanded the musicians continue playing. Sensing trouble, the group extended its set by two songs, but was eventually forced to pull the plug by the bar's owner, according to el occidental. Out of nowhere, one of the instigators threw a grenade at the stage. The explosion injured one person and had panicked customers running for the exits. Martinez and alejandro were among those who fled the bar, but they were met at the front door by a hail of bullets, presumably from the same four men who had harassed them earlier.

            "Musicians killed in mexico after refusing to play more songs for audience jasso/ap two members of the musical group la excelencia were killed in a mexican bar after refusing to play more songs for the audience leaving the audience wanting more is the goal of every musician, unless you're a musician in violence-torn mexico. Two members of local group la excelencia were murdered in a guadalajara bar early monday morning after refusing to play more songs past closing time, el occidental of mexico reported. Jonathan martinez, 22, and gustavo alejandro, 35, were pronounced dead outside the vida divina nightclub, gunned down by unidentified assailants with suspected ties to the country's notorious drug gangs. A third victim, identified as bar patron leslie soltero, 26, was taken to a local hospital with a gunshot wound to her ankle. When la excelencia's performance came to an end around 4 a.m. Local time, four reportedly intoxicated and aggressive audience members demanded the musicians continue playing. Sensing trouble, the group extended its set by two songs, but was eventually forced to pull the plug by the bar's owner, according to el occidental. Out of nowhere, one of the instigators threw a grenade at the stage. The explosion injured one person and had panicked customers running for the exits. Martinez and alejandro were among those who fled the bar, but they were met at the front door by a hail of bullets, presumably from the same four men who had harassed them earlier. By the time police arrived at the scene, the killers had already escaped by car. No witnesses were able to identify the getaway vehicle. With news wire services"

The ruling could make new mexico the fifth state to allow physician-assisted suicide, the new york times reports, though the state is considering appealing to the state supreme court. The case stems from two doctors'desire to give prescriptions for life-ending drugs to terminal patients who request them, along with the case of cancer patient aja riggs. \" i don't want to suffer needlessly at the end, \" riggs told the court. Her uterine cancer is currently in remission, but she says it is likely to return, according to cnn. \" this court cannot envision a right more fundamental, more private, or more integral to the liberty, \" judge nan nash wrote. This right, she argued, was forged in new mexico's constitution — apparently citing its guarantees to life, liberty, and property, the albuquerque journal implies — despite the 1960 law. \" if decisions made in the shadow of one's imminent death regarding how they and their loved ones will face that death are not fundamental and at the core of these constitutional guarantees, then what decisions are? \" she wrote.",

His black labrador-griffon cross, nemo, is the first french presidential pet to come from a rescue centre, and since his arrival this summer he has been photographed in the gardens and even standing to attention on the palace steps to welcome niger's president, mahamadou issoufou. But two-year-old nemo brought a whole new meaning to the term presidential leaks this weekend when he cocked his leg for a long and abundant wee against an ornamental fireplace in macron's gilded office during a filmed meeting between the president and junior ministers. In the footage for the channel tf1, three junior ministers are in macron's ornate office talking to the president about inner-city investment when nemo relieves himself behind them.

Instead, the money will go to an hiv clinic in dc known as whitman-walker health, reports mediaite, which notes that the drug whose price was raised astronomically is commonly used to treat hiv patients who are suffering from the parasitic infection toxoplasmosis.

His tweeting ( shkreli tried to engage hillary clinton, too ) apparently drew the campaign's attention to the money, however, which had initially accepted it. \" i think it's cheap to use one person's action as a platform without kind of talking to that person, \" shkreli tells the globe. \" he ' ll take my money, but he won't engage with me for five minutes to understand this issue better. \" ( here's why shkreli hasn't cut the drug's price yet. )",

The professors — who hail from duke, yale, georgetown, northern kentucky, saint louis, hofstra, and elsewhere — have a number of problems with conway's conduct, which they claim shows \" dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, \" the telegraph reports. According to the washington post, the professors cite her reference to the non-existent \" bowling green massacre \" during a tv interview ( she later acknowledged that she misspoke ), her endorsement of ivanka trump products, and more. The professors say that they don't \" file this complaint lightly \" and that conway must be held to an even higher standard than other lawyers because she holds public office, law newz reports. The professors ( their political affiliations aren't specified ) say instead that conway may no longer understand or follow the \" ethical responsibilities \" of a lawyer. The complaint was filed with the dc office of disciplinary counsel, which handles issues dealing with members of the dc bar. Conway was admitted to the dc bar after graduating law school but has since been suspended for failing to pay dues, per the complaint. She is, however, an active member of the new jersey bar.

He said: \" entry to the cave was either underwater, or though a narrow blow hole at the top of the cave. \" the rescue was considered to be at the very edge of our technical capability. \" with the light failing and high tide approaching, a final risk assessment was undertaken by the office in charge and a decision was made to deploy. \" the st albans ' cliff technician showed exceptional courage and entered the cave through the blow hole. \" on entering the cave it became apparent that the casualty had sadly succumbed. \" the difficult decision was taken that the recovery of the body at that point was too dangerous to undertake.

According to nbc los angeles, the out-of-control situation started with the man throwing rocks at a car and doing doughnuts in a utility truck. Police tell ktla he was trying to run people over. When a security guard tried to calm him down, he allegedly picked up a chainsaw and started chasing his boss around. Other workers filmed the incident with their cellphones, and one can be heard yelling, \" he's going to saw someone! \" police arrived and fired more than two dozen shots at the man, who they say was backing up toward them in the utility truck. The man wasn't hit by any of the bullets but did suffer minor injuries during his alleged rampage. He also allegedly crashed the truck into another vehicle. The incident started as workers were preparing to go out to trim trees around power lines. The owner of the tree-trimming company, who says he was the man's target, tells ktla the man regularly comes looking for work and is occasionally hired for odd jobs.

Some of the 11 hungry children found at the squalid compound during an early august raid described a days-long ritual \" intended to cast out demonic spirits, \" which involved siraj wahhaj putting his hand on his son's head as he recited koran verses, per the bbc and cnn. Per the fbi, wahhaj's partner, jany leveille, was believed by the family to be able to communicate with god, and the family thought the boy would return \" as jesus \" and id targets for violent attacks, including law enforcement, per reuters. Wahhaj and leveille are among five related adults facing child abuse charges. All but wahhaj, who has a warrant against him for child abduction in georgia, have been granted release on bail. Though authorities admitted finding weapons and ammunition in a vehicle carrying wahhaj, leveille, and seven children through alabama in december — more weapons were found at the compound — state district judge sarah backus on monday said prosecutors failed to show the group posed a threat to the community. \" the state alleges that there was a big plan afoot, but the state hasn't shown to my satisfaction, in clear and convincing evidence, what that plan was, \" she said.

In the past, 4chan has been linked to various online hate movements, due to the site's loose moderation and anonymous nature. However, nefarious users have largely migrated off 4chan to other hidden imageboards, subreddits, and \" chans, \" meaning a potential closure of the site isn't as big of a story as it once might have been.

It adds that the me's office is still awaiting toxicology results to determine the \" cause and manner of death. \" an example of the mixed messages in coverage: the atlanta journal-constitution reports that county police chief john hauser says it wasn't a case of simple negligence, while cnn quotes a police spokesperson saying, \" i honestly don't have an answer for that question \" when asked whether authorities think it's malice or negligence. The hyperthermia finding isn't surprising because it means the boy's body temperature rose above 98.6 degrees and stayed there, and by all accounts the boy was left in the car for seven hours on a day that hit 90 degrees. In an earlier development today, police revealed that harris had driven to his job at home depot with cooper in the back seat after stopping for breakfast at a restaurant about a half-mile away. Harris also returned to the vehicle at lunch time and opened the driver's side door. Myfox atlanta, meanwhile, is out with a report from an anonymous police source that says investigators seized harris ' work computer and found that someone had looked up how long it takes for an animal to die in a hot car.

        "summary": "Earth will get its own halloween decoration next year, though a little late. In mid-november, a skull-shaped asteroid will make its second flyby past earth since it was discovered just beyond the moon in october 2015. It went on to pass by earth on oct. 31, 2015, prompting it to be nicknamed the halloween asteroid. Officially known as 2015 tb145, it spends most of its time beyond mars and jupiter, per newsweek. But its orbit brings it close to earth every 3.04 years, reports space.com. Because of the tilted shape of the orbit, it will be farther from earth in 2018 than in 2015 — it won't be so close again for 500 years, per science alert — but researchers still hope to get the opportunity to learn more about the rock, considered \" potentially hazardous \" by nasa because of its close approaches. In 2015, the asteroid came within 300,000 miles of earth — as a gauge, the moon is 239,000 miles away. In 2018, it will be at 105 times the latter distance. \" although this approach shall not be so favorable, we will be able to obtain new data which could help improve our knowledge of this mass and other similar masses that come close to our planet, \" researcher pablo santos-sanz says, per sinc. So far, experts have gathered the asteroid is around 2,100 feet wide, rotates once every three to five hours, and looks like a skull from some angles. They also suspect it was once a comet that lost its water during close encounters with the sun. Santos-sanz says it's now quite dark, reflecting 5 % to 6 % of sunlight, making it \" only slightly more reflective than charcoal. \"",

        "summary": "High levels of arsenic in rice shouldn't scare you away, scientists say, because they've found a way to flush most of the toxin, the journal nature notes. Researchers for the study in plos one acquired 41 rice samples from at least a dozen countries and dumped them into either a lab-built contraption that condensed steam and produced fresh, distilled hot water or into a regular old coffee percolator with a filter, where the hot water dripped onto the uncooked rice ( and then back out of the rice ). The results: the coffee percolator-cooked rice got rid of half its arsenic, while the steam device got rid of up to 85 % in some cases, depending on whether white rice or whole-grain rice was used, per the study. These findings could affect countries that consume lots of rice and even infants who eat rice-based cereals, as high arsenic levels in food have been tied to cancer. The way rice is produced contributes to why the product can have up to 10 times the arsenic levels of other foods: the water present in the flooded paddies where rice is grown can shake up inorganic arsenic found in the soil and infiltrate the plants, upi reports. The study's leader notes this technique is simply a short-term fix for people who don't want to wait for longer-term solutions like revamping rice-growing processes and cultivating strains that contain low levels of arsenic, per nature. He also doesn't expect everyone to start firing up their coffee machines whenever they want to make jambalaya — he's really hoping this method may lead to better rice-cookers down the road. \" we just took something that's in everybody's kitchen and applied it to show a principle, \" he tells the journal.

But steyer and veteran political strategist chris lehane say the larger goal is to make climate change a big issue in the 2016 presidential race, reports the new york times.

The school is still there too, a short walk up the road, but not for long.

The town has announced that it will forgo official ceremonies marking the massacre's first anniversary; it asked for a halt to gifts that for months poured in, from individuals as well as organizations; and it tackled the practical matter of the school's future before considering whether to erect a permanent memorial.

Some digging revealed a stone cracked by fire, scraps of iron ore, and viking-style turf walls. \"either it's … an entirely new culture that looks exactly like the norse, \" parcak tells the post, \"or it's the westernmost norse site that's ever been discovered. \" and that means there could more undiscovered sites showing vikings settled deep into north america hundreds of years before the arrival of columbus.

The new canadian site, with telltale signs of iron-working, was discovered last summer after infrared images from 400 miles in space showed possible man-made shapes under discolored vegetation. The site is on the southwest coast of newfoundland, about 300 miles south of l ' anse aux meadows, the first and so far only confirmed viking settlement in north america, discovered in 1960.

( daron taylor, jhaan elker/the washington post ) the ancient chronicles told of a larger-than-life viking warrior with a shock of red hair, banished from his home for killing another man, who sailed with hundreds of followers to an icy island in the sea. And they told of his son, who set out only a few years later to an even more distant place he knew as \"vinland, \" but which today's historians believe were the eastern coasts of modern day canada and the united states. The icelandic sagas are thrilling narratives, full of swashbuckling exploration, epic feuds, dazzling romances and poignant betrayals",
            "A thousand years after the vikings braved the icy seas from greenland to the new world in search of timber and plunder, satellite technology has found intriguing evidence of a long-elusive prize in archaeology — a second norse settlement in north america, further south than ever known. The new canadian site, with telltale signs of iron-working, was discovered last summer after infrared images from 400 miles in space showed possible man-made shapes under discolored vegetation. The site is on the southwest coast of newfoundland, about 300 miles south of l ' anse aux meadows, the first and so far only confirmed viking settlement in north america, discovered in 1960. Since then, archaeologists, following up clues in the histories known as the sagas, have been hunting for the holy grail of other viking, or norse, landmarks in the americas that would have existed 500 years before columbus, to no avail.",
            "Image copyright alamy a new discovery has revealed that the vikings may have travelled hundreds of miles further into north america than previously thought. It's well known that they reached the tip of the continent more than 1,000 years ago, but the full extent of their exploration has remained a mystery, writes historian dan snow. After a long hike across boggy ground and through thick pine forests, clutching pepper spray to protect against bear attacks, sarah parcak and her small team of archaeologists stood on an exposed, wind-blasted headland in north america. Exhausted but happy, they had been led to point rosee in newfoundland by the most high-tech weaponry in the modern archaeological arsenal - satellite data captured 383 miles ( 600km ) above the earth. But once here they were back to using trowels and brushes. I joined them to see how this powerful combination of new and old allowed them to"

Police say the rapists tried to run the woman over after dumping her on the side of the road; her boyfriend, who was also beaten, pulled her out of the vehicle's path. In her bid to protect herself, the woman bit three of her attackers; those injuries, along with blood, semen, and hair samples, will be used at trial, reports the afp. The driver also allegedly tried to eliminate evidence of the crime by washing the bus and torching the clothes taken from the woman. Other developments: the sixth suspect in the attack is undergoing bone testing to verify his age — police believe he may be 17, which would mean he'd be tried as a juvenile. Lawyers in the area of delhi where the trial will be held said today that they would not defend the suspects because it would be \" immoral. \" the government will have to appoint lawyers. The guardian reports that the woman's ashes were scattered on the ganges yesterday. The paper adds that in the wake of the crime, hundreds of delhi women have applied for gun licenses. Meanwhile, an education minister wants the victim's name to be released — so that a potential new anti-rape law can be named after her. \" she was a human being with a name, not just a symbol, \" he tweeted yesterday, reports the bbc.",

But the challenge in iowa is that historically, caucusgoers — only a sliver of registered voters — have had to be coaxed out by a field team, rather than be counted on to show up and vote on their own. This is especially true of the demographic that supports mr. Trump: younger voters and others with a low propensity to turn out. As temperatures plunged to single digits over the weekend, canvassers for hillary clinton posted photographs of themselves on social media going door to door in the snow. Meanwhile, mr.

The connections in the foetal brain are not fully formed in that time, nor is the foetus conscious, according to the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists. The findings of two reports commissioned by the department of health strike a blow to those seeking to reduce the upper time limit for having an abortion, currently at 24 weeks. The studies suggest that late abortions, permitted for serious abnormalities or risks to a woman's health, do not result in foetal suffering because of increasing evidence that the chemical environment in the uterus induces \" a continuous sleep-like unconsciousness or sedation \". The review of existing evidence, as well as guidance to health professionals and information for mothers, was instigated on the recommendation of the commons health select committee two years ago. Efforts in the commons to reduce abortion limits to 22 or 20 weeks were defeated in 2008. The reports will hamper campaigners ' efforts for an early return to the topic, despite david cameron having suggested before the election that that might happen.

Brain connections are not fully formed, and the environment of the womb creates a state of induced sleep, like unconsciousness, they add. Anti-abortion campaigners challenged the reports. The issue of whether a foetus of 24 weeks or below can feel pain had been raised in the debate over whether the current time limit for abortion should be reduced. The limit is set down in the 1967 abortion act, which covers all parts of the uk apart from northern ireland. In northern ireland abortion is not permitted, unless the mother's health is at risk.

An officer fatally shot that man, but when clearing the home to make sure it was safe, officers found the actual intruder dead on the bathroom floor; the armed male killed by police was a resident of the home who, police believe, had shot and killed the intruder. Police also found a juvenile in the home who had been injured by the intruder; he was taken to the hospital with serious but not life-threatening wounds. Police say more details, including the identities of the two men, will be released as the investigation continues, but the family of the man killed by police identifies him to fox 31 as 73-year-old vietnam veteran richard black, and they say he owned the home; 9 news says black and his wife are listed as the homeowners.

Republicans have been attacking the 9th circuit for decades, accusing it of being both too liberal and too large, the washington post reports. Conservative pundits call it the \" ninth circus \" or the \" nutty ninth, \" and newt gingrich once proposed getting rid of it entirely for being \" anti-american. \" the first part of republicans ' complaint — that the 9th circuit is too liberal — isn't as accurate as it used to be. The court's liberal bent declined recently after president obama placed a handful of centrist judges on it. And the gop's claim that decisions from the 9th circuit have the highest rate of being overturned in the supreme court is complicated by the fact that the high court takes up a \" minuscule fraction \" of any courts cases, notes the post. But republicans may have a point that the 9th circuit is too big: the ap reports it has more judges than any other appellate court and covers 20 % of the us population. But 9th circuit judges — appointed by both democrat and republican presidents — oppose proposals to break it down into smaller courts. Trump can't break up the court on his own anyway; it would require congress to act.",

The teaser trailer for 10 cloverfield lane quietly started showing in theaters this week and was released online friday, to the internet's vast surprise, wired reports. ( sample tweet: \" jj abrams secretly made a sequel to cloverfield and released the trailer when no one was looking. This is not a drill!!! \" ) the plot of cloverfield, a \" faux-found-footage \" film abrams made in 2008 about the aftermath of a monster attack on new york city, was also cloaked in secrecy, prompting people to search for clues as to what the heck it was about before it was released, and it looks like the same type of questions will be asked about this follow-up. As collider notes, news of the film broke in 2014, but back then no one knew it was a cloverfield sequel. At the time, it was referred to as a post-apocalyptic thriller called valencia or the cellar. \" we wanted to make it a blood relative of cloverfield, \" abrams tells collider. \" the idea was developed over time. We wanted to hold back the title for as long as possible. \" the trailer shows three characters, played by john goodman, mary elizabeth winstead, and john gallagher, jr., hanging out in an underground bunker casually and pleasantly until things start getting weird: rumbling, a gun, handcuffs, tense looks on everyone's faces, a fire, a fight, goodman begging winstead not to go outside, the tagline \" something's coming \"... You get the idea. Imdb's plot description: \" waking up from a car accident, a young woman finds herself in the basement of a man who says he's saved her life from a chemical attack that has left the outside uninhabitable. \" and that's basically what winstead described to collider back in march about what was then called valencia, noting, \" you don't know who's telling the truth or who to believe. There's a lot of, who's manipulating who. \" how, exactly, it all relates to cloverfield is not clear. It's in theaters march 11.",
