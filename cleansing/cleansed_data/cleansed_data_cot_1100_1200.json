        "summary": "If you were shocked when 38 women came forward to accuse director james toback of sexual harassment, prepare to be truly taken aback: that number is now closer to 238. After the los angeles times published its original exposé, more than 200 additional women got in touch with the paper to report their own stories of alleged harassment at toback's hands, the times reports in a follow-up article. That number includes today anchor natalie morales. Most of their stories involve toback approaching them to offer to make them a star, and then, at what was supposed to be an interview or audition, asking sexually inappropriate questions before, in many cases, dry-humping the women or masturbating in front of them. The times hasn't verified the new accounts. Many people have also called the lapd to report disturbing encounters with toback, the department confirms; it's looking into the calls to determine whether an investigation is warranted. In new york, where toback lives and where many of the encounters allegedly took place, those who say they're victims are being told to get in touch with the manhattan da's office, and several of the women accusing toback say they've done so. Toback's longtime agent has dropped him as a client, and others in the showbiz industry have come out against him, with some saying they've disliked the 72-year-old director for years. In 2010, gawker also spoke to two sources who say toback tried to pick up underage girls as well. ( spy magazine tried to expose toback in 1989. )",

        "summary": "It was one of the most shocking moments on tv, but because it happened before everyone had dvrs ( or even vcrs ), barely anyone has seen it. Now, usa today reports, two movies are hitting theaters based around the incident: the suicide of florida journalist christine chubbuck, who killed herself on the air during a june 15, 1974, broadcast for sarasota station wxlt. \" in keeping with channel 40's policy of bringing you the latest in ' blood and guts '... You are going to see another first: attempted suicide, \" chubbuck, 29, said to viewers before shooting herself in the head with a gun she'd hidden under her desk. She died shortly after. Usa today notes the irony of how a death she'd wanted to be seen by so many ended up being relegated to virtual secrecy. The lone tape of the broadcast was thought to be lost, but in june, mollie nelson, the station owner's widow, told vulture her husband had the tape, and when he died, she gave it to a \" very large law firm \" to guard. Fascination about the case and chubbuck's life, which included bouts with depression and struggles as a woman in the workplace, has spurred christine — a drama debuting oct. 21 in select theaters and elsewhere in the fall — and kate meets christine, soon to be playing in a dozen theaters. Usa today calls the latter film a \" quasi-documentary \" that follows actress kate lyn sheil around sarasota as she preps for the part of chubbuck. Its director, robert greene, notes how we wouldn't see something like this today kept hidden. \" it comes from another era where, for good or bad, it was more swept away, \" he says. \" we live in an era today where we think we have a right to see everything. \" as for the original tape now being harbored by some unnamed law firm? nelson told vulture she has no intention of ever showing it to anyone.

        "summary": "Just 1.5 % of mammals menstruate and 99.9 % of those are primates. That's why scientists are amazed by the spiny mouse — the first rodent shown to menstruate with a cycle remarkably similar to humans, according to a study that still needs to be peer-reviewed. Researchers at monash university in australia who were studying a lab colony of 14 female spiny mice found they bled for three days out of an average menstrual cycle of nine days. That means they shed the uterine lining for 20 % to 40 % of their cycle, similar to the 15 % to 35 % of time women bleed during a typical 28-day cycle, per nature. \" when you do science you're not surprised at anything — but wow, this was a really interesting finding, \" says a reproductive biologist not involved in the study. Scientists hope the mice can now be used to study conditions related to menstruation. The current animal model for menstruation-related conditions is the baboon, which menstruates, but research on primates is expensive. The study suggests spiny mice could eventually replace the baboon, \" opening up a new, cheaper way to study disorders like endometriosis and pre-menstrual syndrome, \" reports popular science. Researchers — who flushed the mice with a saline solution for 18 days, and dissected the uteri of four mice at various stages of the menstrual cycle — are still looking at genes to discover the source of cells that regrow the uterine lining after it is shed. As for why it took them so long to realize a rodent was menstruating, \" the answer, as with many discoveries in science, is that no one really looked, \" says a study author. \" everyone knew that rodents didn't menstruate. \" ( this company has a period policy. )",

It's a polished, carefully crafted, highly controlled work, attended to by more than a dozen facebook employees who include professional photographers and editors who help write posts and remove harassing comments and spam. Of course, image managers are a dime a dozen among chief executive officers, but zuckerberg is in a unique spot as ceo of a social media company, notes new york. \" he has to connect, to show the power of facebook's platform to allow people to share moments from their lives. \" as a result, observes bloomberg, \" the scale of this team is something different. \" that dozen, by the way, doesn't even count another handful of employees who manage his communications, including emails, posts, and speeches. \" what he's learned over the last two years is that his image in the digital domain needs to be controlled, \" says a berkeley prof. In fact it's a complete retooling of the image created in the film the social network, where he was depicted by jesse eisenberg as socially awkward, intense young man trying to fill his new billionaire shoes. Today, though, daily posts serve as the town hall meetings he launched in 2014; professional photos show a well-dressed man leaving the vatican or a father reading to his baby girl; and full-blown documentaries detail his latest entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavors. Bloomberg wonders if this is a man who hopes to some day run for public office, noting that his goal in 2017 is to travel to all 50 us states. And quartz points out that a recent theme is how he \" gets \" middle america. ( check out why zuckerberg is suing families in hawaii. )",

The gunman, omar mateen, killed 49 people and injured more than 50 in the attack at a gay nightclub. The 29-year-old muslim born in new york made calls during the attack saying he was a supporter of the islamic state. But he also spoke about an affiliate of al-qaeda and hezbollah, both of which are is enemies. Questioned on his startling assertion, mccain repeated it: \" directly responsible. Because he pulled everybody out of iraq, and i predicted at the time that isis would go unchecked and there would be attacks on the united states of america. It's a matter of record, so he is directly responsible. \" however, mccain later sought to clarify his comments, saying over twitter: \" to clarify, i was referring to pres obama's national security decisions that have led to rise of #isil, not to the president himself. \" he later tweeted that he \" misspoke, \" and released a clarifying statement.",

Lawyers for the teen, who is being represented by the aclu, said they'd tried everything to find her a sponsor to no avail. On sunday, they asked the full court to reverse the panel's decision. Lawyers argued the delay to oct. 31 is putting the teen dangerously close to the abortion cutoff for texas, which bans the procedure after 20 weeks. Tuesday's 6-3 ruling was split between democrat- and republican-appointed judges. It sends the case back to a lower court, where a judge ordered the trump administration to allow jane doe to have an abortion, the austin-american statesman reports. According to the ap, the teen came to the us in september from an unnamed central american country and found out she was pregnant while in federal custody. The department of health and human services says it has a police of \" refusing to facilitate \" abortions and had refused to transport or temporarily release the teen to have the procedure. \"it's clear that their anti-woman, anti-abortion, anti-immigration agenda is unchecked by basic decency or even the bounds of the law, \" an aclu lawyer says. The trump administration could appeal the decision to the supreme court.",

The government has a hands-off policy when it comes to such tribes because their members are so vulnerable to disease when they meet the modern world. But in this case, the mashco piro has been venturing out of the rainforest in encounters with neighboring villagers, missionaries, and even tourists. Reuters reports at least 100 such instances over the past year. \" the only ones who haven't been in contact with them are representatives of the state! \" says a government official. Anthropologists also say it makes sense to establish official contact, especially now that tribe members are emerging on their own and putting themselves at risk. \" well-organized contacts are today both humane and ethical, \" write two researchers in science. In refusing them, \" governments are simply guaranteeing that accidental and disastrous contacts will take place instead. \" the government says a team of doctors upriver will be prepared to treat tribe members if illness occurs. The washington post reports that another factor also is driving the \" urgency \" of the contact: in may, tribe members killed a young man from another village with an arrow, and other violent encounters have been recorded. The government hopes to play peacekeeper before things get out of control. ( besides, one school of thought is that it's impossible for \" lost tribes \" to remain lost these days. )",

He was 88 and had been the world's longest reigning monarch, reports the ap. The royal palace said bhumibol died \" in a peaceful state \" at siriraj hospital in bangkok, where he underwent an operation over the weekend and had been treated over the past decade. During a reign that spanned 70 years, the us-born bhumibol was the nation's one constant as myriad governments rose and fell, a gentle leader who used the throne's influence to unify the nation and rally troops through the cold war as thailand's neighbors fell under communist control. In his heyday, the frail, soft-spoken man in spectacles wielded so much power and respect, he could squelch coups and rebellions with a gesture or a few well-chosen words. Bhumibol was the world's richest monarch and one of the planet's wealthiest people: forbes magazine estimated his fortune at more than $ 30 billion in 2011. Although not known for having extravagant tastes, he nevertheless lived the elite life of a modern-day king, racing yachts and appearing at official functions clothed in ornate golden robes. Over the last decade, the once vigorous bhumibol had withdrawn from public life due to a series of illnesses. His wife, queen sirikit, has also long been ailing and has been even more rarely seen. Strong anti-defamation laws in thailand make it a severe crime to speak ill of the king or the royal family, making it sometimes difficult for outsiders to gauge public opinion. However, npr reports that the king's successor, crown prince vajiralongkorn, is clearly less well-liked than his father. Thailand's pm says the government will observe a one-year mourning period and flags will fly at half-staff for 30 days. No government events will be held for 30 days, he added. The world's longest reigning monarch is now queen elizabeth ii, who ascended to the british throne in 1952.",

Jacob schmoyer allegedly used a homemade explosive device inside his car; the ensuing blast killed schmoyer, his son, jonathan, and his friend, david hallman. Since the explosion, the allentown police department has received four letters from schmoyer detailing his plans to kill hallman and his son as well as how the bomb would be made. Why? \" he was miserable. Basically, the four letters describe a miserable life, he was unhappy himself, \" an atf special agent told reporters thursday, per nbc news. \" he admitted to a lot of criminal acts, he didn't think it was going to get any better. There was a lot of hatred there, and obviously, some directed at mr. Hallman and his son. \" authorities say the letters indicate schmoyer was targeting hallman, but also planned to take his own life and \" take his son along with him, \" per the allentown morning call. They say he \" lured \" hallman out on the night of his death; surveillance video shows hallman, who lived doors down from the location of the explosion, entering schmoyer's car. When the explosive went off just two seconds later, schmoyer was in the driver's seat, hallman was in the front passenger seat, and the toddler was in a car seat in the back seat, per lehigh valley live. The sister of the little boy's mom says schmoyer also sent letters to his family before the explosion, and that they \" [ stated ] he had something against autism, which he suspected jj [ jonathan schmoyer ] had. \" even so, schmoyer's grandmother tells wfmz, \" i really did believe he would never do this, maybe in my heart i knew he would do it to himself, but never to jj. \"",

If that holds true, it would be one of the 10 coldest games in nfl history. Espn is a little more optimistic, calling for a whopping high of 1 degree. Though the network also points out it will feel like -23 degrees with the wind chill. The vikings, who are waiting for their new stadium to be built, are playing an outdoor home playoff game for the first time in nearly 40 years, espn reports. The stadium will be providing free hand warmers and coffee, and fans are encouraged to bring blankets and cardboard or newspaper to put under their feet. According to the star-tribune, the coldest game in nfl history is known as the \" ice bowl. \" green bay and dallas played for the 1967 championship with the temperature hovering around -13 degrees ( with a wind chill of -50 degrees ).

            "Good news, millennials: diet coke is introducing four new flavors that are sure to tickle your taste buds. At least that's what coca-cola ( ko ) is hoping. Starting in two weeks, you can buy diet coke in ginger lime, feisty cherry, zesty blood orange and twisted mango. They will come in a skinnier silver can, reminiscent of red bull's. And the company may have had another drink in mind when it mixed up the flavors -- lacroix seltzer, which has attracted exactly the audience coke is after. Coke wasn't shy about which customers it's targeting. \" millennials are now thirstier than ever for adventures and new experiences, and we want to be right by their side, \" said rafael acevedo, the group director for diet coke in north america. \" we're making the brand more relatable and more authentic. \" another diet coke executive said the company cast a \" broad flavor net \" after examining what millennials are eating and drinking, and tested everything from spicy notes to exotic fruits. Related: coca-cola is replacing coke zero with a new drink the company even released a video of millennials trying the flavors. ( their most common reaction: \" whoa. \" ) coca-cola spent two years on the relaunch and says it asked more than 10,000 people",

The delegate count in the democratic primary, however, shows that's not very likely. A total of 2,383 delegates are needed to win the nomination, and clinton now has 502 compared to sanders ' 70. That includes 451 superdelegates ( party insiders who can flip their support later ) for clinton and just 19 for sanders, though both candidates are tied in the pledged delegate count at 51, reports the new york times. Another 880 delegates will be awarded when 11 mostly-southern states vote on super tuesday on march 1, and clinton is expected to win a \" jackpot from the overwhelmingly black and hispanic areas, \" per the times. Clinton \" could effectively end the race in less than two weeks'time, \" one analyst says. Sanders ' campaign manager admits super tuesday could be a struggle, but \" because we can do the long game, once we get past march 1, the calendar changes dramatically, \" he tells the ap. Sanders is focusing on winning colorado, massachusetts, minnesota, and oklahoma, and keeping close primary races in other states to avoid handing clinton the delegates that come with huge victories. Still, president obama's 2008 campaign manager, who supports clinton, says sanders would need \" surprising landslides in surprising places \" and \" other than vermont, i don't see a single state where hillary clinton is going to lose in a blowout. \"",

But as the new york times reports, timothy ray jones \" was leading a fractured life fraught with feelings of betrayal, anxiety, and mistrust \" before police say he murdered his kids in south carolina and dumped their bodies in alabama. After eight years of marriage, jones and wife amber divorced in 2013 when jones found she \" was putting the children to bed and then going next door \" to meet a 19-year-old neighbor with whom she was having an affair, according to a divorce filing. Jones got custody of the couple's kids, but he was questioned by police last month about possible abuse. A report claimed jones, an engineer at intel, abused at least one child, though officers saw no signs of wrongdoing on their visit to the family's trailer home. Less than a month later, on sept. 3, the children were reported missing by their mother; on sept. 6, police pulled over jones in mississippi and found him \" high as a kite \" with blood, bleach, and rags in his vehicle, prosecutors say. Police tell nbc news they believe jones killed the children sometime before their mother reported them missing, then \" traveled three states with these children in garbage bags for some period of time, \" the sheriff tells wltx. The new york daily news reports jones will be charged with five counts of murder when he is extradited to south carolina. Autopsies of the bodies begin today. The ap, citing prison documents and a family member, reports that a 19-year-old jones went on a crime spree in illinois in 2001 that included car theft, burglary, drug charges, and more.",

Unlike snakes, the lizards spend most of their lives underground, in an area about the size of a small table, livescience reports — so to find the new species, researchers had to put thousands of pieces of cardboard at various sites in the hopes some of the lizards would make a rare aboveground appearance, surfacing beneath the cardboard. ( they are sometimes spotted underneath dead wood or logs, where the ground is still cool and moist, and the cardboard created these areas. ) the four species are silver-bellied anniella alexanderae, yellow-bellied anniella campi, purple-bellied anniella grinnelli, and anniella stebbinsi, all named after uc berkeley scientists, as one of the researchers is from the university. As the los angeles times explains, snakes are legless lizards, but these four species are not snakes. How are they different? they have movable eyelids, so they can blink; they don't shed their skin in a single piece; some have external ear openings; and they don't \" coil \" or \" slither \" as much, tending to be \" more rigid \" than snakes, says one of the researchers. These four types are small, usually not longer than 8 inches and about as thick around as a pencil.",

        "summary": "Scientists have detected an enormous freshwater \" bulge \" in the arctic ocean. The bulge measures nearly 2,000 cubic miles and has risen some six inches in the last nine years. Researchers speculate that the bulge is the result of strong winds whipping up a clockwise current, raising the water height in a section of the arctic known as the beaufort gyre. The growing \" dome \" was spotted using radar satellites belonging to the european space agency. The water is fresh because it's coming largely from rivers running off the russian side of the arctic basin. The water being whipped into the gyre likely represents about 10 % of all freshwater in the arctic, reports the bbc. A change in the wind could topple the dome, spilling cold freshwater as far as the northern sectors of the atlantic ocean. \" our findings suggest that a reversal of the wind could result in the release of this freshwater to the rest of the arctic ocean and even beyond, \" says the lead author of the new study of the dome, published in nature geoscience. The concern is that the water might disturb currents that have a key influence on weather patterns. The currents draw warm waters up from the tropics, maintaining milder temperatures in winter than would ordinarily be expected at northern european latitudes, and a change in the current could significantly affect temperatures. Researchers also speculate that the gyre may be sucking warmer water up from the depths of the arctic and speed the melting of ice. The dome may be one more unforeseen effect of global warning, scientists speculate.",

            "Continue reading the main story related stories uk scientists have detected a huge dome of fresh water that is developing in the western arctic ocean. The bulge is some 8,000 cubic km in size and has risen by about 15cm since 2002. The team thinks it may be the result of strong winds whipping up a great clockwise current in the northern polar region called the beaufort gyre. This would force the water together, raising sea surface height, the group tells the journal nature geoscience. \" in the western arctic, the beaufort gyre is driven by a permanent anti-cyclonic wind circulation. It drives the water, forcing it to pile up in the centre of the gyre, and this domes the sea surface, \" explained lead author dr katharine giles from the centre for polar observation and modelling ( cpom ) at university college london.

What this implies is that a change in this wind could allow this dome to fall apart, and all the freshwater it contains to spill in the northern sectors of the atlantic ocean. This is where the north atlantic drift – one of the five major oceanic currents – releases heat from the water that heat is then moved eastwards by prevailing winds, heating up the majority of the european continent.

        "summary": "The bloodshed in brooklyn early yesterday brought a horrific end to the career of a band that was huge in tehran's thriving underground rock scene — and a rising star in the us. Yellow dogs members arash and soroush farazmand were shot dead along with occasional vocalist ali eskandarian by a gunman later identified as raefe akhbar, who killed himself after the rampage, the wall street journal reports. Contrary to earlier reports, police say akhbar had not been thrown out of the yellow dogs, but was a former member of the free keys, another iranian rock band that was closely associated with the yellow dogs. He tried to shoot a free keys member during the attack but the singer survived after a struggle in which the magazine of akhbar's gun fell out. The yellow dogs — described as astute, well-informed, and resourceful 20-somethings in a state department cable released by wikileaks — arrived in the us in 2010 and had recently been granted political asylum, the new york times reports. The free keys arrived a year later and stayed for a time at the house shared by the other band, which had become a hub for fellow musicians, several of whom were present when akhbar began his rampage, climbing down from a neighboring roof carrying a rifle in a guitar case. Two yellow dogs members were away and survived the attack, which the band's rep says was sparked by a \" very petty conflict, \" the new york daily news reports. Police say akhbar was kicked out of the free keys last year for allegedly stealing earnings and had been turning up at shows, pestering former bandmates to let him back in.",

The celeb is accused of taking a photo of the naked woman as she changed in the gym's locker room and posting the pic to snapchat with the snarky message: \" if i can't unsee this then you can't either. \" the city attorney's office confirms that the older woman has been located, reports abc news.

Chief leonard campanello's department put up a facebook post with the phone numbers and email addresses of the ceos at five big pharmaceutical companies — eli lilly, abbott labs, merck, johnson &amp; johnson, and pfizer, reports cbs boston. \" now... Don't get mad, \" advises the post. \" just politely ask them what they are doing to address the opioid epidemic in the united states. \" campanello argues that most addicts start out by getting hooked on prescription drugs. \" they can definitely be part of the solution here and i believe they will be.... Might need a little push. \" campanello is familiar with unconventional methods. Earlier this year, after a rash of overdose deaths in his city, he shifted his department's approach to reflect the idea that \" addicts will no longer be treated as criminals, \" sums up the portland press herald. The philosophy emphasizes treatment over prosecution, and while it's a little early to gauge results, the newspaper says the \" radical shift \" has at least sparked a national conversation about the proper approach to addicts. As for the ceo stunt, the daily news of newburyport actually tried all five numbers and ran into a brick wall. The closest thing to a response was someone in the pfizer office referring the call to an industry rep, who said the real problem was with generic drugs, not the one produced by these five companies.

It turns out that a lowly garden snail ( cepaea nemoralis ) found in ireland is genetically different from british ones — but incredibly similar to one species found in southern france and northern spain today. But scientists don't believe snails made the long crawl from the pyrenees some 8,000 years ago. Instead, \" what we're actually seeing might be the long lasting legacy of snails that hitched a ride, accidentally or perhaps as food, as humans traveled from the south of france to ireland, \" the study's co-author said. The christian science monitor spells it out for us: \" this latest research joins a growing body of evidence that the first people of ireland arrived from iberia. \" to get to their conclusion, researchers started with a snail hunt, spending two years amassing samples from across europe with the help of volunteers. They then looked at the mitochondrial dna via muscle samples taken from 880 of the creatures ' feet, the christian science monitor reports. It adds that the snail is among a number of irish species ( it names the strawberry tree and the kerry slug ) that are specific to it and iberia, and the bbc speaks with a population geneticist who says hints of this similarity have been found in humans from the respective regions: \" the genetic patterns are there, but are much weaker.

At some point during the 12-hour drive, seamus suffered a bout of diarrhea and romney hosed down the dog and the car before returning him to the carrier. A new gingrich ad uses a clip from an old interview in which romney defends his treatment of the dog, abc reports. \" this is a completely air-tight kennel, mounted on the top of our car, \" romney says in the ad. \"he was in a kennel at home a great deal of time as well. It was where he was comfortable. \" the seamus story first surfaced during romney's previous white house bid, and neil swidey, the boston globe reporter who unearthed it, says he finds its endurance fascinating.

The city was in lockdown over fears of a paris-style attack at the time. Soldiers slept at the police station for two weeks during the operation. \" when they left, they organised a small party to thank the police in the area, \" police spokesman, johan berckmans, told belgian newspaper la derniere heure ( in french ). \" we have launched an investigation to find out what exactly happened. \" speaking to de standaard ( in dutch ), the spokesman said 15 to 20 soldiers"

Things get worse for respondents over age 55, with a third saying they feel unappreciated at work and a sixth saying they don't have friends at work. \" there comes a time when either you haven't achieved success, work has burned you out, or lived experience tells you family is more important, \" one workplace researcher says. \" you ask yourself: ' what am i doing this for?

Many companies are getting creative with the benefits they offer, focusing on both happiness at work and stress management.

            "House republicans narrowly approved a sweeping overhaul of the nation's food stamp program thursday that would slash about $ 39 billion in funding over the next decade, cut aid to about 4 million americans in the next few years and shift the burden of providing aid to some of the nation's poor to state governments. The gop-backed plan differs sharply from a bipartisan senate proposal passed in june, and its passage will further strain relations between the two chambers as they spend the next several weeks toiling over a short-term budget deal and negotiating over raising the federal debt limit. As those battles begin, thursday's vote is a victory for house majority leader eric i. Cantor ( r-va. ), who orchestrated a strategy this summer to split apart the farm bill to consider funding for food stamps, or the supplemental nutrition assistance program, separately from legislation authorizing crop subsidies and an overhaul of many agricultural and conservation programs. Cantor said the deep cuts enacted thursday were necessary because while most snap recipients need the assistance, there are too many people \"that choose to abuse the system. \" \"frankly it's wrong for hard-working middle-class americans to pay for that, \" cantor said. Rep. Tim huelskamp ( r-kan. ), a strong supporter of the bill, said that stiffer work requirements for certain adults applying for snap funds mean \"you can",

Several democrats warned today that cutting $ 39 billion from the program, formally known as the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ), is a cruel step that would only hurt people in need. The nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated that up to 3.8 million people would lose food stamp benefits next year.

The gop-backed plan differs sharply from a bipartisan senate proposal passed in june, and its passage will further strain relations between the two chambers as they spend the next several weeks toiling over a short-term budget deal and negotiating over raising the federal debt limit. As those battles begin, thursday's vote is a victory for house majority leader eric i. Cantor ( r-va. ), who orchestrated a strategy this summer to split apart the farm bill to consider funding for food stamps, or the supplemental nutrition assistance program, separately from legislation authorizing crop subsidies and an overhaul of many agricultural and conservation programs. Cantor said the deep cuts enacted thursday were necessary because while most snap recipients need the assistance, there are too many people \"that choose to abuse the system. \" \"frankly it's wrong for hard-working middle-class americans to pay for that, \" cantor said. Rep. Tim huelskamp ( r-kan. ), a strong supporter of the bill, said that stiffer work requirements for certain adults applying for snap funds mean \"you can",
            "The house approved legislation thursday that would cut $ 39 billion in funds over the next decade for food stamp programs. Members approved h.r. 3102, the nutrition reform and work opportunity act, in a close 217-210 vote. No democrats voted for the bill, and 15 republicans voted against gop leaders.

Several democrats warned today that cutting $ 39 billion from the program, formally known as the supplemental nutrition assistance program ( snap ), is a cruel step that would only hurt people in need. The nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated that up to 3.8 million people would lose food stamp benefits next year. The vote was expected to be close, as a few republicans had said they were undecided on how to vote. Just a day earlier, house appropriations committee chairman hal rogers ( r-ky. ) said he was \"looking at it, \" and two"

A study in cell biology finds that octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish aren't just surviving but are actually thriving, reports the christian science monitor. The australian researchers looked at 60 years of data from around the world and found \" remarkably consistent \" increases in all three groups, they say in a press release. They don't pinpoint a cause but suggest that it might have something to do with their lifespans of just a year or two, reports science. \" cephalopods are often called ' weeds of the sea ' as they have a unique set of biological traits, including rapid growth, short lifespans, and flexible development, \" says one of the researchers. A colleague uses the more colorful analogy of \" rock stars of the sea \" with the guardian, but the idea's the same: the creatures ' \" live fast, die young \" lifestyle gives them a chance to adapt more quickly than other species. A host of factors may be at play, including overfishing that wipes out competitors or predators, but there's a potential downside: at some point, cephalopods may run out of food and turn to cannibalism. However, it turns out, the results have \" significant and complex implications for both the marine food web and us, \" says the lead author. ( this striking new octopus species was just found. )",

Advertisement the 56-42 vote staves off an election-year rebuke of obama, but will give political ammunition to backers of transcanada corp.'s plan to build a pipeline connecting alberta's massive tar sands projects to gulf coast refineries. Despite obama's efforts, 11 democrats brushed off obama on the vote and sided with republicans. The 11 democratic defections were sens.

            "In the wake of lobbying by president obama and senate democratic leaders, the senate thursday defeated legislation to speed up construction of a u-s.-canadian oil pipeline. The white house victory came after the president started personally calling democratic senators wednesday night. The vote underscored the extent to which rising gas prices and energy supply have become a central political issue. Republicans -- along with the oil industry, which is running a nationwide advertising campaign about energy supplies -- have been attacking obama on the campaign trail for failing to fully exploit traditional oil and gas resources while americans are financially stretched. Democrats and their environmental supporters counter that the president must weigh the benefits of fossil fuels against their environmental impact and the importance of promoting renewable energy. The dispute came to a head thursday afternoon on capitol hill, as the senate considered two competing amendments to a federal transportation bill addressing the keystone xl pipeline extension,",

Kamiyah mobley, taken from her mother's jacksonville hospital room when she was just 8 hours old in 1998, has been found alive and healthy in walterboro, sc. The times-union reports her current identity is being withheld, but it's been revealed she was living with gloria williams, 51, who has been charged with kidnapping and interference with custody. The jacksonville sheriff's office tweets that a recent tip from @missingkids got the ball rolling again. They found a woman with the same birth date in walterboro, and dna tests clinched it. \" we believe the victim may have known she was a kidnapping victim, \" the jso tweeted, though news4jax reports kamiyah grew up believing williams to be her birth mother. The case garnered 2,500 tips over the years, was featured on america's most wanted, and had a $ 250,000 reward attached to it. But there were challenges from the start: no picture had yet been taken of the newborn, so the best police had to go on was a composite sketch. On july 10, 1998, a woman believed by the family to be a nurse told shanara mobley that her newborn needed to be checked for a fever and removed the child from the room. Surveillance video proved to be too grainy to lead to a clear identification of the suspect. Times-union reporter tessa duvall tweets that jacksonville sheriff mike williams says he does not believe williams was on the initial suspects list. First coast news reports shanara mobley sued what was then university medical center and got a $ 1.5 million settlement.",

Not tianna marsh, whose apparent naivete won her a $ 37,000 bmw 1 series ride after she saw an ad in the new zealand herald. The front-page \" april fools'day special \" guaranteed a new beemer to the first lucky taker who brought the ad and their own car as a trade-in to the newmarket dealership today and asked for \" tom, \" per the video bmw nz posted on youtube. So marsh showed up with her 15-year-old nissan avenir at 5: 30 this morning, ready to claim her prize — which the dealership gladly handed over in a reverse-psychology move that may go down as the greatest april fools'day prank ever. \" the ad was intentionally vague and definitely appeared too good to be true, but in this case we wanted to turn the tables and reward the first person who was willing to take the chance, \" a bmw spokesman tells the herald. The dealership had even hired extra security in case people flooded the place, but when tianna walked in, the streets and dealership appeared virtually empty. Confetti flew as the manager handed her the keys to the black car with the license plate \" nof00l \" ( pics are shown on the bmw blog ). As for marsh's former clunker, the dealership says money raised by auctioning it off would go to a charity that provides souped-up ride-on cars for disabled kids to help them move about.

Terrorists, he said, are \" obsessed \" with \" the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight, particularly if it's a us carrier, particularly if it's full of mostly us folks. \" kelly said the us plans to \" raise the bar for, generally speaking, aviation security much higher than it is now. \" the ban now in place affects around 50 flights a day, none of them on us carriers, but there were reports earlier this month that the trump administration was considering expanding it to flights to and from the european union, which would affect around 65 million travelers a year, the ap reports. The airline industry is worried that an expanded ban on electronic devices could lead to a drop in demand, reuters reports, though execs including united's oscar munoz say they are in close contact with homeland security on the issue and have thanked the administration for giving them a \" heads up. \" ( officials say intelligence on al-qaeda led to the original ban. )",

Romney has scored another big win in a midwestern state, but even his \" staunchest allies don't expect him to pick up enough momentum \" to win louisiana on saturday, \" meaning the ' romney can't win the south ' and ' romney can't win conservatives over'storylines \" will linger into april, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. Neither romney nor santorum managed to expand their voter base in illinois, and the low turnout will add fuel to arguments that romney can't excite voters, notes maggie haberman at politico. Santorum's speech \" was a strong reminder of why he resonates with a base that has shown it wants the race to keep going, \" she writes. \" in fact, more than two-thirds of voters in the illinois exits said they want the primary to plow forward. \" romney did well with his core voters but he didn't flip many of santorum's supporters, and the results show he still faces \" sustained opposition from a sizeable bloc of republicans: the rural vote, the socio-economically downscale, and the very conservative, \" writes jay cost at the weekly standard.

            "Mitt romney won a solid victory last night in the land of lincoln. Let's take a close look at how he pulled it off. Throughout this primary battle, we have seen political divisions along some pretty straightforward demographic and ideological lines. Mitt romney has typically done well with urban and suburban voters, as well as socioeconomically upscale voters ( i.e. Those who have college degrees and make more than $ 50,000 a year ). On the other hand, newt gingrich or rick santorum have typically had an advantage among rural voters, socioeconomically downscale voters, and very conservative voters. Layered atop this, romney has done better in primaries than in caucuses, and in the north than the south. So, in many respects, illinois was thus \"bound�? to favor him. It is a northern primary state with a favorable demographic mix for the former massachusetts governor.

Throughout this primary battle, we have seen political divisions along some pretty straightforward demographic and ideological lines. Mitt romney has typically done well with urban and suburban voters, as well as socioeconomically upscale voters ( i.e. Those who have college degrees and make more than $ 50,000 a year ).

        "summary": "Baby boy or baby girl? as of today, parents in germany have the option of choosing neither, leaving the gender spot on their newborn's birth certificate blank if the baby's sex can't be determined. As many as one in 2,000 people are born with ambiguous genitalia, and the new law basically creates a third gender category for \" indeterminate \" or \" intersex \" people, the bbc reports. Currently, passport holders in the country are listed as either m ( male ) or f ( female ); with this change, a third option will be added: x ( intersex ). Individuals whose gender is left blank at birth can choose later to become male or female, or can remain intersex, der spiegel reports. Germany, the first european country to make such an allowance, reviewed cases of intersex babies and found that many who were subjected to sex assignment surgery at a young age ended up unhappy. The law is an attempt to relax the pressure on parents, who may feel forced to make a quick decision about gender and surgery. But the wall street journal explains the law's wording could actually have the unplanned effect of pushing parents toward surgery. It reads that if a male or female gender can't be assigned, the child \" shall be entered without such information in the register of births. \" some fear that might lead stigma-wary parents to request surgery that would allow for a definitive determination of sex. Another fear: that intersex people won't have \" a space... To be themselves, \" as one lgbt activist points out to afp, noting that schools separate things like bathrooms and sports activities by gender.",

The nasa spacecraft successfully completed a harrowing 30-minute \" orbital insertion \" into mars ' orbit last night, the ap reports. \" i don't have any fingernails any more, but we've made it, \" says the deputy director for science at goddard space flight center in greenbelt, md. Scientists have big plans for the explorer: it's going to be the first mission to study the martian upper atmosphere from orbit — it's not meant to land on the surface — in advance of nasa's ambitious plans to send astronauts to mars in the 2030s. Maven isn't the only new addition to the martian skies: as space.com notes, india's mars orbiter mission is set to arrive on the scene tomorrow night. Researchers believe mars used to be a \" warm and wet \" planet billions of years ago and that it may have even sustained microbial life, but they're not sure what sucked all of the water off the planet's surface and eliminated carbon dioxide from its atmosphere ( one theory is the sun stripped the planet clean ). The school-bus-sized maven — short for mars atmosphere and volatile evolution mission — will spend at least a year hovering as low as 78 miles over the planet's surface, using eight high-tech instruments to gather info and even observe the siding spring comet that's set to zip by on oct. 19. Meanwhile, curiosity and another rover set to launch in 2020 are designed to bring mars samples back to earth and try to make oxygen out of carbon dioxide — a process that would help human explorers survive on mars, the ap notes. \" this really is a quest of humanity, \" nasa's head of science missions says.",

        "summary": "When the fed made the surprising announcement last week that it would not ease up on its bond purchases, it looks like some traders may have gotten an early leak of the news — and such a leak may have helped them make quite a bit of money. The washington post and mother jones break it down: the fed announcement was made at exactly 2pm according to washington's national atomic clock. It should have taken the information 7 milliseconds to reach chicago. Instead, a few \" massive \" orders — betting correctly on the fed decision — were placed in chicago exchanges just 1 to 3 milliseconds later. ( the orders were for gold futures contracts; the price of gold jumped after the announcement. ) according to market analysis firm nanex, $ 600 million in assets could have changed hands in those few extra milliseconds before other chicago traders had the information. The news was first reported by cnbc and quartz. So what happened? it's still not clear. The media got an early look at the data, but reporters were in a secure room and not allowed to communicate with anyone outside until exactly 2pm. Even so, the post speculates it could have been a leak from either the media or the fed itself, or perhaps a technical glitch. The fed says it's contacting media organizations to make sure the lock-up rules are understood. Nanex's founder believes a single actor is responsible for the early orders. \" this is not a bad technology case. This is a somebody's-hand-is-in-the-cookie-jar case, \" he says. \" the fed news was leaked to, or known by, a large wall street firm who made the decision to pre-program their trading machines in both new york and chicago and wait until precisely 2pm when they would buy everything available. \"",

        "summary": "Surgery on babies still in the womb has long largely been restricted to those who would die otherwise, but a landmark study is likely to lead to a surge of research into fetal surgery to treat birth defects. Surgeons found that repairing spina bifida — a debilitating spinal condition that 1,500 babies are born with annually — in the womb helps avoid the brain damage and paralysis that often result when the condition isn't treated until after birth, npr reports. During the surgery, doctors operate on a four-inch long fetus, putting a protruding, roughly raisin-size piece of spinal cord back inside the fetus's body. The study reviewed 183 pregnancies, and found that children who had the surgery before birth were twice as likely to walk unaided later: at age 3, 42 % could walk, versus 21 % who did not have the prenatal operation. \" this is the first time that fetal surgery has ever been attempted and validated for what we think of as a non-fatal birth defect, \" says one of the study's authors. There were medical downsides for both mothers and infants ( for instance, 80 % of the babies who had the surgery were delivered prematurely, compared to 15 % of those who did not ), but experts describe the study as a huge step in the right direction, the new york times notes.",

        "summary": "An ohio man with a long rap sheet was taken into custody early monday after a danville cop was found shot dead and his police cruiser and gun missing, nbc news reports. Officer thomas cottrell was on duty late sunday when a disturbing call came into the knox county dispatch center around 11: 20pm, per wcmh: a woman told dispatchers her ex had left with weapons and was looking to kill a police officer. After trying to contact cottrell by radio, sheriff's officers went out in search of him, first finding cottrell's bloody hat, per wbns — and then his body, just before midnight behind a municipal building. Cottrell, one of six officers in the tiny danville pd, had been shot to death, and his body was found without his gun or cruiser. The cruiser was later found a half-mile away, reports fox news. Herschel jones was seen sprinting from a residence about an hour and a half later and was briefly pursued by cops on foot and taken into custody. Per cbs news, jones has been named the prime suspect in the killing, but it's unclear whether jones — charged previously for breaking and entering, burglary, and carrying a concealed weapon, among other infractions — has been charged, nbc notes. He was jailed for four years after a 2011 conviction for receiving stolen property and illegal possession of chemicals. Meanwhile, danville mourns one of its men in blue. \" [ our ] members … are heartbroken this morning as we learn about the tragic murder of officer thomas cottrell, \" reads a monday morning post on the fraternal order of police of ohio's facebook page. \" his assassination is the latest reminder of how dangerous police work is and how the police are targeted for violence. \" ( this case sounds nothing like a recent police shooting in illinois. )",

Per local media, firefighters responding to a call of a child locked in a car saturday in the city of yiwu found the boy — ided as 17 months old, though the straits times says he's 3 — \" sitting in the driver's seat of the car, crying and prying at the glass, \" the journal notes. Locksmiths were already trying to open the door to save the boy, who had reportedly been trapped by that point for about an hour. But as the boy's condition appeared to worsen, firefighters mentioned breaking the windows, and a witness tells the straits times the boy's mom balked at that idea, pleading with firefighters to let the locksmiths keep trying instead. The firefighters, however, opted to smash the window and retrieve the child. Comments on china's weibo site were not kind. \" looks like the car window is her real son, \" one user posted, per the straits times, while the journal cites another commenter saying, \" the answer is simple: first smash up the parents, then smash the glass. \" the outrage may also be tied to deep-seated biases against drivers of luxury cars in china: according to a survey last year, \" chinese drivers of bmw cars are seen as newly rich, materialistic showoffs by drivers of other luxury brands, \" the journal notes. The mom has since told local media that she tried to break the window herself and that she simply didn't want the breaking glass to scare or hurt her child. And not everyone's blaming her. \" some journalists know that'dog bites man ' isn't really news, so they try to rewrite it as ' man bites dog, ' \" one weibo user wrote this morning.

Sure, karen handel in georgia and ralph norman in south carolina come to mind, but the new york times points out another: crown prince mohammed bin salman of saudi arabia. It wasn't an election, of course, but he was named the new successor to the throne in his country, and the times explains how mohammed has emerged as an important ally of the trump administration. One sign: the 31-year-old dined at the home of jared kushner and ivanka trump on a visit to dc, then returned the favor by hosting them on their visit to saudi arabia. Among other things, he favors a hard line against iran and is leading the saudi move to punish qatar for its purported support of terrorism. Other coverage of the prince: fast rise: mohammed effectively assumed control of the nation's economic and defense policies in 2015, the same year his father took the throne, reports marketwatch. Given that his father is 81, his ascension to crown prince raises the prospect that saudi arabia might have a king in the not-too-distant future who would rule for decades.
