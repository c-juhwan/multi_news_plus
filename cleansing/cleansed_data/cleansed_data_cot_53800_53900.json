Borch, 21, knew immediately that something was wrong with the raccoon that was charging toward her. \" imagine the tasmanian devil, \" she tells the bangor daily news of the \" terrifying \" june 3 incident. Yanking out her headphones, she began \" dancing \" around the animal on the narrow path, but she tells the herald she knew that, one way or another, the animal was going to bite her. She figured her hands would be the best spot, so she offered them up. The raccoon chomped down on her thumb and stayed there, scratching at her legs and arms as she screamed. Now on her knees, she spotted her phone lying submerged in a mud puddle, and had an idea: drown it. \" with my thumb in its mouth, i just pushed its head down into the muck, \" she tells the news. When the raccoon finally stopped moving, she yanked out her finger and raced the three-quarters of a mile home. Two days later, the state confirmed the animal was infected with rabies. Borch got rabies shots, and an animal control officer adds an unpleasant footnote: the infected raccoon may not be alone. \" not to scare people, \" heidi blood tells the news, but \" when there's one, there's typically another. \" ( normally nocturnal like raccoons, a crazed beaver attacked a woman paddle-boarder. )",

        "summary": "It seems becoming a vegetarian and staying a vegetarian are two very different things. A whopping 84 % of vegetarians end up eating meat again, and most people shift back within a single year, according to a new study. Specifically, 53 % of vegetarians are meat-eaters again within 12 months, while more than 30 % go back to meat within three months, the huffington post reports. Of the 11,000 people studied, 2 % were vegetarians, 10 % former vegetarians, and 88 % lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the smithsonian reports. Some 35 % of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, skeptoid reports. \" i will take a dead cow over anemia anytime, \" says one respondent. And in the guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \" every cell in my body screaming ' protein — that's what you need. ' \" perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as co.exist reports them: \" a message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption. \" ( read about a veggie burger that \" bleeds \" like meat. )",

Things came together in that carell interview, in which he peppers mccain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, carell says, \" i was just kidding! i don't even know what that means! \" and the tense moment subsides.

        "summary": "The case of the renoir supposedly purchased at a flea market for $ 7 in 2009 continues to unspool dramatically: now the washington post finds three witnesses who say on the shore of the seine hung in marcia fouquet's virginia home in the 1980s and 1990s. That would seem to dispute the story fouquet's daughter, martha ( or marcia, depending on which article you're reading ) fuqua, has given about her lucky find. The painting was discovered to have been stolen from a baltimore museum in 1951, and now fuqua is fighting to hold onto it. Robert musser, who dated and lived with fouquet in the 1980s, recalls the small, ornately-framed painting adorned with renoir's name on a small plaque attached to the frame. \" she said it came from a museum in baltimore, \" he says. \" she said it was a real renoir, that she owned a renoir.... She never told me how she acquired it. \" he assumed it was a fake. An anonymous childhood friend of fuqua's says the mother and daughter showed her the painting in fouquet's studio in the 1990s and said it was a real renoir. \" i didn't ask where it came from because i just assumed they were lying, \" she says, but the \" unusual \" frame and renoir plaque stuck in her memory. Bobby j. Fontaine, a former student of fouquet's who lived with the family for a time, also remembered fouquet showing him the painting in the 1990s. \" she says,'do you think it's real or not? ' \" he recalls. \" i told her, ' i guess it's real. ' \" but they spoke no more about it. This follows last month's news that a few months before fuqua claimed to have found the renoir at a flea market, she took it to be appraised at an auction house — where she reportedly told an art specialist that she had gotten it from an estate.",

        "summary": "When erin and marianne krupa decided they wanted to start a family five years ago, they moved from north carolina to new jersey in search of a less conservative environment. Little did they know they were about to hit upon a state insurance mandate from 2001 that they say specifically discriminates against same-sex couples trying to conceive: in new jersey, most women under 35 must prove infertility by having had \" two years of unprotected sexual intercourse \" before their insurance providers are required to cover fertility treatments, reports the new york times. Soon after they visited fertility doctors, erin learned in 2013 that she is infertile due to endometriosis and benign cysts on her uterus. But their insurance provider has denied coverage of most treatments the couple has gone through, which means they've spent nearly $ 50,000 so far in their quest to have a child. Now they're suing the state. \" it's completely discriminatory, \" reproductive endocrinologist dr. Jane miller tells wabc-tv. And while only two other women are joining the krupas in the lawsuit, shannon minter of the national center for lesbian rights tells the new jersey law journal that \" these denials are extremely common \" and \" we expect to see many more [ legal challenges ]. \" one of the plaintiffs ' attorneys says that the law in new jersey is especially discriminatory in its language about exposure to sperm through intercourse. New york and connecticut, for instance, require exposure but don't specify how, while legislation in california and maryland requires infertility treatment be covered regardless of sexual orientation. As for the krupas, marianne has since gone through her own fertility treatments, but has miscarried twice. Both women are still trying. ( these two common surgeries may make women more fertile. )",

Top commanders are considering such cuts as they deal with a decreasing budget, the joint chiefs of staff chair said this weekend. While acknowledging that \" we can't pay [ soldiers ] enough, \" gen. Martin dempsey added, \" we also have an institution to manage. \" no specifics have been revealed; details will be released along with the proposed military budget in february, the wall street journal reports. Dempsey did say benefits wouldn't be immediately cut, no changes will be made to the retirement system, and that the plan is a multi-year effort to slow down compensation. Pay and benefits will soon make up 60 % of the military budget ( currently, the cost of military personnel is about 50 % of the budget ), meaning that if they're not curbed, there won't be enough money for new weapons or training within the decade, dempsey said. Defense secretary chuck hagel and president obama must approve the plan, then congress, and so far it's not looking too popular with lawmakers. The news comes days after a congressional budget office report that said cutting military pay is one of many options to reduce the budget deficit, military.com reports.",

            "Military members, retirees and veterans have a few more reasons to be wary of politicians who say their top priority is to cut federal spending. The congressional budget office on wednesday released a report of more than 100 options for reducing budget deficits. It's a timely product as house and senate conferees strive to negotiate by mid-december a new debt-cutting deal to replace automatic budget cuts of sequestration. More than a few of the cbo options are fresh ideas to roll back compensation for categories of veterans or to raise tricare fees for military retirees, on suggestions that the government is being too generous. To be fair, cbo is not singling out veterans here. There are options in the report to make nervous many segments of society dependent on federal payments, from social security recipients to drug manufacturers. But for select veterans ' programs, cbo makes some hard-edged points that lawmakers bent on cutting spending might find compelling, if not persuasive, to help address the nation's debt crisis. Here are some of those ideas: cap military pay raises – from 2000 through 2010, congress approved basic pay raises that averaged a half percentage point above private sector wage growth. The military could save $ 25 billion from 2015 to 2023 by reversing course, capping raises yearly at.5 percent below civilian wage growth. Cbo predicts only a \" minor \" effect on force retention. Evidence in favor of this move are data showing cash compensation for enlisted members now exceeds wages of 90 percent of civilian counterparts, well above the defense department's goal of keeping service pay ahead of 70 percent of civilians of similar age and educational background. Cbo says officer compensation exceeds 86 percent of private sector peers. The case against capping raises is that recruiting and retention goals could be compromised, cbo says, and smaller raises also dampen other elements of military compensation including retirement annuities. Raise tricare fees – cbo floats two options to have military retirees pay more for health care. One is to have tricare-for-life users -- retirees, spouses and survivors age 65 and older -- pay the first $ 550 of costs not covered by medicare and then 50 percent of the next $ 4950.

California's secretary of state agreed to allow a group called yes california to begin collecting signatures for a ballot measure, reports the los angeles times. If 585,407 are collected by july 25 — a high hurdle for the relatively small group — a proposal will land on the 2018 ballot to erase lines in the state constitution outlining california as \" an inseparable part of the united states \" and the us constitution as the \" supreme law of the land. \" if passed, it would set up a 2019 vote on whether california should become \" a free, sovereign and independent country. \" even if that passed, huge hurdles remain. Secession would require a constitutional amendment, with two-thirds support in both the us house and senate and ratification by at least 38 states. \" it's basically impossible, \" notes a post at new york. The idea of a \" calexit \" has been in the works since 2014, but the wall street journal notes that it got a boost after donald trump's election as a mostly jokey way to register opposition. Seems nuts? \" i think we'd have the votes today, \" says a group co-founder, who argues that california gives the federal government more money than it receives and is \" culturally \" separate from the rest of the country. \" america already hates california, and america votes on emotions. \" adds a rep for the california national party, which supports secession in the long-term but not the current effort, \" it's certainly as likely as donald trump becoming president. \" ( the movement already has a moscow \" embassy \". )",

        "summary": "Stephen allwine allegedly had no moral objection to sleeping with women other than his wife, but he was opposed to divorce — or, at least, his church was. It's for that reason that he tried to arrange his wife's murder through the dark web and finally killed her himself when no other killer appeared, prosecutors allege. At the start of allwine's murder trial in minnesota this week, prosecutors claimed the united church of god elder began having affairs through the ashley madison website, which he learned about while counseling married couples at church, reports the minneapolis star tribune. Since his church views marriage as a lifelong commitment, per the washington post, prosecutors believe the then-43-year-old allwine decided his wife should be killed and paid $ 6,000 in bitcoin to dark web site besa mafia, which claimed a link to organized crime. Though law enforcement officials now suspect besa mafia was a scam, they warned the couple that user \" dogdaygod \" was plotting amy allwine's death. Stephen allwine then bought a gun, which was found next to his wife's body in the couple's cottage grove home three months later on nov. 13, 2016. Prosecutors say allwine drugged amy, 43, with scopolamine, shot her in the head, and staged the scene to look like a suicide — failing to erase gun residue from his hand and traces of blood leading from the scene. A computer search also linked him to \" dogdaygod, \" prosecutors say. Allwine's defense attorney, on the other hand, says the prosecution has only theories and alleges police contaminated the scene by moving the gun before photos were taken, per the pioneer press. \" just because he had an affair doesn't mean he killed his wife, \" he says of his client, per the post.",

The dark overlord told the ap in february they wouldn't release any of the stolen episodes; it's unclear why that changed.

At issue is the fact that the companies — limebike, spin, and bird — started operating three weeks ago without approval from the city, and city authorities say the electric scooters can be dangerous. \" we cannot overstate the public safety hazard that operating motorized scooters pose on city sidewalks, \" said city attorney dennis herrera in a cease-and-desist letter to the companies monday, per slate. The letter ordered the companies to stop operating until a plan was in place to make sure customers stop riding on sidewalks and without helmets or drivers licenses, and stop parking in places that block sidewalks, ramps, and transit stops. ( they don't require a docking station and can thus be left anywhere when riders are done using them, the ap reports. ) techcrunch says the letter didn't \" seem to be making any difference, \" as scooters from all three companies were spotted on san francisco streets tuesday. The board of supervisors is looking to put a permitting process in place for the scooter companies similar to the one that exists for bike-sharing companies operating in the city; it hopes to have the process in place by may 1. It also plans to establish fines starting at $ 125 when scooter regulations are violated.",

Quartz points out that the low-fat mayo market has doubled since 2005 as americans look for healthier options.

The spot ( see it below ), by cramer-krasselt in chicago, is heavy on images of feel-good americana, as police officers, campers, bridesmaids and tailgaters hum the tune to \" if you're happy and you know it \" — punctuating each line not by clapping hands but by slapping the bottom of their ketchup bottles, trying to get the ketchup out. The ad isn't overly sentimental. Rather, it features several comic moments — including one in which a hot-dog vendor appears to end up in a full-body cast after spilling ketchup on some mobsters. And in the final scene, a grandmother looks mildly horrified after making a long farting sound while squeezing the last ketchup out of a plastic bottle.

Americans bought $ 2 billion worth of mayonnaise last year, compared to $ 725 million in ketchup, according to market-research firm euromonitor.

            "Heinz ketchup walks the line between humorous and heartfelt in its first super bowl ad in 16 years, an extended version of which hit the web thursday. The spot ( see it below ), by cramer-krasselt in chicago, is heavy on images of feel-good americana, as police officers, campers, bridesmaids and tailgaters hum the tune to \" if you're happy and you know it \" — punctuating each line not by clapping hands but by slapping the bottom of their ketchup bottles, trying to get the ketchup out. The ad isn't overly sentimental. Rather, it features several comic moments — including one in which a hot-dog vendor appears to end up in a full-body cast after spilling ketchup on some mobsters. And in the final scene, a grandmother looks mildly horrified after making a long farting sound while squeezing the last ketchup out of a plastic bottle. The tagline is, \" where there's happy, it has to be heinz. \" the hashtag is #ifyourehappy. The",

After beating the green bay packers at home for the second time in four years, they only hope this trip ends the same way — at the super bowl. Manning threw three touchdown passes and the giants shocked the packers 37-20 in an nfc divisional playoff game today. Manning threw for 330 yards, sending the giants to san francisco for the nfc championship game next sunday night. More from today's football games: the san francisco 49ers beat the new orleans saints in a thrilling 36-32 game today. With new orleans poised to score on its opening possession, donte whitner delivered a crushing blow that knocked out running back pierre thomas and forced the first of five saints turnovers. San francisco's hard-hitting, opportunistic defense set the tone the same way it has all season, putting the 49ers back in the nfc championship for the first time since the 1997 season. If style points and offensive fireworks meant anything, the baltimore ravens wouldn't stand a chance of making it to the afc championship. Playing defense and protecting the football are what they do best, and that formula led to a 20-13 victory over the houston texans today, putting baltimore in the afc title game against the new england patriots next sunday, with the winner advancing to the super bowl in indianapolis on feb. 5.",

The researchers classified that temperature change as \" significant. \" such sympathetic coldness could be an adaptive trait, says lead researcher dr.

The \" cold \" clips showed blocks of ice throughout, whereas the \" hot \" ones only briefly showed steam at their start. \" there is also some evidence to suggest that people may be more sensitive to others appearing cold than hot, \" he points out.

        "summary": "Looking for the perfect cheese for the ultimately gooey, perfectly melted grilled cheese sandwich? good news: scientists with the american chemical society have put out a three-minute video from the society's \" reactions \" series on youtube all about that very subject. And the winners are... Gouda, gruyére, or manchego, with mild cheeses melting more beautifully than sharp. It's all about how casein proteins clump together ( the resulting spheres are called micelles ) when cheese melts. These micelles, which are held together by calcium and are gloriously fatty, are negatively charged, meaning those tiny balls bounce apart. Add lactic acid, however, which goes up the longer a cheese ages, and those micelles smack together, trapping water and getting all gooey, reports consumerist. But wait, there's more. The older the cheese, the more lactic acid, which in turn lowers the cheese's ph — thus sharper cheeses have a lower ph and mild ones a higher ph. The ideal ph, in fact, is right between 5.3 and 5.5, with cheese of lower ph releasing their oils when heated and getting clumpy. This is why gouda, gruyére, or manchego are ideal but on the milder side; if they age too long and become sharper, the ph dips too low and the cheese breaks down more easily, meaning you could end up with a curdled mess while heating it.

The retired south korean general, who the financial times reports led his country's special forces, spoke to a london-based think tank wednesday and outlined exactly what american forces would encounter should we decide to bloody the country's nose — or something more significant. He doesn't mince words: \" i try to explain to the americans — if we have to go into north korea,... It's not going to be like toppling [ saddam ) hussein ]. This would be more like trying to get rid of allah. \" he describes the country as \" one huge barracks \" and the population as militarized far beyond the [ west's ] imagination. \" a 14-year-old child in north korea probably gets more than 100 hours of military training a year, \" the times of london quotes chun as saying. \" by age 14, a child knows how to fire an ak47, fire an rpg, throw a grenade, pitch a tent and march 24 hours. \" and even things that may seem promising on their face — the north's estimated 1,000 fighter jets are aged — aren't, per chun, who says those planes would be used kamikaze-style, usa today reports. And there's not just the physical battlefield to contend with, per the brisbane times: \" north korean cyber capability is right below nuclear capability in terms of threat, \" says chun. He also describes an extreme system designed to root out any dissent, whereby the country's families are grouped in units, and if one person \" misbehaves, the entire five or 10 families go to the gulag or are executed. So everybody spies on everybody else. \"",

But boone says he was nothing more than a celebrity spokesman for the would-be ship, and he doesn't seem too concerned about the whole thing, saying he does plan to get himself to court and telling tmz, \" is this the way lindsay lohan and robert downey got so famous? \"",

Masahiro ono tried to use to \" jolt the new heart into rhythm \" wasn't working; he said he had to pump it by hand for 10 minutes until a working one was found. The donor heart was damaged and weakened as a result and wouldn't strengthen; it was eventually swapped for an artificial heart. Then came strokes, infection in lewis ' bloodstream, and what the family says was another equipment mishap that left him brain-dead. Read the full story here.",

            "Zebra is the american medical slang for arriving at an exotic medical diagnosis when a more commonplace explanation is more likely. [ 1 ] it is shorthand for the aphorism coined in the late 1940s by dr. Theodore woodward, professor at the university of maryland school of medicine, who instructed his medical interns: \" when you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras \". [ 2 ] since horses are common in maryland while zebras are relatively rare, logically one could confidently guess that an animal making hoofbeats is probably a horse. By 1960, the aphorism was widely known in medical circles. [ 3 ] as explained by sotos, [ 4 ] medical novices are predisposed to make rare diagnoses because of ( a ) the availability heuristic ( \" events more easily remembered are judged more probable \" ) and ( b ) the phenomenon first enunciated in rhetorica ad herennium ( circa 85 bc ), \" the striking and the novel stay longer in the mind. \" thus, the aphorism is an important caution against these biases when teaching medical students to weigh medical evidence. Diagnosticians have noted, however, that \" zebra \" -type diagnoses must nonetheless be held in mind until the evidence conclusively rules them out: in making the diagnosis of the cause of illness in an individual case, calculations of probability have no meaning.

            "We all know commercials are produced to make money. But after watching the latest budweiser commercial set to air during the super bowl, i feel like not only supporting the brand, but hugging whoever was in charge of the ad. In the ad, entitled \" flash fans, \" the producers of budweiser tell two port credit, ontario beer-league hockey teams that they are shooting a documentary of them as they get set to play against one another. Instead, they fill an entire empty arena with die-hard fans covered in body paint and holding thundersticks and banners. The look on the players ' faces is priceless. Obviously, budweiser's main goal is to sell beer. However, there are ways to go about it that can actually be inspirational. These were two teams planning on once again playing in front of an empty arena. Instead, they experienced what the pros experience. Judging by the 4-3 overtime score, they may have played above expectations. Said one player, \" not that i was ever in the professional leagues anywhere.

The bill was backed by police because drivers \" will be more likely to have been tested, to have insurance, or to know the rules of the road, \" says lapd chief charlie beck. But a note of caution comes from new mexico, one of 10 states that already issues such licenses. \" it's been a disaster, \" says the state's secretary for taxation and revenue. \" we have had a lot of identity fraud. \"",

The presidential also-ran is said to be part of a group — along with former new york yankee derek jeter — that will be purchasing the miami marlins for $ 1.3 billion, bloomberg reports. Nothing is official — an anonymous source says the sale contract hasn't been signed yet — but the miami herald confirmed the report. Bush and jeter, as well as at least three other investors, are said to have outbid multiple other groups, including one led by tagg romney and former ballplayer tom glavine. The kushner family had also reportedly been close to a deal. Bush, who tried and failed to buy the marlins three years ago, will reportedly be the \" control person \" in charge of franchise decisions for the marlins. The deal would need mlb approval and could still take months to finalize. The marlins are owned by jeffrey loria, who paid $ 158 million for the team in 2002. Despite losing money and having some of the worst attendance in the league, the marlins are currently valued at $ 940 million. If the reported $ 1.3 billion purchase price is accurate, it would be \" one of the most lucrative franchise flips \" ever, deadspin reports. Loria is apparently selling the marlins in order to get his estate in order — and also because he's tired of the team's constant losing and the criticism that has brought on him.",

The la times reports that the accident began when driver jay howard lost control of his vehicle a little more than a quarter into the 200-lap race.

A video graphic behind putin showed a missile taking off from russia, zooming across the atlantic to south america, then turning north toward the us, reports the washington post. \" i hope everything that has been said today will sober any potential aggressor, \" putin said, without naming names. He added that russia had developed the nuclear-capable weapon, which \" missile defenses will be useless against, \" despite skepticism about moscow's abilities. \" nobody listened to us, \" he said, per nbc news. \" well listen to us now. \" putin, who asserted that moscow has \" no plans to be an aggressor, \" also said russia had a new underwater drone capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, reports the ap. And he declared that any use of nuclear weapons against one of its allies — again, he did not mention specific nations — would be considered a nuclear attack on russia and that moscow would respond in kind. All in all, the two-hour speech suggested \" a new arms race \" between russia and the west, observes the guardian. The speech comes less than three weeks before putin is expected to easily win another six-year term, reports the bbc. He used much of the address to focus on economic reforms, promising among other things to reduce the rate of poverty by half in the next six years.",

Luis vargas, 46, broke down when an la superior court judge granted a petition to release him from his sentence of 55 years to life for three sex crimes. The move came after dna evidence linked those assaults to a serial attacker known as the teardrop rapist, so labeled for having a teardrop tattoo under his eye, the ap notes. That man, who was never caught, is suspected of having committed about three dozen crimes in the la area. Vargas had matched assailant descriptions, and he caught investigators ' eye because he had a faded teardrop tattoo under his left eye and a 1992 rape conviction involving his girlfriend at the time, reports the los angeles times. \" you can sentence me to all the years you want, but... That individual that really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there, \" vargas warned a judge before he was sentenced in 1999. In 2012, vargas reached out to the california innocence project and asked to use dna techniques to examine samples on the clothing of one of his alleged victims, per the times. The dna matched that of the victim and the teardrop rapist. The three victims had positively ided vargas as the perpetrator, but an innocence project attorney tells the ap it was a \" shaky witness \" case, an assertion the la district attorney's office backed up in a recent court letter that said there were discrepancies and uncertainties in their identification of the rapist, the times notes. Vargas still has to clear up some immigration issues before he's fully released, but he hopes to be home by christmas.",

According to the huffington post, the list contained personal information about more than 60 people pulled from an official document of individuals who signed up to speak at a city council debate on \" limiting muslim influence \" earlier this year. \"this is the first time i've been slightly alarmed, \" the head of a local islamic group tells the morning news. \" they were just being good citizens to show up and be a part of the democratic process. Now they are targets. \" david wright led the armed protest outside the irving islamic center last weekend and appears to be behind the list, which has since been removed from facebook, the morning news reports. While wright's organization, bair, states its intention isn't to intimidate anyone, people whose names were on the list say it couldn't have been meant for any other reason than to put a target on their backs. The washington post quotes a number of facebook posts from wright this week, including, \" we like to have guns designed to kill people that pose a threat in a very efficient manner, \" and \" my gun is an assault weapon... It's a weapon designed to assault people not animals. \" the list may have backfired: the morning news notes rsvps for a pro-muslim rally scheduled for saturday at the mosque had more than doubled in 24 hours.",

The bbc reports jane wilson and her husband gary were hiking on tryfan in wales when it started to get dark and they decided to skip the summit. While attempting to descend the mountain, gary was looking at an ordnance survey app while jane went a short way ahead to make sure the path was safe, according to the telegraph. The manchester evening news reports gary heard his wife fall, got to safety, and called for help. Rescuers found the 53-year-old librarian's body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff with a fractured skull. At a hearing friday, jane's was ruled an accidental death due, in part, to using an app instead of a map. \" apart from potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map, batteries on mobile phones have a nasty habit of running out just when you need them most, \" the telegraph quotes a spokesperson for mountain rescue england and wales as saying. A detective says the app map \" would have been small and not as detailed \" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest. A director with ordnance survey says hikers should always use the app in conjunction with an actual map \" due to the nature of mobile devices when navigating the real world. \" authorities also say jane wasn't wearing appropriate footwear for the hike.

Some stats backing up the \" too easy \" refrain, per the center for american progress: 37 % of 4th-graders find their math work too easy 29 % of 8th-graders find that subject too easy as well, as do 51 % of civics students and 57 % of history students and the trend doesn't stop at middle school. In terms of civics and history, 56 % and 55 % of 12th-graders said the same thing, respectively; 21 % said ditto about math and some of the intel gathered on the amount of work kids do seems to back this up: nearly a third of 8th-graders say they read less than five pages a day... In school or as homework. A third also say they write lengthy answers on reading tests two times a year — or less.

        "summary": "An 8-year-old boy in canada never had any problems eating salmon or peanuts. Then, within just a few weeks of getting a blood transfusion as part of his treatment for brain cancer, he ate salmon and experienced a severe allergic reaction within 10 minutes. The same thing happened when he ate a chocolate peanut butter cup four days later. Doctors determined he was suffering from transfusion-borne allergies, and wrote about it in the canadian medical association journal. A piece in scientific american calls the case \" extremely rare. \" but with allergies so common, why is that, well, the case? such a reaction can only occur if three factors are in place, explains scientific american. The donor must first have high levels of the type of immunoglobulin-e ( ige ) antibodies that set off allergic reactions. The patient must then receive a significant amount of that blood and, within a few months, be exposed to the allergen the ige antibodies would react to. That's because — in good news for this 8-year-old and others like him — the ige antibodies eventually disappear from the blood because the recipients don't produce the same antibodies on their own. In this case, the boy was again eating fish and peanut butter six months later. Scientific american points out that antibody-transfer is usually a good thing, as it helps guard against infection. And avoiding a situation like this is tough, livescience reports. Having allergies doesn't disqualify would-be donors ( in either the us or canada ), and having a high level of ige in the blood doesn't always correlate with experiencing allergies.

The 8-year-old boy had no history of being allergic to any foods, and was undergoing treatment for medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer. A few weeks after receiving a blood transfusion, he experienced a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis within 10 minutes of eating salmon, according to the report, published online today ( april 7 ) in the canadian medical association journal. His doctors suspected that the blood transfusion had triggered the reaction, they wrote in the report. After treating the patient with a drug containing antihistamines, the doctors advised him to avoid fish and to carry an epinephrine injector in case he had another reaction. [ 9 weirdest allergies ] but four days later, the boy was back in the emergency department after eating a chocolate peanut butter cup.

            "A boy in canada mysteriously became allergic to fish and nuts after he received a blood transfusion, according to a new case report. The 8-year-old boy had no history of being allergic to any foods, and was undergoing treatment for medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer. A few weeks after receiving a blood transfusion, he experienced a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis within 10 minutes of eating salmon, according to the report, published online today ( april 7 ) in the canadian medical association journal. His doctors suspected that the blood transfusion had triggered the reaction, they wrote in the report. After treating the patient with a drug containing antihistamines, the doctors advised him to avoid fish and to carry an epinephrine injector in case he had another reaction. [ 9 weirdest allergies ] but four days later, the boy was back in the emergency department after eating a chocolate peanut butter cup.

And the flub this time was obama's. While reciting the phrase \" the office of the president of the united states, \" he effectively choked on the last word, saying just \" sta —, \" and making a little face after doing so. In other oath-taking tidbits, the president placed his hand on two bibles: one abraham lincoln's and the other martin luther king's. ( prof. Cornel west wasn't thrilled about the latter choice, notes the national review: west slammed the use of king's \" prophetic fire as just a moment in presidential pageantry. \" ) joe biden, meanwhile, again took the oath from justice sonia sotomayor, the wall street journal notes.

Lawyers for albany's nite moves will appear before the state's highest court today to argue that it doesn't need to pay sales tax on admission fees or lap dances, reports the ap. The club claims the dances are exempt under part of the tax code covering \" live dramatic or musical arts performances \" — and it has a cultural anthropologist as an expert witness. Before a lower court, the anthropologist testified that she had observed \" choreographic patterns of exotic dance \" at the club, noting that one dancer executed 61 moves in the course of three songs, the wall street journal reports. The tax department, however, argued that a nude dancer is not \" engaged in a genuine choreographic dance performance when she removes her clothing. \" whatever the court decides may not have much impact on other establishments, since nite moves only serves non-alcoholic drinks, putting it under a different part of the tax code than most other strip clubs.",

For white women, the rate was 47 % higher. \" this shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared, \" dr. Kathleen m. Schmeler tells the times. New research in the journal cancer excluded from death rates women who had undergone hysterectomies; previous research had included them even though they were not at risk because their cervixes were removed. Last year, there were 12,990 new cases of cervical cancer in the us, and 4,120 deaths, per the national cancer institute. The new study re-examined those figures. For black women, the news was shockingly bad, with 10.1 per 100,000 dying of cervical cancer ( compared to 4.7 for white women ), a rate seen in underdeveloped countries, per the times. Reasons for the racial disparity included poor access to screenings and the hpv vaccine. Experts said screening options must be expanded for at-risk women, and warned that the gap could widen if the affordable care act is repealed and women's health clinics shuttered. While screenings work well, \" many women in america are not getting them, \" says schmeler.

The provision would block the use of federal subsidies for insurance that covers elective abortions. Advocates on both sides are calling saturday's vote the biggest turning point in the battle over the procedure since the ban on so-called partial birth abortions six years ago. Both sides credited a forceful lobbying effort by roman catholic bishops with the success of the provision, inserted in the bill under pressure from conservative democrats. The provision would apply only to insurance policies purchased with the federal subsidies that the health legislation would create to help low- and middle-income people, and to policies sold by a government-run insurance plan that would be created by the legislation. Abortion rights advocates charged sunday that the provision threatened to deprive women of abortion coverage because insurers would drop the procedure from their plans in order to sell them in the newly expanded market of people receiving subsidies. The subsidized market would be large because anyone earning less than $ 88,000 for a family of four — four times the poverty level — would be eligible for a subsidy under the house bill.

The amendment goes beyond long-standing prohibitions against public funding for abortions, limiting abortion coverage even for women paying for it without government subsidies. The abortion issue had been rumbling within the house democratic caucus for weeks, but saturday's votes revealed the depths of the fault lines. The amendment passed with the support of 64 democrats, roughly a quarter of the party caucus. But abortion-rights supporters are vowing to strip the amendment out, as the focus turns to the senate and the conference committee that would resolve differences between the two bills. Although house liberals voted for the bill with the amendment to keep the process moving forward, rep.

While we clearly need health-care reform, the last thing our country needs is a massive new health-care entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our health-care system.

Petersburg subway station was a 23-year-old man from a former soviet republic in central asia who had links to islamist radical groups, according to reports in the russian media. Reuters reports that officials in kyrgyzstan have identified the suspect as akbarzhon jalilov, a russian citizen born in the city of osh. Officials say the toll from the attack has now hit 14, with up to 50 others injured by a bomb that exploded on a train between sennaya ploshchad and tekhnologichesky institut stations monday afternoon. A second bomb left at a different station failed to explode. Investigators believe jalilov may have planted that device before blowing himself up on the train. The subway driver is being praised for continuing to the next station after the bomb went off, making it easier for rescuers to reach the wounded. According to russian reports, the second bomb, which was packed with shrapnel and disguised as a fire extinguisher, would have done more damage than the first. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Vladimir putin, who was visiting st. Petersburg at the time of the bombing, met with security chiefs monday night, the guardian reports. Earlier, he laid flowers at the tekhnologichesky station.

The wirecutter, a product recommendations site, has just tested 30 sets of children's headphones and found that half of them in fact do not cap volume at a promised limit, and that the worst of the bunch emit such high volumes that damage can occur in a matter of minutes. \" these are terribly important findings, \" one pediatric audiologist not involved in the testing tells the new york times. \" manufacturers are making claims that aren't accurate. \" meanwhile, the wirecutter's headphones editor tells good morning america that there isn't even a governing board that oversees this. The world health organization has deemed sound below 85 decibels to be safe for up to eight hours, but half the headphones went above this level, and in some instances children can even remove the volume limiter. Meanwhile, one in five teens suffers from hearing loss, according to a 2010 report in the journal of american medical association, and some docs blame headphones. \" we're really talking about listening to a rock concert on a daily basis, \" one otolaryngologist tells abc news.

Though it offers no definitive link between zika and fetal abnormalities, the study does produce the first evidence of virus transmission from mother to child and \" the strongest evidence yet that the virus causes abnormally small heads and incomplete brain development, \" reports the verge. The study centers on a 25-year-old slovenian woman who became pregnant while volunteering in brazil in february 2015. She developed a high fever and rash during her 13th week of pregnancy, but ultrasounds at 14 and 20 weeks showed no issues. When she returned to slovenia in october, however, doctors found extensive brain damage in the fetus and the pregnancy was aborted, per nbc news. An autopsy found the full genome of the zika virus exclusively in the fetus ' unusually smooth and scarred brain, suggesting the virus only attacked nerve tissue, per reuters. The mother had no family history of genetic abnormalities and the fetus tested negative for 13 other viruses known to cause birth defects. \" you have a mother who's infected, a fetus that's abnormal, and in the fetus, you have the genetic signature of the virus, \" says an infectious disease expert. \" this is clear data showing zika can infect the fetus. \" an epidemiologist adds \" it sounds like a pretty clear case of extreme microcephaly. \" scientists suspect brain development may have stopped around 20 weeks, leading one doctor to suggest that zika, like other viruses linked to birth defects, may be most dangerous in the early stages of pregnancy.

        "summary": "Scientists are urging people to watch what they eat — and drink — in a new study linking a pesticide with parkinson's disease. Researchers note that, for a time, cattle in hawaii were likely fed a gruel containing traces of heptachlor, used by american pineapple farmers before it was banned in 1988, per time. The cows ' milk was contaminated, but \" no one knows how long or how widespread the contamination was before being detected, \" the parkinson's disease foundation says, per nbc news. To test the possible effects, researchers studied the brains of 116 japanese-american men in hawaii who had given information about their milk-drinking habits before they died. They found men who consumed more than two glasses of milk, or 16 ounces, daily had 40 % fewer brain cells in the substantia nigra, an area that shows damage in parkinson's cases, compared to men who drank less than two cups per day. Some 90 % of heavy milk drinkers also had heptachlor residue in their brains, compared to 63 % of those who didn't drink milk. Researchers dated the cell damage to after the accumulation of heptachlor, which suggests the chemical was responsible for the changes. The team couldn't test milk samples, but they \" have no other explanation for how heptachlor epoxide found its way into the brains of men who consumed milk, \" a study author tells live science. He notes \" the vast majority of milk consumers do not get parkinson's disease, \" but \" this adds to the literature that diet may indeed play a role. \" the study also backs others suggesting smokers enjoy protection against parkinson's: milk drinkers who smoked showed no brain cell loss. One critic notes participants divulged how much milk they drank some 30 years before they died, so their consumption perhaps changed. ( this pesticide has been linked to alzheimer's. )",

That meeting was to take place oct. 19, 1995; it was the last day she was seen alive. Detectives found a muddy shovel in sandoval's car, muddy clothes inside his home, and noticed scratch marks on his face, neck, and chest. Charges were not filed at the time because authorities could not find the body, any witnesses, or a crime scene. Sandoval was convicted in 2010 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.

Failing to do so might raise your risk of esophageal cancer, suggests a study in the annals of internal medicine by chinese researchers. The idea is that hot tea ( or, presumably, any hot beverage ) can damage cells in the esophagus and make it more vulnerable to the damage caused by cigarettes and alcohol, the lead researcher tells the telegraph. How hot is too hot? the researchers didn't specify, but cnn notes that previous research on hot beverages pegged the danger zone at 149 degrees fahrenheit and above. \" irritating the lining of the esophagus could lead to increased inflammation and more rapid turnover of the cells, \" explains a national cancer institute investigator who was not involved with the study. \" alternatively, hot liquids may impair the barrier function of the cells lining the esophagus, leaving the tissue open to greater damage from other carcinogens. \" the observational study was a massive one, following nearly 500,000 chinese adults ages 30 to 79 for about a decade.

        "summary": "Planned parenthood got some good news from the supreme court on monday, as new justice brett kavanaugh joined the court's more liberal judges — as did chief justice john roberts — in deciding not to hear a case involving the group. The upshot is that state court rulings will remain in place; those rulings allow planned parenthood to contest laws in louisiana and kansas to defund the organization. If either kavanaugh or roberts had joined conservative justices clarence thomas, samuel alito, and neil gorsuch, the court would have taken up the case, turning it into the first major abortion test of the new court, reports politico. Lawmakers in the two states sought to deny public funding to planned parenthood because the group provides abortions. However, federal law already prohibits medicaid funds from being used for abortions, notes npr. In his dissent, thomas blasted the decision. \" what explains the court's refusal to do its job here? \" he wrote. \" i suspect it has something to do with the fact that some respondents in these cases are named planned parenthood. \" he contended that the cases at hand \" are not about abortion rights \" but \" about private rights of action under the medicaid act, \" per cnn. Still, usa today sees the court's move as a setback for conservative interest groups who have been pushing for action on planned parenthood over the issue of abortion.

        "summary": "\" that new soda tax in seattle is working out about as well as chicago's, \" proclaims a headline at hot air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the chicago-encompassing cook county tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The chicago tribune reported at the time that costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34 %, while sales jumped 38 % at locations just beyond the county line. And costco is again at the fore of what's happening: because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as kiro discovered when it spotted an updated costco sign for gatorade in seattle. The sign details costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles — $ 15.99 — and separately lists the city's $ 10.34 tax, for a new total of $ 26.33. But that's not all the sign says: it also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for citizens against government waste sees the ends quite differently: \" let's be clear. Soda taxes don't make people healthier. They don't raise revenue — they drive it outside city limits. They don't help ease inequality — they make the poor poorer. \" but some in government seemingly remain hopeful: kxly reports a bill was reintroduced monday that would push the tax statewide.

The male shot by two salt lake city police officers was in critical condition at a local hospital sunday morning after being struck twice in the torso, according to det. Ken hansen with the unified police department, which is investigating the shooting. Hansen did not have details about the male's identity or age, but said the shooting occurred when two salt lake city officers were called around 8pm to break up a fight near a downtown homeless shelter that sits next to a shopping mall and movie theater. When the officers arrived, they found the male in the street, hitting another person with the broomstick, hansen says. Officers tried to break up the fight, but the male with the broomstick tried to attack an officer and one or both of the police officers then shot the male, hitting him in the upper and lower torso, per hansen. Selam mohammad, 19, tells the deseret news that he was with a 16-year-old friend from kenya when fighting started and the friend grabbed a broomstick to break it up. Police \" ran up with their guns pulled out \" and told the friend to drop the stick, mohammad says. \" he barely even turned around, then boom, boom, boom — and he just dropped, \" he adds. \" my friend didn't do anything. \" nearly 100 officers, some with riot shields, responded when rioting ensued, the salt lake tribune reports.",

        "summary": "Six people died after losing air conditioning at a florida nursing home whose power was knocked out by hurricane irma, broward county mayor barbara sharief confirmed in a press conference wednesday. Sharief said three people died at the rehabilitation center at hollywood hills and two more were declared dead at a hospital, the south florida sun sentinel reports. A sixth death was announced in a press release later wednesday morning. It may have all been due to extreme temperatures at the facility, though the causes of death haven't yet been officially determined. A police rep simply said \" a number of people \" were \" in respiratory distress \" at the facility; 115 people were evacuated from it. More on the deaths and other irma-related news: hollywood police chief tom sanchez says precautionary checks are being performed at the other nursing homes in the area, the miami herald reports. Sanchez says a criminal investigation into the deaths has been opened. The airstron employee who had been trying to fix the ac unit tells local 10 that a fuse needed to cool the unit popped out during the hurricane. He says he's been trying to repair the facility's unit for days, but florida power &amp; light ( fpl ) has yet to fix the fuse for him despite his phone calls. The washington post reports a rep for fpl noted the county didn't designate the facility as \" top critical \" — meaning a place given priority attention — during a 2017 hurricane planning meeting. The post separately reported that as of wednesday morning some 40 % of the state was still without power, and that some may not see it for as long as weeks. The mayor of naples, fla., put it bluntly: \" the biggest issue is power. It's 92 degrees and the sun is out and it's smoking out there. \" fpl's best estimate at this point for when power will be restored to those along the state's west coast: sept. 22. Carbon monoxide is also an issue in the wake of the storm: the los angeles times reports that at least five people have died and more than a dozen others have been treated after breathing carbon monoxide fumes from generators.",

Trump tweeted the video with the hashtags \" #fraudnewscnn \" and \" #fnn. \" a cnn spokesman called it \" a sad day when the president of the united states encourages violence against reporters. \" but on abc news, homeland security adviser tom bossert suggested cnn and other critics were overreacting. \" no one would perceive that as a threat, \" he said, adding that trump is \" beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to. \" the new video comes just a few days after trump posted two tweets in which he talked about msnbc's morning joe co-host mika brzezinski \" bleeding badly from a face-lift. \" those tweets sparked condemnation from all over the political spectrum, with even trump's fellow republicans calling them unpresidential. On saturday, however, trump took to twitter once again to address the backlash, writing, \" my use of social media is not presidential – it's modern day presidential, \" politico reports. At a press conference thursday, deputy white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said trump \" no way, form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence, \" the washington post reports. \" in fact quite the contrary. \"",

        "summary": "An absolutely amazing story out of oklahoma, where a texas 16-year-old survived a 3,500-foot fall in a skydiving mishap — and didn't even require any surgery for her injuries. Mackenzie wethington, who went skydiving saturday as a birthday present from her parents, slammed into the ground, yet somehow only suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken bones, and a broken tooth; she's already communicating with her parents in writing and doctors say she's in good condition and should suffer few long-term effects. \" i have no idea how she survived, \" one tells today. Experts are calling it a miracle; one suspects the teen somehow decreased her air speed and thus landed somewhat more softly — in other words, she was incredibly lucky. The teen was supposed to do a tandem jump with an experienced skydiver, but was told when she arrived that pegasus air sports center wasn't doing tandem jumps, so her first jump after six hours of training was on her own — and went horribly awry. It's not clear exactly what happened: according to myfox dfw, the family says mackenzie's primary parachute didn't open properly ( it was supposed to open automatically ) and may have gotten tangled, and mackenzie couldn't open the emergency chute. Mackenzie's dad ( who says the main chute only half-opened, according to cnn ) blames pegasus air sports center, claiming it offered inadequate training and didn't properly maintain its equipment. The owner of pegasus, however, blames mackenzie and denies any problem with her equipment: \" she didn't do what she was supposed to do, \" he says, though it's not clear what she did wrong; the owner says she didn't take a \" corrective counter action \" to make her parachute \" stop turning. \" he claims the chute did open fully but somehow, \" maybe... Initiated by her, \" started a rotation that caused the problem. The family has hired a lawyer, fox news insider reports.",

In fact, niburu was \" supposed \" to crash into earth just last month. And while death-by-planet remains unlikely, the existence of an undiscovered planet in our solar system is now almost a certainty, according to nasa. Planetary astrophysicist konstantin batygin and professor mike brown set out to disprove the existence of a hidden planet a few years ago and, ironically, ended up finding convincing evidence for the existence of what they call \" planet nine. \" the main evidence for planet nine comes from its \" gravitational footprint, \" but it's convincing enough that batygin says the solar system makes a lot more sense with the hidden planet than without it, space.com reports. Planet nine is believed to be 10 times more massive than earth and located about 20 times farther from the sun than neptune. From its position in the far reaches of the solar system, it has tilted and reversed the orbits of objects in the kuiper belt, according to batygin and brown. It also may be the reason the orbits of the planets are slightly off from the sun's equator. Finally, planet nine could be the \" super earth \" frequently found orbiting other stars but \" conspicuously absent \" around ours. Oh, and nasa wants conspiracy theorists to know planet nine, if it exists, is staying far away from earth. ( scientists just found the smallest possible star. )",

            "Eso/tom ruen/nagualdesign scientists are searching for an unseen planet hiding somewhere in our solar system, but not one set to seemingly appear from nowhere to collide or nearly collide with earth, ushering in an age of apocalypse. Over the past several weeks, you may have come across one of those wacky predictions that a planet called \" nibiru \" or \" planet x \" is lurking \" behind the sun \" or somewhere else out of view in our solar system but threatening an imminent existential catastrophe nonetheless. As with much of the fake news and online rumor-mongering that now spreads far and wide in a flash over social media, there is a grain of truth to the story that is then twisted, exaggerated, taken out of context or conflated with others. The kernel of reality in the 2017 version of the nibiru cataclysm prophecy, which represents at least the third time the planet has failed",
            "It might be lingering bashfully on the icy outer edges of our solar system, hiding in the dark, but subtly pulling strings behind the scenes: stretching out the orbits of distant bodies, perhaps even tilting the entire solar system to one side. If a planet is there, it's extremely distant and will stay that way ( with no chance -- in case you're wondering -- of ever colliding with earth, or bringing \" days of darkness \" ).it is a possible \" planet nine \" -- a world perhaps 10 times the mass of earth and 20 times farther from the sun than neptune. The signs so far are indirect, mainly its gravitational footprints, but that adds up to a compelling case nonetheless. One of its most dedicated trackers, in fact, says it is now harder to imagine our solar system without a planet nine than with one",
            "A possible \" planet nine \" in earth's solar system would orbit far beyond neptune's orbit ( visible as a bright ring around the sun in this artist's illustration ). Planet nine is out there, and astronomers are determined to find it, according to a new statement from nasa.

Over the past several weeks, you may have come across one of those wacky predictions that a planet called \" nibiru \" or \" planet x \" is lurking \" behind the sun \" or somewhere else out of view in our solar system but threatening an imminent existential catastrophe nonetheless. As with much of the fake news and online rumor-mongering that now spreads far and wide in a flash over social media, there is a grain of truth to the story that is then twisted, exaggerated, taken out of context or conflated with others. The kernel of reality in the 2017 version of the nibiru cataclysm prophecy, which represents at least the third time the planet has failed",

Trapped inside a golden piece of amber — already partially shaped to be sold as jewelry — was a fully feathered section of a dinosaur's tail. According to the los angeles times, the person selling the amber thought it was some kind of plant. While scientists have found evidence of feathered dinosaurs, not to mention feathered prehistoric birds, this piece of amber is the first time feathers have been found perfectly preserved and attached to what is unmistakably a dinosaur. The find was published thursday in current biology. The tail section is believed to belong to a young, sparrow-sized coelurosaur that lived 99 million years ago. Researchers know the tail belongs to a dinosaur because of its articulated vertebrae; birds have vertebrae that are fused together. And because of the way the features are structured, researchers believe they were useless for flight. It remains unclear exactly what purpose the feathers served, though researchers theorize dinosaurs may have used them for camouflage, regulating their body heat, or signaling to other animals. Now that researchers can see how feathers actually appeared on a dinosaur's body, they hope to learn how they evolved for flight in modern-day birds. They also believe that, given access to myanmar's amber mines, they may one day find a whole preserved dinosaur.",

If 178 wings sounds like more than you could eat in a week, chew on this: sudo also won the buffet bowl contest the day before — a race to eat a five-pound platter of buffalo-style cuisine, according to major league eating. \" one contest is exciting as it is, but to have two wrapped up in a two-day period is something else, \" says sudo, who weighs only 115 pounds. \"i just can't wait for next year. \"",

        "summary": "Audrey parker used canada's medically assisted death law to legally end her life — but a provision in that law forced her to do so months earlier than she wanted to. The guardian looks at the 57-year-old's case and the debate it has generated: parker's stage 4 breast cancer was painful and advanced enough that she qualified as having a \" grievous and irremediable medical condition, \" as determined by two doctors. But the law requires that one be of sound mind at the time of his or her death — and with the toronto star reporting the cancer had moved into parker's brain lining, she feared that if she held off, her lucidity might erode. \" i would have liked to have really lived until christmas. But i can't take the chance of losing my window, \" she told the globe and mail. So she opted for a premature death on nov. 1. The globe and mail reports the provision was put in as a \" safeguard, \" with the guardian noting cases of dementia patients who request death but then forget they have done so and happily live out their last days. On the flip side, the provision has also forced others to reel in their painkiller dosage at the end, resulting in increased pain. Before parker's death, she publicly advocated to have the law changed, and the guardian reports federal justice minister jody wilson-raybould responded in the negative: \" we're not considering changing something in the legislation. \" parker discusses her experience in a lengthy obituary she wrote herself, which is filled with gratitude, features 10 pieces of advice, and ends with this: \" until we meet again, i leave you with a simple message: be kind... Because you can. \" ( this man had issues with the way he had to end his life. )",
