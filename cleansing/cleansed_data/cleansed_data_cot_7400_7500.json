        "summary": "When jensen walcott and her good friend, jake reed, both got hired at pizza studio in kansas city, kansas, on the same day, the 17-year-olds were initially excited. Then reed mentioned to walcott that he'd be making $ 8.25 per hour. Walcott would only be making $ 8 per hour, even though she was hired for the same position and had the same degree of experience. Thinking there must have been a mix-up, she called her boss just an hour after being hired to ask about the wage discrepancy — and was promptly fired, she tells fox 4 kc. Jensen says the manager told her it's against company policy to discuss wages with co-workers, but both teens say that policy was never mentioned to them before the phone call. Reed was also fired. \" at face value it appears, that the young lady was terminated because she complained about unequal wages. That's illegal, \" an attorney tells the station, adding that, per the national labor relations board, it is perfectly fine for colleagues to discuss wages. He thinks jensen may have a legal claim on her hands, but for now, jensen just wants to bring some attention to what happened. Fox 4's story came out last friday, and the station noted that when it reached out to a corporate rep for pizza studio, he promised to investigate but never called the station back. Fox 4 hasn't offered any updates since then, but the story got wide pickup this week, with many outlets decrying the fact that walcott was apparently terminated for requesting to be paid as much as a male counterpart.",

The pri governed mexico for 71 years until losing power in 2000.

Obrador isn't conceding at least until official results are released mid-week, and may challenge the results in court, said sources. Out-of-control drug violence and mexico's sluggish economy were key considerations in the vote. Peña nieto has vowed to open state-owned oil monopoly pemex to foreign investors, raise tax revenue, liberalize the labor market — and crack down hard on drug violence. \" it's time for the pri to return, \" a 70-year-old voter in cancun told reuters. \" the pri is tough. They won't let the drug violence get out of control. \" but other voters feared a return to the old days of the pri when it racked up a reputation as a corrupt, autocratic party, notes the journal.",

Here's what they're saying: \" expectations, schmexpectations: ( mitt ) romney had a great night, \" writes nate silver of the new york times. Romney missed his poll numbers, but was swiftly declared winner, \" a more tangible benchmark of a ' good ' performance. \" no conservative alternative emerged: more importantly, neither newt gingrich nor rick santorum emerged from the scrum. Intrade actually now has gingrich ahead of santorum, but the former speaker expended more resources here for another fourth-place finish. Electability ruled the day: exit polls show that romney was the overwhelming pragmatist pick, taking a whopping 62 % of the vote among people who rated electability as their top criteria, aaron blake of the washington post points out. Romney also did surprisingly well among tea partiers, and even beat santorum among evangelicals. Ron paul scored: paul's silver medal cements him as someone the gop can't just ignore, politico writes; fealty will have to be paid at the convention. Paul walloped everyone else among young and first-time voters, which could have implications for the gop's future. Jon huntsman lives to fight another day: huntsman's surge proved real enough to justify staying in the race, even if he has no clear path to the nomination, and precious little money. Rick perry paid dearly: it's unclear how much perry spent in new hampshire, but politico's sources say it was substantial enough that his price-per-vote will wind up being staggering. Perry got 1,322 votes, or 0.73 %.",

He didn't go to the hospital then, but he changed his mind wednesday night, the orlando sentinel reports. The palm beach post explains that he had a severe headache — and doctors who x-rayed him discovered the cause was a bullet fragment lodged in his head, behind his left ear. Weirder still: doctors told jones he needed to be transferred to another medical center for treatment, the daytona beach news-journal reports, but he left the hospital wednesday night and it's not clear whether he followed their advice. Also wednesday, police found a black suv that they're framing as a getaway vehicle, but there hasn't yet been a report of any suspects arrested. The sentinel reports that three people were hit by bullets, but none are believed to have been involved in what triggered the 6: 30pm shooting, which occurred outside the campus music building while students were milling around. One man reportedly started arguing with a second man standing in front of the building seconds before shots were fired; police believe they both fired shots. At least one student appeared to know a confrontation was coming because he'd said he wanted to watch, police say.

Though some are skeptical about the male desire \" to dress like a rockford peach \" or as sean connery's barelegged james bond from 1964's goldfinger, aced design met its $ 10,000 fundraising goal on kickstarter within 24 hours of its launch monday, per mashable. It has now raised more than $ 45,000 offering rompers for $ 90 and up in pink, blue, splatter print, and also a fourth of july design. The gang behind the brand, who describe themselves as friends from business school, say they were \" sitting around drinking beers \" one night when they discovered that men's fashion was missing a \" stylish and fun \" design that was also versatile and comfortable. After \" countless hours \" at work, they came up with a \" super-garment \" dubbed the romphim. Combining a tailored shirt and structured pants, the romphim includes an adjustable waist and — most importantly — a zipper fly, so the outfit doesn't have to be shed in order for the wearer to pee, as is the case with most rompers for women, per new york. The rompers are expected to ship in august. ( pre-muddied pants are now a thing. )",

Exhibit a: carson yesterday offered to bow out as commencement speaker in may at johns hopkins after a brouhaha erupted over his comments on gay marriage. While on fox tuesday, carson said this, as per politico: \"my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they nambla, be they people who believe in bestiality, it doesn't matter what they are, they don't get to change the definition. \" grouping gay marriage with bestiality and pedophilia ( the nambla reference ) didn't sit well with johns hopkins students, who started a petition to scrap him as speaker. Carson tells the baltimore sun that he will oblige if the school wishes. As for the comments: \" perhaps the examples were not the best choice of words, and i certainly apologize if i offended anyone, \" he says. \" but the point that i was making was that no group of individuals, whoever they are, whatever their belief systems, gets to change traditional definitions. \" ( rush limbaugh would agree. ) of course, all of this might actually work to carson's political advantage, observes dave weigel at slate.

Discovered in northern thailand more than 30 years ago, cryptotora thamicola came to the attention of us biomechanics researcher brooke flammang when a colleague showed her video of the cave dweller crawling along surfaces, wired reports. \" i was like, ' fish can't do that, ' \" says flammang. \" that's ridiculous. \" so she teamed up with thai scientist apinun suvarnaraksha, who shot video of the endangered species and had a museum specimen ct-scanned at a dental school. Published in scientific reports, their results show that cryptotora thamicola has a skeletal structure made for walking. The pelvis is bound by long ribs to the spine, and overlapping vertebrae keep the spine stiff — unlike modern fish but much like ancient four-limbed tetrapods that once crawled around like salamanders, the new york times reports. \" functionally, it makes perfect sense, but to see it in a fish is incredibly wild, \" says flammang. Scientists have identified possible tetrapod tracks dating back nearly 400 million years, nature reported in 2009, but could it have been cryptotora thamicola? \" we see these footprints in a fish today, doing something very unfishlike, \" says flammang, who believes the thai fish may show how creatures first reached land. ( evolutionary theory could explain why we can't find alien life. )",

There's definitely an adjustment period that comes with living alone — but once you do start living by yourself you may never look back.

The number of people choosing to live solo jumped from 39 percent in 2007 to 42 percent in 2017. And the majority of those who are living alone are millennials. \" if you're living alone for the first time, whether you're moving out of mom and dad's, saying no more to housemates, or getting out of a relationship and having a bed to yourself after all these years, you have to know yourself and see it as a choice, despite the ups and downs, \" joanna townsend, a life coach and psychotherapist for blush",

In some cities, however, living alone is far more common. According to estimates from the u.s. Census bureau, there are 21 metropolitan areas where more than one in every three homes are occupied by individuals who live alone. While these cities do not necessarily share a single defining quality, there are some common characteristics that may help explain why residents are more likely to live on their own in these places. Living alone means footing the bill for utilities and rent — or upkeep and mortgage. For that reason, it is not financially prudent, or even possible, for many. In cities with a lower than average cost of living, fewer residents may need to rely on a roommate in order to afford housing.

And the majority of those who are living alone are millennials. \" if you're living alone for the first time, whether you're moving out of mom and dad's, saying no more to housemates, or getting out of a relationship and having a bed to yourself after all these years, you have to know yourself and see it as a choice, despite the ups and downs, \" joanna townsend, a life coach and psychotherapist for blush",
            "In any u.s. City, living arrangements run the gamut from friends and strangers living as roommates to domestic partnerships to single-parent households to the traditional nuclear families. While the vast majority of americans cohabitate in one way or another, there are also those who live alone — either by choice or by circumstance. Across the united states, about 1 in every 10 americans — 10.3 % — live alone. More than 1 in every 4 households — 27.9 % — are made up of a single individual. In some cities, however, living alone is far more common. According to estimates from the u.s. Census bureau, there are 21 metropolitan areas where more than one in every three homes are occupied by individuals who live alone. While these cities do not necessarily share a single defining quality, there are some common characteristics that may help explain why residents are more likely to live on their own in these places. Living alone means footing the bill for utilities and rent — or upkeep and mortgage. For that reason, it is not financially prudent, or even possible, for many. In cities with a lower than average cost of living, fewer residents may need to rely on a roommate in order to afford housing. The barnstable town, massachusetts metropolitan area, which comprises cape cod, is the only metro area where"

The culprit or culprits broke into an underground vault through a manhole and cut three fiber-optic cables belonging to internet wholesalers, the wall street journal reports. A spokesman for wave broadband, one of the firms affected by the severed lines, tells the los angeles times that the attack caused slow internet and tv service for people in the sacramento area. It's a \" huge inconvenience, but it's not a comprehensive outage, \" he says. An fbi press release issued last month details 10 similar attacks over the last year, all in the san francisco bay area; all but one occurred between the hours of about 9: 30pm and 2: 15am. Tuesday's incident happened around 4: 30am. The ceo of security consulting firm rook security tells usa today that the attacks — like one that cut service to more than 50,000 customers in 2009 — show how vulnerable the internet's infrastructure is. \" when it's situations that are scattered all in one geography, that raises the possibility that they are testing out capabilities, response times, and impact, \" he says. \" that is a security person's nightmare. \" ( a 75-year-old woman scavenging for metal brought down the internet in two countries. )",

But the purple-haired 14-year-old from appleton, wis., has decided to wrest control back from the type 2 spinal muscular atrophy that's plagued her by ending her own life, and she's going to go out dancing, the washington post reports. On friday she ' ll be donning a tulle dress and attending her prom, which she calls her \" last dance \" — and then, after spending one final summer with her mom, they ' ll turn off the ventilator that keeps her alive at the end of august. Jerika's mom, jen bolen, has been working furiously since jerika was a baby to ease her daughter's agonizing pain, but even after 38 surgeries, it has become unbearable ( usually at a seven on a one-to-10 scale on a good day ). \" i used my voice that i had and said,'this is enough pain. I don't need this anymore, \" jerika tells usa today. The director of the pediatric palliative care program at uw health in madison tells the post-crescent that even though the bolens have \" turned over every stone and tried every treatment to make things better for her … we really haven't been able to help her pain. \" which is why jen bolen has come around to her daughter's decision, despite her own anger, sadness, and fear about what's to come. \" i know she's only 14, but she's old enough to decide, \" bolen says. \" it's her body and it's her pain. \" she's put up a gofundme page to help raise money for jerika's last days, which she hopes to make as \" pleasant and magical as possible. \" \" the first week, i was crying all the time, \" jerika says of the days right after making her decision. \" but after a couple days, i was running around so happy.

The company's stock slid nearly 7 % on monday, the biggest decline in four years, as it deals with allegations that it allowed people's personal data to be manipulated during the 2016 campaign, reports the wall street journal. The new scandal specifically involves the data-mining company cambridge analytica, which worked for the trump campaign and is accused of improperly obtaining the data of 50 million facebook users without much trouble. The story continues to widen: different: the details of this mess are complex, \" but the most important thing to understand is that facebook collects an enormous amount of data about its users, and it lost control of that data, \" writes rhett jones at gizmodo. Yes, facebook has weathered similar controversies, but this feels different, he adds. For one thing, lawmakers in the us and europe are demanding accountability, raising the prospect of investigations, hearings, and penalties. Stephen colbert: the late-night host weighed in on the scandal monday, declaring that \" free will is an illusion. \" cambridge analytica reportedly created psychological profiles so it could bombard users with targeted ads and stories. Colbert takes facebook to task for allegedly being informed of these tactics and failing to stop them. See the video. Where's zuckerberg? silent so far amid the scandal is mark zuckerberg, notes julie carrie wong at the guardian. He might not want to wait too much longer: the hashtag #whereszuck was trending, as was #deletefacebook. Similar theme: the editorial page of the new york times also takes facebook to task for its response and thinks lawmakers should look into whether the company violated its own 2011 consent decree with the ftc about protecting users'data. \" it is clear that lawmakers cannot rely on the company to police itself. \" facebook turmoil: the company's chief information security officer, alex stamos, is leaving after meeting resistance in his push for the company to be more transparent in how it was used to spread disinformation, reports the new york times. What to know: the bbc has a question-and-answer primer on the entire scandal, including background on cambridge analytica and the quiz it used to get information from facebook users. Among the explanations is how to protect your privacy on the site. Dirty tricks: britain's channel 4 has undercover footage of cambridge analytica execs boasting of using underhanded tactics to sway elections around the world, including the use of prostitutes and bribery. The company says these were all \" hypothetical scenarios. \" the guardian has details.",

Mic.com reports there doesn't seem to be a way for people who've set up recurring donations through the site to cancel that running payment. Mic started playing with the donation process after spotting a tweet by cnn political reporter jeremy diamond, who posted a screenshot ( cc'd to donald trump himself ) from a donor who'd unsuccessfully tried to cancel his payments to trump's campaign both online and by leaving voice messages for the campaign. \" i thought maybe if you could bring some attention to it, maybe it would suddenly appear on his site, \" the donor wrote. Mic set up a recurring $ 1 donation as an experiment and then tried to nix it, but it confirmed what the unnamed donor said: there's no apparent way to cancel, nor a way to delete credit card info from the site. The only option, in fact, seems to be to \" update \" one's credit card with a new, valid credit card number ( even plugging in a fake number didn't work; the bad number was simply rejected ). Mic tried the same thing on hillary clinton's donation page and found a button to remove one's credit card — which a campaign rep confirmed would stop all donations. A federal election commission rep says the agency doesn't have any rules that speak directly to this specific issue, so right now, until the trump campaign answers questions about the dilemma ( the trump campaign hadn't yet responded to mic's multiple requests for comment ), donors who wish to get out of their payments may have limited options: cancel their credit card or fight the charges with their card issuer.

Andressian had taken prescription pills and was found in a car doused in gasoline in an apparent suicide attempt. Andressian told authorities that he drove that day about 145 miles to lake cachuma. Authorities had twice searched the lake unsuccessfully, using dogs and a dive team. Although initially arrested, andressian was released but later charged with murder. Prosecutors contend that andressian killed the boy to get back at his estranged wife. Andressian had shaved his beard, lightened his hair and had been socializing while living out of a las vegas hotel for 47 days — conduct characterized as inconsistent with that of a grieving parent, sheriff's officials said.",

The bad news: they don't actually have to cover the drugs those patients need. Key drugs are missing from some plans, the washington post reports, in what patient advocates believe is a bid to drive sick customers away. Some plans omit certain medicines for hiv, cancer, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and more altogether, or else require patients to pay as much as 50 % out-of-pocket — which is often more than $ 1,000 a month. Consumers might not realize, either; some plan don't detail their formulary ( that's the list of covered drugs ) until patients formally apply, the wall street journal reports. And, as scott gottlieb at forbes explains, if a drug isn't on the formulary, it won't even count toward your out-of-pocket cap ( $ 12,700 for a family, $ 6,350 for an individual ). The obama administration says that if your plan doesn't cover a crucial drug, you should ask for an exception; the government is asking insurers to respond to these requests within three days.",

According to abramovitz's lawsuit, lee, fearing she would lose him if he moved away from montreal, posed as abramovitz to send an email declining the offer, the montreal gazette reports. After deleting the original email, she then allegedly set up a fake email account in gilad's name and sent a rejection notice to abramovitz, who was sharing her apartment at the time.

In a later statement, he also said \"numerous references \" attributed the the quote to her as well. \"the postal service used her widely recognized quote to help build an immediate connection between her image and her 1969 nationally recognized autobiography, 'i know why the caged bird sings, ' \" the statement said. The u.s. Postal service unveiled a limited edition stamp honoring poet and civil rights activist maya angelou at the warner theatre in washington, d.c. The first lady michelle obama, oprah winfrey and attorney general eric holder were amongst those in attendance. ( reuters ) but monday night, after being told that anglund confirmed the quote as hers, saunders wrote in an e-mail, \"had we known about this issue beforehand, we would have used one of [ angelou's ] many other works.... The sentence held great meaning for her and she is publicly identified with its popularity. \" emily anglund, anglund's granddaughter, said she had no idea that the quote has been attributed to angelou for several years, or that it is featured"

Trayvon martin, 17, was walking through a gated community back to his stepmother's house after going out to buy candy for his brother when zimmerman called 911 to report a suspicious person. Zimmerman — who has called police 46 times since the beginning of 2011, the miami herald reports — was told by a dispatcher not to follow martin, but did so anyway; he told authorities he shot the teen in self-defense. Martin's family has called for federal authorities to take over the case, and civil rights leaders have noted their alarm — zimmerman, 28, is white, and reportedly specifically warned residents about unfamiliar black youth, although his father called him a \" spanish-speaking minority \" in a letter to the orlando sentinel. Martin's family said friday they would ask to meet with attorney general eric holder. Abc, which notes that zimmerman was never tested for drugs or alcohol the night martin died, has zimmerman's recently released 911 call as well as calls from others who witnessed the shooting. The herald has more on zimmerman as well as the sanford police department, which has a history of racial tensions.

The \" borat \" star and actress wife isla fisher are giving $ 500,000 to save the children to pay for measles vaccinations for children in northern syria. They are also donating the same amount to the international rescue committee ( irc ) to help refugees in syria and neighbouring countries, particularly women and children, with health care, shelter and sanitation. More than four million refugees have fled conflict in syria for the relative safety of the neighbouring countries, according to the united nations. Millions more have been forced to leave their homes for other parts of the country. Justin forsyth, chief executive of save the children, said the money would \" save many thousands of lives and protect some of the most vulnerable children \". \" by allowing us to make their generous donation to syrian children public, sacha and isla are helping highlight the tragedy of the issue today, \" he added. David miliband, the ex-british foreign secretary who is president of the irc, called their gift a \" great expression of humanity. \"",
            "Today sacha baron cohen and isla fisher have made a $ 1 million donation split equally between save the children and the international rescue committee to support victims of the conflict in syria. Donate now to help us provide food, water, medicine and education to syrian children. Today sacha baron cohen and isla fisher have made a $ 1 million donation split equally between save the children and the international rescue committee to support victims of the conflict in syria. 500,000 dollars will be used to fund a programme vaccinating more than 250,000 children against a potential measles outbreak in northern syria. The other half of the donation will be used to help fund the work to support families, with a special concern for women and children, both inside syria and in neighbouring countries who are suffering as a result of the ongoing conflict. The money will go towards education, health care, shelter and sanitation. There are currently four million refugees in neighbouring states and over seven million displaced inside syria. It has been estimated that around 12,000 children have been killed in the conflict and the real number may be much higher. Some sources have indicated that thousands of children have been killed by barrel bombs alone. Justin forsyth, save the children ceo, said: \"the syrian conflict is now approaching its fifth year and children are the first victims. There is no safe place left in syria, with shelling and violence omnipresent. Food and medicines have become scarce and basic"

A lawyer for the death row records founder tells the ap knight accidentally ran over and killed a friend yesterday afternoon while trying to \" escape \" in his pickup truck after being attacked by two other men. But police give a different account of events to the la times, saying that after knight argued with two men on the set of nwa biopic straight outta compton, he followed them to tam's burgers around 3: 30pm pst and ran them over. \" looks like he drove backwards and struck the victims and drove forwards and struck them again, \" a police spokesman says. \" the people we talked to say it looked like it was an intentional act. \" cnn reports the man killed was terry carter, 55; tmz describes him as an actor. The second victim has been named as cle sloan, 51, who tmz reports appeared in training day. Police say the incident is being investigated as a homicide, not a traffic accident; knight's bail has been set at $ 2 million. Knight — who was behind the wheel when passenger tupac shakur was shot dead in 1996 — has a long history of legal problems, including an alleged camera theft for which he is on bail. His lawyer says he is confident that knight, whose pickup was found abandoned in a parking lot hours after the incident, \" will be totally exonerated. \" the times notes it's not clear whether knight had any \" affiliation with the production \" of the biopic.",

The resignation of senior political adviser rebekah mason capped an explosive eight days in state politics that rocked the administration of the conservative republican governor in a scandal that shows no signs of going away quietly, the ap reports. According to gawker, the affair has been \" all but confirmed, \" with local blog yellowhammer releasing fresh audio of a conversation between bentley and mason in which he refers to her having seen his underwear.

He also denied reports that he co-owned a safety deposit box with mason, saying she was merely designated to access it if needed.

        "summary": "Former fbi agent john morris took the stand in whitey bulger's trial today, and emotionally apologized to the family of michael donahue, one of bulger's alleged — and accidental — victims. The boston globe explains how donahue ended up behind the wheel of a car that was riddled with bullets in 1982: donahue was giving a ride home to brian halloran, a bulger associate. Morris had heard that halloran was cooperating with investigators in a murder investigation related to bulger, and mentioned that in a conversation he had with john j. Connolly jr. — morris'subordinate, and the fbi agent who reportedly got bulger to become an informant. ( bulger is denying he ever informed. ) the info allegedly spurred the attack. Morris, who has admitted taking cash and gifts from bulger and is testifying in exchange for immunity, says he later realized his statement could have gotten back to bulger, and apologized for his \" indirect \" role. ( bulger's lawyer says morris knew he was \" signing mr. Halloran's death warrant \" in sharing the info. ) \" i do want to express my sincere apology for things i did, and i didn't do. I do not ask for forgiveness — that's too much, \" he said to donahue's family in the front row. But i do acknowledge it publicly. \" donahue's widow says she believes morris was sincere, and that the guilt he lives with is his punishment. But, she adds, \" i don't forgive it. Their'sorries ' come too late \"; it was the first apology she had received from the fbi. The daily beast has much more on morris ' own corruption and intimate ties to bulger, who is apparently not happy that morris is now testifying against him: the beast reports that as morris testified last week, bulger muttered, \" you're a f --- ing liar. \"",

In what the hollywood reporter says \" could become the biggest ever profits case in television history, \" co-creator robert kirman ( whose comic books provided the show's source material ) along with producers gale anne hurd, glen mazzara, and david alpert have now sued amc; the show's other co-creator, frank darabont, had already filed a lawsuit of his own. Per the lawsuit, at least three other shows that aired on amc but were produced by outside studios were paid higher licensing fees than walking dead, which was produced by amc's in-house studio. As a result, the cast and crew of those shows made a higher percentage of the show's net profits. Per thr, potential damages in the case could reach $ 1 billion. The washington post explains the issue: traditionally, a studio and a separate broadcast or cable channel are involved in creating ( studio ) and airing ( channel ) a show; the network would pay the production company a licensing fee in order to air the show and the production company would pay the actors and crew a percentage of that fee. But after certain fcc rules were eliminated, a studio and production company are now allowed to be owned by the same corporation; in this case, amc owns its own production studio. \" since money is changing pockets in the same pair of pants, there's an incentive for the production company and the cable channel to agree on what might be something of a lowball figure \" for the licensing fee and, following that, the amount the talent makes, an expert explains.",

            "Washington ( ap ) — the white house says president barack obama is removing cuba from a list of state sponsors of terrorism, a key step in president barack obama's bid to normalize relations between the two countries. The white house says on twitter that obama has submitted to congress required reports and certifications indicating his intent to take cuba off the list. Obama made the final decision following a state department review of cuba's presence on the list. The u.s. Has long since stopped actively accusing cuba of supporting terrorism. Cuba was one of four countries on the u.s. List of nations accused of repeatedly supporting global terrorism. The countries still on the list are iran, sudan and syria. Obama announced in december that the u.s. And cuba were ending a half-century of hostilities."

The nod could give romney a boost in a state that he dumped millions into in 2008, but has largely ignored thus far.

That from the fast-food giant's japan unit, which has been digging into the discovery of the tooth, which turned up in an order placed in august in osaka. Mcdonald's holdings co. ( japan ) ltd. Further says it doesn't yet know how it ended up there: workers at the plant that produces the fries don face masks, and none of the employees of the location in question reported an absent tooth. As the ap puts it, mcdonald's japan officials \" bowed deeply \" today in apology over the tooth, as well as plastic pieces that were recently found in its food. The wall street journal reports that three plastic incidents were discussed. A child eating a sundae last month was lightly injured by a plastic piece determined to have come from a machine involved in assembling the dessert. The other two incidents involved plastic in chicken nuggets: one was blue, and so it could have fallen in during production ( its thai suppliers use colored materials to make it easier to sight instances of contamination ), but the other was clear, a type not used at mcdonald's, officials say. Reuters notes that mcdonald's japan has been obtaining its nuggets from thai producers for less than six months, following a scandal involving a chinese supplier that allegedly used expired meat. The company's problems stretch back further: mcdonald's japan is expected to report a sixth consecutive year of declining sales and its first loss in 11 years.",

On feb. 7, what was day six of the nine-day race — which can be completed on foot, skis, or mountain bike — guides working the yukon arctic ultra race located the italian athlete's sled, but not zanda. He had, up until that point, been averaging about 32 miles a day, and when he was ultimately located, he said he'd gone off in search of help after his feet began to freeze. But the effects of hypothermia, which can trigger odd or confused behavior, may have been setting in: he tells the cbc he spent 18 hours trudging through the snow shoeless before being found. He was airlifted to whitehorse general hospital, where an mri showed circulation had essentially ceased in his feet. Yukon news reports only one 300-mile racer finished the race, which was called off early on feb. 8 due to weather. Robert pollhammer, who helms the race, says \" we've never had these cold temperatures from the start for an entire race. \" but he pins the blame for zanda's situation on zanda, telling the cbc \" he had the right gear... He simply ignored all the warning signs of hypothermia. \" ( runner's world notes that those who register have to provide proof of their wilderness survival skills. ) further, pollhammer thinks it was foolish of zanda to leave his sled behind, as it contained a tracking device. As for zanda, he doesn't seem to think it was foolish of him to participate: he tells the cbc he is without regrets, and that he won't stop racing, even if he's forced to do so with prosthetics. It ' ll be some months before doctors can gauge the degree to which zanda's circulation has recovered, and whether he ' ll need to have his hands or feet amputated.

        "summary": "It's just a theory, but a pretty dazzling one. Two scientists this week laid out the tantalizing possibility that jupiter sees raindrops of liquid diamond and saturn gets diamond hail, reports nature. If true, both planets would be teeming with the gems. \" if you had a robot there, it would sit there and collect diamonds raining down, \" says one of the scientists, kevin baines of the university of wisconsin-madison. The possibility stems from the fact that both planets have methane in their atmospheres, explains red orbit. As the theory goes, lightning zaps the methane and creates carbon soot. The soot gets exposed to intense pressure as it falls, turning into graphite, and then into, voila, diamonds. Adds national geographic: \" at the greatest depths of jupiter's atmosphere, the conditions are so extreme that the gems may actually form an ocean of liquid diamond. \" note for ambitious space miners: all the reports include doses of skepticism from other scientists. ( still, it's more exciting than the recent discovery of plastic on a moon of saturn. )",

Researchers have long wondered whether the high pressures inside the giant planets could turn carbon into diamond2, and even though some researchers dispute their claim, mona delitsky of california specialty engineering in flintridge, and kevin baines of the university of wisconsin-madison, now say it is possible. They are laying out their argument this week at a meeting of the american astronomical society's division for planetary sciences in denver, colorado. In their scenario, lightning zaps molecules of methane in the upper atmospheres of saturn and jupiter, liberating carbon atoms. These atoms then stick onto each other, forming larger particles of carbon soot, which the cassini spacecraft may have spotted in dark storm clouds on saturn3. As the soot particles slowly float down through ever-denser layers of gaseous and liquid hydrogen towards the planets ' rocky cores, they experience ever greater pressures and temperatures. The soot is compressed into graphite, and then into solid diamonds before reaching a temperature of about 8,000 ° c, when the diamond melts, forming liquid diamond raindrops, they say.

Scientists have believed for some time that neptune and uranus likely contain diamonds deep below their surfaces, but this is the first time a team has reported similar evidence for jupiter and saturn. The diamond core on neptune and uranus would most likely stay solid because the temperatures inside these planets are lower. \"previously, only uranus and neptune were thought to have conditions in their interiors that would allow the formation of diamond at their cores.

Opened fire on the president outside the washington hilton in 1981. \" i heard these shots, \" parr said in a 2013 interview. \"i sort of knew what they were, and i'd been waiting for them all of my career, in a way. \" the times reports parr pushed reagan into a nearby limo and got on top of him. Parr didn't find any bullet wounds on the way to the white house, but when he noticed the president having chest pains and with blood on his lips, he rerouted the limo to the hospital, according to the post. Doctors say that decision likely saved reagan, who had indeed been shot. \"without jerry looking out for ronnie on march 30, 1981, i would have certainly lost my best friend and roommate to an assassin's bullet, \" nancy reagan said in a statement reported by cnn. \"jerry was not only one of the finest secret service agents to ever serve this country, but one of the most decent human beings i've ever known. \" the post reports parr retired from the secret service in 1985 and became a clergyman.",

            "The house voted decisively late wednesday to reject a bipartisan budget mixing tax increases with spending cuts to wring $ 4 trillion from federal deficits over the coming decade. The 382-38 roll call paved the way for republicans to muscle through their own, more stringent budget on thursday, a measure that would blend deeper spending reductions in safety-net programs for the poor with a plan to dramatically overhaul medicare. The vote also underscored the partisan polarization dominating washington this election year, with leaders of both parties showing little inclination to compromise and let the other side claim a victory. The bipartisan measure rejected wednesday was patterned on a plan by president barack obama's 2010 deficit commission and was written by moderate reps. Steve latourette, r-ohio, and jim cooper, d-tenn. \" this is the only bipartisan way to solve the nation's problems, \" cooper said. \" when you know you have a good deal is when the left and right are pounding the snot out of you, and that's what's happening today, \" latourette said. House budget committee chairman paul ryan, r-wis., was the only lawmaker to speak against the plan, saying it relied too heavily on tax increases and not enough on spending cuts.

        "summary": "For six years, a woman suffered from regular bouts of sharp abdominal pains, and doctors assumed she had the bowel disorder known as crohn's disease. Because the 41-year-old wasn't responding to the usual treatments, they resorted to surgery — and discovered the true and bizarre cause of her discomfort. Small pieces of a heinz foil ketchup packet were perforating her small intestine, reports huffpost. Doctors removed the two foil pieces ( the packet was no longer intact but the fragments did bear part of the word \" heinz \" ), which led to a \" complete resolution of symptoms, \" doctors report in a case study in the british medical journal. Not surprisingly, the doctors say this is the first known case of ingested packaging being mistaken for crohn's, reports the press association. And they draw a lesson: \" it is important to consider alternative surgical diagnoses in patients with presumed crohn's disease unresponsive to standard treatment, \" they write. The woman has no memory of ingesting such a packet, but five months after surgery she remained symptom-free, making doctors far surer of this diagnosis than the earlier one.

Here's what critics are saying: from the start — in which lee notes the death toll in chicago over the last 15 years has eclipsed american deaths in iraq and afghanistan put together, chi-raq is \" a shattering, thunderous wake-up alarm, a call to lay down arms, a gutsy social satire and a highly stylized work of fiction that sometimes feels as accurate and sobering as the crime reporting, \" writes richard roeper at the chicago sun-times. The film is \" filled with wild shifts in tone \" but remains \" in your face and reaching for your conscience. \" \" finally, a movie about something important, \" writes soren andersen at the seattle times. It tackles chicago gun violence with anger and \" sorrow … but also, surprisingly, humor.

This may sound like it's destined for failure, \" but it's an improbable triumph \" with lee \" doing some of his best work in years, \" she writes. \" while you can argue with mr. Lee's ideas, cinematic and political, few directors shake you up this hard, creating laughter that is as bitter as tears. \" \" here's spike lee at his ballsiest. Who else would update aristophanes ' lysistrata, set in ancient greece, and prop it up in present-day englewood, chicago? \" writes peter travers at rolling stone.

It's a shattering, thunderous wake-up alarm, a call to lay down arms, a gutsy social satire and a highly stylized work of fiction that sometimes feels as accurate and sobering as the crime reporting you see on the front page of this newspaper. From the opening sequence reminding us in the last 15 years, more americans have been killed in chicago than in iraq and afghanistan combined, with nick cannon's blistering and electric \"pray 4 my city \" pounding home the point, lee makes it clear \"chi-raq \" isn't interested in polite discussion.

            "This just in: spike lee's \"chi-raq \" isn't a broad comedy that makes light of the tragic levels of violence in englewood, nor is it a gratuitous slam at our great city. It's a shattering, thunderous wake-up alarm, a call to lay down arms, a gutsy social satire and a highly stylized work of fiction that sometimes feels as accurate and sobering as the crime reporting you see on the front page of this newspaper. From the opening sequence reminding us in the last 15 years, more americans have been killed in chicago than in iraq and afghanistan combined, with nick cannon's blistering and electric \"pray 4 my city \" pounding home the point, lee makes it clear \"chi-raq \" isn't interested in polite discussion.

Setting before the propylaea, or gateway to the acropolis of athens, 411 bce lysistrata ( or; attic greek: λυσιστράτη, lysistrátē, \" army disbander \" ) is an ancient greek comedy by aristophanes, originally performed in classical athens in 411 bc. It is a comic account of a woman's extraordinary mission to end the peloponnesian war between greek city states by denying all the men of the land any sex, which was the only thing they truly and deeply desired. Lysistrata persuades the women of the warring cities to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peace — a strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of old comedy"

        "summary": "When news broke yesterday that bryan singer had been accused of repeatedly raping a teenage boy, the director's rep called the lawsuit an \" absurd \" attempt to get attention as singer awaits next month's release of his latest x-men movie — but it certainly doesn't look like the scandal is going away any time soon. Defamer rounds up a number of salacious rumors about singer on sites including dlisted, queerty, and imdb, with the takeaway being, as jordan sargent puts it: \" bryan singer's obsession with barely legal boys was an open secret \" in hollywood. And this isn't the first time singer's been sued over something shady, sargent points out: in 1997, a 14-year-old extra and two other boys who worked on singer's apt pupil sued filmmakers, alleging they forced the underage extras to strip completely naked for one of the scenes. Entertainment weekly has a roundup of those accusations; according to the raw story, the district attorney ultimately determined there was no basis for a criminal case. As for the current case, the alleged victim, michael egan, first sued over alleged sexual abuse at hollywood parties in 1999 back in 2000, according to the hollywood reporter. Singer was not named in that lawsuit; rather, the focuses were the hosts of the parties. It's not clear how that lawsuit was resolved. Yesterday, egan spoke to the press about what he says he experienced at the parties, the new york daily news reports: \" you were a piece of meat to these people and they'd pass you around between them. \"",

        "summary": "Puerto rico is braced for what is expected to be its fiercest storm in almost a century. Hurricane maria made landfall wednesday morning near the town of yabucoa as an \" extremely dangerous \" category 4 hurricane packing winds of around 155mph, according to the national hurricane center, per usa today. The strongest storm recorded in puerto rico before now was san felipe in 1928, which had winds of 160mph, the ap reports. The last category 4 hurricane to make a direct hit was in 1932. \" this is going to be an extremely violent phenomenon, \" warned gov. Ricardo rossello. \" we have not experienced an event of this magnitude in our modern history. \" the latest: by the measure of central air pressure, maria is now stronger than hurricane irma, which passed north of puerto rico, mashable reports. In addition to damage caused by winds and a storm surge up to 9 feet high, the storm is expected to cause landslides and flash flooding. More than 10,000 people have taken refuge in shelters, cnn reports. Authorities say low-lying, flood-prone areas have been evacuated, and people living in flimsy or wooden homes have been told they face death if they don't move to a shelter. St. Croix, the largest us virgin island, was hit with extremely strong winds and rain early wednesday though it was spared a direct hit when the eye of the hurricane passed south of the island, the guardian reports. Maria has already caused one death in guadeloupe and may have caused multiple deaths in dominica, which lost all communications soon after prime minister roosevelt skerrit spoke of \" mind-boggling \" devastation, the telegraph reports. Skerrit said his home and many others had lost their roofs, and there have been unconfirmed reports that up to 90 % of the buildings on the island were destroyed. The us military says forces have moved out of the way of the storm, but they are ready to respond quickly from the base at guantanamo bay. \" we have moved all of our ships out of san juan, \" coast guard commandant adm. Paul zukunft tells the washington post. \" they have not see winds like this ever, so i think the devastation is going to be significant. We're working very closely with fema, and the navy has a significant flotilla of ships in this area. \" puerto rico was spared the worst winds of hurricane irma, but the storm still knocked out power to around 70 % of the population, with 4 % still without power almost two weeks later, the new york times reports.

Colbert asked brockovich about the possibility of lead in other cities, referencing states to the immediate east of the mississippi river. \"i can tell you that flint, michigan is the tip of the iceberg, \" brockovich said. \"i can tell you for certain this is a national crisis that we're not getting ready to face – this crisis is already here. \" brockovich said lead leaching is happening sebring, ohio; louisiana; and there are rumors of lead-laced water in wisconsin. She blamed the trend on the use of chloramines and old infrastructure. \"we've been treating water differently with something called chloramines, which is very acidic",
            "Two decades after erin brockovich instigated the largest direct-action lawsuit in history, the gutsy mother of three is still fighting for clean water. Her most recent crusade in flint, michigan, reached the national stage last week, prompting president obama to declare a state of emergency and the state's governor to activate the national guard. In a post on michigan live, brockovich is credited with bringing the controversy to a \"fever pitch \" early last year — something few other outlets have highlighted. \"excuses … excuses, \" read brockovich's jan. 20, 2015 facebook post about the lead-filled water in flint. \"now is not the time for the blame game... Detroit has failed and flint jumped ship. So much for local control... Everyone is responsible from the top down. \" shared more than 5,000 times, the post gave much-needed airtime to a fight that flint's residents had largely been fighting alone. In the post's comments, people across michigan thank brockovich — who later flew there to meet them — for spreading the word. It's a sentiment echoed repeatedly on her facebook"

Had we acted sooner, \" maybe maddie would still be here. \" but her death gives us \" the gift of focusing our attention, \" del pozo continued, laying out steps to reduce opioid addiction deaths, from increasing access to buprenorphine, used to treat opioid addiction, to ending prosecution of addicts for misdemeanor-level drug possession. Per the free press, del pozo has received plenty of feedback, mostly words of thanks. He seems unconcerned by a few angry responses. \" when the mayor hired me, one of his requirements was that he and i work together to help burlington address the opioid crisis, \" he says. ( a tennessee family has been especially hard hit. )",

        "summary": "Prosecutors say an oklahoma woman once married one of her sons — and then, years later, married one of her daughters. That daughter, misty spann of duncan, pleaded guilty to incest on tuesday in stephens county district court. The tulsa world reports the 26-year-old received a 10-year deferred sentence, which the ap describes as 10 years of probation. Her biological mother, 44-year-old patricia spann, has pleaded not guilty to the same charge, which is a felony in oklahoma that carries a sentence of up to 10 years. She has a january court date. Patricia allegedly said she believed the marriage to be legal because she lost custody of her daughter and two sons when they were children ( and reportedly \" hit it off \" with her daughter after reuniting with her in 2014 ) and isn't named on their birth certificates. But the world notes that she used a different name — patricia clayton — when applying for a marriage license in march 2016. Kfor reports the womens ' marriage ended oct. 12 of this year after misty was granted the annulment she filed for, having cited \" illegality and fraud \"; she says her mother told her she sought legal advice that confirmed their union was legal. But the annulment came more than a year after their september 2016 arrest, which came after a state department of human services child welfare investigator responding to an unspecified inquiry suspected the two had an incestuous relationship and alerted police. Det. Dustin smith told koco last year that the women \" told me they got married to basically defraud the state in order to receive more benefits under health care. That sort of thing. \" more on patricia's marriage to her son here.",

Instead, donald trump used it over and over again improperly for his own business and political ventures, says underwood, adding that donald jr., ivanka, and eric trump didn't fulfill their roles as board members in stopping him. President trump quickly refuted the allegations and vowed not to settle the case. Details and developments: out of charities? underwood not only wants to shut down the 31-year-old foundation, she wants to bar donald trump from leading another new york charity for 10 years and his children from serving on any nonprofit boards for a year.

The president is accused of rampant misconduct by using the charity as one of his personal checkbooks, directing funds meant for needy causes to settle business and personal debts, boost his political aspirations and benefit his namesake company, the trump organization. He also filed false statements to the internal revenue service, according to the suit. Barbara underwood, the state's attorney general, is seeking to dissolve the charity and personally penalize trump and three of his children. She said she also sent referral letters to the irs and the federal election commission for further investigations of possible violations of federal law. The lawsuit and referrals deepen the president's extensive legal woes, adding to u.s. Special counsel robert mueller's investigation of his campaign; a federal investigation in new york of his longtime lawyer and fixer michael cohen; civil suits related to hush-money deals; and claims the president's businesses illegally take money from u.s.

In the suit, attorney general barbara underwood asked a state judge to dissolve the donald j. Trump foundation. She asked that its remaining $ 1 million in assets be distributed to other charities and that trump be forced to pay at least $ 2.8 million in restitution and penalties. Underwood also asked that trump be banned from leading any other new york nonprofit organization for 10 years — seeking to apply a penalty usually reserved for the operators of small-time charity frauds to the president of the united states. The allegations of sweeping misuse by trump of his personal foundation came the same day that he faced another legal setback, with the rejection by an appeals court in new york of his request to halt a defamation lawsuit filed by a former \"apprentice \" contestant. That decision leaves open the possibility that trump could be deposed in the case. Meanwhile, underwood sent letters to the internal revenue service and the federal election commission in which she identified what she called \"possible violations \" of tax law"

            "Listen to article 5: 31 president donald trump's personal charity repeatedly and willfully broke state and federal laws by engaging in a decade-long pattern of self-dealing that culminated in illegal coordination with his political campaign, new york alleged in a scathing lawsuit. The president is accused of rampant misconduct by using the charity as one of his personal checkbooks, directing funds meant for needy causes to settle business and personal debts, boost his political aspirations and benefit his namesake company, the trump organization. He also filed false statements to the internal revenue service, according to the suit. Barbara underwood, the state's attorney general, is seeking to dissolve the charity and personally penalize trump and three of his children. She said she also sent referral letters to the irs and the federal election commission for further investigations of possible violations of federal law. The lawsuit and referrals deepen the president's extensive legal woes, adding to u.s. Special counsel robert mueller's investigation of his campaign; a federal investigation in new york of his longtime lawyer and fixer michael cohen; civil suits related to hush-money deals; and claims the president's businesses illegally take money from u.s. And foreign governments. Dissolution of a charity is \" an extraordinarily rare remedy \" sought only when \" the lack of governance or the level of misconduct is so",

Only between 20 % and 30 % of melanomas are associated with moles, they found, while the \" de novo \" cases — those without moles — were more than twice as likely to have cancer advanced past stage 1 when diagnosed. Furthermore, people with de novo melanomas were twice as likely to have thick tumors and 1.6 times as likely to have broken or uneven skin than those with mole-related melanomas. Though it's unclear why, women with de novo melanomas had higher survival rates, while men and women had roughly equal rates when the melanomas were associated with a mole. \" it's very exciting to have some new questions to investigate, \" the researcher said.

        "summary": "Wine bottles are often marked with the phrase \" contains sulfites, \" and drinking wine can cause headaches. But for most people, those two facts are unlikely to be related, writes lettie teague in the wall street journal. That sulfite warning was the result of a legislative effort by the former senator strom thurmond, who was opposed to alcohol. And sulfites actually appear in much higher doses in many other foods, including canned tuna and dried fruit: a couple of ounces of dried apricots has about 112mg of sulfites, while a glass of wine has only about 10. In fact, only about 1 % of americans are sensitive to sulfites. However, there's another substance in wine you may have heard of that could be causing your headache: alcohol. \" sometimes patients tell me they don't have a reaction to wine if they stop at one glass, \" says one doctor quoted in the piece. Her response: \" then, why don't you stop at one glass? \" in addition to alcohol, however, other substances could be causing a problem. A piece in america's test kitchen cited by lifehacker points to histamines, which dilate the blood vessels in your brain, and tyramines, which constrict those vessels. If foods like cheese, horseradish, or maraschino cherries give you a headache, these substances might be the culprit in wine, too. There is, however, good news on the wine-headache front, at least when it comes to hangovers: researchers are investigating a winemaking method that would cut down on the problem.",

        "summary": "An unsolved poisoning case has enthralled china, 19 years after the fact, and now more than 112,000 people have signed a petition asking the white house to investigate and deport a former suspect who is said to have moved to the us. Zhu ling was a chemistry student at a top chinese university when she was poisoned with thallium in 1994, the christian science monitor explains. She survived, but is now almost blind, paralyzed, and suffering from brain damage. Her case attracted quite a bit of attention at the time owing to the fact that she was young, smart, and attractive; it was never solved, and now a recent, similar poisoning has re-ignited interest. Police investigated zhu's roommate, sun wei, who was said to have access to thallium, but she was never charged due to a lack of evidence. Many speculated, however, that evidence was actually covered up because sun's family was politically connected. She changed her name and is thought to live in the us now; in 2005, she even issued a statement declaring her innocence, the new republic adds. The case was brought back to the forefront of public attention last month, when a student was arrested for fatally poisoning his university roommate. A journalist who has followed the case doubts the petition will do any good, but the chinese government has definitely taken notice: censors were briefly removing social media posts about the case, but now even state media are calling for further investigation.",

She did not die, but was left nearly blind, paralyzed, and brain-damaged, needing constant care from her increasingly aged parents. Her fate has not been forgotten, says wu hongfei, a former journalist who has followed ms. Zhu's case closely, partly because she was pretty and smart and partly because tsinghua is so prestigious.

Over the years there has been intense netizen speculation that sun wei, zhu's roommate, was saved from prosecution by her family connections. Sun wei was reportedly the only person in zhu's circle with access to thallium. ( sun wei denies this. ) one theory is that she was motivated by jealousy. Online bulletin board sites were flooded with rumors, accusations of guilt and attempts to even hunt down sun wei. We may never know what really happened. But as a satisfying verdict was never reached in chinese courts, someone appearing to be sun wei ended up testifying in the court of online opinion. The pressure grew so fierce that in 2005, sun wei issued a statement on the popular tianya bulletin board site. \"i am innocent, \" she wrote. \"i am also a victim of"
