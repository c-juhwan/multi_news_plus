Kelly's abuse allegations \" and \" call on those who profit from his music to cut ties, \" says duvernay, who's a member of the committee alongside rhimes and actress jurnee smollett-bell, per usa today. \" we stand linked with our sisters and will no longer tolerate the predatory behavior of r. Kelly to go unchecked, \" smollett-bell adds, per the ap. \" his music must be turned down and the voices of these brave survivors must be heard. \" the women's letter highlights kelly's may 11 concert in north carolina, and npr notes a friday concert in chicago was canceled after similar concerns were voiced. \" i've never heard of a show being canceled because of rumors, but i guess there's a first time for everything, \" kelly later said in a video posted to twitter.",

The 40-year-old homeless man, who was on tuesday arrested in connection with solomon's murder, told police that solomon was drunk and stumbling when he approached him on the edge of the river beneath garibaldi bridge early friday, reports the washington post. Galioto claims solomon slipped over an embankment and into the water after the two argued. Galioto's female companion echoes that story, saying the two \" were pushing each other. Massimo pushed him, the boy pushed back, and then he fell in the water, \" per the local. However, two witnesses told police they saw a man thrown into the river. Roughly $ 1,700 was charged to solomon's credit card on saturday in milan, per the daily beast, which spoke to officials who say they suspect a gang known for targeting foreign tourists may have stolen his wallet and phone. Galioto's companion reports seeing solomon descending the stairs to the river with two people who she says robbed him, per the ap, and the daily beast points out galioto has not been charged with theft. As for his subsequent death, solomon suffered a head wound and police say he may have hit his head on a rock in the river, though an autopsy will determine whether he died by drowning or entered the water dead. The guardian has this line from solomon's father: \" the only doubts we had [ about beau going to rome ] were pickpocketing. \" also wednesday, pope francis met with solomon's parents at the vatican, reports usa today.",

But now medical documents that surfaced in 2010 but have only recently been officially analyzed suggest that at least when he was imprisoned in 1923 after a failed coup he had what's called \" right-side cryptorchidism, \" meaning that testicle never descended into the scrotum, as is typical in childhood, reports the guardian. \" the experienced medical officer immediately recognized the condition, \" german historian peter fleischmann, who analyzed the documents, told german tabloid bild, via the huffington post. His right testicle was \" probably stunted, \" though hitler's childhood doctor apparently told american interrogators in 1943 that his genitals were \" completely normal, \" and a polish priest and amateur historian once said a german army medic who treated hitler mentioned the shrapnel injury. Whether the testicle in question eventually descended and was later injured or never in fact descended at all, it does in fact appear to be true that hitler \" has only got one ball, \" as the song goes. ( other medical notes suggest hitler was fond of cocaine and suffered from uncontrollable flatulence. )",

After the deaths of at least a dozen rangers in the country's virunga national park over a span of just 10 months, the park will be closed to visitors for the remainder of the year, the guardian reports. The news comes after the highly publicized may kidnapping of two british tourists who were ambushed while being driven to their accommodations in the nearly 3,000-square-mile park, which is famously home to more than half of the planet's mountain gorillas; the female ranger accompanying them was shot dead. Rachel makissa baraka, 25, is believed to be the first female ranger killed in the national park, which, having been established in 1925, is the continent's oldest. That incident spurred the park's closure until monday, at which time the park's director announced the \" profoundly difficult \" decision not to reopen until 2019 so as to have time to put in place \" much more robust measures \" regarding safety. \" this will require a very significant investment, \" emmanuel merode wrote in a letter, per reuters.

        "summary": "Playstation users, rejoice: you may soon be watching mtv and the daily show via a new internet stream. That's because sony cut a surprise deal with viacom to stream its cable channels over internet-based pay tv by the end of the year, the wall street journal reports — and those channels include mtv, comedy central, and nickelodeon. The stream will probably run on playstation consoles at first, and appear later on other sony devices like smartphones and tablets. Big companies like google and intel also want in on the streaming game. But sony has talked to other major programmers as well, including cbs, time warner, and walt disney. No word on those, possibly because big entertainment companies either can't or won't undercut deals they've made with pay-tv operators. The big question, per the new york times: will deals like sony-viacom undercut cable companies, sell lots of new online cable packages, or have no effect at all?",

            "Photo in a deal that may signal the start of a new era of competition for entrenched cable and satellite providers, viacom has tentatively agreed to let its popular cable channels — like nickelodeon and mtv — be carried by an internet tv service that sony is creating. The agreement is believed to be the first of its kind between a major programmer and any of the technology giants that are trying to disrupt traditional modes of tv delivery. If other programmers follow suit, sony's as-yet-unnamed service would let paying subscribers receive live cable channels the same way they use on-demand libraries like netflix or hulu. Intel and google are working on similar services, but try to make it more user-friendly, perhaps the way netflix does with personalization features and a fancy interface. Most households today have only a few choices for television service: whatever cable company serves their local area, be it comcast, time warner cable or others, and two satellite providers, directv and dish network. In some parts of the country, television through verizon or at&t is also available. Analysts say cable delivered through the internet could give households many more choices — if the new services give customers more for their money and if cable incumbents don't smother the services. To even have a chance, companies like sony and intel need the permission of programmers, and that's why the viacom deal is considered a breakthrough. Although viacom and sony declined to comment on thursday, a person directly involved in the negotiations confirmed a wall street journal report about the agreement. The person insisted on anonymity because the companies were not prepared to comment on the record. Having the news spread was advantageous for sony, though, because having viacom on board — even just on a preliminary basis — will most likely help the company complete other carriage deals.

        "summary": "The odds of a rate hike by the fed next week just went up even more: the labor department released another solid unemployment report friday morning. Us employers added 235,000 jobs in february, more than expected, and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.8 % to 4.7 %, reports marketwatch. The report is the first to reflect a full month under president trump, and he quickly took notice by retweeting a drudge report headline declaring \" great again: +235,000. \" construction provided the main boost for the jobs increase, accounting for 58,000 of the new hires, notes a post at the wall street journal. The report also showed that average hourly pay rose 2.8 % compared to last february, which the ap characterizes as decent but below a benchmark increase of 3.5 % that would typically be seen in a healthy economy. If anything gives the fed pause in terms of its approach for the rest of the year, it would be this \" somewhat sluggish \" stat, notes the journal. A rate hike by the fed, which meets tuesday and wednesday, would be the third in 15 months. One analyst at investment banking firm jeffries thinks it's a done deal: \" we have a date with a rate hike, \" he tells cnbc in the wake of the report. \" this is pure muscle across the board. \"",

One industry estimate has the \" global body armor and personal protection market \" rising from $ 2.4 billion last year to $ 3.7 billion in 2023. Think snazzy shirts, jackets, and vests that can stop a bullet. \" throughout the decade, there has been a global exponential increase in civilian awareness regarding terrorism or ' of the sort ' violence, \" says the president of new york armor wear company doo aquino. \" wearing stylish body armor has caught on not only in the us, but around the world. \" but expect to shell out. A virginia company called aspetto tells the wire that one of its custom-made bullet-proof suits costs up to $ 5,000. And if you happen to get shot? \" you should get a new suit, \" says a company exec. The clothes are designed to take multiple shots, but repeat performances aren't advised. Fox also takes note of another burgeoning market: some 8 million americans now have permits to carry concealed handguns, and they need clothes to make sure the \" concealed \" part holds true. ( the general trend already has reached the school-age set in the form of bullet-proof backpacks and clothes. )",

Per the new york times, uae attorney general hamad al shamsi accused hedges of \" spying for a foreign country, jeopardizing the military, political, and economic security of the state. \" it revolved around hedges ' postdoctoral work for durham university: the 31-year-old meant to shed more light on how the mideast's 2011 arab spring uprisings affected the uae, but the uae may have \" construed [ it ] as crossing a red line, \" a fellow academic says. Prosecutors say hedges confessed to spying after being presented with \" compelling evidence, \" though hedges has said he's innocent, the bbc reports. A uae life sentence includes a maximum of 25 years behind bars, per the national. Hedges ' family says during the early part of his detention he didn't have access to the british consulate, was kept in solitary and fed a \" cocktail of medication \" by guards, and signed a \" confession \" written in arabic, which hedges doesn't speak or read, per cnn. The ruling appears to have caught the uk off guard, as it has long considered the emirates a close ally. \" today's verdict is not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner, \" british foreign secretary jeremy hunt says, with the bbc noting hunt had been \" given assurances \" just over a week ago from the emirates ' crown prince that this wasn't how things would turn out. Hedges is now \" absolutely terrified \" and \" not well, \" suffering from panic attacks, his wife, daniela tejada, tells the bbc. Hedges has already filed an appeal, and the uae's ambassador to the uk says they're mulling clemency, per the guardian. ( a us student in iran was also accused of spying. )",

Nathan deal announced today. State police will also be involved. Deal said the state government would remain closed tomorrow, and urged people to stay off the roads, cnn reports. Many commuters are still stranded in cars on the highway, and atlanta mayor kasim reed said the city's top priority was to get food, water, and gasoline to them, according to usa today. Both reed and deal defended their storm response, with reed saying he was \" not going to get into the blame game, \" according to the atlanta journal constitution. Reed reveals that there have been more than 791 accidents since last night. Towing companies were peppered with calls, but many couldn't help because their trucks couldn't get through the gridlock either. Tractor trailers have been especially difficult to haul off the roads. \" what's in common in every single accident we have today? tractor trailers, \" complained the state's deputy transportation commissioner. The death toll in atlanta has been low, however, with one teen dying yesterday afternoon on an icy road crash. In alabama, by contrast, five people have died and 23 been injured due to the storm.",

Apparently some iphone 6 and 6 plus owners are frustrated by phones that are pulling out their hair, business insider reports. The issue seems to be the tiny space between aluminum and glass on the outside of the phone; that \" microscopic seam, \" as one twitter user put it, is catching and yanking people's hair — both from their scalps and their beards, says a 9to5mac.com community post. The problem may not be unique to apple, business insider notes; users of the samsung galaxy note 4 complained about a gap between that device's screen and case. Unsurprisingly, various hashtags, including #hairgate and #beardgate, have sprung up regarding the iphone issue — and they've led to some amusing shaving-related memes collected at buzzfeed.",

You can run nowhere. It must have been horrific. \" the defense attorney disputed the murder charge, saying of the shooting, \" was it to kill her, or was it to get her out? all we really know is she locked herself behind the toilet door and she was shot. \" the hearing adjourned without a bail decision, cnn reports. Pistorius will spend the night in jail until it resumes tomorrow morning. As the hearing took place in pretoria, steenkamp was cremated at a ceremony in port elizabeth, where the grief was mixed with anger, reuters reports. \" she was an angel. She was so soft, so innocent. Such a lovely person. It's just sad that this could happen to somebody so good, \" said an ex-jockey who worked for steenkamp's father. \" he must be dealt with harshly, \" he said of pistorius. \" without a doubt he's a danger to the public. \" the olympic and paralympic star stands to lose his medals as well as his freedom, reports the new york daily news.

The moves come before ceo mark zuckerberg testifies before us lawmakers next week over a different scandal. In october, facebook said it would require advertisers running electoral ads to verify their identity and location. It will now extend that requirement to so-called \"issue ads, \" which aim to sway opinions on immigration, gun rights, the economy and other topics. Crucially, the company said it would now also verify the identity of administrators of pages with large followings, making it harder to run them from fake accounts. Facebook pages were used by russian agents to spread misinformation during the 2016 election, according to the us justice department. \"these steps by themselves won't stop all people trying to game the system, \" mark zuckerberg said in a post on his personal facebook page. \"but they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads. \" each electoral and issue ad will be labeled as \"political \" and will include information on who paid for it, which would be required by the honest ads act, transparency legislation that has been introduced in congress, a bill facebook appears to be pre-empting with its new policies.

On friday, just days before its chief executive, mark zuckerberg, is expected to testify before congress, facebook said it had started forcing people who want to buy political or \"issue \" ads to reveal their identities and verify where they are. Mr. Zuckerberg announced the move in a post on facebook. He said this verification was meant to prevent foreign interference in elections, like the ads and posts from so-called russian trolls before and after the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg added that he supported a senate bill, the honest ads act, that would bring political advertising on the internet more in line with what is required on broadcast television. One of the sponsors of the bill, which has some bipartisan support but is still in the committee stage, said that statement was a reversal from what facebook had earlier indicated."

            "In the hope of avoiding future foreign meddling in elections, as was seen in 2016 us presidential campaign, facebook announced today ( april 6 ) some of its most significant efforts to date to boost transparency in political advertising. The moves come before ceo mark zuckerberg testifies before us lawmakers next week over a different scandal. In october, facebook said it would require advertisers running electoral ads to verify their identity and location. It will now extend that requirement to so-called \"issue ads, \" which aim to sway opinions on immigration, gun rights, the economy and other topics. Crucially, the company said it would now also verify the identity of administrators of pages with large followings, making it harder to run them from fake accounts. Facebook pages were used by russian agents to spread misinformation during the 2016 election, according to the us justice department. \"these steps by themselves won't stop all people trying to game the system, \" mark zuckerberg said in a post on his personal facebook page. \"but they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads. \" each electoral and issue ad will be labeled as \"political \" and will include information on who paid for it, which would be required by the honest ads act, transparency legislation that has been introduced in congress, a bill facebook appears to be pre-empting with its new policies. Zuckerberg reiterated his support for the legislation in his post, although as quartz has reported, the",
            "San francisco — for months, facebook's critics — ranging from silicon valley executives to washington politicians — have been urging the company to do a better job of identifying who is buying political ads and creating pages about hot-button topics on its social media sites. On friday, just days before its chief executive, mark zuckerberg, is expected to testify before congress, facebook said it had started forcing people who want to buy political or \"issue \" ads to reveal their identities and verify where they are. Mr. Zuckerberg announced the move in a post on facebook. He said this verification was meant to prevent foreign interference in elections, like the ads and posts from so-called russian trolls before and after the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg added that he supported a senate bill, the honest ads act, that would bring political advertising on the internet more in line with what is required on broadcast television. One of the sponsors of the bill, which has some bipartisan support but is still in the committee stage, said that statement was a reversal from what facebook had earlier indicated."

Tetyana chornovil, 34, was driving home outside the capital of kiev when an suv blocked her path. \" the jeep hit me. It tried to kill me, \" chornovil said. \" they broke my window. I jumped out, tried to run. I was caught and they began beating me. \" photos and a video show her with a black eye, swollen shut, and swollen and bloody lips. Two men have been detained and a third identified in the assault that came as protesters — angry over president viktor yanukovich's refusal to sign agreements with the eu amid a financial crisis — have been gathering in kiev's independence square. A protest organizer was stabbed four times earlier this week, and protesters are now calling for interior minister vitaly zakharchenko's resignation, reuters reports; he'd previously come under fire for a violent crackdown on protesters. Prior to her attack, chornovil had posted photos of zakharchenko's handsome home. \" here lives the executioner, \" the journalist wrote.",

Satellite images show the existence of ancient stone structures built thousands of years ago in what is now an inhospitable part of saudi arabia, reports livescience. Archaeologists led by david kennedy of the university of western australia call them \" gates \" because they resemble field gates from above. In a paper in the november issue of arabian archaeology and epigraphy, kennedy writes of about 400 such structures built somewhere between 2,000 and 9,000 years ago. They are generally in what are now volcanic lava fields, though it's possible the land wasn't quite so unfit for humans when the structures went up. The big question is why. \" i don't know what they are, \" kennedy tells the new york times. \" they don't look like structures where people lived, and they don't look like animal traps, \" he says, adding that they're probably too low for the latter. Most of the \" gates \" are about 700 feet long, though one extends for 1,700 feet, per news.com.au. Johnson has previously discovered similar structures in neighboring jordan via airplane trips, though he thinks those ( which resemble kites ) were likely animal traps and probably came along after the \" gates. \" one researcher not involved with the study calls it intriguing, but says he wishes kennedy would have offered a theory, if only to discourage speculation about extraterrestrial origins associated with other such finds.

But gabi's portage bay neighbors describe something else entirely: a house of horrors that attracts up to 100 cawing crows, seagulls, and pigeons at a time that scatter bird droppings, feathers, dirt, and peanut shells all over the neighborhood and attract rats, the seattle times reports. Now at least two neighbors have joined together in a $ 200,000 suit against gabi's parents, lisa and gary mann — and other neighbors are considering joining the suit, since they say they've tried talking to the manns to no avail. One of the neighbors ' major beefs: the manns are framing it as a little girl who's just feeding birds. Not so, the lawyer for the two suing homeowners tells kiro 7. \" the scope and scale of the feeding is not the work of a minor child, \" she says. \" the mother, lisa mann, is responsible for the vast majority of [ it ]. Gary and lisa mann have also constructed extraordinarily large feeding stations and hired employees to help carry out the feedings... And related activities, [ which ] have run nearly every day, year-round, from the morning hours to as late as midnight. \" the suit also notes the peanut shell problem — an issue for residents with severe allergies, the times notes. A trial date has been set, but it's not till aug. 6, 2016. \" my clients hope the feeding will stop before then, \" the lawyer tells the paper. ( there might be something to gabi's bond with the crows after all. )",

The journal reports the labor force participation rate has barely budged in a year, with december's 62.7 % up only slightly from 62.4 % a year prior.

In that situation, the election would be decided in congress, opening up the chance for mcmullin.

Turkey buys stolen oil from syria and iraq and then resells it, and \" the appalling part about it is that the country's top political leadership is involved in the illegal business — president erdogan and his family, \" said anatoly antonov, per usa today. Antonov said the oil is moved from isis territory to turkey via tanker trucks, adding that moscow has satellite images and video to prove it. Erdogan countered that he considers the allegations \" slander \" and said he would step down if they are proven, reports reuters. The russian ministry displayed images allegedly showing tanker trucks stocking up on oil at isis posts in syria and iraq, and then crossing into turkey. Antonov gave no evidence implicating erdogan or his family, though he did note that one of erdogan's sons is energy minister, while another is head of \" one of the biggest energy companies. \" he then pressed journalists to conduct their own investigations. \" we are confident that, with your help, truth will prevail, \" he said. Russia also accused turkey of supplying 2,000 militants, 120 tons of ammunition, and 250 vehicles to islamic state and nusra groups in the past week alone, reports sputnik news.",

        "summary": "A viola player in britain has won an unusual legal case against the royal opera house seen as groundbreaking in the music industry. Chris goldscheider says he got blasted so loudly by the brass section during a 2012 rehearsal that it permanently wrecked his hearing and ended his music career, reports the bbc. On wednesday, britain's high court of justice agreed the 45-year-old suffered \" acoustic shock \" during the rehearsal of wagner's die walkure and is entitled to damages. Goldscheider is asking for about $ 1 million in lost wages; the court will decide the amount later. The royal opera house, for its part, is skeptical that the relatively new concept of acoustic shock even exists and maintains that goldscheider instead developed something called meniere's disease that explains his vertigo, nausea, and inability to endure noises, per the guardian. \" this is the first time that the court has explored the music industry's legal obligations towards the hearing of musicians, and the first time that acoustic shock has been recognized as a compensatable condition by the court, \" says goldscheider's attorney. That particular piece by wagner is notoriously loud, and goldscheider had the misfortune of sitting directly in front of the brass section, explains the washington post. At one point, the volume reached more than 130 decibels, the equivalent of a jet engine a mere 100 feet away. Goldscheider had been wearing orchestra-supplied ear plugs, but he says they weren't enough to protect him from the booming trumpets, horns, and trombones, with the principal trumpet singled out as the main villain. He quit the music business for good in 2014 and says he had to move his family to the country to avoid city noises.",

        "summary": "A purported psychic who conned her victims out of $ 341,000 was sentenced friday to six years in prison. Gina marie marks, 45, operated \" readings by natalie \" out of a home in bethesda, md., but the $ 100 tarot card readings she offered were just the beginning, the washington post reports. From there, she convinced clients to withdraw large amounts of cash and hide it in pillowcases or under mattresses so energy from their bodies could travel to the bills; then the clients were to give marks the cash — the more they gave, the more committed they were to marks ' \" spirit guides \" — so she could put it on an altar at her church in order to break evil curses placed on the client or carry out spells for the client. If clients emptied their bank accounts, they were told to make pricey purchases like designer handbags, using a credit card, for the same ritual. Though clients were told the money and items would be returned, they never were. Marks was convicted of defrauding five clients for amounts ranging from $ 2,655 to $ 153,400 each; she had pleaded guilty to felony theft in february, nbc washington reports. Victims say if they balked at the amount of money they were told to hand over, marks would accuse them of not taking the work seriously or warn them that their doubts would anger the spirit guides. She convinced them of her authenticity by using phone spoofing — she would tell a client someone ( say, an ex over whom the client was heartbroken ) would call on a certain day and time, but warn the client not to answer; phone spoofing allowed marks to place the call from her own number, but make it appear as if it was coming from the ex's number. Marks, whose lawyer said she is prepared to pay almost $ 129,500 of the total amount due in restitution, insisted to the judge her work was legitimate and that she cared about her clients. To that, the judge said he felt he was being \" scammed. \"",

Los angeles mayor antonio villaraigosa has already said he would sign the new ordinance, backed by councilman joe buscaino, who introduced the issue in early may, he said, in response to the recent deaths of two teenage skateboarders who died while hill-bombing. \" it's very serious when young, talented lives are lost; we have to respond, \" councilman richard"

The coffee chain — which launched the free tuition program less than a year ago — says it will now cover the cost of an entire four years of college for workers who enroll in arizona state university's online program, reuters reports. Starbucks says workers will now be reimbursed for tuition at the end of every semester, cnn reports. \" the unfortunate reality is that too many americans can no longer afford a college degree, particularly disadvantaged young people, \" says ceo howard schultz, who predicts the company will spend $ 250 million on the program over the next decade. The offer is open to all employees who work at least 20 hours a week, and starbucks says around 2,000 workers are already taking part in its free tuition program. The only catch appears to be that, unlike tuition reimbursement plans at other firms, this program is limited to a single university's online program, quartz reports. Still, analysts say it looks like a pretty smart move from the company after its widely mocked campaign to start conversations about race relations. \" compared to the race together idea, which was as half-baked as it gets, this idea is a home run on several levels, \" the ceo of brand consultancy agilecat tells usa today. \" it's a big bounce back for starbucks. \" ( families making less than $ 125,000 a year no longer have to contribute to tuition at stanford. )",

        "summary": "A shouting match between a democrat and a republican over the firing of house chaplain rev. Pat conroy became so heated tuesday evening that witnesses thought one of them might throw a punch. It began when gop rep. Tom macarthur walked to the democratic side of the floor and accused democratic caucus chairman joe crowley of \" politicizing \" the firing with a resolution for a special investigation of it, cnn reports. During the ensuing squabble, crowley banged his fist on the table, gestured for macarthur to get back to his side of the chamber, and shouted that he was offended by the firing of the chaplain, adding that house speaker paul ryan was the one who had politicized things by forcing conroy to resign. A source tells politico that macarthur, an episcopalian, told crowley, who is catholic, that it wasn't a partisan issue because he is a republican and he regularly prays with the catholic chaplain. House minority whip steny hoyer eventually calmed the men down. \" in new jersey, we don't back down from people, \" macarthur later said, per abc7. \" you know he's 6 ' 4 \", i ' m 5 ' 6 \". If he wants to take a punch at me, you know let him have at it. \" crowley's office says the argument would never have come to blows. Conroy was reinstated this week after rescinding the resignation he said ryan had asked him to sign. Ryan says he met with conroy over a cup of coffee tuesday and they \" absolutely \" agreed to put the episode behind them.",

Tech entrepreneur justin keller, who launched the website commando.io, penned an open letter monday to the mayor and police chief of san francisco, where he's lived for three years, to sound off about his \" concern and outrage \" regarding the city's homeless and drug problem, the guardian reports. \" the city is becoming a shanty town … worst of all, it is unsafe, \" he wrote on his personal blog. He noted his parents had been in town over the weekend and had run into three intimidating situations involving homeless or seemingly high people. \" what are you going to do to address this problem? \" he asked. \" i know people are frustrated about gentrification happening in the city, but the reality is, we live in a free market society. \" \" the wealthy working people have earned their right to live in the city, \" he added. \" they went out, got an education, [ worked ] hard, and earned it. I shouldn't have to worry about being accosted. I shouldn't have to see the pain, struggle, and despair of homeless people to and from my way to work every day. \" he noted the city had made the homeless and \" riff raff \" disappear during the super bowl. In addition to keller being dressed down on twitter, a homeless person interviewed by the guardian simply said of such \" tech bros \" that \" they don't care about nobody but themselves. \" keller updated his blog to apologize for using the word \" riff raff, \" saying it was \" insensitive and counterproductive. \" but in an email to the guardian, he said, \" i in no way meant to vilify homeless or drug users, my frustration was that we as citizens don't feel safe. … instead of crucifying me, we all as citizens should be crucifying the city and elected government officials for ineptness. \"",

        "summary": "Wednesday's gop undercard debate may not have as many viewers as the main event, but lindsey graham brought his a material anyway, launching quips at china, bernie sanders, and even himself. Cnn reports some of his one-liners inspired only tepid laughter in the colorado audience. And maggie haberman at the new york times says graham's jokes are all pre-canned and won't help him with voters. Regardless — on a night he was facing the similarly low-polling rick santorum, george pataki, and bobby jindal — it was enough to get attention. Here are graham's five best lines of the night. On bernie sanders: \" the number two guy went to the soviet union on his honeymoon and i don't think he ever came back. \" on china: \" when it comes to dealing with me, you've got a clenched fist and an open hand. You pick... Make me commander in chief and this crap stops. \" on beer: \"if you're looking for good beer policy, i ' m your best bet. My dad owned a bar. \" on the university of colorado: \" looking at their academic standards, the only way i could have gotten into this university is to be invited to this debate tonight. \" on the democratic candidates: \" if we don't beat these people, who the hell are we going to beat? \"",

            "Photo: jim wilson/the new york times; video: by cnbc carly fiorina got a big boost from an earlier debate, and then her campaign faded a bit. Her response this time: hit hard on the theme of the big and powerful versus the small and the powerless. It's a fascinating argument for a woman who once was squarely in the former category. She served as the chief executive of hewlett-packard, one of the nation's largest, richest companies. She and her company were definitely the big and powerful. But in the wake of mitt romney's struggles in the 2012 campaign, it's clear that being perceived that way won't work with voters. And worse, the country has shifted even more since then toward a populism that questions the benefits that go to the rich and powerful. Mrs. Fiorina clearly gets that. In her remarks during the debate, she repeatedly talked about what she called \"crony capitalism, \" which she defined as big, powerful companies partnering with a big, powerful government to get ahead at the expense of others. \"this is how socialism starts, \" she said. \"government causes a problem, and then government steps in to solve a problem. \" will it work? her republican colleagues have so far resisted attacking her c.e.o. Credentials. ( with the exception of donald j. Trump, who has in the past accused her of being a terrible leader of the company. ) but the democrats would not be so friendly if she were to get the nomination. President obama's aides seized on mr. Romney's business background and — with the help of a leaked audio recording of comments that mr. Romney made about the \"47 percent \" — helped turn that background into a political albatross. Mrs. Fiorina is hoping to avoid the same fate if she becomes the republican nominee."

Nel tried to paint pistorius as controlling — a text from reeva steenkamp said he \" snapped at her \" for chewing gum — selfish, and a negligent gun owner; pistorius admitted he usually carried his gun with a bullet in the chamber. But the athlete had a chance to respond to some of nel's more damning statements. A look at what went down today, per the ap and bbc: interpreting a text from steenkamp that read \" i ' m scared of u, \" pistorius said, \" she's scared of the feelings she had for me and the way i brushed her off. \" in response to other messages, he added, \" i think she was feeling at the time upset and exaggerated on some of the things that she said. \" why did the couple never say \" i love you \" in messages? nel asked, pointing out that all of their messages only contained the phrase twice, in both instances from steenkamp to her mother. \" i never got the opportunity to tell reeva i loved her, \" pistorius said. \" we were in the foundation phase of our relationship — still opening up to each other, still starting to trust each other. \" as to why he told a pal to take the fall for a gun incident at a restaurant, he said he feared the media would print lies, though he added, \" i know my finger was not on the trigger... I don't recall how it went off. \" ( nel sarcastically described the discharge as a \" miracle. \" ) the couple apparently fought over the kendrick lamar rap song \" b****, don't kill my vibe, \" which steenkamp didn't want pistorius to play.

Only in the case of a 42-year-old man who went to the emergency room at our lady of lourdes medical center in new jersey immediately following a seizure, the data tracked on his fitbit helped inform doctors of the appropriate course of action to take to save his life, those docs report in the journal annals of emergency medicine. It's the first time a fitness tracker has been used like this, reports gizmodo. The key question in this case was whether the irregularly high and erratic heartbeat ( atrial fibrillation ) he suffered three hours prior to the seizure — which they wouldn't have known about had it not been for the man's tracker — was chronic or episodic. If chronic, resetting his heart rate via rhythm conversion, essentially shocking it back to normal, could dislodge a clot, cause a stroke, and possibly kill the man. But the fitbit revealed exactly when he had a spike in heart rate and that it was abnormal, and his tracker from that day even reveals ( through the subsequent slowing of his heart rate ) when the drug diltiazem was administered. \" not all activity trackers measure heart rates, but this is the function of most value to medical providers, \" says one of the authors, per the huffington post, which notes that the devices aren't medical but may be used in this way more in the future as they become more reliable.

In an editorial, the tribune says it is time for the 83-year-old hatch to \" call it a career \" after 42 years in the senate, citing his role in dismantling two national monuments, his work on the controversial tax overhaul as chairman of the senate finance committee, and his \" utter lack of integrity that rises from his unquenchable thirst for power. \" hatch, now in his seventh term, is the longest-serving republican senator in history. The \" anti-environmental, anti-native american and, yes, anti-business decommissioning \" shrinking of the grand staircase-escalante and bears ears national monuments appears to be \" basically a political favor the white house did for hatch \" in return for his support of the tax plan, the tribune editorial board writes. But what should end his career, the tribune writes, is the fact that he promised in 2012 that this would be his last term, but now appears to be planning another run in 2018. The paper calls the flip-flop \" basically a theft from the utah electorate. \" mitt romney was rumored to be planning a run for the senate seat if hatch stepped down, the hill notes.

        "summary": "The army's elite ranger school got underway yesterday, but this class of hopefuls makes a little history as it includes the first female soldiers to attempt ranger training, reports the army times. Opening the training is part of the army's efforts to assess the possibility of integrating women soldiers into combat roles. At the end of day one, these were the numbers: the 399 soldiers had to complete 49 push-ups in two minutes, 59 sit-ups in two minutes, a 5-mile run in less than 40 minutes, and six chin-ups. Sixteen of 19 female soldiers passed, which, per fox news, is a 16 % failure rate. Of 380 male soldiers, 78 failed the test, a 20 % failure rate. The first four days — dubbed the ranger assessment phase — are the most brutal, with some 60 % of all failures occurring. Ranger school lasts 62 days, notes the washington post, and is not for the faint of heart: only about half those who attempt the training pass. In coming days, soldiers will also do a 12-mile march carrying 45 pounds, conduct a navigation exercise without gps, complete a water survival test, and scale a 35-foot tower. And they ' ll have to do it on a max of four hours of sleep a night. Female soldiers who graduate get a certificate and ranger tab, but they will not join the 75th ranger regiment.",

The female candidates joined 380 male soldiers to take on the ranger physical fitness assessment – a pass-fail event that prevents many from entering the course.
