The filing lists both his assets and liabilities as between $ 10 million and $ 50 million. It comes after a new york jury on friday ordered jackson to pay $ 5 million to lastonia leviston, who said he acquired a sex tape she made with her boyfriend, added himself as a crude commentator, and posted it online without her permission. ( forbes calls jackson's filing \" suspiciously timed. \" ) wearing a wig and calling himself pimpin ' curly in the video, jackson made explicit remarks about leviston and taunted her former boyfriend and his rap rival, rick ross, the ap reports. Jackson got the 2008 tape from the man in the video, leviston's boyfriend at the time. The rapper and his lawyers say jackson didn't actually post the video but that leviston's then-boyfriend said she wouldn't mind if he did, and he thought that would suffice. \" this was something done to me, \" leviston says. \" i didn't have a choice. I would never, ever do this to myself. \" ( he joins these other celebs who have declared bankruptcy. )",

        "summary": "An impressive cast including robert redford, nick nolte, and emma thompson can't save a walk in the woods, a new flick based on bill bryson's travel memoir of the same name. It's a trip better left untaken, according to most critics. ( it's just below the 50 % positive mark at rotten tomatoes. ) here's what they're saying: want to see \" two of america's finest screen actors completely humiliate themselves \"? then you're in the right theater, jr jones writes at the chicago reader. Redford plays bryson, who attempts to hike the appalachian trail with his buddy, played by nolte. \" nick offerman and kristen schaal turn up briefly to provide some comic relief, \" jones adds. The only problem is that's something \" you're not supposed to need when the movie itself is a comedy. \" the flick has \" a few too many side characters \" and \" a sitcom heart, but that doesn't ruin the journey, \" writes joe neumaier at the new york daily news. Redford gives \" a natural curiosity \" to a \" stuffy \" character, he says. Meanwhile, \" nolte's way with a joke is nimble, and his delivery is spot-on. \" neumaier adds, \" while older audiences will go for it, even viewers who haven't acquired the wisdom of age can learn something. \" bilge ebiri suggests this might be an example of \" exceptionally lazy filmmaking. \" it's \" a road movie without a road, a journey of self-discovery without discovery, and a tale of friendship without any chemistry, \" ebiri writes at vulture. Nolte's \" aura suits the role and the movie. But nothing else works, \" including the \" lowest-common-denominator gags executed with little energy or conviction. \" colin covert is on an entirely different page. Though he isn't known for his comedic chops, \" released from the shackles of his serious stereotype, redford glorifies every gag in the script, \" he writes at the minneapolis star tribune. Then there's nolte, who's \" divine \" and \" perfect for the unfit, funny, slovenly steven katz. \" overall, covert says a walk in the woods is \" a first-rate movie \" and \" warmly entertaining. \"",

        "summary": "The popular and controversial \" missing richard simmons \" podcast is now complete, though the central question of why the fitness celeb abruptly ditched public life in 2014 remains unanswered. Was the podcast an invasion of privacy or fair game? here's a look at coverage related to that question and about simmons himself: the basics: former daily show producer dan taberski, a student in simmons ' exercise class, created the six-episode podcast to explore why simmons stopped showing up for classes, or anywhere really, without explanation in 2014. It quickly shot to no. 1 on itunes. See story. The critics: one of the most widely circulated criticisms of the show came from amanda hess at the new york times, who called it \" morally suspect. \" plenty of others had the same theme, including jessica brown at the week, who complained that \" no one is talking about how insensitive this podcast is, and how it disregards the privacy a man who wishes, for whatever reason, to be left alone. \" backlash to criticism: at the daily beast, ben collins thinks the critics should lighten up. Simmons is an \" extremely public figure \" who vanished under seemingly odd circumstances. \" ah, yes. That old journalistic mantra: you should probably just leave that shady situation — the one that goes unsolved even after months of interstate investigation — entirely alone. \" ditto: glenn dixon at the washington post argues that the podcast is a legit way for fans to mourn the absence of their hero. Given his stature, \" it's unacceptable for simmons to walk away without ceremony. \" expect more: sarah larson at new york also thinks simmons'status as a public figure saves the show, \" if just, \" but she also thinks the show raises ethical questions about podcasts that explore \" real-life mysteries. \" in fact, the \" serial \" spinoff \" s-town, \" which will put the spotlight on a small alabama town, debuts next week. \" we ' ll be having these conversations in the weeks, months, and years to come. \" read it in full here. Simmons'reaction: a longtime rep says simmons is aware of the swirling rumors — he's transitioning to a female! he's being held hostage by his housekeeper! — and is unfazed. \"i said to him the other day, 'there are people that think you are a very overweight, depressed woman.

The campaign was cut off from its voter database after accusations it accessed similar data belonging to the clinton campaign. But sanders campaign manager jeff weaver says that was an \" inappropriate overreaction \" on the part of the dnc, according to cnn. The ap reports weaver claims the dnc is \" actively attempting to undermine \" the sanders campaign. \" individual leaders of the dnc can support hillary clinton in any way they want, but they are not going to sabotage our campaign, \" politico quotes weaver, who also described the voter data as being \" stolen \" and held \" hostage \" by the dnc. The clinton voter data was available to the sanders campaign because of a software error, politico reports. The fired staffer who accessed the data claims he was only trying to find out how badly the glitch had compromised the sanders campaign's own data, according to cnn. Without access to its database, the sanders campaign could have a hard time reaching out to voters a day before the third democratic presidential debate and weeks before the iowa caucuses. Weaver called the voter database the campaign's \" lifeblood, \" politico reports. The dnc has said it will consider whether or not to restore the campaign's access to its data after it gets a report on how the clinton data was used and confirmation all copies have been destroyed.",

        "summary": "Need a reason to watch less tv? here are eight: cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, influenza/pneumonia, parkinson's, liver disease, and suicide. Scientists are telling people to get off the couch after a study found a link between tv binge-watching and those leading causes of death. Researchers at the national cancer institute studied more than 221,000 people, aged 50 to 71, who had no chronic disease at the outset in 1995. Over 16 years, they found those who watched seven or more hours of tv per day were 47 % more likely to die from any one cause, compared to those who watched tv for less than an hour, reports medical news today. Those who, like 80 % of americans, watched tv for three to four hours per day had a 15 % higher chance of death. That was true even after researchers considered factors like calories and alcohol consumed, and whether people smoked. The study's lead author notes that because \" television viewing is the most prevalent leisure-time sedentary behavior \" — americans spend more than half of their leisure time in front of the tv, she says — it's likely \" an indicator of overall physical inactivity, \" per a release. She adds the \" results fit within a growing body of research indicating that too much sitting can have many different adverse health effects, \" though she cautions that because links to some causes of death appeared for the first time in this study, more research is needed. As a blogger and tv fan at refinery 29 points out, it's not tv itself causing the harm, but too much on-your-butt time, especially when paired with junk food. Want to live longer but still binge-watch your favorite show every now and then? exercise helps, \" although we found that exercise did not fully eliminate risks associated with prolonged television viewing, \" says the researcher.

A look at what the outcome means for both campaigns: one common theme: the virtual tie is an ok result for clinton but an \" ominous one \" for sanders, as this new york times analysis argues. The thinking: iowa democrats are a white and liberal bunch, and sanders should have done better. An analysis at the week makes a similar case, with a headline referring to sanders ' \" stinging defeat. \" if he can't win here, he's likely in big trouble in a national race, it notes. Vox has a much more optimistic take about sanders ' \" remarkably strong \" performance and chalks it up to young voters. Along those lines, john cassidy at the new yorker calls sanders the night's \" big winner. \" he \" confirmed his capture of the party's under-forty wing, which means trouble for hillary clinton \" — especially if the rising marco rubio ends up as the gop nominee. Politico has a glum analysis for camp clinton: when this campaign started, iowa was supposed to be a resounding victory, not a \" tentative first step. \" clinton's \" inability to ride a first-class ground organization to triumph underscores the candidate's weakness and the lack of a message that resonates with primary voters. \" a similar take at the washington post: sanders did well with liberals, young voters, and independents, writes karen tumulty. \" the photo finish showed that republicans are not the only voters looking for qualities beyond experience and electability. \"",

Rich beausoleil, the state's bear and cougar specialist, said this was only the second fatality in the state in the last 94 years. Wildlife authorities say the injured man was alerted to the cougar upon hearing the screams of his companion. Realizing they were being stalked, officials say the men did what experts say to do: make noise and distract the animal. The efforts appeared to work, but the cougar returned after the men believed it had been scared away. The first man was attacked and dragged away. As the surviving man rode off, he was attacked but was able to climb back onto his bike and escape. The survivor rode 2 miles to find cell phone reception and call for help. Sgt. Ryan abbott with the king county sheriff's office told the ap when rescuers arrived it took them about 30 minutes to locate the second victim, who was dead with the cougar standing on top of him. \" the deputies shot at him and spooked him, and he ran off, \" he said. It took several hours before authorities found the cougar up a tree and killed it. While the cougar was being hunted, rescuers had to wait to retrieve the dead man's body. The surviving victim was initially listed in serious condition but has been upgraded to satisfactory. Cougars, also known as mountain lions and pumas, are a protected species, the seattle times reports. Each year, the state allows 250 cougars to be hunted and killed in 50 designated zones.",

In a 3,500-word essay, the former canadian radio personality veers between defensiveness, self-pity, and contrition as he chronicles his professional and financial collapse. More than 20 women made allegations of being choked, smothered, bitten, slapped, and punched by him, yet he doesn't apologize: \" even as i feel deep remorse... I cannot confess to the accusations that are inaccurate, \" writes the former cbc radio host, who was acquitted in 2016 after apologizing to one woman to avoid another trial. \" what i do confess is that i was emotionally thoughtless in the way i treated those i dated and tried to date. \" that confession — along with his concession that he was \" probably a sexual bully \" — is ringing hollow for many readers, the toronto star reports. \" accountability for me would be reaching out to the people that you harmed and being accountable to them, \" says farrah khan, an expert on sexual violence. New york-based writer moira donegan tweets that \" being a man credibly accused of sexual harassment or assault is one of the more surefire ways for an aspiring writer to find magazine work. \" review editor ian burama then defended his publication's decision to run an article by the widely reviled #metoo figure: \" i am not going to defend his behavior, and i don't know if what all these women are saying is true, \" the 66-year-old tells slate. \" perhaps it is.

Taylor clark, who had just taken his last exam at southern illinois university edwardsville, brought a soda to his girlfriend at work monday morning, then drove to a truck driver training center in hazelwood, missouri, to meet a prospective buyer. Emails show michael gordon, an employee of the facility, wanted to discuss clark's 2007 nissan 350zx and perhaps take a test drive. But clark, 19, never returned home. After family reported him missing, police found his car in the center's parking lot and his body in a nearby wooded area. \" there was an attempt to cover him, \" officer tim fagan tells the belleville news-democrat. Police tell ktvi that gordon met clark on his lunch break, shot him once, moved his body, then returned to work. Police believe gordon, who is being held at the st. Louis county jail on a $ 1 million bond, acted alone, though they're exploring the idea that clark had company. \" we're looking at the possibility that there was someone with him, \" fagan says. Authorities are still searching for the murder weapon and gordon's car, a red 1990 bmw 325i. Workers at an illinois convenience store where clark worked say he was adored. \" he would dance behind the counter, \" the manager says. \" the customers loved him. His co-workers loved him.

        "summary": "The supreme court wrestled with a high-profile case on wednesday — how far religious groups must go in helping employees gain access to birth control under obamacare. Based on the arguments, don't expect a clear resolution: the new york times reports that a 4-4 tie is a \" real possibility, \" an outcome that would not set national legal precedent but would affirm the four lower-court rulings under review. All of those rulings sided in favor of obamacare, but the upshot is that until a national precedent is set, \" religious groups in different parts of the country would have conflicting obligations if they object to covering contraception. \" and the ap notes that the case could be re-argued anyway when a ninth justice joins the court. The linchpin of the case comes down to a single word — \" hijacking, \" writes lyle denniston at scotusblog. It came up in various forms seven times during arguments, he observes. Religious employers that oppose covering contraceptives accuse the government of \" hijacking \" their plans. The health care law allows such groups to opt out of providing birth-control coverage as long as they fill out a form and notify the government they are doing so. The government then steps in to make sure the coverage is provided. Religious groups say this workaround \" still makes them complicit in providing contraception for their employees, \" notes npr. John roberts, samuel alito, and clarence thomas seem to agree, and, based on his skeptical questions and comments wednesday, swing vote anthony kennedy does, too. \" the church plans here, religious organization plans here, are, in effect, subsidizing the conduct that they deemed immoral, \" kennedy said at one point. The justices could say as early as next week if they seem destined for a 4-4 tie, or wait until june, reports the ap.",

I ' m freer than colleagues who will face the voters again. I can speak my mind without fearing the consequences much. \" and speak his mind he does, writing bluntly that \" i don't know how much longer i ' ll be here.... Maybe i ' ll be gone before you read this. \" but before that happens, mccain has \" some work that needs finishing.... And i want to talk to my fellow americans a little more if i may. \" a few highlights: on president trump: \" he has declined to distinguish the actions of our government from the crimes of despotic ones. The appearance of toughness, or a reality show facsimile of toughness, seems to matter more than any of our values. \" on ideological divides: \" we are secluding ourselves in ideological ghettos. We have our own news sources. We exchange ideas mostly or exclusively with people who agree with us, and troll those who don't. Increasingly, we have our own facts to reinforce our convictions and any empirical evidence that disputes them is branded as ' fake. ' \" on the current state of politics: \" i suspect ( humility has ) never been in abundant supply in most human enterprises. And i don't mean modesty. Any politician worth a damn can fake modesty. Humility is the self-knowledge that you possess as much inherent dignity as anyone else, and not one bit more. \" upset by incivility? get off your butt: \" because i guarantee you, voters on the far right and far left are. If you want politics to be more civil, if you want congress to argue less and get more done, then show up. Represent. Play as big a role in the mundane activities of politics as the zealots do. \" before he ' leaves ': \" i would like to see us recover our sense that we are more alike than different. \" ( mccain's son-in-law says the senator told him to \" take care of meghan. \" )",

In an interview with matt lauer wednesday on today, jennifer appel, 48, said the fishing vessel rammed their 50-foot sailboat on purpose. \" the taiwanese fishing vessel was not planning to rescue us, \" she said. \" they tried to kill us during the night. \" she said that was what finally prompted her to call the coast guard for help — after never activating their boat's emergency beacon — which she did by using a surfboard to board the fishing vessel and use its satellite phone. Appel earlier claimed she and tasha fuiava, 26, were beset by a force 11 storm with massive waves soon after leaving hawaii in may, but noaa has no record of that size a storm in the area at the time, people reports. On wednesday, appel said she believes officials are underestimating storm sizes. Fuiava, on the other hand, said she slept through the storm, which apparently took out their boat's engine and damaged its mast. The pair also maintained tiger sharks repeatedly hit the boat with their tails despite experts saying that would be highly unusual. Appel said the sharks were telling them, \" you're in our living room. \" a couple other oddities from the interview: appel denied the coast guard's claim that it contacted them in june; denied, in fact, ever actually being \" lost at sea \"; and, as time reports, twice interrupted lauer to plug her garmin gps and katadyn water purifier.",

The proportion of obese people worldwide now stands at 11 % among men and 15 % among women, while 9 % of men and 10 % of women are underweight, according to researchers who analyzed data on 20 million people in 186 countries for a study in the lancet medical journal. The researchers warn that if current trends continue, there's no chance of meeting the global target of keeping obesity at 2010 levels in 2025. Instead, they predict that around a fifth of adults worldwide will be obese by 2025. \" although it is reassuring that the number of underweight individuals has decreased over the last four decades, global obesity has reached crisis point, \" warns lead researcher majid ezzati of imperial college london. To tackle the crisis, he says, there should be global initiatives to ensure that healthy food isn't more expensive than unhealthy, highly processed food. In a lancet editorial, george davey smith from the university of bristol says we are living in \" a fatter, healthier, but more unequal world. \" he warns that focusing on obesity in wealthy countries could divert resources away from regions like east africa and south asia, where a high proportion of people are still underweight.

The number of people across the globe whose weight poses a serious threat to their health is greater than ever before – professor majid ezzati study author the study, published in the journal the lancet, calculated and compared bmi among adult men and women from 1975 to 2014. Bmi is a measure of a person's weight for their height, and indicates whether their weight is healthy. The data revealed that in four decades global obesity among men has tripled - from 3.2 % in 1975 to 10.8 %. Obesity among women meanwhile has more than doubled, from 6.4 % in 1975 to 14.9 % in 2014. This translates as 266 million obese men and 375 million obese women in the world in 2014. It also means the world's population has become heavier by around 1.5kg"

Earlier this year, bormida was offering $ 2,175 to people willing to move there in an effort to stave off its extinction. Facing the prospect of a similar future, little albinen may soon significantly up the ante. The local reports the village of 240 people that overlooks the rhone valley from an altitude of 4,200 feet will vote nov. 30 on whether or not to pay more than $ 25,500 per adult and $ 10,200 per child to families willing to relocate there. With a lack of jobs, residents — especially young families — have been leaving albinen, according to euronews. In fact, the village's school was forced to close recently when three families moved away and took their eight children with them. Should albinen residents approve the proposal, the money would come with some stipulations: new residents must be under the age of 45, they must agree to live in albinen for 10 years ( or repay the money ), they must buy or build property worth at least $ 204,000, and the property must be their primary residence. The community newsletter calls it \" an investment in the village's future. \" albinen authorities believe the proposal will make them money in the long run through new taxpayers, new construction, and increased shopping. And while there aren't many jobs in albinen, there are a few villages nearby. Plus, as curbed notes, it's on the \" sunny side \" of the rhone valley.

The paper calls heracleum mantegazzianum \" one of mother nature's nastier creations, \" and makes clear why: its sap, which is found on pretty much all of the plant ( roots, leaves, seeds, flowers, etc. ) can blister or scar the skin of any who touch it. Get it in your eye and temporary or permanent blindness can follow, per the michigan department of agriculture and rural development. Any who touch it are advised to wash immediately and seek medical help; the reaction can occur up to 48 hours after contact. Mdard gives a bit of background on the plant, which is native to central asia but has been in north america for a century, likely imported as an ornamental as \" its size made it somewhat of an oddity \" ( the battle creek enquirer reports it can hit 18 feet in height ). And it has the ability to really take hold: one plant can give rise to an entire colony, and wiping out a colony can take a full 5 years due to seed and root regrowth. It's been found in at least 11 other states, including new york, connecticut, illinois, oregon, and wisconsin. ( in other deadly plant news, this duchess is growing an entire poison garden. )",

        "summary": "If the emergence of agrarian practices is seen as a mark of intelligence in humans, then ants can boast some serious smarts. Not only have researchers discovered a highly organized type of farming in fiji ants — who plant the seeds of fruit trees, fertilize and protect them, harvest the resulting fruits, and collect seeds for future plantings — but they report in the journal nature plants that the techniques date back 3 million years. Humans, by contrast, didn't begin to sort out how to plant and harvest crops until around 23,000 years ago, reports the los angeles times. While farming has been observed in other species, including yeti crabs that cultivate bacteria and sloths that grow algae gardens on their fur, this is the first time ants have been found to farm plants rather than fungus. \" ants are a lot smarter than we think they are, \" one researcher tells new scientist. \" we call them superorganisms because they form networks that are much like our brains. The information flow among ant colonies is just insane compared to human social systems. \" the researchers out of the university of munich in germany say they discovered that ant colonies have been seen farming dozens of squamellaria plants simultaneously, all connected through trails that link the thriving domatia, which are round, hollow structures they form at the base of the fruit trees in lieu of nests. What's more, it appears that the ants and trees have evolved to be co-dependent; without the trees, the ants starve, and without the ants, the trees no longer propagate. ( like humans, ants also use toilets. )",

            "Could ants get any cooler? these amazing insects have been known to create rafts and bridges with their bodies and tend to vast fungus gardens. Now, a new study suggests they have also been farming plants for millions of years. High in the trees of the island nation of fiji, evolutionary biologist guillaume chomicki, a post-doc at the university of munich in germany, discovered a specialized community of ants that actively cultivate six species of plants. Dna evidence suggests this farming behavior could go back as far as 3 million years, he said. To put that in perspective, the earliest known evidence of human farming dates back to 23,000 years ago. The ant-farmed plants are all members of the squamellaria family, also known as \"ant-plants. \" they are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants, usually trees. In a paper published this week in the journal nature plants, chomicki describes how the industrious ants, a species called philidris nagasau, are involved in nearly every aspect of the ant-plants ' life cycle. Even before the squamellaria's fruit is ripe, the ants begin gathering its seeds by cutting through the fruit's wall.

But abortion rights advocates are hoping that monday's supreme court decision that texas clinic laws are unconstitutional will help remedy the so-called \" abortion desert \" in the south and midwest, as the los angeles times frames it. While abortion critics in other states are shoring up laws similar to those in texas — including some of the 200 or so restrictions passed between 2010 and 2014, per the guttmacher institute — as well as trying to implement new ones they say will protect fetal health, abortion rights advocates are celebrating the supreme court decision and making their own plans. \" it's a definitive ruling, \" says dr. Willie parker, who heads up the mississippi clinic. \" it doesn't leave any wiggle room for people who have sought to abuse regulatory authority and gut the provisions of [ roe vs. Wade ]. \" abortion rights supporters also hope the supreme court ruling will topple laws in other states ( some laws are temporarily blocked, and the new york times expects \" waves of legal challenges \" ), and that at least some shuttered abortion clinics can be reopened. Per the center for reproductive rights, besides texas, five other states mandate that abortion clinics meet ambulatory surgical center standards, while nine other states say clinic doctors must have admitting privileges at local hospitals, the ap notes. As for opening the doors of closed clinics, especially those in rural areas, whole woman's health president amy hagstrom miller tells the times it's a \" daunting task \" that will mean starting from square one with licensing, staffing, and other logistics. \" we have the go-ahead to open clinics, but the process to undertake it is going to take time, \" she says.

The 35-year-old reality-tv star was said to have been bound, gagged, and held at gunpoint, with nbc noting she was robbed in a room in a private mansion. A source familiar with the venue's security tells nbc that five men overpowered the night watchman and retrieved the key to where kardashian was staying, and two of them reportedly broke in. Once inside, they tied her up by her hands and feet and handcuffed her in the bathroom, where a source tells e! she \" begged for them to let her live and [ said ] she has babies at home. She thought they were for sure going to kill her. \" they're said to have taped her mouth and put her in the bathtub, and after they left with what's believed to be more than $ 10 million in jewelry, she broke free. She reportedly hopped on a plane after speaking to local law enforcement. The source who spoke to nbc says the perps seemed to know they wouldn't get much trouble from security, which has led to whispers of an inside job. Bodyguard pascal duvier was mia, though tmz notes he's usually glued to her side ( kardashian had even tweeted a pic of him earlier sunday, writing: \" this guy is always in my shot! \" ). The site cites reports that because kardashian had retired for the evening, duvier may have been earning his paycheck by watching instead over sisters kourtney kardashian and kendall jenner as they enjoyed a night out in the city of light.",

The ap reports new forensic techniques allowed authorities to match heinrich's dna to dna found on clothing worn by a young boy who was sexually assaulted in the same year and county as jacob's disappearance. They used that to get a search warrant for heinrich's property in july to look for human remains and jacob's clothing. According to the star tribune, that search didn't turn up anything connected to jacob. But police did find three binders of pictures of naked boys and videos of boys delivering newspapers and riding bikes that allegedly belonged to heinrich, the ap reports. According to the star tribune, heinrich was actually questioned twice following jacob's abduction, and tire marks and footprints from the scene were similar to his.

        "summary": "For karl the hornbill, the pickings were slim. With only half a bottom beak, the black-plumed bird at washington's national zoo couldn't eat anything smaller than a mouse. And to do that, he had to sort of scrape his beak along the ground while tilting his head at just the right angle. Lacking teeth, abyssinian ground hornbills scoop up morsels, which they flip in the air and swallow whole. Experts puzzled over how to help the 27-year-old bird eat, the washington post reports, but ill-fitting prosthetics kept falling off. Experts at the smithsonian institution then came up with a novel idea: reaching into their vaults, they found a hornbill skull circa 1933 to use as a model, then turned to a 3d printer to build karl a shiny new beak. In a fascinating video that outlines the process, specialists crafted the new appendage in stages with the help of the printer. Then they glued it onto a prone karl. \" fingers crossed it stays on, \" one of them says. Native to africa, hornbills are about the size of a wild turkey. Males have blue and red coloring around their throats and long eyelashes they can flutter at mates they choose exclusively. For karl's sake, his keepers hope with a full belly, he will be better able to keep up the latter end of the bargain. Vet james steeil says the hope is that the high-tech prosthetic \" will provide karl with a better avenue to eat for himself and hopefully propagate the species. \" ( animals are being stolen from this zoo — for food. )",

But for karl, the zoo's hornbill, eating was a challenge due to his worn down lower beak.

            "Reproduction and development abyssinian ground hornbills are monogamous animals, with males helping care for females and young during the incubation stage. Breeding time depends upon location, with pairs residing in nigeria and uganda breeding in january, kenyan pairs breeding in november, and west african populations breeding in june-august. Nests are constructed in the cavities of trees, with rock holes or synthetic cavities utilized when trees are unavailable. Males prepare the nest cavity by lining it with dry leaves; females will then lay one or two eggs over the course of five days. Incubation lasts 37 to 41 days, with the male providing food for the incubating female. Incubation for abyssinian ground hornbills begins with the first egg, so one hatchling will mature more quickly and grow faster than its nest mate. Newly hatched chicks normally weigh about 2.5 ounces ( 70 grams ), with both mother and father investing heavily in the hatchling's future. The second hatched chick will often die of starvation as",

        "summary": "The historic thaw in us-cuba relations didn't happen overnight, but came after more than a year of secret talks that had already been going on for months when president obama caused a stir by shaking raul castro's hand at nelson mandela's funeral last year. Insiders tell bloomberg that at least seven high-level meetings were held in ottawa starting in june 2013. The canadian capital was seen as an ideal meeting place because of the country's close ties to both cuba and the us, although the canadians didn't take part in the talks. Pope francis — the first-ever pontiff from latin america — also played a key role. He pushed both sides to talk to each other and reportedly hosted the final negotiation session at the vatican. More: the us spy freed as part of the deal that saw american aid worker alan gross released has been identified by newsweek as rolando sarraff trujillo, a former cryptographer in cuba's directorate of intelligence who was sentenced to 25 years after being arrested for spying for the us in 1995. Trujillo is believed to have exposed several long-running cuban espionage operations before he was caught, including the \" cuban five, \" whose remaining three members were exchanged for him. The us hasn't named trujillo as the released spy, but us officials say he was one of the most important assets the us ever had in cuba and his release was a major priority, reports the washington post. \" information provided by this person was instrumental in the identification and disruption of several cuban intelligence operatives in the united states and ultimately led to a series of successful federal espionage prosecutions, \" a spokesman for the office of the director of national intelligence says. American lawmakers had mixed reactions to the shift, and reuters found a similar split in miami's little havana. \" this is a new beginning, a dream come true for the 11.2 million cubans in cuba, and i think it will provoke a change of mentality here, too, in this community, \" says a magazine publisher who came to the us in the 1980 mariel boatlift.

        "summary": "A civil lawsuit is inching forward against the jordan-based arab bank for allegedly facilitating payments to the families of suicide bombers — but there's also a us connection to the scheme, writes adam penenberg at pando daily. New york attorney gary osen, who filed the suit 10 years ago, says the bank's us-dollar transactions are cleared in new york, and federal officials haven't done a darn thing about it. The bank has apparently shuttled \" massive amounts of terror financing from madison avenue, \" writes penenberg. As for osen's $ 2 billion suit, representing 235 plaintiffs, he filed it because of how terror is financed in palestine. Typically hamas visits the families of suicide bombers and has them fill out mundane forms to receive financing through the arab bank, according to the lawsuit. The money comes from sources such as iran, iraq, and saudi charities, and families find it hard to refuse. As one palestinian father told der spiegel after israel leveled his house, \" we needed the money. We suddenly no longer had a house. \" in dealing with osen, the arab bank has denied some document requests and postponed a trial date, but barring a late reprieve from the supreme court, the suit is headed for a trial or costly settlement. But osen says he's doing it for his clients, not the money: \" they did it and do it... Because it gave them an opportunity to not be victims. \" click for penenberg's full article, or see msn-nz's report on how hamas is getting into the film business.",

He caught a break on thursday, however, when he appeared in court in an unrelated case, explains the chicago tribune. He'd been in prison since 2014 for attempted armed robbery, and he was granted early release in that case because of time served. At that point, he should have been shuttled back to prison because he still faced the murder charges, but the court never received word. The state department of corrections says that because it never got \" documentation indicating mr. Glover should have been retained or sent back to cook county custody, the idoc, by law, had to release him. \" the cook county sheriff's office says it is trying to figure out how the mix-up happened. Glover and two other men are accused of shooting 25-year-old larry porter in 2012 from their vehicle as he drove on the dan ryan expressway.

Meanwhile, a pediatrician who reviewed the study said that this doesn't mean kids should \" roll around in the dirt, \" but that adults can \" loosen up a little \" about cleanliness. By the way, one in three of the kids studied were either sucking their thumbs or biting their nails \" frequently \" between the ages of 5 and 11 and enjoyed being a third less likely to develop allergic sensitization than their peers by age 13; those numbers held through the study's conclusion, when they were 32.

Your fragrance will come in 14-karat gold bottles, the dallas morning news reports. If that doesn't strike your fancy, perhaps one of the store's other nine fantasy gifts, all part of this year's exercise-in-extravagance christmas book, will: a trip to vanity fair's oscars after-party includes a jewelry loan and a personal stylist, along with a $ 5,000 gift card to get clothing for the event — from neiman marcus, of course. A steal at $ 425,000. How about a pair of his ' n ' hers amphibious vehicles? the four-wheel quadski duo costs $ 100,000. For a paltry $ 95,000, you can get a maserati ghibli s q4. Only 100 of the cars are being made, and they go from zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds. An exec expects them all to sell within an hour. Head to new orleans for five days to experience mardi gras — with 11 of your friends. The $ 125,000 trip for six couples includes a french quarter cottage, fancy meals, and an appearance on a parade float. The \" ultimate slot car raceway \" offers a scale model of your favorite track, and for $ 300,000, it includes a party hosted by full-size race car drivers vic elford and david hobbs, the ap reports. If you're feeling cheap, you can deck out your house with luxury linens for just $ 55,000. It's all cheaper than last year's $ 1.9 million gift.",

They were two of 15 \" mules \" stealing the equivalent of $ 2.6 million that night in an online hacking scheme that, since 2013, has stolen about $ 1.2 billion from banks in 40 countries — likely the biggest digital heist in history, bloomberg reports. Investigators say that a group of cybercrooks dubbed the \" carbanak gang \" has been using techniques usually employed by spies to hack into banks, move money around, and send cash to atms. \" carbanak is the first time we saw such novel methods used to penetrate big financial institutions and their networks, \" says the co-founder of a london intelligence firm. The gang initially struck banks in ukraine and russia, where employees received emails from seemingly legitimate suppliers that contained microsoft word attachments; once opened, they allowed malware ( known as carbanak ) to enter the bank's network, steal confidential data, take over pc cameras, and record keystrokes. Soon investigators traced carbanak's coding to the home of ukrainian citizen denis katana, a small, quiet man who allegedly moved money around bank accounts with the artistry of an elite hacker. Yet katana hasn't been charged since his march arrest, and investigators say the gang's \" phishing \" campaigns are still penetrating banks with a new iteration of the malware. \" there will be hundreds of people [ involved ], \" a top researcher at kaspersky labs tells wired. \" dozens of people that are working 24/7, that would be the real scale of the carbanak group. \"",

        "summary": "The 2013 election is in the books, and while there weren't many surprises in this off-year affair, there's plenty to digest. Here are some bulleted thoughts to help your brain do just that: some polls had terry mcauliffe ahead of ken cuccinelli by double digits, so his 3-point win is something of a stunner, politico points out. Cuccinelli's assessment: \" this race came down to the wire because of obamacare. \" exit polls seem to agree with him, cnn reports; 53 % opposed obamacare. Mcauliffe also outspent cuccinelli by $ 15 million. Given the small margin of victory, expect some recriminations from the rnc, which spent just $ 3 million on the race, compared to $ 9 million in 2009. Do republicans still have problems with women? mcauliffe won women by the same 9-point margin that barack obama did, and chris cillizza at the washington post points out that he won unmarried women by a whopping 40 points. But chris christie actually won 57 % of women en route to his landslide win. Of course, christie won as \" the un-republican, \" in cillizza's words. The results suggest that the gop \" would be much better served nominating a chris christie conservative than a ken cuccinelli or ted cruz conservative \" in 2016. The party might be getting the message. Tea party favorite dean young lost in alabama's 1st district — maybe the reddest in the country — because his more moderate republican foe raked in more money. The race \" may signal the coming of a more active republican business community, \" cnn observes. Of course, the chris christie conservative most likely to be nominated is... Chris christie. Pundits everywhere are declaring him the official frontrunner for the gop nod in 2016. Click for much more on christie's win. Bill de blasio's win was hardly a surprise, but it does represent a kind of revolt in the big apple. \" he became the voice of frustration for the boroughs outside manhattan, \" says today's new york times profile. De blasio has promised to raise taxes on manhattan's high-rollers, a big change from michael bloomberg and rudy giuliani's tough-on-crime reps.",

        "summary": "A flight attendant who allegedly left her gucci heels and nearly 70 pounds of cocaine behind when she fled lax last week has surrendered at an airport on the other side of the country, authorities say. Jetblue flight attendant marsha gay reynolds turned herself in at new york's jfk airport on wednesday evening and is expected to appear in federal court on thursday, reports the new york daily news. Authorities say that when reynolds was selected for a random screening last friday, she kicked off her shoes and bolted, leaving her drug-filled luggage behind as she ran down an up escalator and escaped the airport building. Reynolds, a 31-year-old new york city resident, somehow managed to board one of her company's planes over the weekend to make it back to new york, sources tell the los angeles times. Sources tell nbc news that she was able to fly on saturday while authorities were still in the process of identifying her, even though the tsa had scanned her id before she ran out of the airport. Jetblue says it's cooperating with authorities in their investigation. Reynolds has been charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and faces a minimum of 10 years in prison if convicted.",

            "Play facebook twitter google plus embed flight attendant jailed, accused of smuggling 70 pounds of cocaine 0: 29 a flight attendant who fled a security check — allegedly leaving behind 68 pounds of cocaine and her gucci shoes — was in custody wednesday. Marsha gay reynolds, 32, a former jamaican beauty queen, surrendered in new york and was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in a federal criminal complaint. Court papers did not say what airline employed reynolds, but a source told nbc news she worked for jet blue. The suspect went on the lam friday night after she showed up for a flight out of los angeles international airport and was selected for a random screening. The attendant — who normally would get to bypass bag screening as a crew member — became visibly nervous and made a phone call in a \" foreign language, \" transportation security administration officers told police. As she was being escorted to the front of the screening area, she kept trailing behind and then suddenly bolted toward an elevator, dropping her roller bags and taking off her designer shoes, authorities said. She ran down an up escalator, out of the building and disappeared. Inside her bag, police found 11 bricks of cocaine wrapped in green plastic and placed into yellow or white envelopes, clothing, a package of condoms and a $ 5.38 in cash. Marsha-gay reynolds was the second runner-up in the miss jamaica 2008 competition. Tyronne payton while an investigation was underway, reynolds was able to hop a jet blue flight to the east coast on saturday, sources said. The tsa had scanned her identification before she ran from terminal 4 in lax but were still in the process of identifying her into the weekend, the sources said. Sources said reynolds was a runner-up in a jamaican beauty contest. A woman with the same name was listed in local news stories as the third-place winner of the 2008 miss jamaica world pageant and a runner-up in the 2007 miss jamaica universe pageant. One online pageant profile for reynolds said she had attended nyu. The university had a woman by the same name on its 2004 track and field roster. The american alliance of airport police officers said reynolds ' arrest was proof that new security measures — including screening of all airport employees — is needed. \" screening all employees is feasible",
            "Reynolds fled from lax on friday night after she was randomly selected for a security screening, the complaint said. Despite the near arrest, reynolds may have worked as an attendant on the saturday flight to new york, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the source was not authorized to discuss details of the case."

Harvey schwartz, appointed co-president when gary cohn left for the white house in december 2016, will leave the firm after its board of directors chose fellow co-president david solomon to succeed current ceo lloyd blankfein, reports the wall street journal. Chief financial officer from 2013 to 2016, schwartz, 54, was initially thought to have a leg up on solomon as he's better known throughout the firm. But blankfein told the board he preferred solomon, who oversaw the firm's investment bankers beginning in 2006, doubling the unit's profit margin over a decade, and has pushed for the hiring of more women, per the new york times. Blankfein has held the top job since 2006. With schwartz's retirement on april 20, the 56-year-old solomon will be named the sole president of goldman sachs. He ' ll become \" perhaps the banking industry's most prominent spokesman \" when blankfein opts to retire, possibly as early as this year, the times reports. That might mean a little less time for solomon's musical pursuits. The investment banker also works part-time as a dj under the name d-sol, who boasted of having his electronic rendition of \" don't stop \" by fleetwood mac featured on sirius xm radio earlier this year, per the new york post. Schwartz, meanwhile, might find more time for karate as he charts his next move. \" it's been an incredible 21 years.

What this means in the short term: the lawyer for the woman who's suing cosby for allegedly sexually assaulting her in the playboy mansion in 1974 wants to grill him. \" we are looking forward to mr. Cosby answering questions under oath at his deposition and we will continue to seek justice for our courageous client, judy huth, \" gloria allred said yesterday, per nbc. Allred says the supreme court's decision was \" a huge, huge victory \" for huth and added that she hoped to get cosby in a room for questioning within 30 days, cnn reports. And if cosby hems and haws about availability? \" we are willing to even go to massachusetts where allegedly he resides and take [ the deposition ], \" allred said, per cbs los angeles. Huth says she was 15 when she went to the playboy mansion with the comedian and he molested her in a bedroom. Cosby's legal team had sought in june to have the state supreme court review huth's case based on what they say were \" procedural errors \" in its filing, notes nbc. They claim, per cnn, that cosby should never have been named in the suit based on california child sex-abuse law, and that the statute of limitations had long since expired because she tried to sell this story to a tabloid a decade ago. The curt posting on the supreme court's website simply reads: \" petition for review denied, \" per the press-enterprise. This comes just days after cosby's 2005 deposition in the case of andrea constand started circulating. ( cosby wants constand to pay. )",

Circuit judge barry williams — who also acquitted two other baltimore officers — found lt.

Nbc news reports prosecutors presented \" essentially the same evidence as previous trials, \" though they stressed that as commander of the shift in april 2015, rice was responsible for putting gray in a seat belt inside the baltimore police van where he suffered a fatal spinal cord injury. Rice ordered gray's legs be shackled but ignored seat belt policies, prosecutors said. One prosecutor compared the act of not putting gray in a seat belt to \" handing someone a loaded gun. \" defense attorneys, however, said putting a seat belt on gray, whom they described as aggressive, would've put rice in danger given the tight space in the van compartment where suspects are held. \" everything about it was professional, correct, \" an attorney for rice said. Williams found rice's failure to use a seat belt wasn't itself a crime, reports the guardian. The verdict follows the acquittal of two other officers in the case, edward nero and caesar goodson jr.

They are commonly considered harmless other than for patients taking a certain blood thinner, but another senior author notes they may not actually \" be as safe as we think. \" another researcher says the fda \" should be aware of these findings, \" but notes that a clinical study is needed to determine whether the medications actually cause heart attacks. As for what could be causing the potential link, researchers think it might have to do with the drugs reducing nitric oxide production in the circulatory system; lower levels of nitric oxide are linked to heart problems, and researchers are currently testing the theory.

H2 blockers, which have been around longer than ppis, are reasonably effective against heartburn and are the second-largest-selling class of drugs used to treat it. The study's findings lend support to an explanation for an untoward effect of ppis on heart-disease risk proposed by stanford scientists a few years ago. Research done then showed that ppis impede the production of an important substance, nitric oxide, in the endothelial cells that line all of the nearly 100,000 miles of blood vessels in an average adult's body.

We explore this potential risk in the general population via data-mining approaches. Methods using a novel approach for mining clinical data for pharmacovigilance, we queried over 16 million clinical documents on 2.9 million individuals to examine whether ppi usage was associated with cardiovascular risk in the general population.

Li discovered the roughly 8-inch-long creature in 1983 when he was studying infectious diseases near a xinjiang province mountain; he tells cnn the name he gave it is a nod to his hometown: ili. \" i sat down next to some rocks, and suddenly two bunny ears emerged from the crack of one of the rocks, \" he tells the bbc of that first discovery. \" the little thing was staring at me, blinking at me, \" he continues. \" i thought it was the most beautiful and bizarre creature i'd ever seen. \" fellow researchers noted that the species hadn't previously been identified, and even now, only 29 of the live animals have ever been seen; china classifies it as an endangered species. Indeed, over 37 days spent looking in 2002 and 2003, li and his team were unable to find a single pika. Today, it faces challenges to its survival thanks to human encroachment on its habitat as well as air pollution, but as carrie arnold notes at national geographic, \" there are no concerted efforts under way to help the ili pika. \" but li hopes he can parlay the rediscovery into the creation of protected areas for it. And as arnold quips, \" how could anyone turn down a face like that? \" ( another recently spotted rare find: a fanged deer. )",

When her horse hit the asphalt, she lost her footing, spun around and essentially pancaked, throwing lara face first into the asphalt. \" the tribune notes that dewees was competing with her newest horse, and that the horse had been trained to continue the barrel race and then go toward the arena's exit gate should the reins get dropped. The horse, genny, was shod with shoes for running on dirt, and the gate should have been shut so the animal couldn't get onto the asphalt driveway. Dewees suffered broken bones and a head injury and underwent surgery to remove a blood clot from her brain. She appeared to be improving, but \" took a turn for the worse on thursday, \" possibly due to another blood clot, her grandmother tells the tribune. Dewees — a national barrel racing champion, accomplished singer, and beloved schoolteacher — was somewhat of a celebrity in her hometown of fewer than 2,000 people in pasco county. She was also a cancer survivor and the mother of an 18-month old boy. Genny got stitches for several cuts on her legs, but is doing ok.",

Hochul used the best example of that governance — the gop plan to turn medicare into a voucher system — to win a district no democrat had any business winning. \" the fact that they could win in a solidly republican district just a few months after their worst defeats in decades has got to be an enormous boost for democrats, \" writes kornacki. They'd need another two dozen similar victories to retake the house, no easy feat. But the victory is \" a reminder to everyone that, just like it changed dramatically after obama's win 2008, the political climate has again shifted in the wake of the gop's 2010 landslide.

The republican in the race, jane corwin, fully endorsed the gop plan to alter medicare, while the democrat, kathy hochul, defended the social safety net. The race's polling trends point to medicare as the defining issue, while the conversation has played out on a national level. Former house speaker nancy pelosi ( d-calif. ) summed up the democratic position: \" we have a plan -- it's called medicare. \" with some exceptions, democrats have ranged from reluctant defenders of government spending to outright hawkish assailants of social funds.

Scalia raised an argument made by others that affirmative action might actually hurt african-americans in some cases, reports the dallas morning news. If, for example, black students got into a top school by virtue of their race instead of their grades, they might suffer academically — and thus might be better off going to a lesser school. A snippet, via mother jones: \" there are those who contend that it does not benefit african americans to get them into the university of texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well. One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the university of texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they're being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them. \" the general idea of scalia's argument is known as the \" mismatch theory, \" reports the wall street journal, and it has been put forth by advocates including ucla professor richard sander, who wrote this amicus brief for the court case, notes talking points memo. Scalia himself sounded sympathetic to the reasoning. \" maybe it ought to have fewer \" black students, he said of ut. \" i don't think it stands to reason that it's a good thing for the university of texas to admit as many blacks as possible. \" his line of questioning wasn't sitting well with all: one of the spectators in court was al sharpton, who said afterward, \" i did not know if i was sitting in the supreme court or at a donald trump rally. \"",

No longer: carr was rewarded with his boss ' car after making a lasting impression on his first clients. After his 2003 nissan altima broke down saturday and \" backup rides fell through, \" carr set out from homewood, ala., at midnight en route to a home in pelham, expecting the walk to take seven hours, homeowner jenny lamey writes on a gofundme page. He'd traveled 14 miles before police picked him up around 4am, per wiat. They bought carr breakfast and a take-out lunch, then dropped him at lamey's home around 6: 30am, per al.com. As the rest of the bellhops moving crew had yet to arrive, lamey suggested carr take a nap. According to a viral facebook post, he got to work instead. \" this was the first job in a long time to give me an opportunity to get hired. I wanted to show them i got the dedication, \" says carr, who moved with his mother to alabama from new orleans after their home was destroyed by hurricane katrina. \" i just can't tell you how touched i was, \" says lamey. Bellhops ceo luke marklin is on the same page. \" the grit and heart walter showed defines bellhops ' culture precisely … we set a high bar on service and he just raised it, \" he wrote in a sunday tweet. A day later, marklin thanked carr by handing over the keys to his 2014 ford escape, leaving carr \" trying to hold back the tears, \" per al.com. \" no matter what the challenge is, you can break through, \" adds carr, who hopes to join the marines before getting a bachelor's degree in physical therapy. Some $ 8,400 has been raised to help him on that path.",

Here's what critics are saying: much of the original cast returns but \" [ will ] smith is gone and so are any of the ripe pleasures of emmerich's campy excess, cheesy dialogue and all, \" peter howell writes at the toronto star. If the filmmakers wanted audiences to actually care if the planet is destroyed, they failed, he adds. They \" spend more time engaging in flatulent melodrama in this way late and very stupid sci-fi sequel than they do kicking alien ass. \" it's a darker film than the original, writes luke buckmaster at the daily review, \" but the humor is still present, if less daffy, \" thanks in part to jeff goldblum. In what is presumably a compliment, he notes liam hemsworth comes across \" as a more sedate version of a young tom cruise \" but there's \" nobody to match will smith's cigar-chomping rascal. \" his parting words: \" keep expectations low, and goldblum appreciation levels high. \" \" if your witty asides aren't witty, and your digital effects look like so much else you've seen the last few years, and your editing juggles the various plotlines so ineptly...

        "summary": "One serious drawback for astronauts who spend long periods in space is that they often return to earth with degraded vision, and a new study may have pinpointed the problem. It's a buildup of spinal fluid around the eyes, say researchers from the university of miami. This cerebrospinal fluid is the stuff that cushions the brain and keeps it safe when we move around, but the lack of gravity in space seems to throw it out of whack, reports the bbc. Instead of being evenly distributed, it tends to pool around the eye cavities and exert pressure on the eyeballs, flattening them, explains vice. Most astronauts who spend months in space end up with blurrier vision, and the condition isn't always reversible, notes a post at phys.org. \" we saw structural changes in the eye globe only in the long-duration group, \" says lead author noam alperin. \" and these changes were associated with increased volumes of the csf. Our conclusion was that the csf was playing a major role in the formation of the problem. \" the findings, presented at the annual meeting of the radiological society of north america, are the first concrete evidence that csf is the culprit, and they could help nasa figure out how to remedy the problem. A larger study is now in the works, but this first one is \" timely and significant, \" given the push toward longer-duration missions, adds a post at universe today.

After a petition to remove renoir's work \" from our national museums \" on the white house's website in april failed to gain more than 15 votes and was thus archived for lack of support, geller's anti-renoir instagram account now has more than 4,000 followers and his eight-or-so-person protest outside boston's museum of fine arts on monday is getting some publicity — much to the dismay of one genevieve renoir, who says she is the painter's great-great-granddaughter, reports the guardian. She even took to instagram to contest geller's assertion that renoir sucks at painting, saying with a smattering of emojis that the free market has spoken. On its face, the movement is about aesthetics. One sign at the protest claiming \" aesthetic terrorism \" said as much. \" if you took his word for it, trees would be a collection of disgusting, green squiggly lines and eyeballs would be jet black as if they were colored by sharpies, \" geller tells npr in its three-question interview. \" in real life trees are beautiful; renoir just sucks at painting. \" but wbur reports that the self-described political organizer is doing this as more of a hobby to \" blow off steam \" and that he means it as a joke, albeit \" a pointed one. \" in using phrases such as \" god hates renoir, \" \" empty calories, and \" infantile green scribbles that look like crayon, \" geller is also posing provocative questions about who sets a museum's standards for what is displayed and what the public should find beautiful or compelling.

Holding signs that said \"renoir \", \"take ' em down! renoir sucks \" and \"god hates renoir \", members of the renoir sucks at painting movement protested outside the museum of fine arts in boston on monday. The group, led by organizer max geller, demanded the museum remove renoir paintings – of which there are many, including the famous dance at boufival, 1883 – from its walls. When the guardian asked why he dislikes renoir so much, geller countered: \"why do so many people think he's good? have you looked at his paintings? \"in real life, trees are beautiful. If you take renoir's word for it, you'd think trees are just a collection of green squiggles, \" geller said. Renoir is considered a good painter because his work is featured in museums, geller added. But upon further inspections of his paintings, that line of argument \"seems pretty fallacious \". Geller hates renoir so much, he started an instagram account also called renoir sucks at painting, which shows closeups of certain renoir paintings with criticism in the comments, as well as photos of geller and others gesturing angrily in front of various renoir works. The renoir sucks at painting movement was inspired after geller visited the barnes foundation in philadelphia, which houses a large collection of renoir paintings, or, as geller called them, \"empty calorie-laden steaming piles \". The instagram account has more than 2,400 followers, and has even received the wrath of genevieve renoir, who says she is the painter's great-great-granddaughter. On one photo, genevieve commented: \"when your great-great-grandfather paints anything worth $ 78.1m dollars … then you can criticize. In the meantime",

Holding signs that said \"renoir \", \"take ' em down! renoir sucks \" and \"god hates renoir \", members of the renoir sucks at painting movement protested outside the museum of fine arts in boston on monday. The group, led by organizer max geller, demanded the museum remove renoir paintings – of which there are many, including the famous dance at boufival, 1883 – from its walls. When the guardian asked why he dislikes renoir so much, geller countered: \"why do so many people think he's good? have you looked at his paintings? \"in real life, trees are beautiful. If you take renoir's word for it, you'd think trees are just a collection of green squiggles, \" geller said. Renoir is considered a good painter because his work is featured in museums, geller added. But upon further inspections of his paintings, that line of argument \"seems pretty fallacious \". Geller hates renoir so much, he started an instagram account also called renoir sucks at painting, which shows closeups of certain renoir paintings with criticism in the comments, as well as photos of geller and others gesturing angrily in front of various renoir works. The renoir sucks at painting movement was inspired after geller visited the barnes foundation in philadelphia, which houses a large collection of renoir paintings, or, as geller called them, \"empty calorie-laden steaming piles \". The instagram account has more than 2,400 followers, and has even received the wrath of genevieve renoir, who says she is the painter's great-great-granddaughter. On one photo, genevieve commented: \"when your great-great-grandfather paints anything worth $ 78.1m dollars … then you can criticize. In the meantime",

Romney's entire answer on pay equity \" was pretty amazingly retrograde, \" writes matthew yglesias at slate. \" if you're going to have women in the workforce … sometimes they need to be more flexible, \" romney said, explaining that female staffers had to be home early to make dinner for their kids. Here's a novel idea: \" maybe dad should cook dinner! \" equality demands that some moms be able to take jobs with inflexible schedules. Janice d ' arcy at the washington post, meanwhile, is fuming over romney's gun violence response, in which he said having more married parents would solve the problem. Obama said he agreed. But research shows that education and income level are a heck of a lot more important than your parents ' marital status. Unmarried mothers, d ' arcy writes \" are not a monolithic voting bloc and neither are they a monolithic punching bag. \" then there was the treatment of candy crowley, who was often ignored or talked over. \" since both candidates are trying to convince voters that they respect women, they might start by respecting candy crowley, \" tweeted nicholas kristof. One romney adviser today confirmed that romney would not have signed the lilly ledbetter fair pay act. \" he was opposed to it at the time, \" ed gillespie said, according to the huffington post.

This \" may be the summer movie we didn't know we were waiting for. \" she argues the flick is \" old-fashioned in the best sense, \" but with \" lots of modern tricks and technology. \" the downside: \" ritchie just doesn't know when to quit, which means we get multiple endings when, really, just one would do. \"",

        "summary": "Another bear attack is in the news, this one an unusual case of a bear attacking a girl seemingly unprovoked. Abby wetherell, 12, says a black bear came out of the woods and chased her as she jogged on a dirt road in rural michigan, reports ap. After the bear knocked her down once and she escaped, it caught her a second time and mauled her. The girl says she played dead at that point, which seemed to work, and by then her father and a neighbor were on the scene to chase the bear back into the woods. \" we're very proud of the way she handled herself, \" says her grandfather. \" she kind of amazed us. \" abby is recuperating from surgery to repair deep cuts to her thigh, but she is expected to be released in days, reports the detroit free press. The newspaper notes that playing dead isn't always the best advice in a bear attack, though it apparently depends on the situation. In two other attacks this week, one bear pounced to protect her cub and another when it was startled. Four people in all were injured.",

        "summary": "Stories about president trump's first 100 days in office are inescapable this week, and vocativ is out with an interesting take: a detailed look at his first 444 tweets. It's probably no surprise that @whitehouse is the account mentioned most often, but in second place is @newyorktimes ( usually preceded by \" failing \" ), followed by @foxandfriends. The people mentioned most often? hillary clinton and former president obama are tied at eight. Trump loves his all-caps, and the phrase that most often gets that treatment, by a mile, is fake news. He did that 19 times. However, he has tweeted about \" jobs \" most often, with 32 mentions. Dig into more particulars here, or check out other 100-day coverage: npr lists the 28 laws trump has signed, a figure the white house boasts is more than any president since truman. But npr notes that several are of the mundane variety, including one recommending that people fly the us flag on national vietnam war veterans day. Five others cover personnel matters. Time sees trump's three biggest accomplishments as the appointment of neil gorsuch to the supreme court, the withdrawal of the us from the trans-pacific partnership, and the reversal of various obama-era regulations and policies, including trump's decision to greenlight the keystone oil pipeline. The boston globe has a detailed look at how trump has done on the promises he made during the campaign. For example, the gorsuch pick and the keystone move are in the \" done \" category, his pledge to propose an amendment mandating congressional term limits is in the \" not done \" pack, and his promise to suspend immigration from \" terror-prone \" nations falls into the \" it's complicated \" pile. Politifact has a similar guide, noting that trump fulfilled a promise to place a lifetime ban on white house officials lobbying for foreign governments. He gets a \" compromise \" rating on a similar promise to ban former white house and congressional officials from lobbying the government for five years. Trump has an approval rating of 44 %, per a cnn poll, putting him last among presidents at the 100-day mark since modern polling began with eisenhower. Obama, for instance, was at 62 % and george w. Bush at 63 %, reports fox news. The latter's poll has trump's approval rating at 45 %. The simpsons weighed in on the first 100 days, and trump will not be amused.",

And he similarly asks us to imagine a remake of the 1967 movie the graduate, when a young dustin hoffman is disgusted with himself for having an affair with the 42-year-old mrs. Robinson. The movie wouldn't be quite the same today, he writes. \" it is hard to feel sorry for a young man who goes to bed with the woman everybody else in the theater wants to go to bed with. \" in short, 42 ain't what it used to be. The essay, however, is getting just as much buzz for the reaction, often in the form of ridicule, from female writers. Some examples: tracy moore, jezebel: \" the only thing more ludicrous than tom junod's feelings about 42-year-olds are the misguided assumptions that lurk beneath them … like a 42-year-old woman clawing at the icy surface above her, desperate to escape the tomb of her old age and fading beauty, trapped in part because she acknowledges that icy cold water could significantly invigorate her appearance. \" sarah miller, the hairpin: she professed relief upon reading the piece: \" tom junod still wanted to have sex with me, and more importantly, laugh over hamburgers afterward, as he admired me in a stunning shift. Because according to junod, i ' m still hot — not like 42-year-old women used to be, back when they were super gross, like anne bancroft in the graduate. And according to junod what makes me hot isn't just being hot, it's that, unlike other women who just haven't had all this time, i also finally figured out how to be sort of interesting. \" dr. Logan levkoff, huffington post: she points out that junod is in his 50s. \" gee, a man being interested in a younger woman — wow — that sounds like a novel idea. \" click to read junod's full post.",

The benefit ranged from about $ 80 to $ 120 per week to help with her personal care; her husband and daughter say she couldn't complete tasks independently, couldn't leave the house, and often had difficulty breathing. In november, her husband mick found dawn struggling to breathe; he called an ambulance, and by the time he got off the phone, she had collapsed. That day, he and the couple's daughter agreed that doctors should remove her life support, the essex gazette reports; two days after her death, he found the letter from dwp, which had been sent on the day she died. As her daughter explains, dawn's attendance allowance claim was up for renewal, and upon reassessing her claim, the dwp found her benefits should be withdrawn based on information it reviewed regarding her treatment, medication, symptoms, and test results.
