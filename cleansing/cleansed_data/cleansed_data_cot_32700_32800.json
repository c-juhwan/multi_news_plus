        "summary": "What do the united states and papua new guinea have in common? per the international labor organization, they're the only two countries out of 185 that don't have national paid parental leave, the new york times reports. To make up for that absence, some states — including rhode island, new jersey, california, and most recently, new york, per pbs — have implemented partial payment through state insurance programs, and now san francisco has joined the pack, but with one big difference: thanks to a measure passed tuesday, the city will offer fully paid leave for six weeks for new parents ( either biological or adoptive ), making it the first city in the nation to do so, abc news reports. A worker can already recoup 55 % of his or her paycheck through the state of california for parental leave, and the new mandate in san francisco mandates private employers in the city with at least 20 employees make up the rest of the paycheck for that time period. The measure's supporters applaud the decision. \" paid parental leave increases the probability that employees will return to work, be more productive, and earn higher wages, \" the ceo of the bay area council tells the times. \" that is good for business and for families. \" others praise the vote, though in more measured tones. \" we are ahead of the curve in california, but globally, we are way behind. It's shameful, \" says a legal aid society lawyer. One group not passing cigars around: some bay area small-business owners, who say tuesday's vote will place more of a burden upon companies already struggling with the city's expensive cost of living and minimum-wage mandates, per kpix 5. \" enough is enough, \" one local factory owner says. \" it's this constant piling on, it's the death of a thousand cuts. \" the atlanta journal-constitution, meanwhile, wonders about the futility of the measure, noting that san francisco is a city \" where hardly anyone can afford a family \" anyway.

        "summary": "More than a week after a major net failure at a salmon farm near seattle, it's still unclear how many fish escaped and what the damage to the surrounding ecosystem could be. The cook aquaculture fish farm was damaged on aug. 19, and the extensive grid of nets holding 305,0000 atlantic salmon collapsed the following day, reports scientific american. The company released a statement blaming \" exceptionally high tides and currents coinciding with [ the aug. 21 ] solar eclipse, \" but scientists are raising eyebrows. \" the thing about tides is that they're just marvelously predictable, \" one tidal energy expert says. Another tells inverse that this tide was at the 45th percentile for 2017, suggesting much bigger ones to come. Whatever is at fault, commercial fishers like ellie kinley, a member of the coastal tribe lummi nation, worry that the 10-pound farmed fish threaten the smaller native pacific salmon already losing habitat to hydropower. \" the timing couldn't be worse because our baby chinooks are coming out of the river, \" she says. Farmed fish can also spread parasites and diseases. The true extent of the damage done by however many fish managed to escape won't likely be seen for several years, when today's young population matures. For now, washington, which has the most net-pen salmon farms in the country, is rethinking fish farms, per the spokesman-review. ( data suggests that neither the tide nor the water current or wind speeds were unusually high when the nets malfunctioned. )",

A tidal expert is questioning claims made by a fish farm near seattle that the impending solar eclipse destroyed its floating pen full of atlantic salmon. The floating pen contained 305,000 salmon weighing 3 million pounds and imploded at a cooke aquaculture fish farm off cypress island in washington's puget sound on saturday around 4 p.m. Pacific. The corporation estimates that several thousand fish escaped, but says that it will not know precise numbers until it conducts an inventory after harvesting. Because ocean tides are caused by gravitational pull from the sun and the moon, an eclipse often creates especially large tides: the sun and moon line up and pull in nearly the exact same direction, which strengthens the net gravitational force.

            "Google just relaunched the gmail app for iphone in the app store. In a blog post announcing the release, google says it fixed the error in the original app that blocked it from displaying notifications. Unfortunately, it looks like that's all google fixed. As we noted in our review of the gmail app, it's missing a ton of critical features such as the ability to check multiple accounts at once. However, google did say in its blog post today that more features are coming soon. We just downloaded the app, and it appears google did fix the problem with push notifications. After logging in, the new e-mail badge popped right up. ( see screenshot. ) try it for yourself right here.",
            "Unfortunately, users ' more substantive concerns with the app have not been addressed. The gmail team's blog post says that multiple account support, improved notifications and mobile-specific signatures are coming, along with \" many more \" features. But for now, little has changed about the app that many panned as insufficient for a native gmail app. The native gmail app for iphone, ipad and ipod touch users is back in the app store. The app was first released on november 2, but it shipped with an unfortunate error that greeted new users with an incomprehensible error message. Shortly after releasing it, google pulled the app from the store. The problem was caused by broken push notifications, and that bug has been fixed in today's release. The update also improves handling of images in html messages. Just about the only feature the gmail app handles better than the web view is attachments. For most other purposes, the experience is the same, and in some cases, the mobile web is actually better. While even the mobile web gmail supports multiple accounts, this native app does not. That's strange, because the app is just a wrapper around the web view. Users must choose which gmail account to use for the app, and they have to back out to change accounts. For users who frequently manage multiple gmail accounts, the mobile web version is a much easier option. The day the gmail app first rolled out, popular mac mail client sparrow tweeted that an iphone version of sparrow would come \" to the rescue \" and give iphone users \" the gmail experience [ they ] deserve. \" we ' ll just have to wait a few months. Grab the gmail app from the itunes store. Does the gmail app work for you, or do you need more features? sound off in the comments."

Scientists from the university of chile have spent a year designing the drug in a bid to tackle the growing problem of alcoholism in the country. The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol. Normally, the liver turns alcohol into the hangover-causing compound called acetaldehyde which is then broken down by a metabolising enzyme. If someone who's been vaccinated tries to drink alcohol, they will immediately experience severe nausea, accelerated heartbeat, and general discomfort. Once the vaccine has been administered it cannot be reversed. A preclinical trial using mice to determine the correct dosing is due to begin next month with researchers hoping to begin tests on human subjects in november.

Scientists from the university of chile have spent a year designing the drug in a bid to tackle the growing problem of alcoholism in the country. The vaccine, which would be effective for between six months and a year, works by sending a biochemical message to the liver telling it not to express genes that metabolise alcohol. Normally, the liver turns alcohol into the hangover-causing compound called acetaldehyde which is then broken down by a metabolising enzyme. If someone who's been vaccinated tries to drink alcohol, they will immediately experience severe nausea, accelerated heartbeat, and general discomfort. Once the vaccine has been administered it cannot be reversed. A preclinical trial using mice to determine the correct dosing is due to begin next month with researchers hoping to begin tests on human subjects in november.

It takes about 1,000 licks to get to a lollipop's center, researchers say in a new york university press release. The finding was incidental to research on what some might see as a topic of more importance: the way water currents shape objects they're rushing past. The findings help explain how solids dissolve — handy knowledge for pharmacologists making pills and geologists studying erosion. Researchers used candy to reach their conclusions. When they dipped homemade hard candy into flowing water, they found that the same shape was eventually left — no matter how the candy was shaped to begin with — before the candy disappeared completely. \" we used these results to figure out in general how fluids dissolve materials, and we realized that that is basically what you're doing when you're enjoying a lollipop, \" a scientist tells abc news. Tootsie roll industries applauds the work. \" how many licks is a question fans of our candy have asked us for decades, \" the company's president tells abc. \"we're thrilled that new york university has conducted a study to help find out. \" but it wasn't without sacrifice, says the researcher: \" resisting the temptation to just bite into one is tough. \" sadly, the news comes shortly after the passing of melvin gordon, the company's ceo.

The virus, mollivirus sibericum or \" soft virus from siberia, \" qualifies as giant because it is 0.6 micrometers and can be seen under a regular microscope, reports vice news. But why revive it? well, the french team who discovered it hopes to study the virus, which dates to the last ice age and is incredibly complex genetically; it has 500 genes, while influenza a, for instance, has just eight. Studying such a virus isn't without risk, though. \" a few viral particles that are still infectious may be enough, in the presence of a vulnerable host, to revive potentially pathogenic viruses, \" a researcher tells afp. That's why the team will first ensure the bug won't cause human or animal disease before placing it with a single-cell amoeba. After introducing the virus to an amoeba host, researchers will move on to mice and then human cells. A little wary of such a revival? this is the fourth prehistoric virus discovered since 2003 and the second by the french team. They revived the giant virus pithovirus sibericum after its discovery in 2013. Experts warn, however, that prehistoric viruses could eventually recover by themselves. Climate change is warming arctic and sub-arctic regions at twice the global rate, meaning mineral resources are likely to grow more accessible and permafrost layers may be \" dug up and exposed to air, \" a researcher says. \" if we are not careful, and we industrialize these areas without putting safeguards in place, we run the risk of one day waking up viruses such as small pox that we thought were eradicated. \" ( click for more on giant viruses. )",

        "summary": "At least two black women were barred from pledging university of alabama's 16 sororities — a member of the university's board says the number of women is actually higher — and one of the bigger twists to the story is that sorority members, not the pledges themselves, were the ones to come forward, reports the new york times. An alpha gamma delta sorority member, for instance, told the school's crimson white that she spoke out when one of the women, an impressive candidate who was salutatorian of her high school, wasn't advanced to the next round of pledging. In some cases, alumni allegedly stepped in to ensure the women weren't admitted and, in one instance, even threatened to cut financial support if the recruit was given the green light, cw reports. The cw points out that just a single black woman has made it through the recruitment process and joined a \" traditionally white \" sorority there, in 2003. A number of sororities now say they're investigating the women's cases. A ua rep told the times the school is working \" to remove any barriers that prevent young women \" from \" making the choices they want to make, \" but sororities \" determine their own membership selection processes and expect their members to follow their procedures during recruitment. \" al.com notes the school has not described any specific action it might take.

Pope benedict xvi's butler, who is under arrest for allegedly leaking confidential vatican documents, is just a scapegoat, according to the source of new secret documents published sunday by the italian newspaper la repubblica. The butler, paolo gabriele, 45, remains in a vatican jail cell on charges of aggravated theft for possessing confidential correspondence. Publication of the new documents sunday — which la repubblica said it had received from an unknown person after gabriele's arrest on may 25 — would strongly indicate that gabriele wasn't the only person with access to the secret correspondence of the roman catholic church. The documents lay bare the political machinations among cardinals posted to the vatican, suggesting an administration riven by infighting over which benedict, 85, has — or chooses to exercise — little authority. In a letter accompanying the three new documents, the shadowy provider calls gabriele \" the usual scapegoat \" and says his or her intention is to \" drive out the real culprits from the vatican, \" whom the letter identifies as msgr.

There can be no secret negotiations. No notification, no negotiation, \" he said, per the bbc. Juncker said that as a european, he is saddened by the vote to leave, but the eu must respect the will of british voters. He turned on brexit supporter and independence party leader nigel farage after farage applauded the latter statement. \" you were fighting for the exit, the british people voted in favor of the exit. Why are you here? \" juncker asked farage. In other developments: farage was booed and jeered after making a speech in which he insulted his fellow members of the european parliament and the whole european project, the guardian reports. He told the meps that they were in denial about the eu and the euro failing, accused them of trying to bring in political union by stealth, and said none of them had \" ever done a proper job \" in their lives, let along created a job. He concluded by calling the brexit vote a \" seismic result \" for world politics and predicting that the uk will not be the last country to leave the eu. Reuters reports that despite president obama's warning that the uk will be at the \" back of the queue \" for trade deals if it leaves the eu, the exit is unlikely to damage us-uk relations and us officials are now stressing that the \" special relationship \" will remain strong. The guardian reports that british pm david cameron is in brussels tuesday for what will probably be very awkward talks with his european counterparts. He announced his resignation after the brexit vote and is now widely expected to be gone by september. Farage spoke to fox news on monday and slammed obama as \" disgraceful \" for speaking out about the vote, unlike the \" statesmanlike \" vladimir putin, politico reports. The washington post looks at how the british vote highlights a crisis in confidence in democracies from europe to brazil to japan. One of the biggest problems: people no longer believe things will get better. The new york times looks at the \" chaotic paralysis \" gripping britain amid financial and political turmoil. There is increasing talk of forging a deal that would allow britain to remain in a trading bloc with the eu, though eu leaders are expected to take a hard line in negotiations to discourage other leavers.",

More than 70 years later, archaeologists led by yoram haimi of the israel antiquities authority set about excavating the site, uncovering gas chambers, mass graves — and, late last year, a girl's silver pendant. It is engraved with a date, the place name \"frankfurt \" and the hebrew words \"mazal tov. \" a cry from the earth, the remnant from a killing ground has opened up a tragic past to a family that knew little about it.

The now 56-year-old franzen — known for his new yorker essays, his award-winning novel the corrections, and a tiff with oprah — says he was in his late ' 40s when he started having a tough time relating to youth and came up with the orphan idea, which \" lasted maybe six weeks. \" \" one of the things that had put me in mind of adoption was a sense of alienation from the younger generation, \" he says. \" they seemed politically not the way they should be as young people. I thought people were supposed to be idealistic and angry. And they seemed kind of cynical and not very angry. \" it was henry finder, franzen's editor at the new yorker, who eventually talked him out of his plan — which franzen now calls \" insane \" — and came up with a more sensible solution: meet up with recent university grads. \" it cured me of my anger at young people, \" he says. Also revealed in the weekend interview: franzen's belief that he's \" been assigned the role of an anti-women villain by certain feminist critics, \" as the guardian puts it. That has led to an upswell of twitter responses, including a series of tweets from writer jennifer weiner, who's had back-and-forths with franzen before. One tweet related to the orphan bit: \" are you saying iraqi war orphans don't exist solely for the education, moral edification of white men? \" ( apropos of nothing, someone once held franzen's eyeglasses for ransom. )",

Fr leonard was educated at castleknock college, a vincentian boarding school in dublin, and trained for the priesthood at the vincentian seminary st joseph's in blackrock, co dublin. After being ordained he was sent to london and taught in a teacher- training college run by the order in strawberry hill, twickenham. During the first world war he joined the british army's chaplain department, holding the rank of captain and serving on the western front in france. The experience left him partly deaf. He was awarded the british war medal and the victory medal. He returned to work in london and was friendly with prominent social figures including irish playwright and nobel laureate george bernard shaw and the hostess lady lavery, wife of artist sir john lavery and a friend of michael collins. Fr leonard was introduced to, and befriended, a wealthy american couple on honeymoon, wilmarth sheldon lewis and his wife annie auchincloss. Fr leonard returned to dublin in 1939, to the vincentian",

The archive of her 14-year-long correspondence with fr joseph leonard – a vincentian priest who lived in all hallows in drumcondra in dublin – will be sold at an auction in ireland next month. In the previously unpublished letters, jackie tells fr leonard how kennedy, who was then a rising star in american politics, was consumed by ambition \"like macbeth \". In a letter sent in july 1952, she said her time with him had given her \"an amazing insight on politicians – they really are a breed apart \". She described with great excitement how she was in love with \"the son of the ambassador to england \", but expressed concern he might prove to be like her father, john vernou bouvier. \"he's like my father in a way – loves the chase and is bored with the conquest – and once married needs proof he's still attractive, so flirts with other women and resents you.

Police official fadzil ahmat tells reuters that kim jong nam — the son of kim jong il and actress song hye rim — became dizzy and \" felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind \" while at kuala lumpur international airport on monday. He had been waiting for a flight to macau but instead died en route to a hospital. A cause of death has not been established and \" so far there are no suspects, \" ahmat says. However, south korean government sources tell local media that two women thought to be north korean agents poisoned kim using a needle before escaping in a taxi. South korea's foreign ministry says it can't confirm that report. The ap has a slightly different take via an unnamed senior malaysian official who says kim was attacked with a chemical spray. Kim — an \" overweight and careless playboy, but also a smart and open-minded man, \" per cnn — was once considered his father's heir before he fell out of favor. He didn't attend his father's funeral and later told a japanese newspaper that he \" insisted on reform and market-opening and was eventually viewed with suspicion, \" per usa today. Speculation from mark tokola, vice president at the korea economic institute in washington: \" it seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of kim jong un. \" kim jong nam, who spent much of his time in china, had also spoken out against his family and was said to have been close to his uncle, jang song thaek, who was executed in 2013.",

Sanjay gupta this week that he doesn't eat any dairy, eggs or meat, and consumes very little oil. He first opened up about his new plant-based diet last year to cnn's wolf blitzer. Clinton has turned to eating solely plants in order to keep weight off and his heart healthy. Clinton -- who used to be a huge fan of hamburgers, steaks and other foods of the like -- underwent the diet overhaul to reverse the heart disease he's been plagued with in the past. He underwent a quadruple bypass surgery in 2004 because blood flow was blocked to his heart, and just last year he had to have two stents put into his heart to \" open up veins from his bypass surgery, \" according to cnn.

            "Next week, the university of north texas will open the nation's first strictly vegan cafeteria. But administrators didn't create the vegan-friendly option to make a statement about animal welfare or sustainability so much as to provide more options for a student body whose tastes are growing increasingly diverse, said ken botts, director of special projects for dining services. So the southern comfort fare at a separate dining hall that's opening monday, then, is just another option designed to please the students. Despite the coincidental timing, the fried chicken and barbecue specialties at this cafeteria were not created to appease the non-vegan crowd, botts said. \" it is the other end of the spectrum, but it wasn't meant as a comfort for those folks who are going to say, ' well, i ' m not vegan and i want to eat meat, ' \" botts said. \" it's in alignment with the same thought, that this is a way for us to offer our population variety. \" north texas is winning praise from animal welfare advocates even if its officials didn't set out to make a statement of that sort: people for the ethical treatment of animals is awarding north texas a \" compassionate campus award. \" north texas is the first mainstream university to offer an all-vegan facility"

Us district judge peter messitte on wednesday denied the motion, which the washington post describes as apparently \" the first time a federal judge had interpreted [ the constitution's emoluments clauses ] and applied their restrictions to a sitting president. \" the suit, filed in 2017 by the democratic attorneys general of maryland and the district of columbia, says the document's emoluments clause forbids federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments without the consent of congress. The lawsuit says trump is doing exactly that by reaping profits from the trump international hotel in washington, dc, even while doing government business with other nations. In his ruling, messitte wrote that the allegations were plausible and that the ban could apply to any business dealings with foreign governments that resulted in a \" profit, gain, or advantage \" for trump. Cnn notes that the plaintiffs had been pushing to define emolument as an \" advantage, \" while trump's lawyers were looking to limit it to the definition of \" gift. \" the justice department's argument is that the original intention of the clause was to prevent bribe-taking, not legitimate business endeavors. The ap reports the decision will enable the plaintiffs to request the hotel's financial records, with the post adding it's possible they could try to get access to trump's tax returns.

The decision wednesday clears the way for the plaintiffs to seek financial records from the president's company. In his ruling, u.s. District judge peter j. Messitte rejected arguments from the justice department that earnings from business activities, including hotel room stays, do not qualify as unconstitutional gifts. At issue is the constitution's \" emoluments \" clause, which bans federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval. The plaintiffs argue trump's hotel harms area businesses because of the president's ties. Two other emoluments lawsuits are also moving through federal courts.",
            "Washington ( cnn ) a federal judge in maryland on wednesday denied a motion to dismiss portions of a lawsuit alleging that president donald trump, through his trump international hotel in dc and the trump organization, violated a constitutional clause banning gifts or advantages from foreign and domestic governments. In his opinion, judge peter messitte of the us district court of maryland largely sided with maryland and washington, dc's definition of emolument as an \" advantage. \" trump was arguing for a more restrictive definition of the term as a \" gift. \" department of justice spokesman andy reuss said the department is reviewing the judge's order. \" we continue to maintain that this case should be dismissed, a position that was shared by a new york court in a related case. The justice department is reviewing the order and determining next steps to continue vigorously defending the president, \" reuss said. Maryland and washington, dc, have argued that the trump international hotel's operations put other nearby hotels and entertainment properties at a competitive disadvantage, and that the trump hotel got special tax concessions. Messitte deferred a ruling on the president's motion to dismiss the case against him in an individual capacity.

            "Washington ( ap ) — a federal judge is allowing maryland and the district of columbia to proceed with their lawsuit accusing president donald trump of unconstitutionally accepting gifts from foreign and state interests through his washington hotel. The decision wednesday clears the way for the plaintiffs to seek financial records from the president's company. In his ruling, u.s. District judge peter j. Messitte rejected arguments from the justice department that earnings from business activities, including hotel room stays, do not qualify as unconstitutional gifts. At issue is the constitution's \" emoluments \" clause, which bans federal officials from accepting benefits from foreign or state governments without congressional approval. The plaintiffs argue trump's hotel harms area businesses because of the president's ties. Two other emoluments lawsuits are also moving through federal courts.",
            "Washington ( cnn ) a federal judge in maryland on wednesday denied a motion to dismiss portions of a lawsuit alleging that president donald trump, through his trump international hotel in dc and the trump organization, violated a constitutional clause banning gifts or advantages from foreign and domestic governments. In his opinion, judge peter messitte of the us district court of maryland largely sided with maryland and washington, dc's definition of emolument as an \" advantage. \" trump was arguing for a more restrictive definition of the term as a \" gift. \" department of justice spokesman andy reuss said the department is reviewing the judge's order. \" we continue to maintain that this case should be dismissed, a position that was shared by a new york court in a related case. The justice department is reviewing the order and determining next steps to continue vigorously defending the president, \" reuss said. Maryland and washington, dc, have argued that the trump international hotel's operations put other nearby hotels and entertainment properties at a competitive disadvantage, and that the trump hotel got special tax concessions. Messitte deferred a ruling on the president's motion to dismiss the case against him in an individual capacity. However, the court is still considering whether he violated the emoluments clause in an official cap acity. The ruling is on the president's lawyers motion to dismiss an amended lawsuit from washington, dc, and maryland. An earlier motion to dismiss was also rejected.

Some highlights: on kim jong un: \" people are saying, \" is he sane? \" i have no idea.... He was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father. He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others. And at a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, i ' m sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie. \" on getting china to lean on north korea: \" and if i can use trade as a method to get china, because i happen to think that china does have reasonably good powers over north korea. Now, if china can help us with north korea and can solve that problem... That's worth making not as good a trade deal for the united states, right? \" on democrats: \" the democrats have been totally obstructionist. Chuck schumer has turned out to be a bad leader. He's a bad leader for the country. And the democrats are extremely obstructionist. \" on the presidency: \" i love doing it. I ' m, you know, thoroughly enjoying it. It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge. But it's something that i really love and i think i've done a very good job at it.... It's a tough job. But i've had a lot of tough jobs. I've had things that were tougher, although i ' ll let you know that better at the end of eight years. Perhaps eight years. \" on his nickname for face the nation: \" i love your show. I call it deface the nation. But, you know, your show is sometimes not exactly correct. \" the full transcript of the interview is here. Trump also penned an op-ed for the washington post here.",

In fact, the privacy and civil liberties oversight board thinks the nsa's surveillance is illegal and should be shut down, the new york times reports. The board takes particular aim at the legal underpinnings of the surveillance, section 215 of the patriot act. The government maintains that the law gives the nsa a green light to collect all phone records in the us, but the board disagrees. The law requires that such records be relevant to an investigation, and it's impossible that the billions obtained daily could be used for a single investigation \" without redefining that word in a manner that is circular, unlimited in scope, \" concludes the report, per the washington post.

He talks about how the ordeal was \" a real kick in the chops \" and the slew of physical complications afterward — he said at one point, one of his testicles \" blew up to the size of a basketball. \" there were also the psychological hurdles: he had to sit down to urinate, and he \" came to terms \" with the fact he'd probably never have sex again.

        "summary": "A flight from paris to new york is easier on the brain than one from new york to paris, according to a new study that finds jet lag is based not only on distance traveled, but also the direction of travel. In the journal chaos, researchers from the university of maryland present a mathematical model that considers the brain's \" neuronal oscillator cells, \" which regulate a person's biological clock, or circadian rhythm. Though everyone's clock is different, it tends to operate on a schedule slightly longer than 24 hours, study author michelle girvan explains, per live science. That means the brain responds better to a longer day achieved by flying west across time zones than a shorter one achieved by flying east. Researchers say a person flying west across three time zones can recover in less than four days, while a person flying east would need a little more than four days. The divide becomes more apparent across more time zones. A person flying west across nine time zones would need a little less than eight days to recover, compared to more than 12 days for those flying east — though the recovery for crossing 12 time zones is about nine days either way. The mathematical model — which considers external cues like sunlight and geographical latitude, per cnn — was based on a circadian rhythm of 24.5 hours, and some people \" may have longer or shorter natural rhythms, \" girvan says. But overall, the study shows that the general rule of giving yourself one day of recovery for every time zone crossed is off base. Girvan says researchers hope the model will \" serve as a guide for developing more in-depth qualitative approaches, as well as strategies to combat circadian rhythm disruptions due to rapid cross-time-zone travel, shift work, or blindness, \" per science alert. ( this trick might stop jet lag before it starts. )",

        "summary": "Within 10 years of republicans dismantling the affordable care act, 32 million more americans could be uninsured and individual insurance premiums could double, according to a report from the nonpartisan congressional budget office. The report, requested by democrats, is based on 2015 legislation to repeal obamacare passed by congress but vetoed by president obama, politico reports. According to the new york times, the cbo states the result of repealing major parts of the aca — penalties for not having insurance, expanding medicaid, ending subsidies for low-income people — would have immediate negative consequences that only \" worsen over time. \" the report found that in the first year 18 million people could lose insurance and premiums could increase by 25 %. While the cbo's estimates jibe with those from insurance companies and the obama administration, republicans argue the report is one-sided because it doesn't take into account an obamacare replacement. A spokesperson for mitch mcconnell tells politico that repealing the aca without replacing it is a \" situation that simply doesn't exist. \" however, republicans in congress have yet to introduce any sort of replacement plan. And new york magazine reports newt gingrich has already suggested doing away with the cbo over — in the magazine's words — its \" inconvenient budget math. \"",

Little is currently known about the impact of an infection on the male reproductive system, and while what happens to mice doesn't necessarily translate to humans, it's \" a red flag you need to pursue, \" as the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, which helped fund the study, tells abc news. Researchers infected male mice with a mouse-adapted african or asian zika virus strain and found that they showed signs of infection by day seven, per a press release; by day 14, their testes had shrank visibly, while the seminiferous tubules where sperm form began to break down, too. Overall, abc notes that testicles shrank by 90 % of their weight. The mouse's own inflammatory cells piled on their own attack, and by day 42 sperm motility was slashed threefold, while testosterone levels were down, too — all signs of greatly reduced fertility. To wit, infected males impregnated females at a quarter the average rate, and those who did conceive had half the normal number of pups. The lead researcher in the study tells abc that he thinks the damage is permanent. Interestingly, the mice were most affected by the african strain, while those infected with the related dengue virus didn't suffer similar effects. It's time, researchers conclude, to see what happens to the reproductive health of men who've been infected with the zika virus. ( zika proved to be a no-show at the olympics. )",

For modern women, there's an app for that, the new york times reports. More specifically, there are at least six of them, run by for-profit and nonprofit agencies including planned parenthood. Meant to widen access to birth control in a nation in which 40 % of pregnancies are accidental, some of these apps and websites issue prescriptions after women answer clinicians ' questions — some use a video interview — while others ship direct to your doorstep. All of them offer birth-control pills, notes the times, while only some offer birth-control patches, rings, or even the morning-after pill. For some women, the new technology is a time-saver that allows them to avoid missing work to head to the doctor's office, while for others it affords privacy. In fact, it has the potential to become the \" new normal, \" as a headline at cosmopolitan puts it. On the flip side, the los angeles times talks to a nurse practitioner who is worried about women missing out on important face time with doctors, especially the small percentage for whom birth control can result in serious side effects. Her suggested compromise: women should see their doctor for their first prescription, use apps or similar services for refills, and return for a face-to-face visit after two years. The lat runs through the more popular apps, while the nyt has a four-question primer on how to choose services. ( meanwhile, birth control for men is on the horizon. )",

The plunge came despite a 2.4 % drop in the median price. \"the foreclosure flow is robbing demand from the new-homes market, \" one analyst tells bloomberg. \"the new-homes market just can't get off the floor. If new homes suffer, construction suffers and jobs suffer. \" january marked the third straight month sales have fallen, after rising steadily for most of last year.

            "See corrections &amp; amplifications item below. Sales of new single-family homes plunged last month, underscoring the fragility in the housing market. Sales dropped 11.2 % in january from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 309,000, the commerce department said wednesday. The decline brought sales to their lowest level since the government began tracking the numbers in 1963. Sales were 6.1 % lower than in january 2009. This gauge of new-home sales is particularly volatile because it is based on a very small sample size and carries a wide margin of error. Still, the sharp decline is an indication that the housing market remains feeble, despite improvements in the past year fueled by low mortgage rates, reduced home prices and a government tax credit for home buyers. The tax credit, which was expanded and extended, is set to expire april 30. It could lead to an upturn in sales in the next couple of months as buyers rush to take advantage of it, analysts say. U.s. Home builders have sounded more optimistic in recent months, convinced they have survived the worst of the housing downturn.

Police say sunmee kim, 44, filed charges against a man she called her fiance, claiming he had attacked her at their home in the small city of mountain view. She wouldn't give her full name and had no noticeable injuries, police say, but they briefly arrested the man — which apparently enabled her to rob his house. On further investigation, police learned she had allegedly pretended to be kidnapped in los angeles in 2009 to get a man to pay ransom, and pulled the domestic abuse/robbery scam in irvine a few years later. She was arrested in palo alto on thursday for outstanding warrant charges in los angeles and orange counties. \" she was sentenced in orange county for almost the exact same crime and then she disappeared for about five years, \" says a mountain view police spokeswoman. \" this isn't something that happened out of happenstance. We're thinking her ( modus operandi ) is pretty prolific. \" she has also served time behind bars after conning men in southern california seven years ago, cbs los angeles reports. Using aliases, kim apparently meets men on a korean dating website and gets close to them before running her scam. In one case, an irvine man sued police for $ 150,000, saying they failed to verify her claims before arresting him and allowing his place to be robbed.",

        "summary": "When a childhood pastime comes with a million-dollar price tag, sometimes the pastime loses out. In recent years, a 5-year-old's sledding injury led to a $ 2 million lawsuit against omaha, neb., while another case saw sioux city, iowa, paying $ 2.75 million. Such cases are prompting cities in states from nebraska to new jersey to crack down on sledding, banning the practice on many hills, the ap reports. Dubuque, iowa, for instance, is poised to ban most sledding, allowing it in only two parks. The planned ban \" stinks, \" a city council member tells kcrg, \" but if we get hit with one of these ( suits ), it's a lot of money for our citizens. \" in other cases, city signs note that sledders do so at their own risk. The city of paxton, ill., even physically removed a sledding hill. It wasn't a natural one: the city had basically used dirt to hide a pile of concrete and junk. Trees were growing at the site, and some feared that sledders would hit them. \" we live in a lawsuit-happy society, and cities are just being protective by banning sledding in areas that pose a risk for injury or death, \" says a man who runs a sledding website. That risk is very real: one study found that in the decade ending in 2007, sledding-related injuries landed some 20,000 kids a year in the er. But one mom tells the ap she thinks individuals, not the government, should take responsibility. \" you need to have a mindset to make the best decisions for your own safety, \" she notes.",

Oliver focused on president trump \" lying \" to coal miners: \" stop telling them that their jobs are all coming back when they're not. Stop telling them that coal is clean when it isn't. And stop pretending that this isn't an industry in the middle of a painful — albeit necessary — transition. \" but during the segment, he also ripped into murray for, per oliver, not doing enough to safeguard his miners. During the episode, oliver revealed his team had contacted murray's company before the segment aired, and the company had responded with a cease-and-desist letter. Oliver also pointed out that murray has a history of suing media outlets, the independent reports, and predicted that his show would soon get a lawsuit of its own. The suit accuses last week tonight of \" execut[ ing ] a meticulously planned attempt to assassinate the character of and reputation of mr. Robert e. Murray and his companies. \" one of the issues brought up by oliver was a collapse of one of murray's utah mines that killed nine people; oliver cited a government report finding that unauthorized mining practices were to blame, but murray's lawsuit insists an earthquake was to blame and says oliver ignored studies supporting that claim.",

That's because kentucky lawmakers just passed house bill 2, which keeps federally approved radiologists from diagnosing the disease and leaves it mostly to doctors often employed by coal companies. \" throughout the united states, i know of nowhere where radiologists are taken completely out of the evaluation for potential black lung disease, \" says brandon crum, a radiologist who's being excluded. \" that's what we're primarily trained in. \" kentucky will only allow its federally certified pulmonologists to read those x-rays; the state has six, four of whom are typically hired by coal companies, and one is partly retired. Apparently radiologists tend to side with coal miners and diagnose them with black lung, while kentucky's pulmonologists diagnose more conservatively. \" obviously we do not have a standardized process so we are trying to standardize it, \" says rep. Adam koenig, a republican. But critics say house bill 2 simply sides with coal companies as black lung is becoming more common. A recent study found that central appalachia is suffering from a historic cluster of the disease, which is caused by dust inhalation while coal mining, the lexington herald leader reports. New rules are designed to limit permissible mine dust, but many miners worked in the bad old days and are getting sick now. \" it's shocking and it shouldn't be happening, \" says an author of the study.",

But as the chicago tribune notes, it may not ultimately affect his 14-year sentence, and he's not getting out in the interim. The federal appeals court called the evidence against blagojevich \" overwhelming \" — the other 13 convictions against him stand — and suggested the original sentence was not at all too harsh. However, the court found that jurors got improper instructions on five counts connected to his proposed deal with the white house: in exchange for a cabinet post, he'd appoint obama aide valerie jarrett to the president's vacated senate seat, reports the chicago sun-times. Prosecutors could appeal, seek to retry blagojevich on the five counts, or let blagojevich go back before the original judge for resentencing. The appeals court didn't sound sympathetic to blagojevich, but because the five counts may have had some effect on the total sentence, it says the judge must take another look. \"it is not possible to call 168 months unlawfully high for blagojevich's crimes, but the district judge should consider on remand whether it is the most appropriate sentence, \" says today's opinion.

Limbaugh asked gingrich why, then, did he call ryan to apologize for the remark, if it wasn't made in reference to ryan. \" it was interpreted in a way which was causing trouble which he doesn't need or deserve, \" gingrich said. \" my answer wasn't about the budget, and i promptly went back to say publicly that i would have voted for the ryan budget. \"",

Candidates wear what they think we want them to wear, they participate in activities because they think it ' ll make us like them more ( hand me a beer! i love drinking beer! ), they carefully construct every sentence to alienate as few people as possible. In so doing, the voter doesn't actually get to know the real candidate, only the person the candidate wants the voter to see. And this is why we're commending newt gingrich for his choice of ringtone. If, as a republican presidential candidate, you're going to have a song as a ringtone, it might be politically astute to choose something from, say, lee greenwood, or maybe just the \" star spangled banner. \" that could impress some primary voters, if only subconsciously. At a minimum, it certainly couldn't hurt. But gingrich's ringtone isn't anything that's going to impress gop primary voters. His ringtone is abba. Much of the world was alerted to this fact when gingrich's phone went off during a meeting in iowa today.

        "summary": "The uk remains in disarray after last week's brexit vote, with the pound continuing to slump, chaos at the top of both main political parties, and widespread confusion over what leaving the european union is going to involve. Top figures in the ruling conservative party have been jockeying for position since prime minister david cameron announced his resignation friday, but the opposition labour party is in no position to take advantage, the new york times reports. Labour leader jeremy corbyn is facing rebellion from party members who fear his leftist policies will doom the party to defeat in a possible election this year. At least 10 members of corbyn's shadow cabinet resigned after he fired shadow foreign secretary hillary benn in an attempt to stop a leadership coup. In other developments: the leaders of germany, france, and italy are meeting in berlin today and the speed of britain's departure is expected to be the main focus of talks, the bbc reports. France and germany say they are in \" full agreement, \" though it isn't clear exactly what the position they agree on is. Boris johnson, a key brexit supporter who is seeking to replace cameron as prime minister, toned down his position so much in his weekly telegraph column that it almost seemed like a u-turn. He said britain will continue to increase cooperation with the eu in many areas, any changes will come slowly, and brexit supporters need to accept that a 52 % to 48 % victory is \" not entirely overwhelming, \" the guardian reports. In early trading, indexes in britain, france, and germany all fell, with banking stocks particularly hard hit. \" the extent of the uncertainty that now clouds the uk's economic and political outlook is hard to exaggerate, \" kit juckes, strategist at societe generale, tells cnn. The washington post spoke to voters in tilbury, a fading port town in southeast england that heavily backed brexit, and finds that many of them are already regretting the vote, feeling that they were lied to by politicians in the leave campaign. Reuters reports that since cameron says he won't personally trigger article 50 to leave the eu, it is far from clear when the british exit will actually happen. Some officials now say a vote in parliament will have to happen first, though eu foreign ministers now want the exit to happen quickly. ( scotland's first minister says she is prepared to block brexit to protect scottish interests. )",

According to kabc, lee baca, who served as sheriff for 15 years, was found guilty of obstructing justice for his role in a scheme to hamper an fbi investigation into alleged abuses at los angeles county jails. Guards were accused of beating inmates, and during an fbi investigation in 2011, deputies under baca moved the fbi's prison informant to keep him from agents, told the informant and other deputies not to cooperate with the fbi, and threatened to arrest the lead fbi agent in an effort to intimidate her, the los angeles times reports. The three-year sentence for baca, who's 74 years old and suffering the early stages of alzheimer's, is one more than prosecutors requested and a far cry from an attempted plea deal of fewer than six months. Judge percy anderson was critical of baca for not taking responsibility for his role in the obstruction plot, saying he would have sentenced baca to five years in prison if not for his alzheimer's. \"your actions embarrass the thousands of men and women who put their lives on the line every day, \" anderson told baca during sentencing. After sentencing, baca said it \" was an honor \" to serve los angeles county for more than 48 years. It's unclear where baca will serve his sentence, which starts in july. He was the 21st person convicted in relation to the jail misconduct and ensuing obstruction.",

At least steinhardt isn't alone in his legal troubles: fraternity president jamieson tymann, 21 was charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer after allegedly punching a cop in the chest and eye. The officer needed stitches. Police say a robbery and stabbing were also connected to the party in some way. Each of steinhardt's citations carries with it a fine of up to $ 2,500, but wusa says he's \" unlikely \" to be hit with the full $ 275,000 penalty.",

But witnesses place him at the scene along with jairo peralta and diangelo enriquez, who, respectively, are accused of killing the robbery victim and cutting a guy who tried to run away.

        "summary": "It sounds more the stuff of a soap opera than reality, but as an el paso, texas, courtroom has heard, it was very much the stuff of real life — and death. Samuel velasco was last monday convicted on three counts of conspiracy to commit murder in a foreign country: the first murder was that of velasco's father-in-law, francisco maria sagredo villareal, who was murdered in his house in ciudad juarez, mexico, on oct. 3, 2008. His daughter cinthia sagredo escobedo was murdered in the same city on nov. 20. Two days later, ruth sagredo escobedo — daughter of francisco and sister of cinthia — was murdered while in her sister's funeral procession, reports kdbc. Prosecutors say velasco arranged to have his wife's relatives killed in order to lure her across the border and to her own death. Ruth sagredo didn't attend her father's funeral, per court documents cited by the washington post, so her sister was next killed. As for why velasco wanted sagredo dead: he was staring at a possible 99-year sentence in connection with a 2005 sex-assault case involving a child. Vice news reports sagredo was the only witness the prosecution intended to call, as the victim confided in her ( the post specifies the victim was velasco's 4-year-old stepdaughter ). Sagredo had married velasco in february 2004 but filed for divorce 11 months later, with her stated date of separation as the date the alleged molestation occurred. Sagredo's first husband testified that she was \" very adamant \" that velasco should \" pay for what he did. \" the sex-assault case was dismissed in 2009; velasco now faces mandatory life in federal prison at his jan. 25 sentencing, per an ice press release.",

Environmentalists from ocean cleanup who set out to survey the so-called \" great pacific garbage patch \" were stunned by the density of plastic containers, fishing nets, and other refuse. Reconnaissance flights over the heart of the swirling dump between california and hawaii found chunks of garbage, mostly plastics, many of them measuring more than half a yard. Ocean cleanup's founder boyan slat called the refuse a \" ticking time bomb because the big stuff will crumble down to micro-plastics over the next few decades if we don't act. \" fish and other marine life eat the micro-plastics, passing them up the food chain. The patch measures about 1.3 million square miles, with the heart of it spanning about 386,000 square miles. The un says it is growing so quickly, it can be seen from space. This was the first-ever aerial survey of the garbage patch, notes a post at science daily, which adds that \" more debris was recorded than what is expected to be found in the heart of the accumulation zone. \" in fact, \" it was impossible to record everything, \" slat tells the guardian. \" it was bizarre. \" next year the group plans to test a v-shaped rubber boom that aims to herd floating rubbish into a cone.

Jurors did not buy the defense's argument that holmes, now 27, was legally insane at the time of the shooting — he had pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Had they done so, he would have been sent to a mental health facility instead of facing prison or the death penalty. The jury deliberated about 12 hours over the course of two days. Holmes showed no reaction as the guilty verdicts were being read in court, reports ap. ( he faced a total of 165 counts. ) holmes never denied his role in the attack. Afterward, he told psychiatrists that he thought the assault would increase his \" human capital, \" which the denver post explains is a theory of his own concoction that taking the lives of others would increase the value of his own.",

As arrendale tried to defend herself with a baseball bat, davis turned the bat on her, inniello tells wsb. Then arrendale, with 6-month-old daughter cobie in her arms, managed to retreat to a bathroom and lock the door. But davis got in anyway, this time with his assault rifle, inniello says, and shot arrendale in the head. That's when the 33-year-old somehow managed to save cobie, even as she died. \" he shot her and they ( police ) don't know how she was able to twist her body and fall literally in the opposite direction, \" inniello says. Somehow, arrendale fell over the toilet bowl instead of onto the floor, dropping cobie into the bowl and covering her with her body. \" she had pure will, \" ionniello says. \" she wanted that baby to live. \" ionniello believes davis would have killed cobie had he been able to see her; instead, he walked into his daughter's room and killed himself. The baby remained in the toilet bowl for 13 hours before police finally deemed the home safe to enter; she had a head injury, which inniello says may have come from the bat, and was also treated for hypothermia. The atlanta journal-constitution reports that she is in child services ' custody, but inniello says she hopes to take her home soon, where she ' ll join her 15-year-old sister.

When substance abuse affects an ordinary individual it is thought to be the result of stress or depression. With celebrities, we tend to blame their extravagance getting the better of them ( and the luxury rehab centers they attend don't help their case ). What celebrities have been to rehab? as robin williams joked, \" cocaine is god's way of telling you you are making too much money. \" that said, alcoholism is a disease, and there are worse things than alcohol, such as heroin, cocaine/crack, and meth. Treatment centers and famous rehab centers also deal with more than just drug abuse. One can go to the hospital for conditions such as anorexia as well. Many in hollywood have checked in, from the sadly all too common headline \" actress in rehab, \" to comedians who entered rehab to deal with addiction. At the end of the day though, we should respect the individuals on this list for seeking the help they needed. List is alphabetized by first name. List ordered by all voters reranker: 1"

        "summary": "It isn't just recently that humans have hunted animals to extinction. It appears that 100,000 years ago a giant kangaroo lived in the australian outback, where it walked instead of hopped. But perhaps due to its slowness, the creature was an easy target for hunters who arrived somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago. By 30,000 years ago, the lumbering family of kangaroos was extinct. Called \" sthenurines, \" the kangaroos were up to three times the size of modern ones; sported larger bones and larger hip and knee joints; and had a larger pelvis to help balance while shifting between feet, reports the telegraph. What they didn't have: the flexible backbone and hefty tail that today's kangaroos do. \" we've known for a while that sthenurines were different in their dietary behavior, \" the lead author of the paper, published in plos one, tells the bbc. What they're finding now is that the extinct kangaroo was stocky at up to 550 pounds ( the bbc points out that's bigger than a male lion ), stood nearly 7 feet tall, and had only one toe on each hind foot, compared to the modern version's four. \" the biggest ones got to a size that does strain the credulity of hopping, \" says christine janis. \" obviously you're going out on a limb when you're proposing something about an extinct animal. But all the data fit. \" the concept of walking instead of hopping is bizarre but not unprecedented: some tree kangaroos in papua new guinea are reportedly bipedal. ( meanwhile, scientists think of the large tail of today's kangaroos as a fifth leg. )",

        "summary": "The literature world rejoiced yesterday in hearing that harper lee would be publishing her reportedly long-lost second novel more than 50 years after to kill a mockingbird. But others aren't so sure everything's on the up-and-up, citing the author's notoriously publicity-shy nature, the recent death of her fiercely protective sister, and the somewhat shady characters that have swirled around her for years, perhaps preying on her age and reported ill health. After all, lee won a pulitzer prize in 1961 for her debut effort, and in a 1962 press conference, when asked how she felt about a possible second novel, she replied, \" i ' m scared, \" as per the new york times. ( lee herself noted in the publisher's statement released yesterday that she'd written the new novel before mockingbird. ) as megan garber writes for the atlantic in pondering lee's legacy: \" why end the silence? and why do it now? \" the skepticism partly comes from the fact that lee has been linked in the past ( and perhaps the present ) with those who may not have been looking after her best interests. She sued samuel pinkus, her ex-agent, for reportedly \" duping \" her out of the copyright to mockingbird ( they settled in 2013 ); she disputed she had anything to do with a memoir published about her in 2014; and she \" has a history of signing whatever's put in front of her, \" sometimes at the urging of tonja carter, her tight-lipped attorney, gawker has noted. But it's the loss of alice lee — her older sister and most ardent protector — that may have upped the vulnerability level of lee, said by multiple sources to be mostly blind and deaf after a 2007 stroke. \" just feels very potentially exploitative, especially given how tkam itself was exploited and how badly lee was cheated, \" a tweet cited on jezebel reads.",

The move raises all sorts of questions: why would the republicans, rather than the democrats, be insisting on having the vote that the president has been demanding for weeks? what does reid's move say about the filibuster? and why is the senate debating a bill on chinese currency anyway, one that the white house opposes and stands little chance in the house? senate republicans, aware that some democrats facing reelection are unwilling to vote for a jobs package that includes tax hikes on the wealthy, wanted to stage a vote to demonstrate the",

What critics are saying about this detective story ( note: one mild spoiler ): \" in a world filled with cinema replicants — sturdy, shiny, carefully engineered jobs that almost duplicate the look and warmth of a real movie — blade runner 2049 is that rarest of sequels: an original, \" writes stephen whitty at the newark star-ledger.

A word of caution: ford is a late arrival, so you ' ll have a long wait until he shows up — though \" it's terrific when he does. \" soren andersen agrees. Blade runner 2049 is \" deeply imagined \" and the rare sequel that is at least the equal of its iconic original, \" he writes at the seattle times. The performances show \" restraint, \" allowing the characters to \" keep the audience guessing, \" including at the answer to the film's \" essential question \": \" what makes us human? \" villeneuve \" may have fallen a little too in love with his own creation; at two hours and 40 minutes, aesthetic shock and awe eventually outpace the narrative, \" leah greenblatt writes at entertainment weekly. \" but how could he not, when nearly every impeccably composed shot … feels like such a ravishing visual feast? \" she adds. She dubs the film \" the elevation of mainstream moviemaking to high art. \" the praise only continues from joe morgenstern, who refers to blade runner 2049 as \" a classic renewed with soulful beauty. \" the film is \" longer than it should be and short on clarity. \" but \" villeneuve's direction enlivens blade runner 2049 with verve and heart, \" he writes at the wall street journal.

Saturday, september 24 at about 2: 45 p.m., new york city, 12th street near university place: an african-american citizen wearing a striped shirt is dragged from the sidewalk near the intersection by a white-shirted senior police officer assisted by a blue-shirted patrol officer. Forced into the street the man is taken to the ground and descended upon by several officers in order to arrest him. Meanwhile, several yards west on 12th a group of women are being herded into a small area in front of a restaurant trying to do business. Under the supervision of the white shirts, blue-shirted officers begin to create a pen for their detainees with an orange plastic net. The young women, not being told what is going on, are visibly upset by this treatment and facing up the street confront a female officer about their rights and their unlawful detention. One young woman, wearing a black t-shirt with the word \" trip \" on the front, is particularly offended and raises the objection of being treated as if they were in a 1940's fascist state. She then separates from the group and joins others to the east who are chanting \" shame \" over the treatment of this man. This young woman, in her chanting, is holding on to the orange barricade - although it is important to note she is neither trying to escape from the pen into the street nor to tear down the restraining wall. As they try to reason with the female officer rather than respond to their question she places her hand, palm up, with her arm outstretched about one inch in front ofthe face of a women now known as chelsea elliot. It has been reported that one of the women being detained in this pen was hearing impaired. The women continue to focus their attention on their condition rather than the arrest taking place in the street. Across the street by the rear of a taxi detained in the police action several bystanders begin to film and photograph the pile-on taking place with the male arrestee.

But i never know what others will think.

I ' m not sure he came off as presidential at all, which he needed to, his answers on race, birthers [ were ] damaging to him. \" in an unscientific survey at time, trump was seen as the winner by 51 % of readers, at least in the first hour after the debate. More than 150,000 had cast votes. Andrew sullivan, new york: \" clinton was not great at times; her language was occasionally stilted; she missed some obvious moments to go in for the kill; but she was solid and reassuring and composed. I started tonight believing she needed a game-changer to alter the trajectory of this race. I may, of course, be wrong, trapped in my own confirmation bias and bubble — but i thought she did just that. \" nick bilton, vanity fair: \" in conclusion, it doesn't really matter who won or lost during the debate. People who were voting for clinton are still voting for clinton; people who love trump, still love him. The reality is, at the end of the day, most people are one-issue voters and they have already made up their mind about who they are going to vote for. \" chris cillizza, washington post: he has clinton as the clear winner.
