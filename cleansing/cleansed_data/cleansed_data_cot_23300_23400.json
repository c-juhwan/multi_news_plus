        "summary": "For three weeks, a construction worker drank four or five energy drinks per day to help keep up with his intense workload. Then his body went haywire. In a bizarre case florida doctors describe in the british medical journal, the 50-year-old man started gulping down energy drinks on the job but suddenly began vomiting after about three weeks. Soon, his skin turned yellow, but it wasn't the caffeine or even the sugar that was the problem. At a hospital, the man showed signs of liver damage, and a biopsy confirmed he had acute hepatitis, believed to have been brought on by high intake of vitamin b3, or niacin, found in his energy drink of choice. ( it wasn't named. ) each bottle had about 200 % of the daily recommended dose, reports gizmodo. In safe quantities, niacin — also found in green vegetables, meat, and eggs — can improve cholesterol levels and liver function and lower cardiovascular risk. But it also wreaks havoc on the body if too much is consumed. Though the man's daily intake of 160 to 200 milligrams was below the toxic level, the accumulation of niacin over three weeks was enough to do damage; the same thing happened years ago to a woman who drank 10 energy drinks daily for two weeks, reports medical news today. The male patient recovered and was told to avoid similar niacin-rich products in the future. But \" as the energy drink market continues to rapidly expand, consumers should be aware of the potential risks of their various ingredients, \" doctors say. ( even a single energy drink may be dangerous. )",

Within three years, it was churning out more denim than anywhere else in the world, reports the triad city beat; in its heyday, white oak clocked in at 1.6 million square feet, making it the world's largest such plant and the long-time supplier of denim for levi's 501 jeans. After a 112-year run, what the new york times calls a \" shrine to bluejeans and the last major manufacturer of selvage denim \" in america will close dec. 31 ( the company does have plants in mexico and china ); current owner international textile group made the announcement, which affects 208 workers, in october. Though the plant does employ modern looms, it also made denim the \" right \" and \" painstaking \" way, per the times. As apparel news explains, a rising desire for selvage denim ( see a primer on the sturdier, more unique, and pricier denim here ) spurred cone to source and refurbish 1940s-era american draper x3 fly-shuttle looms to produce it. The official word from the company on the closure cited \" changes in market demand \" and noted that the plant's size and capacity created \" a significantly higher manufacturing cost that cannot be supported in a sustainable business going forward. \" the winston-salem journal shares another of the plant's claims-to-fame: during 1969 storms, 3 million yards of denim ended up getting wet and required cleaning. Workers washed it in a chemical solution that caused streaks in the fabric — and cone sold it anyway, under the name \" pinto wash, \" giving america its first bleached jeans. ( now we are instead a nation that wears these and these. )",

That prolific production came to an end on jan. 27 with fischer's death at the age of 96 in germany, the new york times notes.

The white house revoked acosta's press credentials after he rebuffed an intern who was trying to take his mic away as the reporter peppered president trump with questions. Now the network wants a judge to intervene and restore his credentials, reports the washington post. The white house accused acosta of \" placing his hands \" on the female intern, and acosta accused the white house of distorting what happened. Controversy also erupted over video of the incident. \"we have asked this court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass be returned to jim, \" said a network statement. \" if left unchallenged, the actions of the white house would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials, \" it added, per politico. The development comes after renowned first amendment lawyer floyd abrams floated the idea of a lawsuit over the weekend on cnn. \" i think it's a really strong lawsuit, \" said abrams. The suit names six defendants: trump, chief of staff john kelly, press chief sarah sanders, deputy chief of staff for communications bill shine, secret service director joseph clancy, and an unnamed secret service officer who took the physical pass from acosta.

This week, the australian government is responding to criticism — specifically from singer morrissey and french actor brigitte bardot — of its plan to kill 2 million feral cats by 2020. \" our native species are simply not equipped to coexist with feral cats, \" the bbc quotes official gregory andrews in open letters to the celebrities. \" they did not evolve alongside predators like the feral cat. \" the plan to cull the feral cat population was announced in july. Since that time, morrissey has condemned the plan as \" taking idiocy just too far \" and called the australian government \" a committee of sheep-farmers who have zero concerns about animal welfare or animal respect, \" the bbc reports. Bardot calls the plan \" scandalous \" and says, \" this animal genocide is inhumane and ridiculous. \" andrews points out an even bigger animal genocide is being perpetrated by feral cats on the native wildlife. At least 27 species are extinct already in large part due to the cats, and the felines are currently endangering more than 120 more. He says each feral cat kills around five animals every day. According to the australian government, feral cats are a graver threat to native wildlife than even habitat loss, the times reports. Australia's plan is supported by the world wildlife fund and nature conservancy.",

Researchers say that for the very first time, they've developed human eggs in the lab from their earliest points of growth to full maturity, offering insight into how science can potentially help women down the road suffering from infertility or whose fertility is jeopardized by such procedures as cancer treatments, the guardian reports. In the study published in the molecular human reproduction journal, the scientists retrieved ovarian tissue from 10 female subjects in their late 20s and early 30s and nurtured them in the lab with nutrient-heavy \" cocktails. \" there were four steps involved, and of the 48 eggs that made it to the third step, nine achieved full maturity — the point at which eggs can be fertilized. Although the development is being heralded as \" valuable, \" scientists both involved with the study and those looking in from the outside warn the process is still in its infancy and needs years of further research to ensure the eggs are healthy and viable. The efficiency of the process, for example, wasn't stellar — nine mature eggs total wasn't a huge success rate — and the large polar cells found in those nine eggs may be worrisome, as that increased size could suggest abnormal eggs, a human reproduction expert tells forbes. Still, one of the study's co-authors sees their work as an important first step on this fertility front. \" it's very exciting to obtain proof of principle that it's possible to reach this stage in human tissue, \" evelyn telfer tells the bbc. \" this is a big breakthrough in improving understanding of human egg development. \"",

        "summary": "The snowman, a film about a detective on the trail of a serial killer slogging around chilly norway, is getting, well, a wintry reception. And that's putting it kindly. The tomas alfredson-directed film, based on the best-selling novel by norwegian jo nesbo, currently has an abysmal 12 % rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: adam graham calls the film \" the most puzzlingly bad movie of the year. \" it \" plods along so clumsily and aimlessly that it has the feel of something that has been reassembled in post-production by three separate teams, \" he writes at detroit news. \" playground snowball fights have more suspense and intrigue, \" he adds. Planning to see the snowman anyway? be warned: \" the film's trailer advertises a completely different film, \" and even include shots that aren't actually in the film. Despite an a-list cast and a \" picturesque \" norwegian setting, the film is \" not worth slogging through, \" writes moira macdonald at the seattle times. She blames a screenplay tailored so that \" the first half-hour in particular feels like there's no plot at all. \" even after the serial killer plot emerges, odd subplots divert viewers ' attention, she writes. You're left with \" a puzzle, \" namely \" why all of these talented people [ martin scorsese is an executive producer ] couldn't make a better movie. \" it's \" ugly and nasty, \" but \" the worst is that it's boring and makes no sense, \" writes mick lasalle. He describes several other complaints at the san francisco chronicle, including that michael fassbender's detective is a bore and the serial killer he's hunting is hardly less so. This leads to a climax that \" borders on the hilarious — or at least seems that way to an audience made giddy by two hours of boredom and confusion. \" manohla dargis is no more kind. The snowman is \" a grim, thrill-free thriller, one without a twitch of real feeling and next to no elementary story sense, \" she writes at the new york times. Though often pretty to look at, there are multiple \" narrative complications \" and \" no glue \" connecting the scenes, resulting in \" a leaden, clotted, exasperating mess. \" she concludes nesbo's book is \" far more complex … than anything in this movie. \"",

A federal jury last week convicted prabhu ramamoorthy of the abuse, and he faces a life term at his sentencing in december, reports the detroit free press. Ramamoorthy is an indian national who has been in the us on a work visa, and if he is ever released from jail in america, he would be immediately deported. The assault occurred on a late-night flight from las vegas to detroit. The female passenger, in the window seat, says she woke with ramamoorthy's hand down her pants, which had been unbuttoned. Her shirt was undone, too. She immediately went to the rear of the plane to alert flight attendants, and ramamoorthy was arrested when the plane landed. Prosecutors say ramamoorthy penetrated the woman with his fingers. Another jarring detail from the case: ramamoorthy was in the middle seat and his wife, who was not charged, was in the aisle seat. Ramamoorthy gave investigators conflicting stories, once saying he had taken a sleeping pill and was unaware of his actions. But he also acknowledged to an fbi agent that he \" might have \" unhooked the woman's bra while playing with it, per cnn. During the trial, his attorney suggested that ramamoorthy was unfamiliar with the us court system and feared torture if he didn't confess, reports the washington post. It remained unclear whether he would appeal. \"everyone has the right to be secure and safe when they travel on airplanes, \" said us attorney matthew schneider. \"we appreciate the victim in this case for her courage to speak out. \"",

The bigger goal is to get a longer-term deal in six months. Iran's top negotiator says many of the specifics are covered in a 30-page informal text \" not yet publicly acknowledged by western officials, \" reports the los angeles times. The negotiator, abbas araqchi, told an iranian news agency that tehran will retain plenty of leeway on its nuclear program. \" no facility will be closed, enrichment will continue, and qualitative and nuclear research will be expanded, \" he said. \"all research into a new generation of centrifuges will continue. \"",

Unfortunately, this means that the village has lacked maintenance for quite some time and the original, gorgeous tuscan stone has begun to crumble. The foliage is also wildly overgrown.

For one, pratariccia has been abandoned since the 1960s when younger residents fled and the older population dwindled, the telegraph reports. Unfortunately, this means that the village has lacked maintenance for quite some time and the original, gorgeous tuscan stone has begun to crumble. The foliage is also wildly overgrown. Despite a few relatively minor hitches, pratariccia still holds ample promise. It lies next to rolling hills, villages with medieval castles, and a national park containing the arno river. Real estate representatives for the monastic order that currently owns the hamlet are advertising it as an ideal development property, perfect for resorts and retirement communities. Local italian officials, according to the telegraph, are also hoping pratariccia is quickly purchased and populated. They say that tourism and residency is what the struggling italian economy could use more of."

        "summary": "A prominent south korean maker of latex condoms ended the day with its stock up 15 %, and a manufacturer of the morning-after pill saw a nearly 10 % jump. The atypical reason why: the country's highest court today ruled that adultery is not a crime. It's been one since 1953, with the offense punishable by jail. Though the law was upheld in 2008 ( and, since 1990, three times prior ), seven of the nine judges found it unconstitutional this time around. An opinion from five members of the panel reads, \" the law... Infringes people's right to make their own decisions on sex and secrecy and freedom of their private life, violating the principle banning excessive enforcement. \" under the decades-old law, straying spouses could be sentenced to as many as two years in jail, reports the bbc. But reuters points out that the situation rarely ends in jail. By its numbers, thousands of spouses tended to file such complaints annually, and of the 892 indictments handed down in 2014, none ended in jail terms. Indeed, one law professor says the penalties had become so \" light \" that the law no longer had the \" preventative effect \" that was intended. Some 5,400 people have been convicted of the crime since 2008, and per court law, their cases can now be reconsidered, with those found guilty eligible for retrials, reports the ap. Yonhap notes that taiwan and north korea are the only other asian countries that have such a law on the books. It reports that in 62 years, some 100,000 south koreans have been convicted of the crime.",

The trial follows 74 participants ages 4 to 25, and will continue for another year and a half before additional evaluation, reports gizmodo. So far, researchers have found that nearly half of the participants using either a high-dose ( 250-microgram ) patch or a low-dose ( 100-microgram ) patch, which they put on every day, enjoyed increased protection from peanut exposure, and that it worked best in the youngest kids.

Daniel mendoza, 61, and lawrence anderson, 72, died of \" multiple traumatic crushing injuries \" late tuesday after a massive tree limb fell on the pair during a fireworks show at the local courthouse, reports the quad-city times. A witness who was standing 20 feet away from the 100-year-old oak tree described \" an ungodly sound \" amid the crackle of fireworks, followed by a rush of air as the limb came down, sending five others to hospitals, per wls. Among them: 21-year-old kathy carter, who was nine months pregnant. She gave birth via emergency c-section early wednesday, naming her daughter kamaree kathleen lawrence in honor of anderson, report wqad and kwqc's shelby shepherd. Police say both mother and infant are in good health, while all other injured parties have been released from the hospital after treatment for cuts, bruises, and possible concussions, per abc news. They're lucky. \" it was everything i could do to hold that limb up. It was a monster, \" says the aforementioned witness, one of many bystanders who rushed to help the men trapped beneath. Indeed, police say the limb was 8 feet wide at its base, and more than 45 feet long. It fell about 25 feet.",

        "summary": "The yards were apparently gruesome places: afghan officials say shirin gul brought home the men who hired her for sex and fed them drug-spiked tea and kebabs; 27 of them ended up dead, buried in one of two backyards after her family members robbed and killed them, the new york times reported in 2015. The bbc in 2005 called her \" afghanistan's most notorious woman prisoner \": gul is serving a life sentence — and so too, in effect, is her 11-year-old daughter. Writing for the times, rod nordland explains that the young meena's situation \" is extreme, but not unique; \" hundreds of children are believed to be behind bars alongside their mothers in the country. Afghanistan's female prisoners are allowed to keep their children with them until the offspring reach age 18; in many cases, there is no alternative for care. That's the case with meena, whom gul conceived while in prison, ostensibly via a prison guard, with gul accused of getting pregnant in order to escape her original sentence — death by hanging. After having the child, her sentence was indeed commuted to life. Nordland describes a child who has never stepped foot outside the nangarhar provincial prison in jalalabad, and likely won't for another seven years. She appears throughout the article as a sweet and polite foil to her \" brash \" mother, whom she tells nordland she will not leave. Gul at one point tells nordland, \" i ' ll kill you. I ' m going to come over there and take out your eyes. \" meena, next to her, offers a calm \" shh. \" \" her mother subsided, briefly, \" writes nordland. ( japan's \" black widow \" has been sentenced to hang. )",

A police spokesperson tells the ap the lettering on the bag is similar to that used in anti-cop tattoos and graffiti. Officers hit lobero with a fine of up to $ 670 under spain's public security law, which — among other things — makes \" disrespecting the police \" illegal. Lobero took to social media to complain about the fine. \" what a bloody disgusting country, \" the local quotes one of her facebook posts as saying. \" but well, all cats are beautiful and anyone who says otherwise is lying. \" her tweet about the incident was shared more than 20,000 times. After that, the madrid police commissioner decided to drop the fine against her, citing the bag's \" ambivalence. \" the public security law went into effect last july.

        "summary": "A heated debate on the merits of more or less sentence spacing may have been put to rest. A study has found that two spaces are better than one between sentences, the washington post reports. The study, from researchers at skidmore college in saratoga springs, ny, sought to settle the age-old debate using eye movement trackers and about 60 student test subjects. To test which is best, the subjects were tasked with reading passages as equipment noted how rapidly their eyes moved. Researchers asked them to read passages with single spaces after periods and double spaces after periods, as well as passages with two spaces after periods or two spaces that followed only commas. After they read, the students were assessed for their understanding of what they'd read. As discover magazine notes, researchers concluded the different styles did not appear to affect how well the students comprehended the passages. However, the study did find that subjects ' eyes lingered for less time between sentences in passages where a double-space was used after periods. This means, the researchers suggest, that two spaces makes for faster reading. So how conclusive are the findings? not very, per lifehacker. The blog notes that the study used courier new, a font similar to what typewriters used back when the two-space style was in more widespread use as a way to prevent cramped-looking text. The study also notes that \" individuals'typing usage also influenced these effects such that those who use two spaces following a period showed the greatest overall facilitation from reading with two spaces. \" go figure.",

            "The most recent edition of the american psychological association ( apa ) manual states that two spaces should follow the punctuation at the end of a sentence. This is in contrast to the one-space requirement from previous editions. However, to date, there has been no empirical support for either convention. In the current study, participants performed ( 1 ) a typing task to assess spacing usage and ( 2 ) an eye-tracking experiment to assess the effect that punctuation spacing has on reading performance. Although comprehension was not affected by punctuation spacing, the eye movement record suggested that initial processing of the text was facilitated when periods were followed by two spaces, supporting the change made to the apa manual. Individuals'typing usage also influenced these effects such that those who use two spaces following a period showed the greatest overall facilitation from reading with two spaces."

( this is why two-spacers tend to be older; they learned to write on a typewriter, not a computer. Baby boomers, as always, think their opinion is the default. ) now two-spacers are sharing a new study, in which college students read text passages with one space after each",
            "The most recent edition of the american psychological association ( apa ) manual states that two spaces should follow the punctuation at the end of a sentence. This is in contrast to the one-space requirement from previous editions. However, to date, there has been no empirical support for either convention. In the current study, participants performed ( 1 ) a typing task to assess spacing usage and ( 2 ) an eye-tracking experiment to assess the effect that punctuation spacing has on reading performance. Although comprehension was not affected by punctuation spacing, the eye movement record suggested that initial processing of the text was facilitated when periods were followed by two spaces, supporting the change made to the apa manual. Individuals'typing usage also influenced these effects such that those who use two spaces following a period showed the greatest overall facilitation from reading with two spaces."

While rubio was cleared of an ethics violation in 2012, an investigator called the lawmaker's apparent confusion between his personal mastercard and the party's american express \" disturbing, \" the times reports. At a campaign stop wednesday, rubio called the times story inaccurate and its claims \" discredited, \" according to the guardian. He says his use of the party credit card for personal charges was a mistake, and he reimbursed the state gop $ 16,000. But those charges all come from 2006 and 2007. Despite years of requests, rubio still hasn't released records from his earlier use of the card, the times reports.

Nearly half of the beverly hills police department is working on the case, the daily beast reports, but they have little evidence, no motive, and no witnesses. Chasen was found fatally shot in her car — witnesses reported hearing five shots, the new york times reports — which had crashed into a light post on a street full of million-dollar mansions. The passenger side window was shattered, but police aren't sure if that was the result of the accident, the gunshots, or some other force, the los angeles times reports. Oddly, there was no other gunshot damage to the car, and no bullet casings were found. Chasen had been at an afterparty for the premiere of burlesque, which she left shortly after midnight, and she had called and left a voicemail to-do list for her assistant just six minutes before the shooting. Police believe chasen was shot before hitting the light post, but beyond that, many questions remain: was it road rage? a carjacking? was she followed? was the culprit in the car with her? was she targeted? was it a robbery? friends and colleagues are offering a $ 100,000 reward in an effort to glean more information, and detectives are looking for video surveillance from nearby homes, clubs, and restaurants.",

The atlantic calls this \" particularly embarrassing \" because bannon is currently in charge of a presidential campaign that has been warning of voter fraud and a rigged election. Records show bannon was, possibly as recently as today, registered to vote at a house in florida's miami-dade county. Strangely, the house is vacant, and its owner says it's slated to be demolished. Neighbors say no one has lived there for months. Bannon used to rent the house for his ex-wife to use but never lived there. He was formerly registered at another house in miami-dade county that he rented for his ex-wife but where he never lived. Florida law says voters must be legal residents in the county where they're registered to vote. Purposefully lying on voter registration is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. Bannon owns no property — at least in his own name — in miami-dade county and may either live in property he owns in california or at the dc headquarters of breitbart, which he co-founded. A trump campaign spokesperson would only say that \" bannon has moved to another location in florida. \" the new york daily news reports that bannon has now moved his voter registration to a home owned by a breitbart writer in florida's sarasota county.

        "summary": "It's a physical mismatch that's long puzzled paleontologists: tyrannosaurus rex, terror of the cretaceous period, empowered with a giant head and ferocious jaws, yet also stuck with tiny, seemingly useless arms. Per national geographic, scientists'speculation on the arms has included using them to hang onto prey, as leverage when getting off the ground, or for pulling mates closer during sex; the general consensus is that whatever they were used for, they were vestigial appendages. But steven stanley of the university of hawaii at manoa has come up with a different theory. In research presented at last week's meeting of the geological society of america, stanley posits that the dinosaur's arms were used for \" vicious slashing, \" and he offers six points to support his argument, including that the arms ' length would have been ideal for close-quarter cuts. Also, the t. Rex's \" huge … sickle-shaped claws \" would've done some serious damage — specifically, being able to \" inflict four gashes [ 3 feet ] or more long and [ more than an inch ] deep within a few seconds, \" capable of repeating this \" multiple times in rapid succession. \" other scientists are skeptical the creature would have held such power in those short arms, noting that when the t. Rex was near enough to actually use them, that would have rendered its most deadly tool — its jaws — useless at such close range. Some are still sticking with the sex theory, though stanley notes the claws would have made such an amorous embrace somewhat perilous. He believes that as the dinosaur evolved, its arms initially atrophied as its jaws became more vital to its survival, but that \" natural selection \" eventually gave the arms something useful to do.

Whatever their limited use, the consensus in recent years seemed to be that they were vestigial, hanging around as an evolutionary remnant from t. Rex's ancestors, a little like the wings of flightless birds. Perhaps, some scientists even suggested, small arms were a necessary trade-off in order to support such huge and powerful head and neck muscles.

But dig a little deeper and drinking habits vary widely among some americans, particularly between those who are wealthy ( eight in 10 drink ) and those who are not ( only five in 10 do ), reports gallup in its latest annual poll of american consumption. Education is another divider, with those who are college graduates being more likely to drink than those who are not. And while beer remains the drink of choice for 42 % of americans, 38 % of those with a household income of $ 75,000 ( the highest category in the poll ) or more prefer wine and 36 % prefer beer, while 41 % of those who make $ 30,000 or less ( the lowest category ) choose beer and 29 % go for wine. The gap between incomes could simply be the result of access to alcohol, as americans with higher incomes can afford to drink more and do things that involve drinking, like socialize with co-workers, go on vacation, and dine out, reports the guardian. This is reflected in another finding: 47 % of higher earners say they imbibed in the previous 24 hours, while only 18 % of lower earners did. The numbers are nearly identical among college grads and non-grads. The poll was conducted by phone in early july and includes responses from 1,009 adults.

        "summary": "A woman wakes in a bunker and is told the world outside is uninhabitable after some kind of apocalyptic disaster. So starts the jj abrams-produced 10 cloverfield lane, which abrams calls a \" blood relative \" to 2008's cloverfield. Whatever its relation, viewers are in for a treat as the film has a 91 % approval rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying. The film revolves around three characters — including \" a creepier john goodman than you've ever seen \" — hiding out in a bunker \" with their shifting allegiances and a power dynamic that never seems clear, \" writes jocelyn noveck at the ap. Eventually, director dan trachtenberg \" launches into a climax that will have many talking — though i found it somewhat disappointing and frustratingly baffling, \" noveck writes. A warning: \" your nails may not survive. \" james berardinelli agrees it's \" packed with suspense and tension and offers some of the best bait-and-switch work of any recent psychological thriller. \" goodman, with \" the rare talent of being able to play both a cuddly, likeable guy and a frighteningly dangerous one, \" is \" perfect \" as doomsday prepper howard, he writes reelviews. But the last 15 minutes \" don't work as a way to wrap up this story or as an introduction to a larger ( generic ) canvas. \" the ending doesn't bother peters travers. The film has \" everything a psychological thriller needs to shatter your nerves — and then kicks it up a notch, \" he writes at rolling stone. \" you can't take your eyes off \" goodman. Trachtenberg, meanwhile, lets \" the claustrophobia of the bunker seep into your blood stream until you're jumping at everything that goes bump in the night, \" he says. \" as for the movie's impact — to paraphrase donald trump, it's going to be huge. \" \" part of the beauty of the film is that you don't know what the heck is going on, and you don't want to know, \" writes mara reinstein at us weekly. Her advice: \" check your nerves at the theater door. Take a deep breath while you still can. … don't try to outguess the narrative.

            "Netflix on wednesday released a new teaser for house of cards'sixth season — and it finally reveals the fate of kevin spacey's character, frank underwood. Spacey was fired from the show last fall due to allegations of sexual abuse made by multiple men. Since then, nobody was sure exactly how the netflix series would handle underwood's absence, given he was the show's main character. This new teaser confirms that, as you might expect, underwood is dead in the new season. The brief video released on twitter shows robin wright's claire underwood standing over her husband's grave, saying, \" i ' ll tell you this, though, francis. When they bury me, it won't be in my backyard. And when they pay their respects, they ' ll have to wait in line. \" underwood's tombstone is then revealed; he's buried next to his father, who died of a heart attack at a young age. Fans have speculated that the former president will die of a heart attack like his father. House of cards'sixth and final season will premiere on netflix on nov. 2. You can watch the quick clip below. Brendan morrow",

Dead. Or is he? could this be a dream sequence? netflix it's not unsurprising given that spacey and cards parted ways after sexual misconduct claims against the actor surfaced last fall. The cards team decided to continue on an finish the final season without spacey and, it seems, frank. Claire underwood ( robin wright ) ended season 6 as the president and it appears she's determined to build a legacy that will stand the test of time.

So, too, was a \" lost continent \" scientists say is now hiding beneath the island nation of mauritius. In a video, lewis ashwal of south africa's university of the witwatersrand explains the oldest rock on earth exists in continents, while younger rocks form the ocean basins. Formed with volcanic eruptions in the indian ocean, mauritius is also made up of young rock less than 9 million years old, per a release. But remarkably, scientists have found that rock contains minerals that date back 3 billion years to \" one of the earliest periods in earth's history, \" per live science. These minerals known as zircons prove \" there are much older crustal materials under mauritius that could only have originated from a continent, \" says ashwal, whose research is published in nature. He believes zircons found on a tiny fragment of gondwana that separated from madagascar were covered by lava during the volcanic eruptions that created mauritius before the lava solidified into the mauritius we see today, hiding the older materials beneath. This suggests \" a complex splintering [ of gondwana ] took place, with fragments of continental crust of variable sizes left adrift within the evolving indian ocean basin. \" a 2013 study found zircons in mauritius'sand, but some argued the minerals might have been carried there on the wind or scientists'shoes. This study, however, is literally set in stone. ( mount st. Helens hides something, too. )",

Castronovo, \" quite frankly, is unstable, \" gardiner said.

            "Washington/ankara ( reuters ) - iran on monday dismissed an angry warning from u.s. President donald trump that tehran risked dire consequences \"the like of which few throughout history have suffered before \" if it made threats against the united states. Iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif hit back at trump's warning, which the u.s. Leader delivered written in capital letters in a late-night tweet. \"color us unimpressed: the world heard even harsher bluster a few months ago. And iranians have heard them - albeit more civilized ones - for 40 yrs. We've been around for millennia &amp; seen fall of empires, incl our own, which lasted more than the life of some countries, \" zarif wrote on twitter. \"be cautious! \" he wrote in capital letters, echoing exact words from trump. Iran has been under increasing u.s. Pressure and possible sanctions since trump's decision in may to withdraw the united states from a 2015 agreement between world powers and iran over its disputed nuclear program. Bitter foes since iran's 1979 revolution, washington and tehran have cranked up talk of war in recent days. The trump administration has launched an offensive of speeches and online communications meant to foment unrest",

That's because patient jerome hamon has become the first person in the world to receive two face transplants. Both the bbc and the telegraph have coverage, along with before-and-after images. \" i ' m 43 and the donor was 22, so i ' m 22 again, \" hamon told french tv. Hamon suffers from a genetic condition that resulted in disfiguring tumors covering his original face. He had a successful transplant in 2010, and things were fine until he caught a cold in 2015 and went on antibiotics. They interfered with the drugs he was already taking to prevent his body from rejecting his new face, and it had to be removed in 2017. Then came a stretch hard to fathom: hamon lived in a hospital room in paris for about three months without a face, unable to see, speak, or hear until the new donor face emerged in january. \" if i hadn't accepted this new face it would have been terrible, \" he says from the hospital where he continues to recuperate. \" it's a question of identity, \" he adds. But \" it's good, it's me. \" hamon's new face is still not quite aligned, but doctors are optimistic about both his individual recovery and the bigger picture. \" today, we know that a double transplant is feasible, \" says dr.

Both states, federal officials, and the utility pacificorp are among those who agreed on april 6 to remove four hydroelectric dams on the klamath river, which runs from oregon into california, reports national geographic. \" it's certainly the most significant dam removal and restoration project ever undertaken, \" says an environmental advocate. Why do it? the dams are blocking 300 miles of salmon and steelhead migration, ruining a valuable fishery and depriving local tribes of food, field &amp; stream reports. And toxic algae blooms in the dam's lakes are poisoning rivers and killing off fish. \" to me, it's an environmental injustice, \" says klamath tribes chairman don gentry. The utility has also put in place wind and solar facilities with 10 times the generating capacity of the dams, per the group american rivers. But critics say the plan deprives california of property taxes and never got congressional approval, the la times reports. In that vein, a california lawmaker blames the dam removal on \" environmental extremists, bureaucrats in sacramento and washington, and a taxpayer bailout for billionaire warren buffett. \" indeed, pacificorp — which is owned by buffett's berkshire hathaway inc. — will avoid spending hundreds of millions on environmental and water-quality upgrades to the dams. Removing the dams should cost around $ 300 million, paid for by a pacificorp customer surcharge and a california water bond. Target date for removal is 2020, pending approval by federal regulators.

The former massachusetts governor and his wife, ann, were overwhelmed with emotion as they received a minutes-long standing ovation from thousands at the verizon wireless arena, in the population center of the state that has unique personal and political meaning to the romney family. \"this is a special moment for ann and me, because this is where our campaign began, \" romney said. \"and then your primary vote put me on the path to win the republican nomination. And tomorrow, your votes and your work right here in new hampshire will help me become the next president of the united states. \" the rally was to have been the final one for romney, but as the crowd was being warmed up by singer kid rock, who sings the campaign's \"born free \" anthem, the staff announced he would make one more visit to ohio and pennsylvania today after he votes in his hometown of belmont, mass. Romney implored his audience to join him in reaching out to any remaining undecided voters. \"ask them to look behind the speeches and all the attacks and all the ads and look to the record, \" he said, his voice hoarse after speaking in three other states",

The cdc's weekly report on morbidity and mortality, published friday, notes 118 people fell ill from january 2016 through february 2018, with 29 of them being pet store workers; 26 people ended up at the hospital. Of those 118, 105 had reported being in contact with a dog at some point, with the vast majority of those interactions happening at pet stores. The stores weren't named in the cdc report, though petland had been named previously, when the outbreak was first reported last year. The spread of campylobacter usually happens when people ingest bacteria-tinged food or beverages, such as raw or undercooked poultry, raw milk, or tainted water, a cdc researcher tells healthday news. \" it's rare that it's associated with contact with pets, \" mark laughlin says, though he warns: \" this is most likely the tip of the iceberg. \" what also makes these recent campylobacter infections unusual is they've been resistant to antibiotics. The cdc report notes health and agriculture officials visited 20 pet stores in four states and found 95 % of the puppies'records indicated had had antibiotics administered before they got to the store or while there. Some of the antibiotics the puppies took are the same ones to which humans are resistant.",

            "By steven reinberg healthday reporter thursday, sept. 20, 2018 ( healthday news ) -- puppies can be cute and cuddly, but they also carry germs that might make you very sick, a new government report warns. An outbreak of antibiotic-resistant campylobacter infections in 2017 and 2018 that sickened 118 people in 18 states was traced to pet store puppies, according to the u.s. Centers for disease control and prevention. \" this is most likely the tip of the iceberg, \" said researcher dr. Mark laughlin, a cdc veterinarian science officer. Among those sickened by the bacteria, 26 were hospitalized. Of those who became ill, 29 were pet store employees. It's likely that many others got sick, but not sick enough to go to the doctor, or doctors didn't report cases, laughlin added. Campylobacter is not a rare bacteria. In fact, according to the cdc, it causes 1.3 million diarrheal illnesses in the united states each year. \" people most often get campylobacter after they consume undercooked chicken, \" laughlin said. They can also get it from contaminated water and raw milk. But it's rare that an outbreak of campylobacter occurs, \" and it's rare that it's associated with contact with pets, \" laughlin said. This outbreak was also unique because the bacteria was resistant to the antibiotics usually used to treat it, he explained. According to dr. Marc siegel, a professor of medicine at nyu langone medical center in new york city, most people who are sickened with campylobacter aren't treated with antibiotics. The reason antibiotics aren't usually used is because they kill the bacteria but release the toxins the bacteria carries, and it's the toxins that cause most of the symptoms, siegel said. Usually, people get better without treatment, he noted. \" one of the most common symptoms is bloody diarrhea, \" siegel said. Other symptoms include headache,"

        "summary": "It's believed that australia has only twice opened a third coroner's inquest into someone's death: with the infamous case of azaria chamberlain, the baby taken by a dingo, and with the 1988 death of a 27-year-old american mathematician. On thursday, a coroner gave the ruling his brother had been seeking for years: that scott johnson's death at the bottom of a sydney cliff was not an act of suicide but a hate crime. The new york times quotes the state coroner, magistrate michael barnes, as saying he was \" persuaded to the requisite standard scott johnson died as a result of a gay hate attack \"; he added there was insufficient evidence to establish who killed johnson, however. Steve johnson in 2005 learned \" there were three other cases of gay men that died at cliff sides that had probably been attacked by marauding teen gangs [ and ] collapsed \" at the news, he said late last year. His lobbying helped secure a second inquest, which in 2012 overturned the suicide ruling. The guardian reports that barnes found johnson's behavior was free of characteristics often linked with suicide, like mental health or drug issues, and that \" naked suicide \" — his clothes were left folded atop the north head cliffs — is \" exceptionally rare. \" barnes referenced the \" inadequacy \" of the original investigation, in which investigators \" quickly jumped to conclusions \" and failed to identify the location where johnson fell as a known \" gay beat, \" where gay men would meet up. Australia's abc reports barnes found many reports of teens and young men assaulting gay men in the area. For steve johnson, the case hasn't been put to bed. \" the inquest produced many leads toward possible perpetrators, \" he said, per the guardian. \" now it's time for a homicide investigation. \"",

Lana lowther, 2, was reported missing from her house around 8: 45pm while wearing only footed pajamas, reports cleveland.com. Authorities and volunteers, assisted by helicopters, tracking dogs, and thermal imaging cameras, searched for her until 1am, but to no avail, per the chronicle-telegram. Minutes later, around 1: 15am, andrew tornabene was making the short drive home from his sister's house when he decided to deviate from his traditional route and look for the girl he'd heard about on social media. About half a mile from her home, he saw lana \" staggering on the corner and falling into the snow, \" per fox 8 and abc 5. He jumped out of his car and \" she threw her arms up and grabbed me, \" tornabene says. \" she was shivering. \" he says he put lana in his vehicle to warm up — it was about 22 degrees outside — then called police. There were cheers on the other end. Lana was taken to a hospital with signs of exposure but \" she's doing well, \" her mom tells wkyc. \" i ' m just so thankful she was found. \" police aren't sure how lana was able to leave her home or where she was in the hours she was missing. Officials say her body temperature suggested she may not have been outside for the entire duration of her absence, per abc 5. \" if someone took her, shame on you, \" lana's grandmother says. \" all i can say is, whoever found her, thank you. \" ( elsewhere in ohio, a baby survived a horrific ordeal because a car was kept running. )",

Inside, they found bourseau's body — her killers had cut off her legs in order to fit her inside, adds the local — in the \" advanced stages of decomposition, \" a prosecutor says; the telegraph reports it was bourseau's mother who found the body. The prosecutor argues two men had beaten bourseau with brass knuckles and a crow bar over a $ 6,500 drug debt before killing her with a blow to the head 10 days earlier, reports the washington post. The killers allegedly returned to the scene of the crime with chlorine acid in the hope of dissolving her body, reports radio france internationale; the telegraph reports at least one suspect admitted they were trying to imitate the lead characters of amc's breaking bad, who use hydrofluoric acid to get rid of their victims ' bodies. The prosecutor says the killers visited the home several times after putting bourseau's body in the acid to check on the decomposition, steal items from the apartment, and clean up the scene. They also left air fresheners to hide the smell, he says. Three men and a woman, aged 19 to 23, have been indicted in connection with the murder. Two men face charges of murder, drug trafficking, and robbery, while the third was indicted for murder by complicity. The woman was charged with drug trafficking.

Researchers believe a third wooden vessel on which caligula is said to have hosted orgies during his brief reign 2,000 years ago is still hiding in the depths of lake nemi, about 20 miles from rome, where it came to rest for unknown reasons. \" we know from documents from the 15th century that one of the boats went down in an area of the lake different to where the other two were found during the fascist era, \" nemi mayor alberto bertucci tells the times of london. With help from police and civil protection agency divers, researchers now hope to find it. On wednesday, those divers will begin user sonar to scan the muddy lake for the missing ship, which may have been built to honor the goddess diana, reports the telegraph. The ships were said to have been decorated in gold and marble, with purple silk sails, columns, bronze statues, and even plumbing and heating. If found, however, this will be the only \" party boat \" of caligula's still in existence. The remains of the two vessels — \" among the largest in the ancient world \" at up to 240 feet long, per international business times — found in lake nemi between 1928 and 1932 were kept in a museum that was destroyed in a fire during world war ii.

Harvard medical school researchers surveyed 4,466 people with an average age of 76 who also underwent heart scans, and found minimal alcohol intake actually changed the structure of the heart in both men and women, nbc news reports. The small change made the heart less efficient, and its structure and function suffered greater changes the more people drank. Women were found to be especially vulnerable to alcohol's effects, \" which might potentially contribute to a higher risk of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, for any given level of alcohol intake, \" says lead author scott solomon, per science daily. Cardiomyopathy involves the heart muscle becoming thick and rigid, or replaced by scar tissue. The left ventricle of the heart, or the pumping chamber, was hardest hit by alcohol and the ventricular wall became enlarged in men who consumed more than two drinks per day; for women, the changes were evident among those who drank just more than one drink daily. This suggests the heart was working in overdrive; such a pace could cause the heart to enlarge and weaken over time, reports time. \" a little bit of alcohol may be beneficial, but too much is clearly going to be toxic, \" a researcher says. Additional studies will determine whether genetic factors play a role in a person's susceptibility. \" what is clear is that at more than two drinks a day is the point at which we start to think we are beyond the safe level for men, and with women, it's likely to be even lower than that, \" solomon tells time.

But trump might not have been paying attention in history class: the 1814 attack, in which troops occupied washington, dc, and set the white house, capitol, and other buildings alight after president james madison fled, was carried out by british troops, not canadians, in retaliation for an american attack on what is now toronto. Britain's canadian colonies did not gain independence until 1867, more than 50 years after the white house burned. \" is britain off the hook? \" the telegraph quipped. It's not clear if trump \" was attempting to inject humor into a discussion on a topic that could have serious economic repercussions, \" the cbc notes, but the leaders will have a chance to discuss it further when trump visits quebec for the g7 summit this weekend. According to canada's globe and mail, trump's recent anti-canadian sentiment stems not from the 204-year-old incident, but from \" dashed expectations. \" trudeau had long largely avoided speaking out against trump, and the president was apparently surprised when the canadian leader pushed back against the new tariffs, calling them \" insulting and unacceptable. \" \" trump thought canada was going to be the easiest country to play, and he's disappointed that didn't happen, \" says canadian trade lawyer dunniella kaufman.

        "summary": "Donald trump has little interest in making his tax returns public, but the washington post reports that he once had to do so back in 1981 because he was applying for a casino license. The bottom line? he paid $ 0 in federal taxes because he claimed a combined income from 1978 and 1979 of a negative $ 3.8 million. Not that he was a pauper: in fact, as the report notes, trump had previously boasted to the new york times of being worth around $ 200 million at the time. He managed to avoid a federal bill by taking advantage of a tax provision used by developers to claim negative income. Might the same still be true today? \" tax analysts say it is possible that trump pays very low income taxes, or no taxes at all, using tactics available to wealthy investors and developers, such as depreciating the value of real estate, \" writes the post's drew harwell. That could prove dicey for trump to explain given his theme of standing up for the little guy against wall street fatcats who take advantage of tax loopholes to \" get away with murder. \" meanwhile, usa today did a deep dive into trump's businesses and found that they've \" been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe. \" click for that investigation here.",

Holgerson has said she went up on the bridge because she thought she wanted to jump, then changed her mind when she saw how high it was. \" i thought she would be fine, \" added smith. New video obtained by nbc news shows smith repeatedly pressing holgerson to jump; at one point, smith says \" i ' m going to push you, \" and holgerson replies, \" no. \" people who jump typically enter the water feet-first, and holgerson's surgeon tells kgw, \" when you fall three times your height, 50 percent of people will die. \" smith has apologized both privately and publicly, but says holgerson is no longer speaking with her and that she was asked to leave the hospital after trying to visit her.

It was to launch on a short, unmanned test mission that the atlantic says will include a \" rigorous training gauntlet not seen since the apollo moon-landing era, \" including traveling 3,600 miles above earth, passing through a thick belt of cosmic radiation, and experiencing temperatures up to 4,000 degrees fahrenheit on a fast fall to earth. \" this is huge, \" says nasa administrator charlie bolden.

But that's what they got, npr reports: ten of 18 subjects experienced significant improvement in their vision. The study was intended only to check whether the process was safe. \" we did not expect to help these patients, and they did not expect to be helped, \" says the study's lead researcher, steven schwartz. \" i ' m astonished that this is working in the way that it is — or seems to be working, \" he says, emphasizing that the results are only preliminary. The study's subjects had incurable diseases — macular degeneration and stargardt macular dystrophy — that cause gradual blindness by killing cells known as retinal pigment epithelial cells. In these cases, \" whatever you're looking at is gone — whether it's faces, or reading or food on a plate, or whether something is a step or stripe, \" says schwartz. Embryonic stem cells can be turned into any type of human cell, and in this case, researchers made them into the type of cells that had been lost. Patients received infusions of 50,000 to 100,000 of the cells. \" in a way, it's a retinal transplant, \" he notes. Among the success stories were a rancher who's resumed horse riding and a woman who can now hike without help; eight patients could read 15 more letters on an eye chart, the telegraph reports.

The researchers stress that the findings must be considered preliminary because the number of patients treated was relatively small and they have only been followed for an average of less than two years. But the findings are quite promising. The patients had lost so much vision that there was no expectation that they could benefit, the researchers say. \" i ' m astonished that this is working in the way that it is — or seems to be working, \" says steven schwartz, a ucla eye specialist who led the study, which was published tuesday in the british medical journal the lancet. \" i ' m very excited about it. \" other researchers agreed the work is preliminary, but also highly promising. \" it really does show for the very first time that patients can, in fact, benefit from the therapy, \" says dr. Anthony atala, a surgeon and director of the wake forest institute for regenerative medicine at wake forest university. What we did is put them into patients who have a disease where those particular cells are dying; and we replaced those dying tissues with new tissue that's derived from these stem cells. In a way it's a retinal transplant. \" that allows you to say, ' ok, now that these cells have been used for patients who have blindness, maybe we can also use these cells for many other conditions as well, including heart disease, lung disease and other medical conditions, ' \" atala says. Human embryonic stem cells have the ability to become any kind of cell in the body. So scientists have been hoping the cells could be used to treat many diseases, including alzheimer's, diabetes and paralysis. But the study is the first human embryonic stem cell trial approved by the food and drug administration that has produced any results. \" it is really a very important paper, \" atala says. The study involved patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration and stargardt's macular dystrophy, the two leading causes of adult and juvenile blindness in the developed world, schwartz says.

Anthony atala, a surgeon and director of the wake forest institute for regenerative medicine at wake forest university. What we did is put them into patients who have a disease where those particular cells are dying; and we replaced those dying tissues with new tissue that's derived from these stem cells. In a way it's a retinal transplant. \" that allows you to say, ' ok, now that these cells have been used for patients who have blindness, maybe we can also use these cells for many other conditions as well, including heart disease, lung disease and other medical conditions, ' \" atala says. Human embryonic stem cells have the ability to become any kind of cell in the body. So scientists have been hoping the cells could be used to treat many diseases, including alzheimer's, diabetes and paralysis. But the study is the first human embryonic stem cell trial approved by the food and drug administration that has produced any results. \" it is really a very important paper, \" atala says. The study involved patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration and stargardt's macular dystrophy, the two leading causes of adult and juvenile blindness in the developed world, schwartz says. The diseases destroy a person's central vision. \" whatever",

But that statistic may be misleading, because men see their doctors for hiv symptoms but visit free clinics to be treated for other diseases.",

            "A box of viagra, typically used to treat erectile dysfunction, is seen in a pharmacy in toronto january 31, 2008. New york &#124; new york ( reuters health ) - even if you're past your prime and have a hard time getting an erection, you might still need to worry about unprotected sex, according to u.s. Doctors. In fact, they report in the annals of internal medicine, the rate of sexually transmitted diseases ( stds ) in older men taking erectile dysfunction drugs like viagra is twice as high as in their non-medicated peers. In both groups, however, the numbers are swelling. According to the centers for disease control and prevention, there were more than six new cases of stds per 10,000 men over 40 in 2008, up almost 50 percent since 1996. \" younger adults have far more stds than older adults, but the rates are growing at far higher rates in older adults, \" said dr. Anupam b. Jena of massachusetts general hospital in boston, who led the study. While the reasons for this development aren't well understood, he said more divorces and better health might have conspired to boost sexual prowess and activity among graying heads. The problem, however, is that older adults appear to flaunt safe sex practices. For instance, the researchers note, 50-year-olds are six times less likely to use a condom than men in their 20s. \" we are typically unaccustomed to practice safe sex over the age of 50, because the risk of pregnancy is eliminated, \" jena told reuters health. To test whether the introduction of viagra in 1998 might explain some of the std surge, jena and colleagues examined insurance records for more than 1.4 million u.s. Men over 40. The average age in the study was about 60 years. The most commonly found std was hiv, followed by chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea. Among the few percent of men who had filled prescriptions for erectile dysfunction drugs, more than two in a thousand had been treated for an std in the year before they got the drug. A year later, the number dropped to half that, suggesting that viagra and its chemical cousins didn't fuel stds. However, the risk of contracting an std turned out to be more than twice as high in men taking erectile dysfunction drugs compared with those who didn't. \" these users have a different sexual risk profile than non-users, \" said jena, adding that the data didn't reveal any good explanation.

        "summary": "The good news for those worried about the us commitment to nato under president trump is that trump declared, \" i believe in nato \" thursday during a summit-ending press conference, reports the new york times. The bad news is that, earlier, in a closed-door session with fellow leaders, he again criticized their defense spending and threatened to \" do my own thing \" if things didn't change, reports the wall street journal. That report is backed up by the washington post, but both newspapers say those in the meeting were unsure exactly what the threat meant — a us pullout or maybe a lesser american role? trump was asked at his press conference whether he thought he could withdraw from nato without congressional approval, and he said: \" i think i probably can, but that's unnecessary. \" trump claimed that other nations had indeed agreed to increase spending, thus making his threat moot. \"yesterday i let them know that i was extremely unhappy with what was happening and they have substantially upped their commitment, \" said trump, without providing details. He also said that nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg had given him \" total credit \" for that, reports reuters. \" we have a very powerful, very strong nato, much stronger than it was two days ago, \" he said. In his own subsequent news conference, french president emanuel macron said nato members had not agreed to boost spending beyond their previous commitment of 2 % of gdp by 2024, reports the ap. He also shot down speculation that trump threatened to pull out. He \" never at any moment, either in public or in private, threatened to withdraw from nato, \" said macron.",
