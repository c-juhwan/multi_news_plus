        "summary": "Mississippi failed to deliver the democrats an alabama-style upset in the last race of the 2018 midterms. Republican sen. Cindy hyde-smith defeated democrat mike espy and will serve the remaining two years of sen. Thad cochran's term. She is the first woman elected to congress from mississippi, the clarion-ledger reports. If espy had won, he would have been the first african american the state had elected to congress since 1874, and the first democratic senator elected in the state since 1982. The victory in the runoff gives republicans control of 53 out of 100 seats in the senate. Hyde-smith had been widely expected to win, though the gop had to pump funds into the state as the race narrowed in its final weeks. Hyde-smith stuck to a strategy of appealing to president trump's core voters — and was rewarded for it, abc reports. The president appeared at two of her rallies monday night and she personally thanked him at her victory party tuesday. \" mr. President, and i just talked to him so i know he's watching, thank you so much for everything, \" she said. The victory follows a divisive campaign that led to several corporate donors asking hyde-smith to return their donations, the ap reports. Hyde-smith was recorded joking about attending a public hanging, and talking about making it \" just a little more difficult \" for \" liberal folks \" to vote. ( she accused espy of using the hanging remarks as a \" weapon. \" )",

In a report published in the archives of sexual behavior, the university of bretagne's nicolas gueguen carried out a set of experiments by putting brown-haired french women — time mentions that past studies have shown blondes are approached more than brunettes — in a series of scenarios, wearing three different types of shoes: black flats, black shoes with a 2-inch heel, or black pumps with a 3.5-inch heel. In the first experiment, as broken down by time, a woman wearing the highest heel was able to get 83 % of men ages 25 to 50 to help her with a gender equality survey; only 47 % of the guys helped her when she wore flats. To test how both men and women responded, four testers in the second experiment asked subjects to help them with a food survey; 82 % of men helped the high-heelers, 42 % the flats-wearers, while only 33 % of women subjects helped out, no matter what the heel height. To test attractiveness levels, the testers then walked in front of \" marks \" and dropped gloves — 93 % of men retrieved the glove for high-heel wearers, 62 % for those in flats. And testers sitting at a bar? it only took men about 7.49 minutes to approach those in high heels, while those in flats had to wait nearly 14 minutes. Gueguen attributes the sexiness of high heels to media imagery, among other reasons, as well as how it changes a woman's gait. \" high heels may exaggerate the sex-specific aspects of the female walk, \" a researcher said last year in the pacific standard.

            "Clay aiken, the former american idol singer, secured the democratic nomination for north carolina's second congressional district tuesday, officially receiving enough votes to avert a runoff in his party's primary elections. Aiken received 40.9 % of the vote, over his closest opponent, former state commerce secretary keith crisco, who got 39.4 % of the vote, according to the state board of election's official results released today. Aiken's mathematical victory asserted him as the strongest democratic contender for november's general election, but became irrelevant yesterday when crisco, 71, died unexpectedly after a fall in his asheboro home yesterday. A close friend and campaign strategist said crisco had planned to concede the race to aiken tuesday. Aiken and crisco were waiting for today's official voting results, which took into account absentee and provisional ballots, since last tuesday's elections.

Just how thin? a hard-to-fathom 2 atoms thick, which means you ' ll need an electron microscope to check it out, notes redorbit. The discovery might not only shed important insights into the unusual liquid-vs-solid structure of glass, it earned the scientists some real-world bragging rights: guinness world records has included the discovery in its 2014 book. So how did they create the glass? as the cornell chronicle explains, the scientists were making a different uber-thin material called graphine and noticed some \" muck \" on it. That muck turned out to be made of silicon and oxygen, the stuff of glass. Their best guess is that an air leak caused copper foils to react with a quartz furnace. By studying the happy accident, the researchers have for the first time revealed \" the precise arrangement of atoms in glass, \" explains the verge. Amazingly, it's nearly spot-on with a theoretical model drawn in 1932 by physicist wh zachariasen. As for real-world applications, the 2d glass could someday be used in transistors and lead to faster processors for computers and smartphones.

        "summary": "There have been no sightings of richard matt and david sweat on the international space station, meaning the two ny prison escapees are likely still somewhere on this planet — but officials admit that despite some promising clues last week, they have no idea where. A state official tells cnn that 10 days in, the trail has gone cold and the two killers could now be in mexico or canada — or still within a few miles of the clinton correctional facility in dannemora, ny. In other developments: the search may have been hampered by interagency rivalries, as well as by the \" disruptive \" appearance of new york gov. Andrew cuomo at the command center when the search was still in its first hours, sources tell the new york post. One source says there was nearly a potentially deadly confrontation a few days ago when a team of state troopers combing the woods for the escapees were surprised by a team of prison officers doing the same thing. In dannemora, residents are displaying blue ribbons in gratitude for the efforts of hundreds of searchers, and they say the ribbons will stay up until matt and sweat are back behind bars. Residents tell the plattsburgh press republican that they are probably in the safest town in the state thanks to the huge law-enforcement presence — though they haven't been spending much time in their backyards and have told relatives to postpone visits. Joyce mitchell, the prison seamstress charged with aiding the escapees, has waived her right to a preliminary hearing and the case will now head to county court, the ap reports. She did not speak at a brief hearing yesterday, where she wore a black-and-white prison jumpsuit. Sources tell cnn that mitchell, whose husband also works at the prison, had sexual relationships with both matt and sweat before allegedly aiding the escape — and allegedly getting cold feet because she didn't want them to kill her husband. New york state sen. Kathleen marchione has a modest proposal to prevent similar escapes in the future: implanting gps tracking chips under the skin of prisoners. The republican tells the new york daily news that she's looking into the idea, though critics call it an \" outrageous \" plan that's probably unconstitutional as well as technologically unfeasible.",

As part of the settlement, google will voluntarily license patents deemed \" essential \" to its rivals in the mobile phone industry, including apple, research in motion, and microsoft. The investigation was centered on allegations that google was abusing its internet search dominance, and the company also agreed to remove content from other websites in its search results upon request. Google had already scaled back that practice, known as \" scraping, \" even though it says it's legal under copyright law's fair-use provisions. The ftc said today that antitrust regulators found no evidence that google gives itself an unfair edge in search results; rivals had accused it of highlighting its own services while burying links to others. Bloomberg calls the settlement \" a blow to competitors, \" and the new york times calls it a \" victory for google. \"",

Maui alone has had six known cases so far this year, when the entire state of hawaii averages 10 a year. The couple live in the san francisco bay area and were diagnosed upon their return home. Both ended up in the hospital, and manilla is still there. \" i've had several operations, two pneumonias, a blood clot, \" says manilla, who lectures at berkeley's journalism grad school. \" right now, i ' m dealing with a kidney issue, all of which was spurred by the rat lung. \" it's not clear how they got the parasite, but it often spreads via snails or slugs that eat rat poop and are ingested themselves in unwashed or uncooked produce. In fact, about 80 % of land snails in the hawaiian islands have been found to be carriers of the parasite, notes cnn. \"we were eating food from the garden, we were eating food from food stands, people were bringing us fruit and vegetables, \" recalls lape. \"we have no idea, frankly, where we picked it up. \" the formal name of the ailment is angiostrongylus cantonensis, which the cdc notes is prevalent in southeast asia and tropical pacific islands.",

A new video spot claims romney will deny women access to birth control and cancer screenings, take away abortion rights, and not support equal pay for women. The campaign hits hard where it hurts, as romney is already trailing president obama among women, the new york times notes. Meanwhile, the ap reports that obama has opened up a new line of attack, with advisers pointing out that the massachusetts economy increased in debt and lagged in job creation while romney was governor. And romney's not sitting this one out: with the obama campaign relentlessly attacking his record at bain capital, romney is now going after obama over the solyndra debacle. If bain capital is romney's private equity problem, then his campaign is attempting to paint solyndra as obama's public equity problem, politico notes.

He told no one, and as he flew over the town where he'd raised his family, he was so overcome with sadness that he \" made a bad decision, \" turned his plane east toward the mountains, closed his eyes, and waited for impact, reports cbs denver. The next thing he knew he was \" bustling through the trees, \" his plane so wrecked it was \" a ball of aluminum \" — yet his body was completely unmarked, without even a bruise from his seat belt. Darling says that as he faced down the cold mountain, a lost cellphone, no survival gear, and no one knowing he'd flown, he heard his son's voice tell him to get up, build a fire, and \" get yourself out of there. \" with a newly found desire to live, he says he then heard his son tell him to reach into the snow on the other side of the plane, where he found his cellphone and called his sister and 911. He was off the mountain in hours. And while he's worried about the consequences of intentionally crashing his plane — as well as flying it without a license — he says he ' ll deal with them: \" i've never felt more alive in my life. I don't know what direction it's going to lead me in, but heck yeah, i ' m along for the ride now. \" ( earlier this year, a 7-year-old girl walked away from a plane crash that killed her parents, sister, and cousin. )",

        "summary": "Almost eight years after it stopped communicating with ground stations, nasa has rediscovered india's chandrayaan-1 lunar probe. The long-lost spacecraft didn't crash into the lunar surface in 2009, as some had suspected, but continued circling the moon in a slightly different orbit. Nasa says it detected the small cubic probe, which it describes as being around 5 feet per side, with a beam of microwaves sent from a 230-foot antenna at its goldstone deep space communications complex in california. Scientists had to use ground-based radar because lunar glare made it impossible to spot the probe through optical telescopes, engadget notes. Nasa says it knew chandrayaan-1 was in a polar orbit, so it trained the beam on the moon's north pole and waited for the spacecraft to cross it. The agency says the radar technique could help future lunar missions by averting collisions with derelict spacecraft and by aiding spacecraft suffering communication difficulties. The probe was launched in 2008 for what was supposed to be a two-year mission mapping the lunar surface. \" to be declared lost and then found after eight years is a great accomplishment, \" krishnaswamy kasturirangan, known as the father of india's moon mission, tells the times of india. \" chandrayaan-1 was our first interplanetary mission and i am delighted that it has been found. \" ( nasa has lost a legal battle over a stolen bag of moon dust. )",

Block reportedly left her home in alexandria, minn., on aug. 8 with a family acquaintance who said he needed her help, reports the echo press. When jasmine arrived at thomas barker's home in carlos, however, she encountered a \" nightmare, \" says alexandria police chief rick wyffels. Barker, 32 — soon joined by his roommate and later a friend — restrained the teen with zip ties. At no point over the next 28 days was jasmine left alone as she was physically and sexually assaulted and moved to a cornfield and then a home on a lake in grant county, wyffels says. But on the 29th day, jasmine saw an opportunity to escape. When her captors left to get lunch on tuesday, jasmine escaped and \" bravely ran door to door \" without finding help, wyffels says. Finally, she swam across the 150-acre lake to a property and encountered its owner, who'd just returned from work because he'd forgotten something. \" it was like somebody shined a big beam of light on me, \" the man tells wcco. \" i was in the right place at the right time. \" just as police arrived, jasmine — later treated for minor injuries, per nbc news — spotted a car belonging to one of her captors whom police quickly apprehended, the property owner adds. All three alleged captors are now in custody. Barker; joshua holby, 31; and steven powers, 20, are each held on probable cause for false imprisonment, kidnapping, and assault. Wyffels says authorities are still trying to determine a motive.",

Katzenmoyer was drinking beer with friends outside an oar concert in 2007 in camden when a woman told police officers katzenmoyer hit her in the chest. In a police report, officers ronald lattanzio and john mcardle say katzenmoyer refused to put his hands behind his back and swung at them. After subduing katzenmoyer, the officers took him to a hospital. A hospital security guard says katzenmoyer was threatening to sue the officers, and mcardle hit him repeatedly in the face to \" shut him up. \" the guard says mcardle also \"beat [ katzenmoyer ] in the face, from the nose to the eye \" while the 20-year-old was restrained. Katzenmoyer suffered a concussion, broken nose, and more, nj.com reports. He was sent home from the hospital but died days later from heart and renal failure. The coroner at the time ruled a cause of death \" could not be determined \" because katzenmoyer had morphine and sleeping pills in his system. His family has been fighting that ruling for years, getting the new county coroner, gordon eck, to re-examine the case. On thursday, eck changed the cause of death to \" homicide. \" katzenmoyer's mother says she's \" just grateful that someone finally...

Jo cox — who was airlifted to a leeds hospital, per the yorkshire post — was leaving a drop-in session for constituents at a library in birstall around 1pm when a man wearing a baseball cap attacked her with a \" foot-long knife, \" per the telegraph. A middle-aged man, who suffered minor injuries, apparently tried to subdue the attacker before he \" suddenly pulled a gun from his bag, \" a witness tells the guardian. Cox, a 41-year-old mother of two young daughters, was shot three times, including once near the head, says a witness. The shooter then left the scene \" very coolly, very slowly \" on foot, per sky news. A 52-year-old man was arrested soon after. Police say they are investigating unconfirmed reports that the shooter yelled, \" britain first! \" at least once during the attack — a possible reference to the right-wing party. In a statement, however, the group says it wasn't involved and \" would never encourage behavior of this sort. \" the guardian notes that cox, a former oxfam aid worker and advocate for syrian refugees, was in the \" remain \" camp of the brexit vote on whether the uk should leave the european union, which has divided many. After news of the shooting spread, mps suspended their referendum campaigning and offered condolences.",

Electrical zaps to the spinal cord offered several patients the ability to move their legs again, researchers find. Two of four male patients studied since 2009 were living with complete motor and sensory paralysis — no movement or feeling in their legs. All had injuries two to four years old. They received implanted electrode stimulators — and all regained some degree of leg movement, with one seeing restored movement in the first week, livescience reports. The subjects could move their legs, ankles, and toes to correspond with a wave on a computer screen. They could also flex their leg muscles to varying extents. One patient in 2009 was able to stand for several minutes during stimulation — though he had never completely lost sensation below his injury. All of the patients can once again control their bladders, bowels, and sexual function, even without active stimulation, usa today reports. Scientists aren't sure quite how the stimulation is helping patients move, though it might improve some spinal connections. \" spinal cord injury may no longer mean a lifelong sentence of complete paralysis, \" says an outside expert.",

Hempstead middle school principal amy lacey was placed on paid administrative leave in december after reportedly announcing, via intercom, that students were not to speak spanish on the school's campus. The hispanic population of the rural area, roughly 50 miles northwest of houston, is growing quickly, and latino advocates say that it's important to allow spanish in public schools. \" when you start banning aspects of ethnicity or cultural identity, \" says augustin pinedo, director of the league of united latin american citizens region 18, \" it sends the message that the child is not wanted: ' we don't want your color. We don't want your kind.'they then tend to drop out early. \" such fast growth is pervasive in texas, says steve murdock, a professor at rice university and director of the hobby center for the study of texas. Half of all texas public-school students are now hispanic, he notes. \"",

Some even theorized that the government was intentionally trying to foster anarchy. \"the government is trying to transform the people's revolution into looting mobs so they can justify cracking down, \" said one professor.

        "summary": "Anger in britain is rising in the aftermath of the grenfell towers high-rise blaze. With 12 people confirmed dead, almost 80 hospitalized, and many more still unaccounted for after the devastating fire in the 24-floor apartment block, calls for justice have been left alongside messages for loved ones at a wall of condolence near the west london site, the bbc reports. Residents say safety concerns had been ignored at the building, which had no sprinkler system and was refurbished last year with cladding that ignited in the blaze. Labour mp david lammy denounced the fire as \" corporate manslaughter \" thursday. He said arrests should be made and warned that the death toll could be in the hundreds, the independent reports. The latest: british government ministers were warned about the fire risk of cladding as far back as 1999, the telegraph reports. Officials have now called for an urgent review of the use of the material, which is on tens of thousands of buildings in the country. Experts say it acted like a \" chimney \" in the blaze, causing flames to race up the building. Ctv reports that the managers of the building, which had around 500 residents, say it is too early to determine the cause. The kensington and chelsea tenant management organization says concerns raised by residents will be looked at during its investigation. Fire commissioner dany cotton says a thorough search of the building has been delayed due to safety concerns. \" on the upper floors there are still some very small pockets of fire remaining, \" she told the bbc thursday. \" due to the nature of the building at the moment we are not sending firefighters in there, because it is not structurally safe for them to go right out to the edges of the building now. \" she said a painstaking fingertip search will be carried out soon as possible. Cotton says up to nine firefighters were injured in the blaze, though she is more concerned about the long-term mental health of the firefighters and everybody else involved in the traumatic incident, the guardian reports. In one of many tales of heroism to emerge from the disaster, 66-year-old grandmother clarita ghavim tells the evening standard that her life was saved by two strangers. She says that after leaving her 10th-floor apartment and finding herself in a hallway thick with smoke, two men put her on their shoulders and carried her to safety. Joe ruane, the former deputy chief fire officer for us air force bases in britain, tells the ap that he has never seen a blaze like this before and it appears that more than one fire protection safeguard failed. Residents also blame a \" stay put \" policy that advised them to",

The death of freddie gray ( variously reported as 25 or 27 ) is raising red flags due to a lack of details and a gap in the police timeline that has gray's family demanding a full investigation into his arrest april 12. Police still haven't said what crime gray was suspected of or what caused his injuries, the baltimore sun reports. Snippets of cellphone videos on wbal show gray, said to have ran from police when they approached, being dragged to a police van after he was caught; a wbal reporter notes he appeared to be moving and talking then. But gray appears to scream in a different video on cnn, and an off-camera woman yells at cops dragging his limp body, \" that boy's legs look broke! \" it gets murkier. Per a police timeline on cbs baltimore, gray was taken into custody at 8: 40am, put into additional restraints at 8: 54am ( cops say they have surveillance video of him still conscious and talking at that point ), then transported to a station house; at 9: 24am, an ambulance was called. Baltimore police deputy commissioner jerry rodriguez said at a press conference that after viewing \" several angles of the arrest, \" per the new york daily news, he doesn't think excessive force inside the van could have caused gray's injuries. Meanwhile, that half-hour gap weighs on his family's mind. \" we believe the police are keeping the circumstances of freddie's death secret until they develop a version of events that will absolve them of all responsibility, \" the family lawyer said, per nbc.

All eyes are now on the senate as it prepares a bill that pays for disaster relief — without cutting other programs. The senate bill would fund the government until nov. 18, with $ 3.65 billion for disaster relief; fema is currently shelling out tens of billions daily. Yesterday's talk shows saw lawmakers taking shots over the bill: \"there is a group, and i do believe it is mostly centered in the house in terms of these tea party republicans, who say, ' on every issue, we're going to make this a make-or-break, ' \" said democratic sen.

Why should we, in effect, rebuild schools in iraq on the credit card but expect that rebuilding schools in joplin, missouri, at this moment in time have to be paid for in a way that has never been in any of the previous disaster assistance that we've put out before? \" sen. Mark r. Warner ( d-va. ) said on cnn's \"state of the union. \" he blamed the dispute on tea-party-affiliated republicans in the house who demanded the spending cut. Sen. Lamar alexander ( r-tenn. ) said on the same program: \"everybody knows we're going to pay for every single penny of disaster aid that the president declares and that fema certifies. And the house sent over a bill that does that and the senate should have approved it. \" he blamed senate majority leader harry m. Reid ( d-nev. ) for manufacturing a crisis over funding for the federal emergency management agency. But warner and alexander, who have been pushing for more bipartisan cooperation over the far more difficult and consequential task of deficit reduction, appeared weary over the mess. Warner called it \"embarrassing. \" \"i don't like this business of sitting around blaming each other over such small potatoes, \" alexander said. But the small potatoes are part of a much larger and ongoing fight about debt and deficit spending in washington. Last"

Depp and heard hugged each other in the queensland courtroom after the ruling.

The afp points out that dna established in 2010 that tut is the son of akhenaten; his mother has yet to be identified. Akhenaten's tomb has carvings showing the death of another daughter, princess maketaten; ahram online reports meritaten is shown in that scene nursing a child.

Al-damati says meritaten's mummy has not been located and could possibly be in that chamber, if it exists.

We have reviewed the matter and, as a result, have severed ties with lizza. \" in response, lizza said he was \" dismayed \" at the new yorker's action, saying the magazine had mischaracterized a relationship he had with a woman as \" somehow inappropriate \" and was \" unable to cite any company policy that was violated. \" a lawyer for the accuser, douglas wigdor, responded to lizza's defense in a statement, saying, \" in no way did mr. Lizza's misconduct constitute a'respectful relationship. ' \" in addition to writing for the new yorker since 2007, lizza has also been an on-air contributor to cnn. After news of lizza's firing broke, the station announced that it had suspended him \" while we look into this matter, \" the usa today reports. Lizza is perhaps most famous for publishing the long, profanity-fueled tirade that led to the resignation of anthony scaramucci from the white house in july. Appearing on a podcast last week, scaramucci said about lizza, \"this guy's obviously a very bad actor. Karma's a bitch. It ' ll come back and bite him. You ' ll see. \"",

        "summary": "There's a new story to file under the \" beware of too little sleep \" category, and it's a pretty ominous one: that a lack of deep sleep could help pave the way to alzheimer's disease. Actually, that there's some sort of relationship has long been established from the reverse — those with alzheimer's often have sleep issues. But npr reports on research conducted by jeffrey iliff, that has found, as the oregon health &amp; science university researcher puts it, that \" changes in sleep habits may actually be setting the stage \" for alzheimer's. Two separate studies got us to that statement, npr explains: in 2009, researchers with washington university in st. Louis who studied sleep-deprived mice found that the amyloid plaques that are a signature of alzheimer's formed more rapidly in the creatures ' brains. In 2012 came part ii, thanks to iliff, his team, and their research on snoozing mice and discovery of the previously unknown glymphatic system. As iliff explained in a 2014 ted talk, the body's lymphatic system clears out waste, but there's no room in the brain for such a system — and one does indeed exist. \" clean, clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid... Fills the space that surrounds the brain, \" he says. Blood vessels \" extend from the surface of the brain down to reach every single cell in the brain, \" he adds, noting that the csf travels along the outside of those vessels to reach every part of the brain, taking waste with it and depositing it into the blood. Among that waste, in mice: the toxins that form the amyloid plaques. Next up is seeing if the same fluid movement/toxin removal happens in our brains during deep sleep. Iliff and his fellow researchers hope to put that to the test before the year is out — so long as they can find enough volunteers who are able to sleep deeply in the loud and narrow tunnel of the ultra-sensitive mri unit that will be used to observe the changes in their brains.",

The company knew about a serious listeria problem at one of its production plants years before an outbreak linked to the company's products killed three people, the fda says. In what food safety attorney bill marler tells abc are among the worst results he's seen in his career, inspections found listeria on surfaces at an oklahoma plant five times in 2013, 10 times in 2014, and once in january this year. The fda told the company it had failed to show that its \" cleaning and sanitizing program is effective, \" but blue bell failed to make major changes to procedures, the houston chronicle reports. Blue bell halted operations at the plant last month before recalling all its products. The report also outlines cleaning problems at plants in alabama and texas, the wall street journal reports. A blue bell spokesman tells abc that the company \" thought our cleaning process took care of any problems, but in hindsight, it was not adequate, which is why we are currently conducting such a comprehensive re-evaluation of all our operations. \" the fda report could lead to major lawsuits against the company, which says it will be months before its products are back on the market, the chronicle reports. \" there's no question that blue bell's oklahoma plant was out of control from a listeria perspective, \" marler tells the journal, adding that \" it appears blue bell did nothing about it. \"",

        "summary": "President obama thinks solitary confinement does far more harm than good when it comes to juvenile offenders, and he's now banning the punishment outright in federal prisons. The president laid out his reasoning in a washington post op-ed, declaring that \" the united states is a nation of second chances, but the experience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that second chance. \" instead of rehabilitation, it's more likely to result in long-term psychological damage, he said. Obama also ordered federal prisons to restrict the use of solitary confinement with adult prisoners and to expand treatment of inmates with mental illness. Usa today notes that the juvenile ban won't affect many kids: it covers only federal facilities, which house few juveniles. As of december, 71 juveniles were in bureau of prisons sites, and only 13 of them had spent any time at all in solitary in the previous year. Still, obama writes that he hopes the federal action will \" serve as a model \" for state and local facilities, where the vast majority of juvenile offenders are held. \"how can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement, knowing its effects, and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people? \" he writes. \"it doesn't make us safer. It's an affront to our common humanity. \" in a statement, amnesty international called the reforms \" a momentous break with this shameful legacy, and an acknowledgement that tens of thousands of human beings should not be condemned to live in a cage. \" in a separate story, the washington post notes that at least 12 states have taken steps in the last year or two to curb solitary confinement, sometimes as the result of lawsuits.",

And in its weekly \" morbidity and mortality \" report, the centers for disease control and prevention sounds an alarm. The prevalence of the defect nearly doubled between 1995 and 2005 and it increased another 30 % in the seven years following to 4.9 in 10,000 births — but there's no explanation why. Nearly 2,000 babies are now born in the us with the defect annually. The researchers note that the sharpest jump in prevalence — 263 % between 1995 and 2012 — was among babies born to african-american women under the age of 20, though an increase was seen across every age and racial group, reports us news &amp; world report. ( still, the prevalence in black mothers \" remains lower than in white and hispanic mothers. \" ) and while researchers have for decades associated young maternal age with gastroschisis, the increased prevalence has coincided with a decline in live births among teens. The defect is often fixed with surgery, but the condition can be life-threatening, with organs exposed to amniotic fluid possibly becoming swollen or infected, triggering longer-term feeding and digestion issues, reports the times. \" we're really trying to dig into the ' why ' \" via federally supported studies, cdc epidemiologist suzanne gilboa says. So far the only clues are that women who use alcohol or tobacco while pregnant, or who are underweight prior to pregnancy or have an std, run a greater risk of having a baby with gastroschisis, but whether this contributes to the early development of an infant's weaker abdominal wall remains unclear.

Leaving earth just days before the release of \" star wars: the force awakens \" seemed like cruel and unusual punishment for a trio of astronauts who are arriving today at the international space station. But astronaut tim peake said they won't be missing out on the film. When someone on twitter said the british astronaut must be \" gutted \" to be leaving earth days before the long-awaited film was hits theaters, peake tweeted a reply that has space enthusiasts and \"star wars \" fans everywhere feeling a little envious.. @chriseastabrook we have a projector &amp; screen onboard &amp; i ' m told that @starwars will be waiting for us up there... What a place to watch it! — tim peake ( @astro_timpeake ) december 12, 2015 peake blasted off this morning on baord the soyuz rocket, alongside u.s. Astronaut tim kopra and veteran russian cosmonaut yuri malenchenko. They are expected to dock at the international space station around 12: 24 p.m. Et. It's peake's first trip to space. He ' ll also earn the distinction of being the first british astronaut to visit the international space station.this will mark malenchenko",
            "Coming to an off-the-earth film screen: the astronauts aboard the international space station will watch star wars. As it turns out, the allure of \" the force \" can out-pull even the force of gravity. The cultural impact of star wars, including episode 7, \" the force awakens, \" premiering in theaters on friday ( dec. 18 ), has escaped the earth and extended all the way into outer space. \" i am told that'star wars ' will be waiting for us up there, \" british astronaut tim peake wrote on twitter on the eve of his launch to the international space station on tuesday ( dec. 15 ). \" what a place to watch it! \" [ in a cinema far, far away: hollywood's'star wars ' films ] the space station's six-person crew, which includes the newly-arrived trio of peake, cosmonaut yuri malenchenko and nasa's tim kopra, as well as commander scott kelly of nasa and cosmonauts mikhail kornienko and sergei volkov, will be able to watch \" the force awakens \" thanks to mission control and a recently-installed theater system on board the orbiting outpost. \" we are very fortunate on board the space station to have great communications these days,"

        "summary": "Johan gustafsson spent more than five years learning arabic, french, and local african languages. The alternative might have been going mad. Gustafsson was abducted from his hotel terrace in timbuktu, mali, on nov. 25, 2011, reports the local. The then-36-year-old had been in the city just 24 hours, as part of a motorcycle quest through the african continent. Instead of making it to south africa, he lived as a hostage until june 26 of this year. He described his time as one of the \" timbuktu three \" ( sjaak rijke of the netherlands and stephen mcgown of south africa were also seized ) being held in the sahara desert by the branch of al-qaeda found in north africa: al-qaeda in the islamic maghreb. As the new york times recounts, gustafsson says he and the others stopped counting the number of times they were moved once that count hit 100. They were initially blindfolded, bound, and forced to make ransom videos in guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits. That all changed four months in once the men decided to convert to islam. For their remaining time in captivity ( rijke was released in april 2015, mcgown in august ), they lived alongside their captors in a situation gustafsson likened to \" a prison sentence and robinson crusoe. \" he tried to escape once, and spent two nights walking through the desert before being recaptured. Sweden's foreign minister says diplomatic efforts eventually prevailed; a source disputes that, telling the times $ 4.2 million made its way to the captors via a south african charity. Gustafsson describes his time as a hostage with a bit of wonder: \" i ' m going to miss the desert, the vastness, the night skies. You know how the storms move. All of this is just so majestic. \"",

Under the new rules, the director can also ask for an independent probe by the inspector general to insure than investigations aren't closed prematurely. Also under consideration are rules that members of the intelligence committee be required to automatically disclose any substantial contact with a member of the media, reports msnbc. The rules will apply to the 17 agencies and organizations within the intelligence community coalition, which includes the fbi, national security agency, and the defense intelligence agency. Not affected by the new rules will be military service members with security clearances not assigned to an intelligence agency, white house officials or members of congress.

            "Washington — intelligence officials will face the possibility of additional scrutiny by lie detector tests and a recently established inspector general under new rules intended to deter and detect leaking to news organizations, james r. Clapper jr., the director of national intelligence, announced monday. The new steps add to the ability of intelligence agencies to conduct their own investigations of potential leakers, even when the justice department has decided that no criminal case can be brought. They were developed amid a bipartisan outcry in congress over recent disclosures in several news outlets — including the new york times — about matters like the use of a computer virus to sabotage iranian nuclear equipment, drone strikes and the foiling of a bomb plot by al qaeda's yemen branch. \"these efforts will reinforce our professional values by sending a strong message that intelligence personnel always have, and always will, hold ourselves to the highest standard of professionalism, \" mr. Clapper said in a statement, adding that the need to stem leaks \"has profound implications for current and future intelligence capabilities and our nation's security. \" the obama administration has already prosecuted six leak-related cases, twice as many as were brought under all previous presidents combined. But congress is pressuring it to do more. The first step announced by mr. Clapper relates to a counterespionage polygraph examination officials take when they join an intelligence",

U.s. Director of national intelligence james clapper on monday mandated new measures, including lie-detector tests, to prevent and detect unauthorized leaks of sensitive national security information to reporters. The move is an attempt by clapper to take the central intelligence agency's strict policy regarding leaks of classified information and apply it to employees of the intelligence community. The intelligence community is a coalition of 17 agencies and organizations within the executive branch, including the defense intelligence agency, department of energy, federal bureau of investigation, national geospatial intelligence agency, national reconnaissance office and the national security agency. Clapper's move comes in the wake of news reports derived from leaked information about u.s. Involvement in cyberattacks on iran and an alleged al-qaida plot to bomb a u.s.-bound flight. From now on, the polygraph test for anyone seeking a classified clearance for any intelligence service will include a specific question regarding contact with journalists and unauthorized leaks to the media. In the event of a leak, anyone in the intelligence community who would have had access to the leaked information is subject to a polygraph test regarding that specific leak. Anyone who fails could"

            "Washington — intelligence officials will face the possibility of additional scrutiny by lie detector tests and a recently established inspector general under new rules intended to deter and detect leaking to news organizations, james r. Clapper jr., the director of national intelligence, announced monday. The new steps add to the ability of intelligence agencies to conduct their own investigations of potential leakers, even when the justice department has decided that no criminal case can be brought. They were developed amid a bipartisan outcry in congress over recent disclosures in several news outlets — including the new york times — about matters like the use of a computer virus to sabotage iranian nuclear equipment, drone strikes and the foiling of a bomb plot by al qaeda's yemen branch. \"these efforts will reinforce our professional values by sending a strong message that intelligence personnel always have, and always will, hold ourselves to the highest standard of professionalism, \" mr. Clapper said in a statement, adding that the need to stem leaks \"has profound implications for current and future intelligence capabilities and our nation's security. \" the obama administration has already prosecuted six leak-related cases, twice as many as were brought under all previous presidents combined. But congress is pressuring it to do more. The first step announced by mr. Clapper relates to a counterespionage polygraph examination officials take when they join an intelligence",
            "Ap file director of national intelligence james clapper, center, emerges from a closed-door meeting with the house and senate intelligence committees aimed at stopping security leaks on june 7, 2012, on capitol hill in washington. U.s. Director of national intelligence james clapper on monday mandated new measures, including lie-detector tests, to prevent and detect unauthorized leaks of sensitive national security information to reporters. The move is an attempt by clapper to take the central intelligence agency's strict policy regarding leaks of classified information and apply it to employees of the intelligence community. The intelligence community is a coalition of 17 agencies and organizations within the executive branch, including the defense intelligence agency, department of energy, federal bureau of investigation, national geospatial intelligence agency, national reconnaissance office and the national security agency. Clapper's move comes in the wake of news reports derived from leaked information about u.s. Involvement in cyberattacks on iran and an alleged al-qaida plot to bomb a u.s.-bound flight. From now on, the polygraph test for anyone seeking a classified clearance for any intelligence service will include a specific question regarding contact with journalists and unauthorized leaks to the media. In the event of a leak, anyone in the intelligence community who would have had access to the leaked information is subject to a polygraph test regarding that specific leak. Anyone who fails could"

She was taken to a local hospital and released after being treated for several puncture wounds. A trapper caught and killed the alligator.

        "summary": "Boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev was formally sentenced to death yesterday, advancing him along the path to federal death row — a place that's pretty free of death. The us penitentiary in terre haute, indiana, currently houses 61 federal death row inmates; only three such inmates have been put to death since 1988, reports nbc news. In fact, there hasn't been an execution since 2003, and there are three prisoners in the facility who have been waiting to be \" dead men walking \" for 22 years. \" it will easily be a decade before the death sentence is even carried out, \" university at buffalo law professor charles ewing told the los angeles times last month. \" people looking for closure are not going to get it. When it eventually happens, this will be way out of people's consciousness. \" more death-row facts, per nbc and the lat: there's one woman on federal death row; lisa montgomery, who cut a baby from its mother's womb, is currently incarcerated at the federal medical center carswell in fort worth, texas. Tsarnaev, at 21, will be the youngest at the penitentiary. He ' ll also clearly be the newest, taking that label from thomas sanders, who was handed his death sentence in september. He kidnapped and killed a 12-year-old girl. Since 1927, 37 people on federal death row have been executed. In federal death penalty cases, appeals are automatic, and the first move will be to request a new trial. The last move: ask the current president for commutation. One professor suggested tsarnaev's decision to speak yesterday could be intended to help him on that latter front.",

Penitentiary in terre haute, indiana. There he will wait — likely for a very long time. Just how long depends on a range of factors, mainly the strength of his legal appeals and the future of lethal injection drugs. But it's safe to assume that it will be several years before he is put to death. Despite the name, there isn't much death on death row.",
            "At 21, dzhokhar tsarnaev is about to become the youngest, most notorious inmate on federal death row. After convicting the russian immigrant last month in the 2013 boston marathon bombings, a jury on friday voted to sentence him to death for his role in the worst terrorist attack on u.s. Soil since sept. 11. When tsarnaev is formally sentenced this summer, it may be the last time he is seen in public, but the legal battle over his case is certain to drag on for years before any execution is carried out. For now he remains in the custody of u.s. Marshals here in boston. After sentencing, he will be turned over to the u.s. Bureau of prisons and eventually deposited at the death house in terre haute, ind., on the banks of the wabash river. From there, over the next 10 years or more, his defense team will wage the final fight for his life. His current defense lawyers, led by widely known anti-death-penalty advocate judy clarke, failed to persuade jurors to spare tsarnaev from death row. The next legal battle will be with a new team of appellate lawyers who will try to win, at a minimum, a new hearing on whether life with no parole is the more appropriate punishment. \" it will be a very slow, torturous process, \" said charles ewing, a university at buffalo law professor. Interviews with several attorneys and experts on capital litigation suggest there is little chance tsarnaev will see his conviction set aside. In march, on the first day of his trial, clarke conceded to the jury that tsarnaev placed one of the two pressure-cooker bombs near the finish line in april 2013 that helped kill three people and injure more than 260 others. He and his older brother, tamerlan, later shot to death an mit police officer. But experts say tsarnaev does have a reasonably good chance of getting the death sentence set aside, based largely on his lawyers'repeated requests to move the trial out of boston.

But even though the decision was 7-2 in favor of colorado baker jack phillips, the ruling is seen as a narrow one in a legal sense, reports cnn. That's because the justices issued their ruling to apply to the specifics of this case and didn't settle the bigger issue: whether business owners have a right to refuse gay patrons on religious grounds. As anthony kennedy wrote, that issue \" must await further elaboration, \" per the ap. Details and developments: the origins: the case began in 2012 when same-sex couple charlie craig and david mullins asked phillips ' masterpiece cakeshop in lakewood to make a cake for their wedding. Phillips refused, saying he objected to gay marriage because of his religious beliefs, and a six-year legal fight ensued. See a timeline at fox news. The ruling: the supreme court declared that the state's civil rights commission erred by treating phillips'religious objections with \" hostility, \" reports the washington post. A key quote: \" the state's interest could have been weighed against phillips'sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the requisite religious neutrality that must be strictly observed, \" wrote kennedy. \" but the official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the commissioners ' comments were inconsistent with that requirement... \"",

However, chief mccollom's story has been inconsistent, the atlanta journal-constitution notes. As his wife moaned in the background, he allegedly told the 911 operator that his service revolver went off while he moved it from the bed, but he also claimed he shot her while he was asleep. Whether chief mccollom will face criminal charges is the county district attorney's call. Meanwhile, margaret mccollom was upgraded to good condition yesterday, wsb-tv reports.",

Thomison tells fox 59 deputies were threatened when they refused those requests and were forced to share one set of body armor while dealing with criminals. Thomison says he \" felt like [ council members ] were serving their own agenda. \" \"the town has refused to educate themselves on how to run a town; they continue to carry out their personal agendas, \" he tells the tribune. Thomison says he was also personally wronged by the council. After being diagnosed with cancer last year, he says the council informed him it would be making him part time to get out of providing his health insurance, which was \" costing the town way too much money. \" when informed of the resignation of the town's entire police force, the council president said: \" it is what it is. \" bunker hill's building commissioner and council vice president also resigned monday. County deputies will patrol the town until a new marshal is hired.",

It's actually completely legal for a parent to give up a baby at a hospital ( or police or fire station ) within 72 hours of its birth in hawaii. What isn't legal? lying to the cops. Family court will now decide whether to return the baby — which officials have dubbed \" baby sandy \" — to simeona, or terminate her parental rights, the ap reports.",

All eyes are on the senate, where republicans need six seats to gain control.

Or it could just be hours. Politico playbook says sources on both sides say we could be in for an \" early night. \" it points to two \" harbingers \": north carolina ( polls close at 7: 30pm ) and new hampshire ( last polls close 30 minutes later ). In the former, if thom tillis ousts democrat kay hagan, it predicts the gop will very likely score the six seats it needs. In new hampshire, if republican scott brown unseats sen. Jeanne shaheen, it's another sign the gop will triumph. How might the democrats stay on top? if the gop loses in kansas and georgia, politico points out they'd need to win eight, rather than six, seats, making for a steeper hill to climb. But as the wall street journal puts it, \" the gop heads into tuesday's balloting with a breeze, but not a strong wind, at its back. \" this is based on a wsj/nbc news poll that found that 46 % of likely voters want to see a gop-led congress, compared to 45 % hoping for democratic control. The house is getting much less attention, with republicans expected to hang on to control. But usa today notes one thing to watch: whether the gop will reach 245 seats. If it does, it would be its biggest majority since harry truman was president. Here are five fascinating races to watch there.",

At a hearing tuesday, india's top court ordered the government to seek advice from overseas and spend whatever it takes to fix the taj mahal, the bbc reports. \" even if you have the expertise, you are not utilizing it. Or perhaps you don't care, \" justices said after reviewing photographs of the decaying 17th-century monument, which is being turned yellow and brown by smog, and green in places by insect dung. Local factories have been closed and a mud treatment to remove stains is underway, but environmentalists say the problem keeps getting worse. The court order comes as controversy rages over the indian government's plan to allow private firms to take over the maintenance of historic sites such as the taj mahal, a move that critics say amounts to privatizing the country's heritage, cnbc reports. The dalmia bharat conglomerate has been approved to run the taj under the \" adopt a heritage \" plan and will be allowed to put up advertising and set ticket prices in return. Kj alphons, india's tourism minister, tells the washington post that the move is necessary because underfunded government agencies are failing to take proper care of the sites. \" not one monument or site in india is visitable, \" he says. \" they are stinking dirty. \" ( the taj mahal is on a list of places not to visit in 2018. )",

Buenos aires &#124; buenos aires ( reuters ) - argentine president cristina fernandez has thyroid cancer and will undergo surgery next month, her government said on tuesday, adding that the cancerous cells had not spread. Fernandez, 58, was easily elected to a second four-year term in october, vowing to deepen her unorthodox policies despite complaints from business leaders who say her heavy-handed management of the economy is stifling investment. Fernandez was diagnosed with a papillary carcinoma that has not metastasized, said her spokesman, alfredo scoccimarro. The operation is scheduled to take place on january 4 and she is expected to take a leave of absence until january 24. \" the thyroid gland will have to be removed, \" said buenos aires-based cancer specialist julio moreno. \" the prognosis is very good. The chances of being cured are 90 to 98 percent. \" the cancer was detected last week during a routine check. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and normally affects people under the age of 40, especially women.

They'd been abandoned on a train, after all, so they couldn't be that valuable, right? wrong, reports the bbc. The fiat worker inadvertently bought a paul gauguin titled fruits sur une table ou nature au petit chien ( fruits on a table or still life with a small dog ) that is worth somewhere between $ 13 million and $ 42 million today, along with a pierre bonnard titled la femme aux deux fauteuils ( woman with two armchairs ) valued at around $ 827,000. The paintings had been stolen in london, but the best guess is that the thieves abandoned them on a train in italy because of a looming border check, reports the guardian. The paintings then got tucked away in lost and found before going up for auction. The unidentified buyer had them both hanging in his house for all these years, until his son stumbled across an image of the gauguin in a book and thought it looked strangely familiar. They called in police, who did some sleuthing and unraveled the story. Authorities are now trying to figure out who should get the paintings — and the factory worker is hopeful because the original couple they were stolen from seems to have died without heirs, reports cnn.",

Trump had warned hillary last year not to accuse him of having a \" penchant for sexism \" because bill clinton has his own supposedly sordid past, and he apparently wasn't bluffing. In a recent post interview, trump said the clintons had \" said things about me which were very nasty \" and that he could be nasty right back, and that was evidenced by a video he posted monday on instagram. Accompanied by a caption reading \" is hillary really protecting women? \" the video — which business insider describes as \" set to creepy, minor-key music \" — shows a still of bill, cigar in mouth, as audio plays from interviews with two women who've accused him of sex crimes. \" no woman should be subjected to it. It was an assault, \" says a voice that politico ids as that of kathleen willey, who accused clinton of attacking her in 1993. That voiceover is followed by audio of juanita broaddrick, who says clinton raped her in 1978. \" he starts to … bite on my top lip, and i tried to pull away from him, \" broaddrick says in trump's video, followed by a clip of hillary clinton \" cackling, \" per politico. The clinton camp has remained relatively stoic on trump's latest hit, with hillary's campaign spokesman telling bloomberg tv on monday this is just a trump \" strategy to try to distract from an issues-based campaign, which is what we intend to run, \" per the post. Meanwhile, a surprising voice has emerged to praise bill clinton: kenneth starr, the ex-whitewater counsel who, as the new york times puts it, once \" tried to bury \" clinton. Starr ( who's got his own problems regarding a sex scandal at baylor university ) said last week he regrets clinton's legacy being linked to all that whitewater \" unpleasantness, \" that the former president has gone through a \" redemptive process, \" and that no. 42 is \" the most gifted politician of the baby boomer generation. \" \" his genuine empathy for human beings is absolutely clear, \" starr added.",

        "summary": "Quentin tarantino has been protesting against police brutality, including referring to certain police officers as murderers — but the filmmaker's own father is not backing him up. \" i love my son and have great respect for him as an artist but he is dead wrong in calling police officers, particularly in new york city where i grew up, murderers, \" tony tarantino says in a statement released by the patrolmen's benevolent association of the city of new york friday. \" he is a passionate man and that comes out in his art but sometimes he lets his passion blind him to the facts and to reality. I believe that is what happened when he joined in those anti-cop protests. \" the elder tarantino went on to tell fox news that his son \" gets extremely emotional and involved through his passion on what he thinks is right, and in my opinion he went off totally without putting a lot of thought and consideration into what he was doing or [ saying ]. \" the pba and other unions representing police have urged a boycott of tarantino's films until he apologizes, and the pba president says the group is \" grateful \" for tony's statement ( even though tony says he won't actually be boycotting his son's next movie, the hateful 8, which opens in december ). Complicating matters is the fact that, back in 2010, quentin tarantino claimed he \" never knew \" and, in fact, \" never met \" his father, and that the man \" was never part of my life. \" \" i have tried for years to create a personal relationship with him other than professional but you know due to circumstances that isn't happening, \" tony tarantino says. \" unfortunately, that happens in too many families today. We just happen to be one of them. \" other protesters are supporting quentin tarantino, the ap reports; an organizer of the rally at which the filmmaker spoke says the resulting criticism is \" an attempt to squelch any discussion by people in the arts or prominent people in other fields of taking up and discussing controversial social issues. \"",

            "Quentin tarantino is on a roll. Although his most recent film inglourious basterds opened to mixed reviews last summer, it has since gone on to become the highest-grossing of his career. This week, the film picked up a phenomenal eight oscar nominations – including best picture, best director and best original screenplay – only one shy of frontrunners avatar and the hurt locker. If the two favourites split the vote, tarantino might, just might, sneak through the middle and make off with the silverware.
