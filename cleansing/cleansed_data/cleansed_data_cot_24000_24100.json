Sources tell reuters that anheuser-busch is already drawing attention from antitrust regulators and the justice department for allegedly trying to crush competition from craft beers by buying up distributors and making it harder for the small brewers to get their beer to customers.

            "Washington the u.s. Justice department is probing allegations that anheuser-busch inbev ( abi.br ) is seeking to curb competition in the beer market by buying distributors, making it harder for fast-growing craft brewers to get their products on store shelves, according to three people familiar with the matter. In the past few months, the world's largest brewer has rattled the craft beer world by striking deals for five distributors in three states. Many states require brewers to use distributors to sell their product, and once ab inbev buys a distributor, craft companies say they find that they can't distribute their beer as easily and sales growth stalls. Antitrust regulators are also reviewing craft brewers ' claims that ab inbev pushes some independent distributors to only carry the company's products and end their ties with the craft industry, two of the sources said, noting that the investigation was in its early stages. Ab inbev's purchase of several craft beer makers in recent years means that it is in a position to offer a greater variety of products itself. State regulators in california, where ab inbev announced wholesaler purchases in oakland and san jose in september, are also looking into the matter, the people familiar with the matter said. The beer giant confirmed that it was talking to regulators. \" anheuser-busch has been in communication with the department of justice and california attorney general's office about the transactions. We are working cooperatively to address any questions they have, \" an anheuser-busch spokesperson said in an email. Craft brewers, who produce everything from well-crafted classics to odd flavors such as pumpkin or raspberry beer, have been a bright spot in an otherwise dull u.s. Beer market. While beer sales rose 0.5 percent in 2014, craft beer sales rose by 17.6 percent to capture 11 percent of the u.s. Market.

If only the world will let him. Since he announced his grand plans, no other country has recognized liberland, croatia has threatened to arrest would-be settlers, and nearby residents interviewed by usa today don't seem quite sure whether it's a joke. Jedlicka insists it's not, and says that more than 300,000 people around the world have applied for citizenship. ( you can do so through the liberland website. ) \" the key for us is to get recognized, \" says jedlicka. \" we're in contact with about 50 embassies. \" the plan is to get a few countries, any countries, to recognize liberland, and \" the rest will fall into place. \" the rest, presumably, includes electricity, plumbing, and actual buildings, all of which liberland now lacks, save for a lone abandoned house.

        "summary": "Scientists who currently look at mild cognitive impairment as an early indicator of alzheimer's might have another tell-tale sign: moodiness or behavioral changes, which they say show up in people who develop full-blown dementia. Researchers at the university of calgary are proposing that doctors begin to use a 34-question checklist to sooner identity people at greater risk for developing alzheimer's, reports webmd. They're calling it \" mild behavioral impairment, \" and neuropsychiatrist zahinoor ismail says they're on the lookout for not \" just a blip in behavior, but a fundamental change \" that has lasted at least six months. \"most people think of alzheimer's as primarily a memory disorder, but we do know... That it also can start as a behavioral issue, \" says the director of the alzheimer's disease centers program at the national institute on aging, who wasn't involved in developing the checklist, but advocates it. Questions range from \" has the person become agitated, aggressive, irritable, or temperamental? \" and \" does she/he have unrealistic beliefs about her/his power, wealth or skills? \" to \" does she/he no longer care about anything? \" and while there are concerns of false positives from the screening — that over-diagnosis can cause stress and unnecessary expense, among other things — many in the field welcome such a test, which could help patients combat any behavioral issues as well as prepare for dementia down the road, reports the new york times. Ismail says that while the \" stealth symptom \" of behavioral changes can be as innocuous as increased apathy, they can also be stark; he saw one patient in her 70s go from \" prude to promiscuous, \" while a law-abiding 67-year-old picked up an addiction to crack-cocaine.

        "summary": "Ever wondered if dogs can actually smell when you are afraid? new research published in the journal scientific reports suggests that humans emit certain chemical signatures that might be predictive of our emotions \" by broadcasting scene specific emissions on breath. \" to test this, they studied the air in a movie theater every 30 seconds over the course of 108 screenings of 16 movies involving 9,500 moviegoers, and they watched how the chemical composition of the air changed from moment to moment. The researchers found that suspense and humor off-gas the clearest signals, while other emotions were more \" muddled, \" as discover magazine reports. One example: levels of the chemicals carbon dioxide and isoprene spiked in the air in correlation with particularly tense scenes in hunger games 2. That seems to make sense, notes discover's neuroskeptic blog, given that stress increases the heart and breathing rates, causing us to exhale more co2. Isoprene, meanwhile, is associated with muscle activity, perhaps from people fidgeting in their seats. The blog, however, has some issues with the study design. Still, the results provide \" a whiff of evidence that humans may use volatile chemicals as signals, \" observes ars technica. And while much more research would be needed to confirm that, the authors \" note that audience emissions may be useful for evaluating whether movies are truly funny or thrilling. \" the work and subsequent studies analyzing what we exhale on a molecular level in different moods also could prove useful in advertising and in the development of medical tools that rely on breath.

        "summary": "The new york times, citing anonymous government officials, reports it knows where rep. Devin nunes got those classified intelligence reports that allegedly show president trump and associates were caught up in american surveillance of foreign officials. The times names two white house officials as the source of the reports: michael ellis, a lawyer in the white house counsel's office, and ezra cohen-watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the national security council. Nunes has refused to identify his sources for the reports, which officials say mostly show foreign officials and ambassadors trying to gain contacts inside trump's family and associates. If the officials in the times story are telling the truth, it contradicts statements nunes has made about his sources, the washington post reports. Nunes has claimed his sources weren't white house staff and also said the reports didn't come from anyone who would have an interest in backing up trump's evidence-free claims about wiretapping at trump tower. White house staff would have such an interest. According to the atlantic, nunes has also previously said the white house wasn't aware of the information in the reports. It's unclear why nunes would have rushed to brief trump on information that originated at the white house, which is what got him in trouble in the first place. Meanwhile, the ap reports sean spicer has invited intelligence leaders from both parties to view material related to surveillance involving trump associates. He wouldn't say if it's the same intelligence nunes has seen.",

It's technically written as 3.14159, or 3.14 for short, but pi is an \"irrational and transcendental number \" whose decimals \"continue infinitely without repetition or pattern, \" according to piday.org, the holiday's official website. But just like the hordes of young people who flocked to get married on 12/12/12, we can't resist the opportunity to celebrate a fortuitous coincidence on our calendars.

        "summary": "This week, ralph lauren installed smart dressing rooms in its 5th avenue store in new york — and venturebeat says they're even more space-age than cher horowitz's clueless closet. The dressing rooms, the brainchild of startup oak labs, feature touchscreen mirrors that, per quartz, use radio-frequency identification ( rfid ) to identify and display the items being tried on. That way, customers can easily ping sales reps if they need new colors, new sizes, or new items entirely, and the reps get notifications on their ipads. The rooms also feature lighting that automatically brightens when the customer enters, and people can use the mirror to change the lighting to one of three different schemes ( \" fifth avenue daylight, \" \" east hampton sunset, \" or \" evening at the polo bar \" ). The mirrors have five language options. Marina nazario tried one of the dressing rooms, and she writes at business insider that \" it blew my mind. \" she notes that the mirrors easily allow customers to browse through other items at the store — and even offer suggestions of items you might like. And they allow you to interact with a sales rep for more than just grabbing a new size — select \" i just need some help! \" if you simply crave human interaction. You can also have the mirror send you information about items you like if you won't be purchasing them that day. \" my shopping experience will never be the same, \" she writes. Venturebeat notes that prada and macy's also have some \" smart \" dressing rooms, but no store has yet been able to make the experience truly cost-effective. Similar mirrors launched at the rebecca minkoff store in new york last year allow customers to make purchases using paypal.

Mccain has glioblastoma, a type of tumor that michael berens at the translational genomics research institute in phoenix has studied for 30 years. He tells the arizona republic that the tumor spreads with \" finger-like projections, \" with wandering cells creating \" guerilla warfare in the brain. \" he says that patients who undergo surgery and chemotherapy survive for an average of 16 to 18 months after diagnosis. \" when i heard of the diagnosis, my heart sank, \" berens says. Mccain is \" a man of great courage and endurance. He has a rough journey ahead of him. \" in other coverage: sen. Lindsey graham told reporters he spoke to mccain, a close friend, wednesday and that the senator briefly discussed his condition before saying, \" i've been through worse \" and shifting the conversation to politics, politico reports. \" god knows how this ends, not me, \" graham said. \" but i do know this: this disease has never had a more worthy opponent. \" barack obama was among the many other well-wishers. \" john mccain is an american hero &amp; one of the bravest fighters i've ever known, \" he tweeted. \" cancer doesn't know what it's up against. Give it hell, john. \" president trump tweeted: \" melania and i send our thoughts and prayers to senator mccain, cindy, and their entire family. Get well soon. \" the washington post has more on glioblastoma, which killed both sen. Ted kennedy and beau biden, joe biden's son. Experts say that symptoms, including problems expressing yourself or understanding what you're listening to, are often only recognized in hindsight. Deepa subramaniam, director of the brain tumor center at georgetown university's lombardi comprehensive cancer center, tells the post that survival times vary widely, with 30 % of patients living more than two years after the diagnosis and 10 % surviving five years. In rare cases, she says, some patients survive for as long as 15 or 20 years. The hill reports that republican senators who were gathered for a meeting on health care negotiations prayed for mccain on wednesday night after hearing the news. They acknowledged that his absence will make it even tougher to pass health care legislation.

More records could be broken over new year's weekend as the cold weather keeps up. Details: freezing sharks: weather was a factor in two deaths in chicago and a car crash that killed four in kansas, per the new york times. Three thresher sharks also died near cape cod, likely when their gills froze. \" if you've got cold air, that ' ll freeze their gills up very quickly, \" says one marine scientist.

        "summary": "The us hit a syrian air base with almost 60 tomahawk missiles early friday in what president trump says was a response to a chemical attack on civilians — and what russia and syria say was an act of aggression. A spokesman for vladimir putin told reporters friday that putin considers the strike aggression and a violation of international law, carried out under a \" trumped-up \" pretext. Russian officials say the strike on the shayrat airfield has destroyed the chances of us-russia anti-terror cooperation in syria, cnn reports. Iran also condemned the attack, calling it \" dangerous \" and \" destructive. \" us allies, including the uk, australia, and saudi arabia, described the action as an appropriate response to the chemical attack, the ap reports. More on the us strike: pentagon spokesman capt. Jeff davis says russian forces were present at the base hit by american missiles, but the russians were informed of the strikes in \" multiple conversations, \" the guardian reports. \" we took extraordinary precautions to not target the area where the russians are, \" davis says. Davis said the strike was the result of the assad regime's conduct, and it \" will be the regime's choice if there's any more, and it will be based upon their conduct going forward. \" syria has denied carrying out a chemical attack, and while bashar al-assad's allies claim it would have been a \" crazy move \" for the regime to provoke the us with such an attack, analysts tell the new york times that it was in fact part of a deliberate strategy of escalating attacks on civilians. The tactics are designed to demoralize the opposition and demonstrate that the syrian government can act with impunity, analysts say. \" rarely has a policy changed so far and so quickly \" and led to such swift action as trump's position on striking the assad regime over the last two days, notes jon sopel at the bbc. It's not clear, however, whether this was a one-off strike or the start of something more prolonged. Sources tell time that the turning point for trump, who ran on a nationalist, isolationist \" america first \" platform, may have been the distressing images of children killed in the attack, some of them the same age as his 10-year-old son, barron. The sources say trump was disturbed by the photos and spoke of them repeatedly. Usa today notes that trump's position on striking syria has changed not just since 2013, when he warned obama against attacking the country, but since his campaign, when he said: \" you're going to end up in",

        "summary": "Insurers nationwide are scrambling to retain customers who might ditch them for a better plan through the obamacare marketplace — and some have engaged in questionable practices to do so. Talking points memo has identified several instances of insurers contacting customers to tell them their current policies are expiring, and encouraging them to sign on for new, sometimes higher-priced ones before the marketplaces launched in october. In one case, a woman in seattle received a letter saying the insurer had found a new plan for her, and if it didn't hear from her, she would be rolled over to this new policy. \" if you're happy with this plan, do nothing, \" lifewise of washington wrote. What lifewise didn't mention was that the new policy would cost her $ 300 more a month — or that she had much better options available to her on the insurance exchange. When she visited the marketplace, she found a cheaper plan and a number of new tax credits for which her family was eligible. In all, she saved $ 1,000 a month compared with the new plan the lifewise had tried to sign her on to. Insurers say it's just business, but regulators are not impressed. Last month, humana was fined $ 65,000 for sending similar letters in kentucky, and also got a slap on the wrist in colorado. \" the letter appeared threatening, \" says a spokesman for colorado's insurance division. \" you've got to let people know their options.

It was a $ 15,000 idea, reports npr. Cardon took the top prize in the space poop challenge among 5,000 solutions submitted from every country and continent, antarctica included, per cnn. A team also took home $ 10,000 for its \" air-push urinary girdle, \" a diaper that uses air to direct waste away from the body using a small tube, which might also be used in hospitals and nursing homes, per the guardian. A third winner took home $ 5,000 for his \" zero gravity underwear \" that seals and sanitizes waste. Nasa says elements from the winning designs will be combined with existing ideas to create a solution that will ultimately be tested in space. The final product will then be placed on nasa's orion spacecraft designed for long space missions. In the case that \" something catastrophic has happened, \" leaving astronauts unable to use a toilet or space diaper as usual, the solution will \" save the crew, \" a nasa rep says.

            "While scanning parenting blogs and sites yesterday, i came across an article on huffington post about a restaurant receipt with a note from a \"single mom. \" i was initially a little amused that this was making the rounds because it seems so silly. Who really cares if someone, single mom or not, left a tip? it's rude in the extreme, but hardly worthy of public discussion. The more i thought about it, though, i realized it wasn't funny at all. The restaurant patron, who left no tip on a $ 138.55 bill, signing, \"single mom, sorry, \" may or may not have been a single mom. I think the diner was not really a single parent, or at least not one who couldn't afford a tip, but rather someone trying to imply that some single moms feel like they are entitled to a pass because they are struggling financially. The note on the receipt ( if it was indeed a joke ), and the reaction it has drawn online, points to a larger issue. Increasingly, it seems, single moms are being used as the butt of jokes or, even worse, a scapegoat for societal ills. What do you think? is this receipt real? is the incident indicative of a larger, mostly negative,",

In reality, only 20 % of adults in the us live more than a few hours'drive from their parents, the new york times reports. The times has an in-depth look at where americans live in relation to their parents and why. The information comes from a university of michigan study in which researchers survey approximately 20,000 americans over the age of 50 every two years. \" the data reveal a country of close-knit families, with members of multiple generations leaning on one another for financial and practical support, \" the times reports. The takeaway: the typical american adult lives only 18 miles from his or her mom ( with 18 miles being the median distance ); 40 % are within 5 miles. The times reports more and more americans are staying closer and closer to home in recent decades. In fact, another recent poll found 37 % of americans have never lived outside his or her hometown, with the exception of going college and serving in the military. Overall, people with more education and income are the most likely to live further from home. \" it speaks to a class divide in the population, \" one expert tells the times. \" particularly as you go further down the socioeconomic scale, people are living pretty close to their parents, and this means they're able to provide help. \" that's only going to become more common as baby-boomers age and need caring for. And as the number of two-income families grows, living near relatives also allows for cheap childcare. Read the full story here.",

That man: 20-year-old florida state university wide receiver travis rudolph, who was visiting tallahassee's montford middle school with other players from the seminoles football team when he spotted paske's son, bo, eating alone. Paske explains in a facebook post that bo has autism and thankfully seems to not notice or mind that he no longer gets invited to birthday parties and regularly sits by himself at lunch. Still, paske's \" feelings of anxiety for him \" can be \" overwhelming, \" she says. Rudolph explains he noticed bo sitting alone and asked if he and his pizza could join the student, per the ap. \" we just had a great conversation, \" rudolph says. One of bo's first questions to rudolph, per the orlando sentinel: whether he played for the nfl, to which rudolph answered, \" not yet. \" a paske family friend who happens to work at montford snapped the photo so he could assure bo's mom her son was doing ok. \" this is one day i didn't have to worry if my sweet boy ate lunch alone, because he sat across from someone who is a hero in many eyes, \" paske writes. Rudolph tells seminoles.com he remembers local football stars engaging with the community when he was young, and figured \" maybe i could change someone's life. \" as for bo, he seems stoked at the hubbub surrounding his lunch date, which also nabbed him an autographed lunchbox and an invite to have dinner with the team. \" it was kind of like me sitting on a rainbow, \" bo says, per the tallahassee democrat. Paske tells the paper the day after rudolph's visit, bo was \" the most popular kid in the room \" and sat with a table full of girls at lunch. ( an awesome story about a girl with autism and a shirt she loves. )",

        "summary": "San francisco's golden gate bridge has apparently banked plenty of pto hours over the last 77 years — and this weekend it's using 52 of them. Starting at midnight tonight and continuing through 4am monday, the bridge will be closed to cars so that a movable median barrier can be installed along the 1.7-mile span to prevent head-on collisions, the ap reports. It's said to be the iconic bridge's longest shutdown ever and the first closure since the few hours it took off in 1987 for its 50th-anniversary celebration. Golden gate transit buses, pedestrians, emergency vehicles, and bicyclists will still be allowed, but officials suggest skipping a city visit if possible. \" stay at home, \" a bridge district spokeswoman tells the san francisco chronicle. About 80,000 drivers cross into san francisco over the golden gate on a typical weekend day, so if all those commuters decide to join the 60,000 drivers who use the nearby richmond-san rafael bridge, \" it's going to be a mess, \" says the bridge official. The $ 30 million concrete barrier will take the place of yellow plastic markers currently hand-placed by bridge workers to separate traffic going in opposite directions. Crews will be able to move the new barrier using two special \" zipper trucks \" to rework the bridge's six lanes as needed, depending on traffic. Officials hope the new system will cut down on head-on crashes: there have been 128 of them on the bridge, resulting in 16 deaths, since 1970, reports ap. ( the bridge is also getting a steel safety net to prevent suicides. )",

This could be the beginning of a potentially dangerous period for afghanistan at a time when the war-ravaged country desperately needs a leader to stem rising violence as foreign troops prepare to leave. \" today we proved to the world that this is a people driven country, \" karzai, wearing his trademark green robe and a lambskin hat, told his nation in televised remarks. \" on behalf of the people, i thank the security forces, election commission and people who exercised democracy and... Turned another page in the glorious history of afghanistan. \" one of the eight candidates will have to score over 50 percent of the vote to avoid a run-off with his nearest rival. The taliban threat to wreck the vote through bombings and assassination failed to materialize, and violent incidents were on a far smaller scale than feared. Turnout was seven million out of 12 million eligible voters, or about 58 percent, according"

There was \" no active claim on the work and no discoverable information that would directly connect this specific work with the claimant family, \" a rep adds, per the telegraph.

            "Brooklyn park, minn. -- a u.s. Senator from minnesota has helped a man rectify his struggle with the irs, which declared him dead for 29 years. Kmsp-tv reports that sen. Amy klobuchar managed to reverse the false declaration and the government now recognizes that adam ronning is alive. \" this was an absurd situation, \" the senator said in a statement. \" this constituent was declared dead by the government when he wasn't. It doesn't get much worse than that. \" a \" 60 minutes \" investigation in 2015 found that approximately 9,000 living americans are erroneously declared dead each year, representing an error rate of one-third of 1 percent of new names added to the government's \" death master file. \" the false declaration in ronning's case was initially made when he was 4 years old. As an adult, he has always paid his taxes, but either only got half of his return or none at all since 2009. \" it's insulting, it's shocking, it's frustrating, \" ronning said. \" i'd call and they were like, ' let's just give him the hold monster. ' \" ronning said the government owes him approximately $ 20,000 in tax refunds. \" that money will definitely have somewhere to go, you got to support the family, and there's going to be more diapers, making sure our cars keep working; just keep on keeping on, \" said the father of two with another child on the way. A spokeswoman for klobuchar said such cases are rare. \" i ' m glad we could help him, and we will continue to work to make sure he gets the tax refunds he deserves, \" klobuchar said in the statement.",

Jennifer morant suffered chronic pain, depression, and anxiety but wasn't terminally ill when she was found dead in her car at her gold coast home with a gas generator and a note reading, \" please don't resuscitate me. \" prosecutors later said her husband had taken the 56-year-old to buy the generator at a hardware store and had told her he would use the insurance payout to build a religious commune in the gold coast hinterland. Abc australia describes it as \" a haven from the biblical rapture \" complete with bunkers. Davis — who referred to the sentence as the world's first for counselling suicide — stressed that morant hadn't shown remorse, reports the guardian. The 69-year-old will be eligible for parole beginning in 2023. ( this suspected suicide turned out to be murder. )",

        "summary": "Dylann roof was attacked by a fellow inmate as he was stepping into a jail shower thursday in south carolina, usa today reports. Roof is charged with killing nine people during bible study at a historic black church in 2015 in charleston. According to nbc news, the 22-year-old roof is in protective custody, meaning inmates ' cells are supposed to be locked while he showers alone. But police say 25-year-old dwayne stafford got out of his cell, ran downstairs, and started pummeling roof. Roof suffered only bruises before officers stopped the attack. One of the officers who was supposed to be monitoring the situation was on break at the time; the other was fetching toilet paper for another inmate. Police say the assault on roof was \" unprovoked, \" the charleston post and courier reports. Sheriff al cannon says there's no evidence it was racially motivated \" beyond the obvious speculation that we would all have given the nature of the situation. \" roof, who is white, is facing federal hate crime charges and is said to have wanted to start a race war with the shooting. Stafford is black. Cannon doesn't believe the guards coordinated to allow the attack but says they will be looking into why stafford was able to get out of his cell. Roof isn't planning on pressing charges against stafford. In the wake of the attack, stafford — who is being held on robbery and assault charges — was praised on social media.",

The find is not only a rarity for saudi arabia, but for the entire arabian peninsula, where to-date only a handful of bone fragments have been found. Like all other dinosaur bones found in the region, the specimens from saudi arabia were fragments as well, excavated in the northwest part of the country along the coast of the red sea. The bones were identified as a string of vertebrae from the tail of a brontosaurus-like sauropod and teeth from a carnivorous dinosaur, likely a theropod. Scientists dated the fossils to be about 72 million years old, placing them from the late cretaceous era. The theropod is thought to be a 6-meter-long bi-pedal meat-eater distantly related to tyrannosaurus rex, while the sauropod was a plant-eating titanosaur that may have been up to 20 meters in length",

Consequently the discovery of a small, but diagnostic, accumulation of elements from campanian-maastrichtian ( ~75 ma ) deposits in northwestern saudi arabia is significant because it constitutes the first taxonomically identifiable dinosaur material described from the arabian peninsula.

The recognition of titanosaurians and abelisaurids from saudi arabia extends the palaeogeographical range of these groups along the entire northern gondwanan margin during the latest cretaceous.

While doing so, he encountered brosseau, who was also standing in the aisle and was seen physically reacting after the contact. \" i was trying to start the vote, the prime minister grabbed my arm.

Cnnmoney reports it spoke with a handful of ex-workers who say they were terminated after raising the red flag about the bank's unethical activities, including by calling the company's ethics hotline set up for just that purpose and meant to protect whistleblowers. \" they ruined my life, \" says bill bado, a former worker who notes he called the hotline and wrote an email to hr in september 2013 and was fired for tardiness eight days after sending it. The ex-employees say their firings all followed that pattern, with trumped-up charges of being late or other misdeeds. \" i endured harsh bullying … defamation of character, and eventually being pinned for something i didn't do, \" says heather brock, canned this month for falsifying documents ( she denies it ). An anonymous ex-hr worker backs up these claims, telling cnn there was a system in place to get back at those who spoke up, with the company keeping a close eye on whistleblowers until it could find something petty to pin on them to lead to termination. \" if this person was supposed to be at the branch at 8: 30am and they showed up at 8: 32am, they would fire them, \" he says. One woman says she was fired even after emailing ceo john stumpf directly about what she thought were shady sales tactics.

            "Chipotle mexican grill must pay a former california employee nearly $ 8 million in damages for scheming to fire her after she filed a worker's compensation claim for a job-related injury, the fresno bee is reporting. The order from a jury in fresno superior court in central california came on thursday. On friday, chipotle spokesman chris arnold told nation's restaurant news that the chain will appeal the ruling. \"we are disappointed with the verdict in this case and plan to appeal this decision, \" he said. The denver-based chain offered no further comment. Warren paboojian, attorney for the plaintiff, could not be reached for comment. In court, he argued that his client, jeanette ortiz, had been wrongly terminated after the mother of nine went on medical leave for injuries related to carpal tunnel syndrome, the bee reported. Ortiz was a general manager making about $ 70,000 a year. She was fired while on leave, accused of stealing money that chipotle could not prove because the video evidence had been erased. \"in addition to taping over the video evidence, paboojian told the jury that chipotle management deleted text messages and lost notes about the reasons for firing ortiz, \" the bee reported.

            "For years, jeanette ortiz was a loyal, hardworking general manager for chipotle mexican grill on shaw avenue across from the fresno state campus. But in january 2015, ortiz was fired, accused of stealing $ 626 in cash from the restaurant's safe, said a lawyer for chipotle mexican grill inc. There was even video evidence to prove ortiz's theft, the lawyer said. But when ortiz denied stealing the money and asked to see the video evidence, her bosses at chipotle declined. Instead, the company destroyed the video evidence, said fresno attorneys warren paboojian and jason bell, who represent ortiz in a wrongful termination case she brought against the fast-food giant.

The mercury news reports on the ballot-casting for the so-called \" self drive act, \" which spells out what role states would have over self-driving cars. Specifically, it bars states from playing a role in the vehicles'design, construction, or performance. Companies in their first year of production would be able to put on the road up to 25,000 autonomous vehicles; that cap would rise to 100,000 over three years. House majority leader kevin mccarthy says the act promises to make the us transportation landscape \" safer and more efficient, \" while an analyst notes that the first nation to get such cars up and running would become \" one of the leaders in the global tech scene. \" but the legislation has others worried that safety will be a side note in the rush to take these cars to market, with states mostly cut out of the picture and \" no enforceable [ federal ] safety standards, \" per a spokesman from the national highway traffic safety administration. The washington post, which says the act can offer \" a rare bipartisan win on a high-profile issue, \" notes that a big issue critics have with the legislation is that carmakers would be able to apply for exemptions from federal safety standards, as long as they can prove that their design is as safe as that of traditional cars. What states would still have control over, per recode and reuters: registration and licensing requirements and safety inspections, among other items, as well as whether autonomous vehicles can use their roads at all.

The agency said today that online criminals tapped into the information of 104,000 people though the irs ' popular \" get transcript \" service. As the ap explains, the service allows people to access their previous returns, and therefore it would allow cyber-thieves who gain entry to grab all kinds of personal information. Cnn money reports that the thieves used the data to claim at least 15,000 fraudulent refunds, but it adds that the greater danger is the prospect of identity theft — and the possibility of bogus bank accounts and credit lines, for example. The irs has shut down the service for the time being as it ramps up security. ( the site krebs on security had warned of vulnerabilities at irs.gov in march. ) still, forbes explains that this wasn't a hack in the traditional sense. In order to get to the taxpayer information, the thieves were able to answer a slew of security questions — \" out of wallet \" information they likely gleaned elsewhere from sites such as faceook. \" so this isn't an example of hackers exploiting a system vulnerability as much as it is a s -----, costly reminder that weak security questions can be dangerous, \" writes kate knibbs at gizmodo.",

In a lengthy, visually stunning bbc article, jon manel explores the case of the man, whose identity remains a mystery six months on. There was no wallet; missing persons reports provided no clue; and every lead that has been chased down only serves to tinge the case with a deeper sense of mystery. The man's manner of death was strychnine poisoning ( presumed to be intentional ), which is \" very unusual, \" per a forensic toxicologist. The rat poison is banned in the uk, but still available in some countries, including pakistan. The empty glass container that held the poison was on the man's person, along with a cardboard box with writing in english and urdu. The writing referenced the container's original contents, thyroxine sodium, and authorities were able to confirm the thyroid drug had been manufactured in pakistan. It's one of two links to the country: an autopsy found that that a serious injury to the man's left leg was repaired with a titanium plate exclusively used by a dozen hospitals in pakistan. The lead detective on the case tells the guardian there have been perhaps 1,750 left-leg surgeries done on male patients in the country using the plate. The man had train tickets — including an unused return to london — on him, and authorities have been able to trace his journey from central london to manchester with the help of surveillance footage. But the information has done little to aid the case. Read the whole fascinating story here. ( the identity of this man who killed himself in 2001 remains a mystery. )",

In fact, one in five people quit smoking if the price of a pack jumps by $ 1, researchers report in the journal epidemiology. They looked at the smoking habits of 632 smokers with an average age of 58 and analyzed data about local laws on smoking indoors and in public places, as well as price fluctuations at nearly 900 chain stores in 19 states, reports the new york times. The impact of price on older smokers is telling, the lead researcher says, since older smokers are likely to be set in their habit. But, \" it's likely that these results would hold in younger people as well — some studies have found them to be even more sensitive to price increases. \" \" our finding... Suggests that cigarette taxes may be a particularly effective lever for behavior change, \" she tells drexel now. Researchers note that only 7 % of people who smoke heavily ( more than half a pack a day ) quit when the price jumped, but they did smoke 35 % fewer cigarettes each day. Smoking bans didn't have the same effect, probably because people can just smoke in another place, the researchers posit. Meanwhile, reuters reports that a new study by the world health organization and national cancer institute finds that smoking costs the global economy $ 1 trillion a year, well over the $ 296 billion collected in tobacco taxes.

The 76-year-old jesuit is the son of italian immigrants who has spent nearly his entire life in argentina. He is known as conservative on most church issues — staunchly opposing gay marriage, for example. But the most common element emerging in profiles ( aside from the fact that he has one lung ) is his humility. Samples: he is \" a humble man who denied himself the luxuries that previous buenos aires cardinals enjoyed, \" reports ap. He \" often rode the bus to work, cooked his own meals and regularly visited the slums that ring argentina's capital. He considers social outreach, rather than doctrinal battles, to be the essential business of the church. \" he \" is the choice of humility, a jesuit intellectual who travels by bus and has a practical approach to poverty, \" reports the guardian. \" when he was appointed a cardinal, bergoglio persuaded hundreds of argentinians not to fly to rome to celebrate with him but instead to give the money they would have spent on plane tickets to the poor. \" the newspaper notes that while he opposes gay marriage, he is more lenient about contraception. \" since 1998, he has been archbishop of buenos aires, where his style is low-key and close to the people, \" reports the catholic news service. \" he rides the bus, visits the poor, lives in a simple apartment and cooks his own meals. To many in buenos aires, he is known simply as ' father jorge.

Subhash paul of india was being assisted overnight sunday by sherpa guides during a descent when he died of altitude sickness, the ap reports. Dutch climber eric arnold passed away friday of the same malady, while australia's maria strydom succumbed to it on saturday. A 25-year-old sherpa was the first to die this climbing season: phurba sherpa fell to his death thursday while trying to prep a route for climbers just 150 feet from the top, cnn reports. Two other indian climbers remain missing, and dozens are suffering from frostbite or signs of altitude sickness. \" this was a man-made disaster that may have been minimized with better management of the teams, \" the president of the nepal mountaineering association tells the ap, noting that too many people on the mountain may have led to logjams that contributed to the deaths. The washington post covers strydom's ambition with her husband, robert gropel, both on a mission to ascend the \" seven summits. \" the couple had faced criticism for being hard-core climbers adhering to a strict vegan diet, which some say could lead to protein and iron deficiencies. \" it seems that people have this warped idea of vegans being malnourished and weak, \" strydom said in a march interview with monash business school, where she taught. \" by climbing the seven summits we want to prove that vegans can do anything and more. \" strydom also made reference to the same issues the nma president noted, saying even though she felt ready for everest, \" we've all heard stories of frostbite and having to turn around from excessive waiting times due to inexperienced people blocking routes. This can lead to life-threatening situations and death. \" meanwhile, per the sydney morning herald, strydom's sister says her family is angry about what they say is a lack of official communication ( and condolences ) from the expedition group.

            "Two former blackwater worldwide employees say the security company repeatedly billed the u.s. Government for excessive or inappropriate expenses, including a prostitute for workers in afghanistan and strippers in the aftermath of hurricane katrina. In a federal lawsuit filed in virginia, brad and melan davis say blackwater officials also deceived the government by double-billing for travel costs and creating false invoices. They say the u.s. Government \" has been damaged in the amount of many millions of dollars in funds. \" brad davis also claims he witnessed acts of excessive force by company workers in iraq. A federal law enforcement official told the associated press that federal authorities in virginia were investigating whether blackwater had overbilled for its state department work. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Blackwater or its workers have also faced federal probes for shootings in iraq and afghanistan and accusations of arms smuggling.

In one of the more serious points, the ft argues that piketty got his data on europe all wrong and that the corrected numbers \" do not show any tendency towards rising wealth inequality after 1970. \" if this proves to be true, it \" would significantly undermine the case mr. Piketty mounts, \" writes the new york times ' neil irwin. In a response, piketty says he welcomes the scrutiny but stands by his conclusions. Slate notes that it will take a while to suss out the newspaper's arguments, but \" given that piketty's book is seeking to make universal claims about the nature of capitalism, he's going to need to provide a more detailed rebuttal. \"",

Each would be about 1,000 feet high, 150 feet wide, and up to 100 miles long, ranging from north dakota to texas, the bbc reports. Tao unveiled the $ 16 billion plan at a meeting of physicists last week, saying the walls could be \" attractively \" designed — possibly out of glass.

As there is no mountain in tornado alley ranging from west to east to weaken or block such air flows, some encounters are violent, creating instability: the strong wind changes direction and increases in speed and height. As a result, it creates a supercell, violent vortex, an invisible horizontal spinning motion in the lower atmosphere.

As there is no mountain in tornado alley ranging from west to east to weaken or block such air flows, some encounters are violent, creating instability: the strong wind changes direction and increases in speed and height. As a result, it creates a supercell, violent vortex, an invisible horizontal spinning motion in the lower atmosphere. When the rising air tilts the spinning air from horizontal to vertical, tornadoes with radii of miles are formed and cause tremendous damage. Here we show",
            "Image copyright afp image caption more than 800 tornadoes were recorded in the us last year building three \" great walls \" across tornado alley in the us could eliminate the disasters, a physicist says. The barriers - 300m ( 980ft ) high and up to 100 miles long - would act like hill ranges, softening winds before twisters can form. They would cost $ 16bn ( £ 9.6bn ) to build but save billions of dollars of damage each year, said prof rongjia tao, of temple university, philadelphia. He unveiled his idea at the american physical society meeting in denver. However critics say the idea is unworkable, and would create more problems than it solves. Threat over ' forever ' every year hundreds of twisters tear through communities in the great north-south corridor between the rocky and appalachian mountain ranges. We may not have east-west mountain ranges - like the alps in europe - we can build walls prof rongjia tao, temple university, philadelphia the proposed walls would not shelter towns - they would not be strong enough to block a tornado in motion. Instead, they would soften the clashing streams of hot southern and cold northern air, which form twisters in the first place, prof tao said. \" if we build three east-west great walls, one in north dakota, one along the border between kansas and oklahoma"

But as the new york times puts it, she led a \" fairy-tale life. \" born deborah vivien freeman-mitford in 1920, she was the youngest and perhaps the quietest of several controversial children. Adolf hitler and joseph goebbels witnessed sister diana marry britain's fascist leader, oswald mosley; sister unity was obsessed with the nazi leader — \" like a belieber, but for hitler, \" as jezebel puts it — and took a teenage deborah for tea with him before attempting suicide. The bbc reports that after also rubbing elbows with winston churchill and john f. Kennedy, deborah later said both had \" tremendous charisma.... But hitler didn't — not to me anyway. \" at 21, deborah married andrew cavendish, the second son of the duke of devonshire. She became a duchess accidentally after the first son and heir — who was married to jfk's sister — died in world war ii. The couple inherited money, an irish castle, and the 35,000-acre chatsworth estate, which included a difficult-to-maintain 300-room mansion. Deborah eventually turned it into one of britain's most popular rural tourist sites and a self-sustaining business. She would greet and direct tourists through the place herself and even fed her own chickens. She also wrote numerous books, including the 2010 memoir wait for me!, and kept a collection of elvis memorabilia. Her son, peregrine, has taken on the title of duke of devonshire.",

Now the private highgate school in north london is considering a plan that would allow boys to do just that, reports the bbc, by transitioning its current uniform policy to a gender-neutral, mix-and-match approach. Boys currently have more limited options, as girls are permitted to wear gray pleated skirts or pants, as well as dark blue jackets and ties. \" we are asking them, should it be called uniform number one and uniform number two? \" says school head adam pettitt. The plan is taking some heat from former students, notes the bbc, who pettitt says are complaining about \" promoting the wrong ideas. \" the school says the issue has come up because more and more students are questioning their identities, as well as the traditionally binary view of gender. Pettitt says that \" absolutely no young people \" were raising the issue in years past, and it \" seems inconceivable that these sorts of questions simply didn't exist. \" he adds that \" it must be a good thing \" if they \" feel happier and more secure in who they are. \" the school currently requires boys to be at least 16 to wear earrings, reports the telegraph, but it does allow one boy to wear a dress to school as well as all students to request to be addressed by a name of the opposite gender. Meanwhile, brighton college has replaced its 170-year-old uniform with a gender-neutral one. ( there's a transgender doll now, too. )",
