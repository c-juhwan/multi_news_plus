A historian is making the case that the most reviled dictator in history first tried to join the german socialist party but was rejected, the guardian reports. If the german socialists, another far-right party, had taken him, hitler may have settled for a more minor role in the party, which was larger than the nazis, argues thomas weber. Since hitler hadn't previously \" shown any leadership qualities and had been happy to follow orders, \" weber says he may not have ever risen to prominence. \" the nazi party would have been absorbed by the german socialist party and thus would have disappeared and history would have taken a different path, \" weber tells the guardian. If that happened, it's unlikely there would have been world war ii or the holocaust, weber tells the independent. Weber, of the university of aberdeen, found an overlooked document from 1919 in a munich archive showing the german socialist party told hitler not only that he wasn't welcome as a member, but that he couldn't write for the party paper. Hitler went on to join the nazis, and became its leader two years later, and the german socialist party was soon dissolved. Weber writes in in his upcoming book that the \" erratic doings of a prima donna \" attributed to hitler belied a \" skillful and conniving political operator \" who \" kept a lifelong vengeance \" against his enemies. So why did the german socialist party spurn hitler? weber tells the independent that perhaps \" it had something to do with the fact hitler was opinionated and they did not want to have someone there who was telling them what to do. \" ( the dutch red cross admits a \" painful \" wwii truth. )",

            "Artist kyle mcdonald installed a program on computers in two new york apple store locations that automatically takes a photo every minute. Now his personal computers have been confiscated by the u.s. Secret service. Mcdonald's intention was to capture people's expressions as they stare at computers, a subject he had first explored in a recording he made of his own computer time over two days using the same program. \" i thought maybe we could see ourselves doing this we would think more about our computers and how we're using them, \" he says. On three days in june, the program documented people staring at computers in apple stores. Since the stores wiped their computers every night, mcdonald had to go back in and reinstall the program each day he took photos. He uploaded a collection of the photos to a tumblr blog, and last sunday he set up \" an exhibition \" at the apple stores. During the unauthorized event at the apple stores on west 14th street and in soho, when people looked at an apple store machine, they saw a picture of themselves. Then they saw photos of other people staring at computers. Amazingly, nobody made a fuss. \" we have this expression on our face [ when we use computers ] that basically says that we're not interacting with anybody, we're interacting with the machine, \" the 25-year-old brooklyn resident says. \" even if there are a lot of people in the room at the apple store, you're not interacting with them.

That's a lot of network traffic, and he learned that apple monitors traffic in its stores when he received a photo from a cupertino computer of what appeared to be an apple technician. The technician had apparently traced the traffic to the site mcdonald used to upload the program to apple store computers — and installed it himself. Mcdonald figured that apple had decided the program wasn't a big deal. That was until four secret service men in suits woke him up on thursday morning with a search warrant for computer fraud.

The change, part of the company's new ww freestyle program, will make it easier for dieters to eat well, which will, ideally, attract new people to the company and former dieters to come back. \" it will attract weight watchers members that see this and say,'this looks like something i want to come back to, ' \" said company ceo mindy grossman. But weight watchers officials say the larger zero-point list isn't just about profitability; it also reflects changes in the way dietitians are looking at healthy food, business insider reports. \" these foods get picked for a reason, \" says gary foster, weight watchers ' chief scientific officer. For example, new studies show that eggs don't necessarily lead to increased cholesterol levels, the way we once thought they did. Hence the arrival of the breakfast favorite on the no-points list, right next to celery and kale.",

        "summary": "New year's eve culminates in a circus of drunk drivers and pedestrians going home after a night of merry-making — and experts say drunk pedestrians are eight times more likely to be killed on the way than drunk drivers. New year's day is the most dangerous day to be on foot, studies have shown; you're 1.7 times more likely to be killed while walking on new year's day than any regular day, reports mother jones. ( not surprisingly: almost half of the fatal accidents take place during the wee hours, and 58 % of the pedestrians killed are intoxicated. ) drunk driving is a well-known danger, but \" the risks associated with drinking and walking aren't as clear to the average person, \" says one highway safety researcher. Half of 2012's fatal new year's eve crashes involved alcohol — and in those, 34 % of the walkers were drunk versus 14 % of the drivers. The reason is simple — drunk people often cross against a sign, jaywalk, or even lie down in the road. So what can america's cities do about it? lower speed limits and brighter street lights help, and some big cities are moving in that direction. We also need more observant bartenders willing to cut off tipsy customers, experts say. Even automotive technology is trying to curb the stats with a camera that slams your brakes if a pedestrian is in the way. But until then, new year's eve partiers will have to help themselves — by wearing bright clothes, sticking close to sober buddies, and staying in groups. You could also take uber, of course, but silicon beat warns that the ride-sharing company will be charging much higher rates than usual — if you need a ride during the prime period between 12: 30am and 2: 30am, don't be surprised if you're charged a minimum of four to five times the typical rate. Last year in pennsylvania, a twitter user claimed a 4.85-mile ride cost $ 265. ( these are the drunkest days of the year. )",

            "By heather somerville / december 29, 2014 at 4: 04 pm how much is your new year's worth? if you're taking an uber, be sure to add couple hundred dollars to that price. Uber spelled out its plans for surge pricing on new year's eve during a call with reporters monday morning. The uptake: uber will be jacking up prices, a lot, and they say it's not their fault if a passenger wakes up new year's morning with an uber credit card receipt equal to a monthly car payment. Passengers have to agree to surge pricing before they get in the car. So folks, read your app. Passengers are alerted to the price increase when they order an uber, and before an order can be confirmed, passengers must agree to it by typing in the app the amount of the surge, a spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman said uber riders can also get a fare estimate before they request the ride. If a passenger doesn't want to pay prime-time pricing, they can sign up for a text alert that will notify them when surge pricing has ended. Which will be long after the champagne toast and rounds of auld lang syne. Uber expects to have the most demand between 12: 30 a.m. And 2: 30 a.m."

        "summary": "The good news: a pentagon-requested study on administrative waste turned up plenty of fodder for officials to work with in streamlining operations. The bad news: the study found so much internal waste — $ 125 billion worth — that pentagon officials seemingly tried to squash it, based on interviews and secret memos seen by the washington post. The report, issued in january 2015 by the defense business board, found what the post refers to as a \" bloated bureaucracy, \" with nearly a quarter of the defense budget used on overhead and administrative costs like hr and accounting. The study offered the dod a five-year plan to save that $ 125 billion ( including through attrition and maximizing its it capabilities ), at which point it appears enthusiasm for the report waned as pentagon brass worried future military funds would be cut if congress and the white house got wind of the results. The post details how the pentagon went into downplay mode, restricting the study's data and taking down a public summary. Deputy defense secretary robert work, the pentagon's no. 2 official, commissioned the report — even after one board member warned him \" you are about to turn on the light in a very dark room \" — but his stance shifted when the study was done. \" there is this meme that we're some bloated, giant organization, \" work told the post, noting the study \" vastly overstates what's really going on. \" he noted it's not easy to carry out some of the board's suggestions, including getting rid of federal jobs, though he says the pentagon will partly implement some of them to bring an estimated $ 30 billion in savings by 2020. \" we're the largest bureaucracy in the world, \" work said. \" there's going to be some inherent inefficiencies in that. \" ( read the post story for the behind-the-scenes infighting. )",

Minegishi explained she had decided to cut off her long hair immediately after seeing her photograph, her face hidden behind a surgical mask and a baseball cap, in the weekly tabloid shukan bunshun on thursday.

Those numbers are extrapolated from an insurance company's phone survey of 1,000 people and show an increase from 52 % last year. Apparently, employees are afraid of being replaced by someone with a better work ethic or dread the work that would pile up while they're away. One expert weighed in from her own vacation, telling the chicago tribune that america has a culture that makes it difficult to take time away from work for fear of being branded \" lazy. \" perhaps even more distressing, of those americans who do get away from work, yahoo reports 42 % feel guilty for relaxing on vacation and 54 % use their vacation time to go to the doctor, handle family issues, or deal with other obligations. Those numbers come from a yearly survey by princess cruises. Studies show americans simply don't take vacations even when employers let them: according to yahoo, us workers left $ 52.4 billion of vacation time on the table in 2013.

And that's even though, just a year earlier, boys and girls both associate brilliance with their own gender. \" it's really heartbreaking, \" lead author lin bian of the university of illinois tells the atlantic. The impact is immediate, she says, and the implications are far-reaching. Girls quickly become less inclined to choose games that are characterized as being for smart kids, as well as subjects linked to \" raw, innate talent, \" which in turn affects career hopes, she says in a new york university video published by the washington post. In the study, kids ages 5 to 7 were read a story about a \" really, really smart \" person, then were shown photos of men and women and asked to guess who the person was. The youngest kids were split, but the older ones mostly guessed it was a man. A second, similar experiment reaffirmed those results, reports the los angeles times. A psychologist not involved with the study theorizes that the changes set in after age 5 because that's when kids leave kindergarten and enter more formal schooling, where gender stereotypes might already be prevalent. Previous research has found that men and women, including parents, perpetuate them. For instance, the atlantic notes that the term \" is my son gifted? \" is googled 2.5 times more than \" is my daughter gifted? \" teachers and characters in literature and films can also play large roles, so some experts say that adults need to work harder to expose the accomplishments of smart women to girls and boys.

        "summary": "For those concerned that the latest iphone wasn't revolutionary enough, the latest apple patent application to make headlines would seem to indicate that tim cook and co. Are truly getting back to basics: it's made out of paper, has handles, and you can put stuff in it. Or, as apple puts it, via forbes: it's \" a retail paper bag, comprising: a bag container formed of white paper with at least 60 % post-consumer content. \" yes, apple is trying to patent a paper bag. Now, to be straight-faced about it, the guardian notes that it's a very nice paper bag, saying that, \" the innovation, in this case, is how apple intends to hold the bag together with such a high proportion of recycled material. \" it seems that the bleach involved in producing regular white paper bags out of recycled content leaves them fairly weak, so apple has added reinforcements and a sure-to-be delightful handle \" formed entirely of paper fibre yarn knitted in an 8-stitch circular knit pattern. \" that ' ll apparently make it feel extra soft to hold. That doesn't slow the guardian from bemoaning that \" sadly the patent application makes no mention of a headphone jack, \" and the like. Which inspires a full-throated defense of apple's elevation of the lowly paper bag over at the verge: \" apple clearly put a lot of thought into this! \" writes russell brandom, pointing out that the designers listed on the patent also brought us apple's magnetic charging system. \" so clearly they're throwing their best minds at the bag problem. And this bag, the result of that labor, is ( presumably ) the best and most intuitive bag apple has ever produced. What a joyous time into which we have been born! \" hallelujah. ( here's how that \" boring \" iphone 7 brought about samsung's \" explosive \" galaxy note 7. )",

It's even patented the sliding function to unlock the phone – deceased as of ios 10 – and the concept of a phone with a bezel and rounded edges. Now it's gone one step further, and applied to patent a paper bag. The patent application summarises the bag as follows: a paper bag is disclosed.

The innovation, in this case, is how apple intends to hold the bag together with such a high proportion of recycled material.

During his years in hiding, salem changed his appearance multiple times, even going so far as to get plastic surgery. His family would flee to a new place — new jersey, minnesota, tennessee, california, florida — every time salem feared his cover had been blown. He uses an app that notifies him, via cellphone, if anyone approaches the front door; he wears kevlar vests and carries multiple guns. Though he still uses an alias in his daily life, he's started giving interviews and has written a book — the first of two memoirs — in an effort to cash in on his former notoriety; currently, he has no job, no pension, and no home equity.

( ap photo/evan vucci ) ( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — house republicans would preserve the popular retirement account for middle-class americans while limiting a cherished deduction for homeowners in a sweeping tax cut plan unveiled thursday that would add $ 1.5 trillion to the nation's debt.

Tax code in three decades, a plan that would sharply cut tax rates for corporations and individuals while eliminating many popular deductions that americans have long enjoyed. At its core, the legislation would deliver the kind of tax relief to companies — $ 1 trillion over 10 years — that republicans say will spark economic growth and encourage businesses to create more jobs and invest heavily in the united states. Far less clear is the bill's impact on middle- and working-class households. The trade-off between reducing tax rates but curtailing deductions — such as the amount that homeowners can write off for their mortgage interest payments — means the impact will vary widely from one family to another. Many americans who need to take out big loans to buy homes in expensive areas such as new york, boston and san francisco could see their taxes go up. The washington region would be a prime example of the trade-offs. High salaries here at lower tax rates would deliver savings off internal revenue service bills.

Kodak is a printing company these days, but it's got a new use for silver: making clothing that doesn't get smelly. Even after it's worn \" for days and days and days … it won't smell, \" says terry taber, the company's chief tech officer. Silver is known for its anti-microbial properties and can kill germs and bacteria, usa today explains. In fact, \" there are stories of people centuries ago taking silver coins and putting them on cuts, \" taber notes. Kodak is now the exclusive provider of the compound silver sulfate to textile company purthread technologies. The north carolina company incorporates the compound into its synthetic fibers, with the goal of preventing not only bad smells but also discoloration caused by microbes that eat sweat. And it apparently works: one of the chemists who worked on the project tells wham he wore a shirt for two weeks without washing it, and it \" never stunk. \" purthread makes personal wear, but it's also focused on markets where the stakes are higher: it currently offers anti-microbial scrubs and lab coats for the medical world, and it plans to work with kodak to develop solutions for the military, too, it says in a press release.

        "summary": "Sitting in restaurants or movie theaters all alone isn't nearly as depressing as you might think — in fact, researchers say, you ' ll actually like it. They decided this after surveying people about whether they preferred to engage in certain activities alone or with others, and then studying subjects'reactions to either a solo or a group outing at an art gallery, the washington post reports. Set to be published this summer, the study found that people didn't expect to get much enjoyment out of a solo gallery outing, but actually ended up enjoying it just as much as those who went with friends. So why do most of us dread going out alone? \" the reason is we think we won't have fun because we're worried about what other people will think, \" says study co-author rebecca ratner. \" we end up staying at home instead of going out to do stuff because we're afraid others will think they're a loser. \" and that, she says, is hard on people in an era when we marry later in life, work more often, and have less time to kick around. It also translates into lonely nights at home when people could be out enjoying themselves and giving a boost to local businesses, she tells new york. That self-conscious feeling we get when going out alone has a name in psychology — the spotlight effect — and a 2000 study found that people tend to adjust their actions so they won't be perceived poorly, even though others rarely notice.

Both crossings were in anbar province, which is now believed to be 90 % controlled by militants.

A state department official says kerry will talk to leaders about forming a new, inclusive, government \" in line with the constitutional timeline that they're on. \" as iraq's military stages what it calls a \" tactical retreat \" from more towns and border crossings, western officials are starting to consider the country's military highly ineffective and possibly even a \" defeated force, \" the new york times reports. Analysts say the military's morale is low, its leadership is corrupt, and the situation is now so desperate that it now has to rely on thousands of untrained volunteers.

Five standout pairs: julia roberts and nick nolte's 1994 romantic comedy i love trouble was spark-free, and perhaps that's because they worked together so poorly they reportedly had to shoot their scenes separately. Afterward, roberts called nolte \" completely disgusting \" and he called her \" not a nice person. \" bill murray starred in the first charlie's angels movie, and reportedly had a bit of a hissy fit on set, interrupting a scene to ask lucy liu, \" what in the [ bleep ] are you doing here. You can't act! \" liu reportedly tried to attack him as the two screamed at each other, and murray refused to come back for the sequel. While filming terms of endearment, shirley maclaine was reportedly upset with debra winger's behavior, said to be tied to substance abuse. At one point winger allegedly farted in maclaine's direction on purpose. Even in 2008, winger confirmed she's still no fan of maclaine. Ok, this one is just sad: apparently there's no love lost between star trek co-stars william shatner and george takei. Shatner once complained about being the only trek cast member not invited to takei's wedding, and takei more recently called shatner \" the biggest douche. \" so there's this very interesting rumor having to do with richard gere and a gerbil, and gere has reportedly accused sylvester stallone of starting it. It seems when they co-starred in the lords of flatbush, they did not get along — to the point of fistfights and gere allegedly pouring chicken grease on stallone — and stallone reportedly got gere replaced.

        "summary": "An apple a day can keep the doctor away, but that's nothing compared to what it can do for primates, at least according to a study published monday in nature ecology &amp; evolution. Scientists have long hypothesized that primates evolved large brains because they needed them for complex social interactions, the guardian reports. But researchers behind the new study say big brains may have actually evolved because of eating fruit. Researchers looked at 140 primate species and found no evidence of a link between brain size and complexity of social behavior. They did, however, find a link between diet and brain size. Specifically, primates that ate fruit had about 25 % more brain tissue than primates of a similar size that ate leaves. The idea is that fruit contains more nutrients and provides more energy than leaves, helping brains to grow. However, it could also be that it takes a lot more mental power to eat fruit ( finding it, determining ripeness, opening it, etc. ) than simply picking some leaves off a nearby tree. Npr reports this might be why spider monkeys have bigger brains than howler monkeys, which are similar in size and live in similar social groups in the same area: while howler monkeys are sitting around eating leaves, spider monkeys are foraging for fruit. Other researchers aren't so sure. One expert points out that while fruit may provide more energy for growing brains, something else is needed to explain why that energy is used for brain growth, according to science magazine.

The rio grande rise seabed, located more than 600 miles southeast of rio de janeiro and 3,000 feet underwater, contains a granite cliff, researchers found. \" you don't find granite on the seabed, \" says a brazilian geology official. That's because it only forms on land, the japan times notes — as does quartz, which was also spotted near the seabed. \" this could be the brazilian atlantis, \" says a brazilian official, per afp via globalpost. He continued, \" if it is the case that we find a continent in the middle of the ocean, it will be a very big discovery that could have various implications in relation to the extension of the continental shelf. \" samples of the granite will be recovered later this year; that might allow scientists to determine if it matches rock from africa or south america.",

        "summary": "The dead chinese space lab that's been crashing to earth since at least 2016 is projected to finally smash through the atmosphere and into land ( or sea ) sometime sunday night. Per npr, the european space agency believes that what remains of tiangong-1 after its burn up during re-entry will make landfall in a 4-hour window around 9pm est. While the timeline for re-entry has tightened, experts are still unable to say exactly where the debris will land, or even close to where. Based on tiangong 1's orbit, it will come to earth between latitudes of 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south, or roughly somewhere over most of the us, china, africa, southern europe, australia, and south america. Based on its size, only about 10 % of the spacecraft will likely survive being burned up on re-entry, mainly heavier components such as its engines. So, fret not. The chances of anyone on earth being hit by debris are considered less than one in a trillion. However, that doesn't explain exactly why scientists are unable to say where tiangong-1 will hit. According to live science, the variable density of earth's atmosphere is partially to blame for the uncertainty. Another variable: tiangong-1's orientation. Depending on the space lab's alignment, drag could cause it to fall faster or more slowly. For the armchair astronomers out there, there are several websites tracking the re-entry, including aerospace.org. Scientists say the re-entry window will narrow as tiangong-1 descends closer to earth.",

        "summary": "President trump owes at least $ 315.6 million to various lenders — including at least $ 130 million to a division of germany's deutsche bank and at least $ 110 million to a commercial real estate lender — according to a federal financial disclosure form released friday by the us office of government ethics. Reuters reports the form covers 2016 and the first few months of 2017. Trump reported income of at least $ 594 million — including about $ 20 million from his new hotel in dc — and assets worth at least $ 1.4 billion ( and it's likely much more ). The biggest chunk of his income came from his trump national doral golf resort in miami. Here's what else you need to know about trump's financial disclosure: the los angeles times highlights how complex trump's disclosure is: 98 pages listing 565 separate roles the president holds or held in llcs, corporations, and more, along with hundreds of different income sources and assets. For comparison, president obama's 2016 financial disclosure form was just eight pages. The disclosure form is evidence trump is \" profiting off the presidency, \" according to thinkprogress. Royalties for his books and profits at properties he frequently visits as president have skyrocketed. The art of the deal royalties increased from $ 100,000 to $ 1 million, and mar-a-lago alone has seen profits jump by millions. But the new york times reports not all of trump's income sources have gotten a boost from the presidency. Revenue was down 12 % at trump national doral — his biggest income source — and about 3 % overall. Deadline picks out how trump is doing in show business, with the disclosure form showing more than $ 84,000 from his screen actors guild pension, more than $ 1.1 million from trump productions, and nearly $ 11 million from miss universe. And forward explains one of the odder nuggets in the disclosure: kosher potato vodka sold in israel for passover. Finally, chris cillizzza at cnn argues this doesn't mean we don't need to see trump's tax returns. The financial disclosure form only gives a range for assets and liabilities — meaning it's hard to get an accurate idea of them — and doesn't include what trump paid in taxes, his holdings in foreign companies, or what he donated to charity.",

Today, prime minister mariano rajoy said the referendum, at odds with the country's constitution, couldn't be held, the new york times reports.

Protests in the region could continue, and catalan president artur mas could even hold the vote against the court's wishes; that \" would be a real earthquake for the eu, forcing other europeans to enter uncharted waters and take sides in a national dispute that has no precedent, \" says a researcher. But \" the most probable scenario \" is early elections in the region, an expert tells the journal — and they could usher in a catalan ruling party that backs independence even more than the current convergence and union coalition.

Responding to a decree signed on saturday by catalonia's leader authorizing an independence vote on nov. 9, prime minister mariano rajoy of spain declared on monday that the vote would not go ahead because it violates spain's constitution and would be rejected by the constitutional court. The standoff raised the prospect that catalans might seek to go ahead with the referendum even in the face of opposition from the central government, creating a deep split within spain, encouraging other separatists in europe — including those in spain's basque region — and leaving mr. Rajoy with a volatile political challenge. Later on monday, spain's constitutional court voted in a special session to suspend the catalan decree pending a final ruling on its validity. Mr. Rajoy's firm stance could leave him \"being legally right but still facing a growing problem of legitimacy that won't be removed unless the question of catalonia's future and sovereignty gets somehow addressed, \" said josé ignacio torreblanca, head of the spanish office of the european council on foreign relations, a research group.

Henry waxman praised the bp boss for setting up a $ 20 billion clean-up fund, but then slammed him for his safety record. When hayward took his job he said he'd focus \"like a laser \" on safety, but \"there's not a single email or document that shows you paid the slightest attention to the dangers at this well. \" bart stupak and others read a string of documents, on the other hand, that indicated that hayward chose profits over safety. When hayward finally got the chance to speak, he struck a conciliatory tone. \"let me be very clear: i fully grasp the terrible reality of the situation, \" he said, in prepared remarks reported in the wall street journal, touting the millions bp has spent so far on cleanup. His remarks were interrupted by a protester, who stood up, hands and face smeared with a black substance, and screamed, \" you need to be charged with a crime. You need to go to jail. \" she was wrestled to the ground by police, and according to the guardian, appeared to be hurt in the process. Other protesters confronted hayward with signs reading \" bp kills. \"",

In a now-viral july 30 facebook post, a woman named therra detailed how she'd been down on her luck and feeling \" like a loser, \" getting hit with unexpected expenses and losing sleep over it. A friend sent her a gift card to whole foods, though, and so therra went shopping \" with a relief i haven't felt all month. \" but it was at the register when the real relief came: the man in front of her on line offered to pay her entire $ 375 grocery bill, and when therra asked him his name, he simply said, \" chris \" and walked away. It was then that the cashier informed therra who had picked up the tab for her. \" you know that's ludacris, right? \" the cashier said. After therra's story spread, the new york times started looking further into it, wondering if therra ( fully ided as therra jaramillo ) had stolen details for her story from a twitter post in may. Instead, the paper found more than 100 posts online detailing how ludacris ( real name: chris bridges ) had paid for people's groceries not only in whole foods, but also in publix, costco, and other venues across the country and in canada, stretching back years. Ludacris ' manager, chaka zulu, confirms to the times his client has indeed done such good deeds, noting, \" luda does these things all the time. But he doesn't want to do interviews to highlight it. It's just his heart. \" meanwhile, jaramillo has since raised more than $ 1,200 for the ludacris foundation, which helps urban youth, to pay back her supermarket hero. \" be like ludacris y ' all, \" jaramillo wrote on facebook.",

No, wait, this particular russian sailor downed half a liter of rum, got behind the controls of a 7,000-ton ship, and proceeded at full speed to plow it directly into a tough-to-spot little rock we like to call scotland, reports cnn in what sounds more like a bar story than a news story. Such was the plight of the lysblink seaways when it ran aground on feb. 18 in western scotland's ardnamurchan peninsula, the uk's marine accident investigation branch found in a report last week. Bad weather further drove the ship aground, damaging the hull, spilling 25 tons of marine gas oil, and resulting in it being declared an utter loss. The 36-year-old officer in question — who's been relieved of his duties — became \" inattentive... Due to the effects of alcohol consumption, \" per the report. Further, despite a ship-wide ban on alcohol, the officer was found after the accident to have a blood-alcohol content almost eight times the legal limit — a feat facilitated by the presence of an on-board store that the report says \" was regularly replenished, and empty beer, wine and spirit bottles and cartons found on board after the accident indicated significant levels of alcohol consumption by the crew. \" and finally, \" although a radar watch alarm had sounded every 6 minutes, the somnolent officer was able to reset the alarm without leaving his chair, \" the report says, via the independent.",

For the first time, did all the different wikis. The original runs were just against the enwiki. This one, the seed list was built from all 865 collections."

Gary ross dahl, the man who made millions of dollars selling the novelty \" pets \" in the 1970s — and caused millions of people to say, \" i could have thought of that \" — has died at the age of 78. According to a new york times obituary, dahl was a freelance copywriter living in a small cabin in los gatos, calif., when he thought up the idea in a bar in 1975 and quickly became a millionaire. In a matter of months, he sold 1.5 million of the rocks, which came in a carrying case complete with a guide to feeding and training. The cash dried up as the fad faded and imitators sprang up, but dahl had made enough to buy a mercedes, a big new house, and a saloon, the times reports. Dahl, who grew up in spokane, wash., didn't replicate the success of pet rocks with later ideas and ended up returning to advertising work, writing advertising for dummies in 2001. The pet rock craze \" was great fun when it happened, \" his wife tells the ap. But in the following years, \" people would come to him with weird ideas, expecting him to do for them what he had done for himself. And a lot of times they were really, really stupid ideas. \" she says dahl, who died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, loved to sail in san francisco bay and she ' ll scatter his ashes there.

Changing that policy spared an estimated 120 drug users from hiv infection over a two-year period, per a study by george washington university published today in aids and behavior. The change came in late 2007, and usa today reports that the needle exchange's initial two-year period cost the city's health department $ 1.3 million. But the avoided cases saved far more than that: a lifetime of hiv treatment for 120 people works out to $ 45.6 million, for a net savings of $ 44.3 million, per the researchers, who point out that \" many injection drug users are covered by publicly funded health plans. \" how lead author monica ruiz sees it: \" our study adds to the evidence that needle exchange programs not only work but are cost-effective investments in the battle against hiv. \" in addition to allowing users to swap used syringes for fresh ones, the dc program offered free hiv tests and condoms. While the programs are gaining support across the country ( by usa today's count there are about 220 of them nationwide ), they are not without their opponents. \" my fundamental concern is that many of the needle exchanges aren't going after the core problem, which is drug abuse, \" says the chair of the institute on global drug policy.

        "summary": "The \" stolen babies \" mystery uncovered by the touching reunion of zella jackson price and her long-lost daughter keeps getting murkier. Price says she was told by a nurse at homer g. Phillips hospital in st. Louis that her daughter died soon after birth in 1965, but adoption records cited in a letter obtained by the ap contradict key parts of her account, stating that the baby girl was born at a different hospital — and price abandoned her. Her lawyer, albert watkins, says the \" glaring inconsistencies \" in the record suggest that there has been a cover-up and add evidence to the theory that the hospital stole and sold price's baby. He tells the st. Louis post-dispatch that the letter lists city hospital no. 1, which mainly dealt with white patients, and price has told him that she wouldn't even drive into that part of town during the segregated mid-1960s. Price says the letter contains many other mistakes, including her age and information about what it calls the \" putative biological father. \" as for the claim she abandoned the girl: \" that's the biggest lie ever told, \" price tells the ap. \" i have five other children. They're all spoiled like they were only children. Why would i give up this one? \" watkins, who suspects the records may have been falsified as part of a scheme to steal price's baby and possibly many more, is trying to obtain more records, although state privacy laws about adoptions are proving to be an obstacle, the post-dispatch reports. And he's not the only one seeking information: a city health department spokesman tells the ap that 282 women have requested medical records since st. Louis police began their investigation.

The bbc notes that, in theory, musudan missiles have a range of 2,500 miles — far enough to touch down in the us territory of guam. And while many of north korea's claims are usually dismissed as hyperbole or outright fabrication — and four previous missile launches this year failed — the second missile flew a confirmed 250 miles. That missile, the new york times points out, also reached a record altitude for north korea at what the country reported was 878 miles ( other sources, however, say 620 miles ). A scientist with california's middlebury institute of international studies says the second missile appeared to have been launched purposely with a high angle so it wouldn't reach japan. \" had it been fired at its normal angle, it would have flown to its full range, \" he notes, adding to the wall street journal that, \" if we do nothing, they will move on to a missile … that can reach the us. \" the times and journal also explain that the sharp trajectory allowed for the testing of technology that makes a nuclear warhead resistant to heat when \" breaching the earth's atmosphere. \"",

The trial could begin within weeks. Jury selection — interrupted by a competency hearing regarding a new psychiatric evaluation of roof — resumed monday. Twenty prospective jurors will be questioned daily from a pool of 512 until 70 remain. That number will then be whittled down to 12 jurors and six alternates.

        "summary": "A less ordinary ruling out of europe on tuesday: the continent's court of human rights found that three portuguese judges erred in deciding that sex is less important for older women, reports the ap. The case involves maria morais, a then-50-year-old who in 1995 underwent a gynecological surgery after being diagnosed with a vaginal disease called bartholinitis; a nerve was damaged during the procedure, and it left her not just incontinent and struggling to even sit and walk but unable to have sex, reports the new york times. The hospital was in 2013 ordered to pay the mother of two 80,000 euros ( currently about $ 93,000 ) for her physical and mental woes, but a year later portugal's supreme administrative court cut that to 50,000 euros, with the lisbon judges saying she was of an age where sexuality wasn't so important, per a court press release. The european court of human rights came down on morais'side 5-2 in her case against portugal, and ordered the country to pay morais 5,710 euros in damages and expenses. Part of the ruling: \" the question at issue here is not considerations of age or sex as such, but rather the assumption that sexuality is not as important for a 50-year-old woman and mother of two children as for someone of a younger age. That assumption reflects a traditional idea of female sexuality as being essentially linked to childbearing purposes and thus ignores its physical and psychological relevance for the self-fulfillment of women as people. \" the times reports morais, now 72, plans to pursue her case once more in portugal with the goal of being awarded greater damages.

They're not providing precise details on how they arrived at the conclusion just yet, but they say the numbers, including 717171634, refer to army units that rackstraw served in during the war, reports the seattle post-intelligencer.

Rackstraw is a former army paratrooper, one of the many reasons colbert's team has long focused on him. In the 1971 letter, the hijacker says he used face putty to disguise himself, which could explain why rackstraw, who was in his 20s at the time, could have resembled the middle-aged hijacker depicted in the famous artist's sketch of cooper.",

Since then, scientists have detected only 30 of them, generally believed to be caused by colliding black holes or other cataclysmic events, per popular science. Frb 121102, however, is a curious anomaly. Traced to a dwarf galaxy some 3 billion light years away, frb 121102 was detected in 2012 and again in 2015, making it the only frb known to repeat. And now scientists say it's emitting bursts again. Using a radio telescope in west virginia on saturday, uc berkeley researchers detected 15 new pulses from frb 121102 at a much higher frequency than ever before. \" as the source is going into another active state [ that ] means that the origin models associated with some sort of cataclysmic events are less likely to be the case of frb 121102, \" researcher vishal gajjar tells cnet. Could the bursts have come from aliens and their spacecraft? that's a \" less popular theory, \" as cbc news puts it, with popular science going into greater detail on \" possible explanations for the repeating burst... Most of them are definitely not aliens. \" here's one: that the bursts came from an energetic neutron star. A statement on the find gives some perspective: \" regardless of frb 121102's ultimate source, when the recently detected pulses left their host galaxy... Life on earth consisted only of single-celled organisms. \" ( read about the discovery of repeating frbs here. )",

There is also a man — the campsite's owner — who has stepped forward to lay claim to the money, and police are investigating his claim. But that man is rumored to be having marital problems, and a fire broke out last week at a house he owns. In a slightly different version, upi says \" there is suspicion \" that the money bag is linked to a fire at a cottage on the campsite property. The evidence \" come[ s ] together to suggest he was hiding his money from his wife up a tree, \" says gizmodo uk.

Blogger violet blue at zdnet, for example, calls scenetap a \" bro-app \" that will merely help \" bro-tards \" zero in on the bars \" with the most chicks in them, \" which is \" sure to make women feel a little more like hunted prey. \" a few bars backed out of the launch in san francisco after receiving complaints.

The app employs facial-detection software and cameras placed strategically in bars and nightclubs to tell users the age and gender makeup of an establishment they're thinking of visiting.

Some privacy advocates call it \" creepy. \" is it an invasion of privacy for your neighborhood watering hole to install cameras and scan your face? here, a brief guide to the controversy: how does the app work? the people behind scenetap have installed cameras in bars in san francisco; austin, texas; athens, ga.; bloomington, ind.; chicago; gainesville, fla.; and madison, wis. The cameras use facial-detection software, which unlike facial-recognition software, only picks up on basic data about people and can't specifically identify faces.

            "Using cameras installed in bars and facial-detection software, the new app scenetap scans the faces of patrons to determine age and gender makeups of crowds. Scenetap a new smartphone app called scenetap made a big splash with its recent launch, but not all of the reviews were entirely favorable. The app employs facial-detection software and cameras placed strategically in bars and nightclubs to tell users the age and gender makeup of an establishment they're thinking of visiting. The problem is that the patrons being scanned by cameras don't necessarily know that they're being monitored. Some privacy advocates call it \" creepy. \" is it an invasion of privacy for your neighborhood watering hole to install cameras and scan your face? here, a brief guide to the controversy: how does the app work? the people behind scenetap have installed cameras in bars in san francisco; austin, texas; athens, ga.; bloomington, ind.; chicago; gainesville, fla.; and madison, wis. The cameras use facial-detection software, which unlike facial-recognition software, only picks up on basic data about people and can't specifically identify faces. Scenetap uses this information to come up with a rundown of ages and sexes, so the app can give users real-time updates on which nightspots are full of women, or men, and how old or",
            "Summary: san francisco denizens are angry that facial-detection cameras placed in bars by nightlife startup app scenetap go live on friday. When locals heard that scenetap's facial detection cameras are going live in over a dozen san francisco bars this friday, the new startup received the opposite of a san francisco welcome. Scenetap was not met with a ritual roasters latte and welcome basket of organic olive oil, sourdough bread, bespoke vegan artisan cupcakes and a complimentary set of rainbow condoms.

A little bit of satisfaction and about $ 65,000 now belongs to chandana keerthi bandara, a former producer for the bbc's sri lankan news service who was fired after he opted to not cover the birth of prince william and kate middleton's first child when he came to work the day after the blessed event, prioritizing instead coverage of the 30th anniversary of sri lanka's black july. Told to publish something about the wee windsor child, bandara initially refused, then put something up about noon. That earned him disciplinary proceedings, a verdict of gross misconduct, and a final written warning, reports the telegraph. When another allegation was made a year later, bandara was sent packing after 18 years on the job. He sued the bbc for unfair dismissal and racial discrimination, and a tribunal has now found that that final written warning was unfair and contributed to his firing, though no racial discrimination occurred. \" the bbc takes disciplinary matters very seriously and we are disappointed with the outcome of this unfair dismissal claim, \" a rep tells the independent, which notes the rep \" could not specify why \" the bbc was disappointed.

            "A bbc journalist has secured a £ 50,000 payout for being sacked after prioritising a story about sri lanka over the birth of prince george. Chandana keerthi bandara, 57, lost his job as a producer on a bbc sri lankan news service in august 2014 and subsequently sued the bbc for unfair dismissal and race discrimination. The employment tribunal found that the dismissal of mr bandara, who had been a senior producer on the sinhala service since 2000 and worked at the bbc for a total of 18 years, was unfair but in no way discriminatory. The journalist had been allocated to oversee the publishing of stories on 23 july 2013, the day after prince george was born, but said he chose not to prioritise the royal birth story partially because it clashed with the 30th anniversary of black july – a wave of anti-tamil violence that led to thousands being killed in sri lanka. According to the telegraph, a tribunal was told mr bandara fought against management pressure to report on the story but finally gave in and the article was published online at 12.08pm. After disciplinary proceedings, he was found to have been guilty of gross misconduct and was given a final written warning.

The majority of these allegations were either proved or partially proved, but the tribunal ruled that the unfair final written warning, given for the dispute over the royal story, played a large part in the dismissal decision. Mr bandara claimed he was unfairly targeted because of his views on the tamil people being persecuted by the sinhalese-dominated government of sri lanka. A tribunal heard how chandana, who has a sinhalese father and tamil mother, worked with a team who were mainly of sinhalese heritage. Mr bandara was unsuccessful in his claims for race discrimination, but a tribunal found the final written warning was too severe a punishment, for an employee with such a good record, describing it as \" manifestly inappropriate \".

The head of the renovations team apparently panicked and called her husband — also on the team — who then used so much epoxy that it ran over and dried on the mask's left-hand side. To cover that snafu, workers tried to scrape it off and ended up scratching up the 3,300-year-old mask. The ap notes it reached three of the cairo museum's conservators by phone, and they're all giving different stories: they don't seem to agree on when the epoxy incident happened, and one says the beard was loose and purposely removed. What they do agree on — and all sources spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal — is that someone on high ordered a quick fix, and that the adhesive used was more damaging than helpful. \" unfortunately, he used a very irreversible material, \" one of the conservators said. \" epoxy has a very high property for attaching and is used on metal or stone, but...

            "Special counsel robert s. Mueller iii's team told president trump's lawyers recently that prosecutors do not believe they can charge a sitting president with a crime under justice department guidelines, trump lawyer rudolph w. Giuliani said wednesday. The special counsel's conclusion signals that it would be left to congress to address any finding of wrongdoing by trump in the investigation. Mueller's team is scrutinizing russian interference in the 2016 election, whether the russians coordinated with any trump associates and whether the president has sought to thwart the probe. Mueller indicated in a meeting a few weeks ago that he concurred with the view that a sitting president cannot be indicted under past legal opinions issued by the justice department, giuliani told the washington post. Giuliani said that mueller at first tried to be \"coy \" when giuliani asked the special counsel for his stance on the issue.

            "Special counsel robert s. Mueller iii's team told president trump's lawyers recently that prosecutors do not believe they can charge a sitting president with a crime under justice department guidelines, trump lawyer rudolph w. Giuliani said wednesday. The special counsel's conclusion signals that it would be left to congress to address any finding of wrongdoing by trump in the investigation. Mueller's team is scrutinizing russian interference in the 2016 election, whether the russians coordinated with any trump associates and whether the president has sought to thwart the probe. Mueller indicated in a meeting a few weeks ago that he concurred with the view that a sitting president cannot be indicted under past legal opinions issued by the justice department, giuliani told the washington post. Giuliani said that mueller at first tried to be \"coy \" when giuliani asked the special counsel for his stance on the issue.

They founded the jimmy ryce center for victims of predatory abduction, which promotes awareness of sexual predators and has given hundreds of bloodhounds to police departments around the country. Ryce said recently that the couple had worked to turn their son's horrific death into something positive instead of giving in to despair. \" you've got to do something or you do nothing, \" he said. \" that was just not the way we wanted to live the rest of our lives. \"",

The powerful rainstorm dumped more than a foot of rain overnight on columbia, swamping hundreds of businesses and homes. Emergency workers waded into waist-deep water to help people trapped in cars, dozens of boats fanned out to rescue others in flooded neighborhoods, and some were plucked from rooftops by helicopters. More door-to-door search operations are planned for monday. Gov. Nikki haley said more than 750 rescue calls were placed in a 12-hour-period on sunday, reports usa today. One death was reported in the area on sunday, bringing weather-related deaths to seven since the storm began days earlier. People were told to stay off roads and remain indoors until floodwaters recede, and an overnight curfew was issued for columbia and across two surrounding counties. With so much water, officials said it could take weeks or even months to assess every road and bridge that's been closed around the state. Several interstates around columbia are closed, and so is a 75-mile stretch of interstate 95 that is a key route connecting miami to washington, dc and new york. \" we haven't seen this level of rain in the low country in 1,000 years. That's how big this is, \" haley said on sunday. She urged residents to stay away from the deep water because \" it's got bacteria in it, \" reports the bbc.",
