        "summary": "Astronomers are feeling giddy about a flash of light on a very odd moon, phys.org reports. Radar images show that a bright object appeared briefly on saturn's moon titan, possible proof of geological activity on a lunar surface that boasts wind, rain, lakes, and seas ( though liquid methane and ethane flow there instead of water ). Scientists are calling the find a \" magic island \" — \" a colloquial term that we use, \" said a co-author of a study on the find, reports the bbc. \" but we don't actually think it's an island. \" whatever it is, scientists say the onset of titan's summer is likely the cause. Among possible suspects: winds that create waves on ligeia mare, the hydrocarbon lake where the bright object was spotted. Gases rising from the sea floor and bubbling on the surface. Solids sunken during winter, now rising to the surface. The spot could also be gas bubbling up from an undersea volcanic vent; there's no proof yet of volcanic activity on titan, but it would explain all the methane there. Understandably, scientists are hungry to see more — like possible summer storms and cyclones, livescience reports. \" we just must go back to titan with a dedicated mission, ideally to land in one of titan's seas — a titan sea probe, \" said a titan expert. \" and then we can understand what is happening on the seas of this incredible place. \" ( for more on our solar system, see how jupiter's red spot is shrinking. )",

The reason i have so strongly opposed crpd is also simple. Karen and i have experienced first-hand as we care for our little blessing, bella, that parents and caregivers care most deeply and are best equipped to care for the disabled.

We will reach greatness when every american is fully engaged. \" the comment set off a wave of criticism of cuomo, who is seeking a third term this fall and is considered a possible white house contender in 2020. After clarifying his thoughts to reporters, cuomo said he has no plans to run for president but will continue his criticism of trump, who is scheduled to attend a long island fundraiser friday. Calling the president \" vindictive, petty and small, \" cuomo said \" make america great again \" reflects trump's desire to return america to a time of greater intolerance and inequality. \" everything he does is repugnant to our values, \" he said. Trump, meanwhile, revisited the controversy friday on twitter, with not one, not two, not three, not four, but five tweets on the subject.

Nicholas, his wife alexandra, and their five children were executed in 1918 as white army forces closed in on the bolsheviks holding them prisoner. Remains identified as the parents and three children ( olga, tatyana, and anastasia ) were interred in a st. Petersburg cathedral in 1998. Body parts identified as those of alexei and his sister maria were found in 2007 about 45 miles south of the first grave, reports interfax.

The soldier accused of passing volumes of classified material to wikileaks gave his first testimony yesterday after being held for more than 900 days. As he spoke, he smiled, twisted his swivel chair, and occasionally interrupted his lawyer, the los angeles times reports. His lawyers are hoping for a dismissal of charges on the grounds that he was confined under illegal conditions. At first, manning was held in a small cell on a us base in kuwait: \" i thought i was going to die in that cage, \" he said. \" and that's how i saw it, as an animal cage. \" the hearing addressed manning's pretend sword-fights and his habit of making faces in the mirror; as for whether he licked the bars of his cell, he said he didn't remember doing so. Called a danger to himself, manning had to spend some nights naked; he once got stuck in a suicide-prevention smock and had to ask guards for help, he said. But a psychiatrist who assessed him testified that he had not been a threat to himself. The judge at yesterday's hearing approved the possibility of a guilty plea to lesser charges ( eight of the 22 he faces ). That could land manning in prison for 16 years rather than the 72 years those eight charges carry — but such a plea wouldn't necessarily halt prosecution of the larger chargers, reports the ap.",

            "Lucasfilm the death star blew up before i was born. Its pink-and-yellow cloud left a residue on the culture. We've inherited luke skywalker's ptsd. Generations have witnessed that moment through rewinds and re-releases, and once mine grew old enough, we recreated it for ourselves with the force awakens'supersize revamp and now rogue one's through-the-looking-glass reimagining of how it was done in the first place. Four decades after the damned thing first exploded, to see the killer ship's blueprint onscreen — a thin-sliced circle covered in scribbles — is to have visual proof that the last 38 years of galactic fantasies really just looks like an old record exhaustively remixed.

            "Talk about a blast from the past – rogue one: a star wars story literally is just that. Taking place just before the events of the first released star wars movie in 1977, this spin-off/prequel has the same primitive, lived-in, emotional, loopy, let's-put-on-a-show spirit that made us fall in love with the original trilogy. It's the first stand-alone chapter in the franchise, and not the bridge between then and now that j.j. Abrams cleverly constructed last year with star wars: the force awakens. As a movie, it can feel alternately slow and rushed, cobbled together out of spare parts, and in need of more time on the drawing board. But the damn thing is alive and bursting with the euphoric joy of discovery that caught us up in the adventurous fun nearly four decades ago. Familiar faces, human and droid, make cameos. But",

The former defense minister, who governed riyadh province for nearly 50 years, thinks democracy wouldn't work in the kingdom and wants to move slowly with reforms to avoid a backlash from conservatives, according to a 2007 us diplomatic cable released by wikileaks. His rule may be a short one: he has had at least one stroke and is rumored to have dementia or parkinson's disease, the guardian reports. \" he doesn't blindly accept everything the united states says, but at the same time he understands the importance of the relationship, which goes beyond oil, \" former us ambassador robert jordan tells reuters. Salman had already taken on many kingly duties over the last year as his half-brother's health declined, and he promised in a speech today that he will continue \" adhering to the correct policies which saudi arabia has followed since its establishment, \" the ap reports. The next in line to the saudi throne is yet another abdulaziz son, 69-year-old prince muqrin. After him, the crown is expected to pass to one of the scores of abdulaziz grandchildren.

In a press conference monday, he added flamion would've died had he not received help from paramedics and a witness who called 911 and performed cpr. Two other passers-by, including a nurse, also stopped to help him. \" a nurse drove by and she told my wife to get a towel, so she ran in and grabbed a pillowcase that's on our stairwell, ran back out and put it on his neck and stopped the bleeding, \" a man says, per cbs news. Some $ 237,000 has been raised for flamion, who will require \" extensive long-term care \" for \" catastrophic \" spinal cord damage, scott says. \" i've heard the word'severed, ' but there will have to be additional analysis after the swelling goes down, \" he adds. A day after five police officers were killed in dallas, flamion, 31, was shot in the left side of his neck around 11am as he walked back to his patrol car to do a records check during a stop in ballwin. Officers say the suspect — who had a history of gun-related crimes and possibly hoped to avoid being caught with a gun — fired shots as flamion's back was turned, then fled to nearby manchester, where he was arrested. Antonio taylor, 31, is charged with first-degree assault of a law enforcement officer, armed criminal action, and unlawful possession of a weapon.",

The book, due out tomorrow, comes after the computer helped run a food truck at last year's south by southwest festival and later launched a cooking app with bon appétit. Watson's cooking skills resulted from its work with chefs at the institute of culinary education, ibm notes. The computer gathered information on how to pair foods and how flavors work together; then it started coming up with recipes of its own, which ice chefs tested. \" given the numerous different combinations of possible ingredients in the world, it's impossible for a single person to imagine and reason about them all, \" ibm notes. But chefs have tweaked watson's recipes to their own liking. You can sample some of them, including a russian celery sandwich and asian butternut squash soup, here.

National geographic reports researchers recorded what is likely the first-ever video of a pointy-nosed blue chimaera in the wild more than 6,500 feet underwater off the coast of california. They published their findings in marine biodiversity records. Chimaeras are better known as ghost sharks, \" dead-eyed, wing-finned fish \" that split off from other sharks and rays 300 million years ago and are rarely seen because of the ocean depths at which they live. ( interesting but unrelated: male ghost sharks have retracting sex organs on their foreheads. ) the program director for pacific shark research center says it was \" a little bit of dumb luck \" researchers got the footage of the ghost shark, which unlike other deep-water creatures appeared to actually like the remotely operated vehicle and its lights. Researchers at first believed the ghost shark was a new species before it was identified as likely a pointy-nosed blue chimaera. That particular species has only ever been seen near australia and new zealand, though mbari notes most deep-water species have surprisingly wide-ranging habitats. It's still possible the ghost shark caught on video is a new species, but scientists won't know for sure until they catch one. ( some of these sharks may be older than the us. )",

The announcement bolsters baseball's position as having the strictest drug rules of the four major u.s. Professional leagues. It also comes a day after barry bonds and roger clemens, the two most decorated players in baseball history, were snubbed for the sport's hall of fame because of ties to performance-enhancing drugs. \"i am proud that our system allows us to adapt to the many evolving issues associated with the science and technology of drug testing, \" baseball commissioner bud selig said in a statement. \"we will continue to do everything we can to maintain a leadership stature in antidoping efforts in the years ahead. \" michael weiner, executive director of the mlb players association, said in november that stricter drug rules probably would be announced before the 2013 season. \"players want a program that is tough, scientifically accurate, backed by the latest proven scientific methods, and fair, \" weiner said in a statement today. \"i believe these changes firmly support the players'desires while protecting their legal rights. \" lab work the sport has authorized the"

Now the movement is poised to grow substantially. A group called the center for humane technology, made up of early employees of companies such as facebook and google, is launching a massive pr campaign called the truth about tech, reports the new york times. The idea: spread the message to students, teachers, and parents that they have been manipulated by giant tech companies to become addicted to obsessing over their social media profiles. The push is getting $ 7 million from the media watchdog group common sense, as well as $ 50 million in donated media and airtime from the likes of comcast and directv. \"the largest supercomputers in the world are inside of two companies — google and facebook — and where are we pointing them? we're pointing them at people's brains, at children, \" says tristan harris, co-founder of cht who formerly worked as a google ethicist. Others in the group include justin rosenstein, credited with helping invent facebook's like button, notes cnet. The cht site says this moment could be a \" turning point \" in the tech revolution, one that moves away from design strategies that deliberately create damaging addictions and toward \" technology that protects our minds. \" ( one early facebook exec feels \" tremendous guilt \" over what he helped build. )",

        "summary": "One large pepperoni, a text-message scandal, and a boycott on the side, please. Papa john's is in the middle of a big mess on two fronts, one in court and one in the media. Here's a look at both: papa john's is in the midst of a drawn-out $ 250 million class-action lawsuit for allegedly sending millions of unsolicited texts to customers back in 2010. Some plaintiffs allege that they received as many as 16 texts in a row, sometimes in the middle of the night, reports cnn. They're suing for $ 500 per text, but could end up getting triple that pending the jury's decision. Meanwhile, papa john's ceo john schnatter is under fire after saying last week that, in the wake of obama's win, franchise owners may opt to cut shifts for full-time employees to less than 30 hours per week to avoid having to offer them health benefits, as per obamacare, reports kentucky's courier-journal. It didn't take long for reactions to start pouring in, with calls for a boycott of the pizza franchise. A facebook page for the protest already has more than 1,500 likes, and a reddit post about the matter has garnered more than 4,000 comments. Caleb melby, writing for forbes, took a look at the math behind schnatter's claims that obamacare will force him to hike pie prices by 10 to 14 cents. That math might work out if you only look at large pizza sales, but on average, he figures the increase should only be 3.4 to 4.6 cents a pie. On last night's daily show, jon stewart also did some ( hasty ) math, and figures that to offset health-care costs ( which schnatter estimates at $ 8 million ), papa john's needs to sell another million or so pizzas. That should be easy, he says, since the company once ran a promo advertising 2 million free pizzas. He advises schnatter to instead \"take all the millions you donated for partisan political purposes and pump it back \" into health-care advances that could be good for business. Not everyone is hating on papa john's, however. More than 14,000 facebook users have rsvped to a national papa john's appreciation day for this friday, started by a group called reboot usa, which compares it to the chick-fil-a frenzy back in august. Supporters are urged to buy an extra pizza and donate it to someone in need.",

The spam texts offered deals for pizza, and some customers complained they were getting 15 or 16 texts in a row, even during the middle of the night, according donald heyrich, an attorney representing the class. \" after i ordered from papa john's, my telephone started beeping with text messages advertising pizza specials, \" erin chutich, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \" papa john's never asked permission to send me text message advertisements. \" the pizza franchises sent the text blasts through a mass text messaging service called ontime4u, which is also a defendant in the case.

            "Updates can now be found at the bottom of this post. Papa john schnatter is no fan of obamacare. The ceo of papa john's international has occasionally railed against the reform for months. Leading up to the election, he was a mitt romney supporter and fundraiser. Now that the election is over, he's doubling down on his claim that the health care reform will force his company to increase pizza prices by 10-14 cents a pie. He estimates that obamacare will end up costing his company $ 5-8 million annually. The issue: the affordable care act dictates that full-time employees ( 30 hours or more per week ) at companies with more than 50 workers need to be provided health insurance. Schnatter has further claimed that some employers will cut employee hours to avoid providing them with healthcare. His remarks have sparked anger on the internet, one thread on social news site reddit, titled \" there are plenty of places to get cheap s***** pizza in the world- anyone else on reddit"

The spam texts offered deals for pizza, and some customers complained they were getting 15 or 16 texts in a row, even during the middle of the night, according donald heyrich, an attorney representing the class. \" after i ordered from papa john's, my telephone started beeping with text messages advertising pizza specials, \" erin chutich, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \" papa john's never asked permission to send me text message advertisements. \" the pizza franchises sent the text blasts through a mass text messaging service called ontime4u, which is also a defendant in the case.

Now that the election is over, he's doubling down on his claim that the health care reform will force his company to increase pizza prices by 10-14 cents a pie. He estimates that obamacare will end up costing his company $ 5-8 million annually. The issue: the affordable care act dictates that full-time employees ( 30 hours or more per week ) at companies with more than 50 workers need to be provided health insurance. Schnatter has further claimed that some employers will cut employee hours to avoid providing them with healthcare. His remarks have sparked anger on the internet, one thread on social news site reddit, titled \" there are plenty of places to get cheap s***** pizza in the world- anyone else on reddit"

It's \" going to be a bit of a tough day, \" curry says, but she is excited about her new role within nbc: she will lead a seven-person unit covering stories around the world, and you ' ll likely see her pieces on nbc nightly news, dateline, rock center, and, yes, even today. She will also serve as a fill-in anchor, and her contract lasts \" a significant amount of time \" beyond just a few years, she says.

She denies many of the rumors — her chemistry with matt lauer is just fine, thank you — and says she doesn't think she was given enough time to work out the \" kinks \" of her first year as co-host. Nbc news president steve capus implies that low ratings are behind the changes, but adds that the new position is a better fit for curry. No official word on her replacement, but reports still say it's savannah guthrie. And, of course, there are more juicy rumors: the new york post claims today's natalie morales is threatening to leave if she's passed over for the job ( she was already passed over once, when curry replaced meredith vieira ). And the national enquirer chimes in with the reason it says morales will be passed over yet again: there are longstanding rumors that lauer fathered one of her kids, and the tabloid claims lauer's wife threatened divorce if he pushed for morales as co-host.",

        "summary": "The bbc reports officials once tried to keep deer away from trains by spraying railway tracks with lion poop. So a train that barks like a dog isn't the strangest idea ever. A team at japan's railway technical research institute has developed a system to keep deer safe and trains on time by turning to the sounds of the animal kingdom, according to asahi shimbun. Under the system, trains emit three seconds of the snorting noise deer make to warn each other of danger then 20 seconds of dogs barking as a \" deterrent noise. \" the idea is that the deer, alerted to danger, will run away from the oncoming train. So far in tests it seems to be working. Officials at rtri say only 7.5 deer were seen every 100 kilometers during test runs. That's about 45 % fewer than normally spotted. Rtri hopes its system will be in use outside of tests by march 2019, the telegraph reports. Deer, which need iron in their diet, are attracted to rail lines by the iron filings they lick up. It's a big problem in japan, where there were a record-setting 613 incidents of trains suspended or delayed at least half an hour due to a collision with a deer or other animal in 2016.",

            "Image copyright getty images image caption deer congregate on railway lines to lick the tracks researchers in japan have fitted a train with a speaker that barks like a dog and snorts like a deer in order to prevent collisions on the railway. Tokyo's asahi shimbun newspaper reports that the combination of sounds is designed to scare deer away from the tracks in a bid to reduce the number of animal deaths on the railway. Officials from the railway technical research institute ( rtri ) say that a three-second blast of the sound of a deer snorting attracts the animals ' attention, and 20 seconds of dog barking is enough to make them take flight. Rtri researchers say the late-night tests, at times when deer congregate around railway tracks, have resulted in a halving of deer sightings. If proved to be effective, future plans include static barking sites where deer are commonly seen, but \" the noises will not be blared in areas where people live beside the tracks \".

The unlikely contraption was thought up by a team at the railway technical research institute. Rtri officials say the contraption has successfully repelled deer, with more than 40 percent fewer animals being sighted from trains. The tokyo-based institution is hoping to have the system in practical use by the end of fiscal 2018 as a novel anti-collision measure. The officials explained that deer have a habit of repeatedly snorting short, shrill sounds to alert other deer when they perceive danger. Researchers thought it would be a good idea to combine that with the sound of a deer's enemy ( i.e. Dog ). The yapping of the hound, which drives deers to panic, adds synergy to the crafty plan, beefing up the \"deterrent noise, \" the rtri says.",

As astrobiology explains ( and as you may be thinking ), the belief that birds are descendants of non-bird dinosaurs is already decades-old. What's new here is that the evolution has been tracked by body mass. Per astrobiology, the study \" showed for the first time that when the mesozoic chapter of earth's history came to an abrupt end 65 million years ago, large body mass was not conducive to survival, whereas small — very small — was. \" in effect, dinosaurs survived by shrinking. Science 2.0 reports the team estimated the body mass of 426 dinosaur species using the thickness of the creatures ' leg bones, and found that the rapid evolution of dinosaurs ' body size slowed \" shortly after their origins \" — with the exception of the evolutionary line that gave rise to birds. Their body size continued to evolve, and the fossil record indicates that the dinosaurs/birds that survived weighed as little as 15 grams, while the smallest non-bird dinosaurs of the time weighed about 600 grams ( that's about 1.3 pounds ). The former's advantage: food. They just didn't require as much when an \" enormous impact \" obliterated food supplies. And, says benson, \" the rates of [ bird ] evolution never slowed down. They continued to find and exploit new niches throughout their ecologic history. \" as the authors of an accompanying article point out, the study explains birds ' \" extraordinary ecological diversity, ranging from large, flightless birds, to small migratory species that fly thousands of kilometers every year. \"",

This hypothesis predicts, among other things, rapid rates of morphological evolution during the early history of major groups, as lineages invade disparate ecological niches. However, few studies of adaptive radiation have included deep time data, so the links between extant diversity and major extinct radiations are unclear. The intensively studied mesozoic dinosaur record provides a model system for such investigation, representing an ecologically diverse group that dominated terrestrial ecosystems for 170 million years. Furthermore, with 10,000 species, extant dinosaurs ( birds ) are the most speciose living tetrapod clade. We assembled composite trees of 614 –",

With no other outlet, grillo has fostered an internet cult of personality, and been wildly successful at it; m5s grew out of his online fan clubs.

But projections suggested it could get more votes than any other party, and could hold the balance of power in the upper house, the senate. \" honesty will be fashionable again, \" grillo declared on twitter, as the projections began to emerge.

The \" sunday assemblies \" have relatively short roots, having been started in britain earlier this year by comedians sanderson jones and pippa evans. They're currently touring the us and australia in an effort to launch, promote, and raise funds for these pop-up congregations ( their take to-date: $ 50,000 of an $ 800,000 goal ). The inaugural sunday assembly in los angeles took place yesterday, with several hundred people showing up and singing songs like \" lean on me \" and \" here comes the sun \"; similar gatherings have been held in san diego, nashville, and new york. And rather than rag on church, the founders want sunday assembly ( motto: \" live better, help often, wonder more \" ) to be just like it, just minus god. Says jones, \" if you think about church, there's very little that's bad. It's singing awesome songs, hearing interesting talks... And helping other people. What part of that is not to like? \" not all atheists are on board, though. Says one, \" there's something not ok with appropriating all of this religious language, imagery, and ritual for atheism. \" ( in related news, a christian college's student president recently dropped a bombshell: he's an atheist. )",

It's not a unique scene. Heavy rainfall has brought the red river to its highest level in 70 years, with that level peaking at 37 feet on monday. The flood level is 30 feet, reports cbs news, and the times quotes a weather.com meteorologist as saying the river level in shreveport, population 450,000, will hold fast above 33 feet through the weekend. The weather network reports hundreds of home are under water; in bossier city, homeowners fought that fate by using more than half a million sandbags.

Anna konopka keeps track of her patients in new london the old-school way, with handwritten files instead of computers. One problem? that puts konopka in violation of a state law requiring doctors who prescribe opioids to use an online database designed to curb abuse. The computer issue isn't the only one at play: the ap reports that five complaints had been registered against konopka in recent years over her medical decisions, and she voluntarily surrendered her license in september. But she now claims she did so under duress and is fighting to get the license back. Konopka says her patients are mostly poor, rural residents who can't afford care elsewhere and aren't bothered by the lack of computers. \" electronic medicine is for the system, not for the patients, \" the doctor, a native of poland, tells cnn. \" the system is destroying human relations between the doctor and the patient. \" a judge who ruled against her on nov. 15 praised konopka's \" sincere desire to continue to help her patients, \" but said she hadn't shown that she deserved to get her license back. Konopka is now asking the same judge to reconsider, and she has about 30 patients providing testimonials in support. A ruling could come wednesday. \" i ' m not upset about anything, \" says konopka. \" the legal system is a game. You move. They move. It's full of tricks and different movements. \"",

Monis reportedly forced johnson to kneel, and \" after a short lapse of time mr monis simply shot him without further notice or warning in the back of the head, \" per a lawyer assisting the coroner.

The new york times reports that one of the six fragments pierced a major blood vessel; the 38-year-old lost consciousness soon after, per gormly. Though monis fired off three shots as police moved in, none struck a person. At least 13 bullets or bullet fragments hit monis. Though the forensics of dawson's death had been aired, the times notes this is the first official statement on whose bullets killed the victims. Abc news reports that there has been some public criticism about the rifle ( m4a1 carbine ) used by police, with a former member of the country's military counter-terrorism unit describing the heavy bullets as overly likely to ricochet.",

But on wednesday, one of those negotiators — in fact, one of the most influential ones — suggested otherwise, reports the washington post. Kevin brady, who chairs the house tax-writing committee, indicated lawmakers were indeed considering changes to the rules surrounding the popular retirement accounts. Likewise, the senate's chief tax writer, orrin hatch, said that he doesn't \" have any problem looking at everything. \" much is in flux, and more will be known when brady and his house colleagues reveal their broad proposals next week, but the upshot seems to be that future 401( k ) contributions may not be as safe as trump suggested. Brady couched his comments on 401( k ) s in the context of trying to come up with a better alternative for people. Too few people use them, he said, and those who do save too little. \" we think we can do better, \" he said, adding that \" we are continuing discussions with the president, all focused on saving more and saving sooner. \" brady didn't offer specifics, but the wall street journal floats a possibility: the forthcoming plan \" might pinch pretax savings for high-income households and use the money to beef up an underused tax break known as the saver's credit. \" under this credit, the government matches up to 50 % of people's contributions, though the program is limited to incomes below $ 31,000 for individuals and $ 62,000 for couples.",

        "summary": "The us is dealing with the burdens of crappy public transportation and pricey infrastructure, for which there is a rather simple solution: more hitchhiking, writes ryan cooper at the week. Yes, the once-popular pastime may seem \" more risky than playing russian roulette with five of the chambers loaded, \" but it's also \" a way to increase our existing transit capacity without spending money — and all of us might just make a few friends in the process, \" writes cooper. He has fond memories of regularly hitchhiking 400 miles to south africa's capital of pretoria from the small village he called home a few years ago near the border with botswana. Sure, the trip would take him 12 hours, \" but it was dirt cheap, usually costing about $ 8, \" he says. There, hitchhiking is \" one of the bedrock elements of south african transportation infrastructure, \" but the practice is frowned upon in the us. Why? cooper points to a talking points memo report describing americans ' anxious views on hitchhiking as \" the result of a series of actions taken by the state to curtail deviant behavior \" beginning in the 1950s. There are risks, but \" you're far more likely to be killed in a standard car accident \" than meet a murderer, cooper says. Plus, you can help ease traffic, provide a small income for car owners if you choose to pay, and make the activity safer by putting more ordinary people out there with the weirdos. Perhaps more importantly, \" more hitchhiking might help americans unclench and ease up on the galloping paranoia, \" cooper writes. Click for his full piece.",

Others, including seahawks owner paul allen and 49ers owner jed york, will be deposed in the case, the source says. The owners are being involved due to public statements they made about kaepernick or nfl players protesting. Kaepernick filed a grievance under the nfl collective bargaining agreement claiming he was deprived \" of employment rights in retaliation \" for his \" advocacy for equality and social justice and his bringing awareness to peculiar institutions still undermining racial equality \" in the us. \"every day that goes by and he doesn't get signed is another nail in the nfl's defense, \" the washington post quotes kaepernick's attorney as saying.

How tiny? whitefish energy had just two full-time employees on the day hurricane maria slammed into the island. However, the company suggests that figure is misleading because its business model is based on being able to ramp up quickly with the hiring of hundreds of subcontractors. Still, the contract with the puerto rico electric power authority seems \" unusual, \" in the words of the washington post. It's not only the biggest one awarded there in the wake of hurricane maria, it also seems to go against disaster protocol. That is, prepa could have activated \" mutual aid \" agreements with other public utilities, which would have been obligated to help. Florida's, for instance, reached out publicly to offer assistance but never heard back. \" i ' m scratching my head wondering how it all adds up, \" a former energy department official tells the post. Prepa's chief has said whitefish was the first \" available to arrive and they were the ones that first accepted terms and conditions for prepa. \" whitefish ceo andy techmanski, meanwhile, tells cnn that \" we called each other. \" whitefish is based in whitefish, mont., the hometown of interior secretary ryan zinke, but both techmanski and zinke say the fact that they know each other played no role. The daily beast, meanwhile, reports the company is financed by a private equity firm called hbc investments, founded by joe colonnetta. And colonnetta is a big supporter of president trump: last year, he gave $ 20,000 to the trump victory pac, $ 2,700 to trump's primary election campaign, $ 2,700 to his general election campaign, and $ 30,700 to the republican national committee.",

After pleading guilty to manslaughter, fraud, and false representation, barbara coombes received a nine-year sentence this week. Uk authorities only learned about the 2006 murder in january when 63-year-old coombes walked into a police station and confessed, reports the guardian. Authorities then uncovered the body of world war ii veteran kenneth coombes in barbara coombes ' garden in greater manchester. He would've been 87 when his daughter him in the head with a shovel, then slit his throat with its blade, reports the bbc. Though coombes said she feared her father would hurt or kill her, judge timothy king didn't believe she acted in self-defense. The sentence he handed down, however, took into account what he referred to as \" 40 years of extreme mental, physical and sexual abuse. \" coombes said her father allowed men to take explicit photos of her as a girl and went on to rape her hundreds of times, possibly fathering a child who died shortly after birth. She said she finally snapped after discovering explicit photos of naked infants, including herself. King said ptsd and severe depression clouded her judgment but suggested she only confessed because a housing official had become suspicious of her father's whereabouts, per the manchester evening news. Coombes fraudulently claimed $ 250,000 in benefits for her father before confessing.",

Last night the comedian hosted a different kind of show to help wwe world heavyweight champion seth rollins defend his title against the face everyone loves to hate: john cena, sbnation.com reports. The match at brooklyn's barclays center between the long-feuding rollins and united states champion cena was a typical mishmash of wrestling staples, including stomach stomping, figure-four leglocks, and a superplex or two. But as cena was checking on the referee, who had ( naturally ) been knocked out during the match, the unspeakable happened, per sbnation, \" out of nowhere, jon stewart has a dang chair! \" the erstwhile late-night host rushed into the ring and was expected to help cena perform a beatdown on rollins — whom stewart had recently taken to task on the daily show — but it was cena who took the brunt of stewart's chair, helping rollins seal the deal and both championship belts.

Cena pointed out how thoroughly obnoxious rollins is on numerous occasions throughout the last month and beat rollins in a non-title match, setting up this fight for two titles.

        "summary": "California police managed to stop three alleged bank robbers who they say took off in a getaway car with three hostages last year, but it took 600 bullets from 32 officers in one of the most violent conflicts between cops and criminals in law enforcement history, according to a new report. Two of the three suspects — known norteño gang members, reports the san francisco chronicle — were killed, but so was hostage misty holt-singh, 41, who was hit by police bullets 10 times. As her husband prepares to sue the city of stockton, a report from the nonprofit police foundation finds police made \" a great many smart and courageous decisions, \" but 600 shots were \" excessive and unnecessary. \" it also states some officers fired only because other cops were shooting, when colleagues were standing in front of them, and \" after the threat had been eliminated. \" holt-singh was visiting a bank of the west branch in stockton on july 16 when the suspects robbed the bank and took herself and two bank workers hostage in an employee's suv, police tell the ap. The two workers eventually jumped or were pushed from the vehicle, but authorities say holt-singh was used as a human shield as the suspects returned 100 shots during the hour-long chase. \" never in the history of us law enforcement has a police force dealt with an event such as this, \" the report states, per the los angeles times. \" there was no planned response for when the suspect vehicle stopped. \" it adds the city's police force included many rookie cops with limited equipment and resources. Stockton's police chief says \" it's important that we be as brave in reviewing this incident as our officers were in responding to it. \" the only surviving suspect has pleaded not guilty to robbery, murder, and other charges.",

        "summary": "With more than 100 companies with business interests around the world, donald trump has attracted the attention of ethics experts, who contend his possible conflicts of interest are \" unprecedented \" for a modern-day us president. Now the new york times offers a closer look at some of these global projects and plans in at least 20 countries, with the paper noting those endeavors are concentrated on developing nations and which are hard to completely untangle due to the president-elect's refusal to release his taxes or a roster of lenders. \" it is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the united states and overseas, \" says michael j. Green, a dod alum who also served on the national security council under george w. Bush. Trump himself bragged to the times earlier this week that \" i've built a very great company and it's a big company and it's all over the world, \" though he then added: \" i don't care about my company. It doesn't matter. My kids run it. \" his spokeswoman, hope hicks, released a statement noting that \" vetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both president-elect trump, his adult children, and his executives. \" nations under the times microscope: the philippines, where trump is the partner on a $ 150 million tower in manila's financial district with a developer who was appointed a special envoy to the united states in october by president rodrigo duterte. Brazil, where a trump-branded luxury hotel is embroiled in a probe rife with allegations of bribes and illegal commissions. Ireland and scotland, where environmentalists are prepping to fight against a trump organization-driven flood-prevention barrier that could bring down an endangered snail's habitat. India, where the lion's share of trump's non-north america projects lie, where it's \" routine \" for bribes to be part of the approval process, where most major developers have \" some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, \" with regional politicians, and where some politicians are tied to india's ruling bharatiya janata party. And turkey, where trump confessed last year ( in a radio interview with his soon-to-be chief strategist steve bannon ) that he may have a \" little conflict of interest because i have a major, major building in istanbul. \" the times goes deep around the world here.",

Apple needs cobalt for its iphone batteries, but experts fear a potential shortage of the metal with the proliferation of electric vehicles, which require over 1,000 times more cobalt for their batteries than do smartphones. Bloomberg — citing \" people familiar with the matter \" — reports that's why apple is trying to secure long-term contracts with cobalt miners. Historically, apple has let the companies that make its batteries buy the cobalt; this would be the first time apple goes directly to the source. One person familiar with the matter says apple is trying to get contracts for several thousand metric tons of cobalt per year for at least five years. Apple itself isn't commenting. In addition to securing cobalt for its iphones in the case of a shortage, fortune reports long-term contracts could help apple's profits because the company may be able to get a better deal on large quantities of cobalt than battery makers can secure. It could also make it easier for apple to know where its cobalt is coming from, according to techcrunch. Half the world's cobalt is produced in the democratic republic of the congo, where some mining operations use child labor and violate other human rights. Apple isn't alone in trying to secure cobalt contracts. Bmw is reportedly close to a contract for a 10-year supply, and volkswagen and samsung are also pursuing multiyear contracts.",

No official word yet on what the objects might be, but officials expect them to be retrieved soon, possibly later today or tomorrow morning. The telegraph notes that aviation experts at the bbc think the objects could be life rafts or emergency exit slides. In a separate sighting today, a chinese plane saw two large objects and several smaller ones in a part of the southern indian ocean that, according to multiple satellite images, could contain debris from flight 370. One of the objects was white and square, the ap reports, and a camera on the chinese plane reportedly got a picture of it. China has redirected an icebreaker to investigate; the objects are said to be scattered over several square miles. But a us navy plane that the telegraph calls \" the most advanced search aircraft in the world \" was unable to verify the sighting. The us is sending a black box locator to the area in case a debris field is found. The towed pinger locator is pulled behind a vessel moving slowly, and can hear the black box pinger down to a depth of 20,000 feet. An officer says they're simply planning ahead so they can act quickly if a debris field is confirmed, \" since the battery life of the black box's pinger is limited. \" the malaysian government has confirmed the plane was carrying wooden pallets, but says in a statement, \" there is as yet no evidence that these are related to the wooden pallets reportedly sighted in the australian search area \" this weekend.

        "summary": "Ohio women, take note: soon you may be unable to get an abortion if you're doing it to avoid having a baby with down syndrome. The state's legislature — most of which is pro-life — appears poised to approve such a bill this fall and send it to gov. John kasich. He has signed abortion restrictions before, reports the new york times, though it notes he hasn't stated his stance on this bill. \" we all want to be born perfect, but none of us are, and everyone has a right to live, perfect or not, \" says mike gonidakis, president of ohio right to life, which lobbied for the bill. \" pretty soon, we're going to find the gene for autism. Are we going to abort for that, too? \" as it stands, an 2012 study in prenatal diagnosis found that fetuses diagnosed with down syndrome are aborted between roughly 60 % and 90 % of the time. But abortion-rights lawyers say the bill doesn't jibe with roe v. Wade and gets us closer to seeing the fetus as a person with its own rights. Indeed, an ohio legislator who supports the bill says that \" this isn't an issue about abortion — it's an issue of discrimination \" against people with down syndrome, the huffington post reports. Some critics doubt that such a law can be enforced, and note that a 2013 north dakota law banning abortion in all cases of fetal genetic problems ( including down syndrome ) has led to no prosecutions. Others say that no law can apply fairly to all family situations and medical diagnoses. Similar legislation failed to pass last year in south dakota, indiana, and missouri, the cleveland plain dealer noted in february, but seven states do prohibit abortion over gender selection. ( meanwhile, teen pregnancy is plummeting in colorado. )",

Gonidakis said any penalties would be for the physician, not the woman, consistent with other legislation the group has supported. \" everyone wants to be born perfect and none of us are, and we don't think we should devalue life based on a false sense of perfection, \" gonidakis said.

That's not to say the carrier won't get to the korean peninsula, but even if it left now and traveled at its top speed, it would take four to five days, reports stars and stripes.

Just don't expect an announcement about the destination from the navy, which doesn't divulge details about the location of its warships. Stars and stripes notes that reports suggesting the vinson was high-tailing it toward north korea have come from officials in washington, not the navy, which has said more broadly that the carrier is moving toward the \" western pacific ocean \" and avoided any mention of a timetable. Last week, president trump spoke of \" sending an armada \" to the region, and reports about the vinson even caught the attention of north korea, which called it \" nothing but a reckless action of aggression to aggravate the tensions in the region. \"",

Good news for moms: they find housework, paid work, and leisure time \" more meaningful \" than fathers do.

        "summary": "\" new evidence \" has emerged to expand a $ 100 million 2016 lawsuit against comcast by washington state, with accusations of \" deceptive conduct \" that's \" even more egregious than we first realized. \" that's per the state attorney general, ars technica reports, with an amended complaint filed in king county superior court after the ag's office examined a \" random sample \" of 150 recorded calls between comcast and its customers. The case revolves around comcast's service protection plan, which more than 500,000 washingtonians subscribed to over a four-year span starting in 2011, paying at least $ 73 million, per an ag office statement. The issue, per the suit, is the spp is \" near worthless \" because it doesn't cover certain repairs ( including wires embedded in walls ) or charges customers for repairs already covered for free under comcast's customer guarantee. The suit says comcast may have signed up more than half of spp subscribers without their consent, including those in the calls who were never informed of the plan or clearly said they didn't want to join. Also alleged: that comcast reps told some customers the plan was \" free \" — only for customers to be hit with a monthly charge of $ 5.99 after the first month. \" the extent of their deception is shocking, \" ag bob ferguson says. In a statement to ars technica, a comcast rep says, \" we strongly disagree with the attorney general's new claims, \" adding the evidence is \" largely based on a flawed methodology and assumptions. \" consumers who think they've been ripped off can file a complaint on the ag's website. Per king-tv, it's not clear how much consumers will each get if the suit is won or settled. A trial date is set for july, per the seattle times. ( comcast isn't the most hated telecom company. )",

The news service, quoting anonymous sources, reports that mueller can prove cohen visited prague in 2016 in the midst of the election. For those asking,'so what? ', the development takes a little unpacking. Among the allegations in the infamous trump dossier compiled by christopher steele is that cohen went to prague and met with powerful russian figures, including a putin ally named konstantin kosachev. When the allegations surfaced, cohen flatly denied them: \" i have never ( been ) to prague in my life, \" he tweeted, along with a photo of the front of his passport. President trump similarly dismissed the allegation as false. But according to the mcclatchy report, mueller now has evidence that cohen entered prague from germany. The report does not say that mueller can show he met with any russian figures, but simply proving that cohen visited prague despite his adamant denial \" could be quite significant, \" writes philip bump in the washington post. The dossier makes unsubstantiated allegations of collusion, but they hinge on the prague trip. If cohen was never there, \" none of this happened. If he visited prague? well, then we go a level deeper. \" andrew prokop at vox sees it this way: \" there is no reason for cohen to try to debunk the steele dossier by lying and saying that he didn't visit prague at all if he actually did, unless he was trying to cover up extremely serious wrongdoing that happened during that visit. \"",
