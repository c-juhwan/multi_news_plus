        "summary": "Headlines about cars starting on fire tend to do bad things to said car company's stock prices, and investors in tesla have gotten angry enough to sue. A class-action suit announced yesterday accuses the company of misleading investors on safety issues, reports the san francisco chronicle. The suit follows a model s fire on wednesday in tennessee, the third such fire in six weeks. The latest happened when the driver ran over a tow hitch, which punctured the electric car's battery pack. The suit says the vehicle \"suffered from material defects which caused the battery pack to ignite and erupt in flames under certain driving conditions. \" it seeks to cover anyone who bought stock from may 10 through wednesday. In that span, tesla stock went from $ 77 to a peak of $ 193 in september to its close of $ 138 on friday. Of course, with the stock dropping, a los angeles times article raises the question, is it a good time to buy? the short answer from one analyst is not yet. As more teslas hit the road and presumably get involved in more accidents, it's likely we're going to be reading about more fires until a fix is in place.",

            "In a fitting finale to a week tesla motors executives would rather forget, a law firm announced friday that it had filed a class-action suit against the electric car maker for allegedly misleading investors over the fire risk posed by the company's model s sedan.

The hitch punctured the electric car's battery pack, which lies beneath the floorboards and is protected from the road by a steel shield. It was the third model s fire in six weeks, and it helped drive down the company's stock. Reviewers have given the model s high marks for safety, and the car scored higher on tests from the national highway traffic safety administration than any other u.s. Vehicle.

The most recent protests started on oct. 2 after dozens of people died in clashes with government security forces during a holy festival celebrated by the country's oromo people. But activists say it wasn't just 52 people ( the official government tally ) who died during that incident, but more than 500, downed by bullets and tear gas from the authorities. Locals also say the government has been blocking the internet to keep people from communicating and rallying, the guardian reports. The nation's communications minister scoffs at the october protest claims, saying none of the deceased had bullet wounds and were killed by stampeding crowds instead. The oromo and amhara people have long protested their marginalization, even though together they make up nearly two-thirds of the nation's population, per the bbc. Al jazeera notes protests started in november, first over land rights, then including political, cultural, and economic issues. Activists say hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands detained. The government says the state of emergency entails, per the ap, some curfews, restrictions or bans on communication and public assembly, and more lenient rules for carrying out arrests. Meanwhile, the government blamed egypt on monday for supporting an oromo rebel group. ( a well-known oromo member: olympian silver medalist and wrist-raiser feyisa lilesa. )",

        "summary": "Time on a tablet may slow speech development in young children, new research shows. Pediatricians at the hospital for sick children in canada who examined the effect of screen time on 900 children between 6 months and 2 years old found a 49 % increased risk of delayed speech for every additional 30 minutes spent using a touch screen, time reports. While previous studies have reported negative effects associated with screen time, including sleeping problems, the research presented at the annual meeting of the pediatric academic societies was the first to establish a link between handheld devices and expressive language delay. Expressive language refers to the ability to convey feelings and information, per the american academy of pediatrics ( aap ). Screen time did not affect other types of communication, such as social interaction or body language. Led by dr. Catherine birken, the team found that by 18 months, one-fifth of the children studied used tablets, smartphones, or other handheld devices an average of 28 minutes a day. With devices \" everywhere these days, \" birken says in a news release that all screen time for children under 18 months should be discouraged, a suggestion echoed by the aap. That even goes for apps marketed as educational. One expert tells time that the littlest ones can't understand the connection between what they see on the screen and what they see in the real world. \"symbolic thinking and memory flexibility is something that apps haven't been able to overcome, no matter how interactive they are, \" says dr.

Catherine birken, a staff pediatrician and scientist at the hospital for sick children in toronto. \" while new pediatric guidelines suggest limiting screen time for babies and toddlers, we believe that the use of smartphones and tablets with young children has become quite common. This is the first study to report an association between handheld screen time and increased risk of expressive language delay, \" she said in an american academy of pediatrics ( aap ) news release. Expressive language is the ability to convey feelings and information, according to the american academy of family physicians. The findings support a recent aap policy recommendation to discourage any type of screen media in children younger than 18 months, birken said. The new research included nearly 900 children from toronto, ages 6 months to 2 years. At their 18-month checkup, 20 percent of the children used handheld devices such as smartphones, tablets and electronic games an average of 28 minutes a day. Birken and her team said that the more time a child spent on these devices, the more likely he or she would have delays in expressive speech. Specifically, for each 30-minute increase in handheld screen time,"

This is the first study to report an association between handheld screen time and increased risk of expressive language delay, \" she said in an american academy of pediatrics ( aap ) news release. Expressive language is the ability to convey feelings and information, according to the american academy of family physicians. The findings support a recent aap policy recommendation to discourage any type of screen media in children younger than 18 months, birken said. The new research included nearly 900 children from toronto, ages 6 months to 2 years. At their 18-month checkup, 20 percent of the children used handheld devices such as smartphones, tablets and electronic games an average of 28 minutes a day. Birken and her team said that the more time a child spent on these devices, the more likely he or she would have delays in expressive speech. Specifically, for each 30-minute increase in handheld screen time,"

        "summary": "Seven republican candidates got a chance to debate without donald trump present on thursday night — though the man megyn kelly referred to as \" the elephant not in the room \" still dominated media coverage, causing some to declare him the winner. Here's what the pundits are saying about people who were actually present: jeb bush. Bush had a great night, most analysts agree, highlighting how different the gop race might be with no donald. He was \" more relaxed and more forceful \" and \" looked positively presidential \" without trump bullying him, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. He bested marco rubio in an exchange on immigration and got in a few jabs at hillary clinton — and trump. Marco rubio. This wasn't rubio's greatest debate, \" but he had a better night than cruz, which is strategically important for him, \" writes niall stanage at the hill. He did, however, struggle when the debate turned to immigration reform. Rand paul. After missing the last debate, paul was another candidate to thrive in a trump-less environment, and he proved to be \" willing and able to speak to issues his party has struggled to address in recent years, \" writes cillizza at the post, who notes that while it's far too late for his campaign, \" at least he had a moment. \" chris christie. The new jersey governor had a good debate, offering his usual forceful arguments about his executive experience and his strength as a general election candidate, though \" familiarity robs it of some of its power, \" writes stanage at the hill. Ted cruz. Trump's strategy all along was to \" create a circular gop fire squad — with ted cruz at the center. And it worked, \" according to glenn thrush at politico. Rival candidates hit cruz early and often, and he also managed to lose several exchanges with the moderators, thrush notes. John kasich. Not an awful night for the ohio governor, but one in which he failed to have any big moments, meaning that for his campaign to go anywhere now, \" there are a lot of bodies he ' ll have to climb over, \" writes anthony zurcher at the bbc. Ben carson. Carson went from \" barely being asked any questions to providing answers that often bordered on incoherence, \" writes cillizza. Like many others, he was puzzled by carson's comments about russia, which included the line \" putin is a one-horse country: oil and energy. \" click for the best attack lines from the debate.",

City health authorities are investigating three cases of poisoning by rat urine, one of them fatal, the new york times reports. The victims of leptospirosis were all in the bronx, the first such cluster of the rare disease reported in a city infamous for its robust rodents. The health department issued an alert on tuesday following the death of a man in his 30s. Two of the bacterial infections occurred in december and one this month, per abc7. All three people were hospitalized with acute kidney and liver failure, and two have recovered and been released. In the past 10 years, leptospirosis has sickened 26 people in the city, eight of them in the bronx. The outbreak prompted the health department to take steps to curb the garbage-trolling rodents and educate residents about the risk. Infections are usually spread when rat urine comes in contact with the eyes, nose, mouth, or through a cut in the skin. People were urged to avoid contact with rats, obviously, but also to clean rodent hot spots with a bleach solution while wearing gloves, boots, mask, and protective eyewear. At an apartment building where one of the three was sickened, residents on wednesday sought help from the city in having a court-appointed representative take over operations from their landlord, reports dna info. \" we stand with the tenants, \" said a statement from mayor deblasio that cited \" persistent problems \" at the building.

But really this is just the latest volley in a diplomatic spat that started with russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election, following which the us seized russian compounds in new york and maryland and booted dozens of russian diplomats. Russia retaliated by reducing us diplomatic staff by 755 positions. Last month the us closed a russian consulate and two annexes.

An air france statement confirmed the engine had suffered \" serious damage. \" an msnbc reporter posted a picture on twitter from a friend who was on the flight, showing the engine, whose protective covering had been \" sheared away, \" per cnn, and which was spattered with a \" brown substance. \" a cbc reporter posted a short video of the landing, which shows the damaged engine right next to a functional one. \" that plane's broken, \" a man can be heard saying in the video. \" the right motor's blown out. \" cnn notes that an engine failure like this is \" incredibly rare, \" particularly at that point in the flight. Meanwhile, air france praised its staff, noting in the statement that \" the regularly trained pilots and cabin crew handled this serious incident perfectly. \" an investigation is in the works to discover the cause of the explosion, and the 500 or so passengers were set to be moved out of goose bay on new flights sunday.",

The us conference of catholic bishops voted 96 to 82 tuesday to name kansas city archbishop joseph naumann chief of anti-abortion activities, besting front-runner cardinal blase cupich of chicago. For 40 years, the job has been held by a cardinal, but naumann's elevation suggests us church leaders are sending a message to rome that they don't share francis ' liberal vision for the church, the wall street journal reports. Cupich is seen as the \" current standard-bearer \" of francis ' more moderate vision, coupling anti-abortion measures with activism for poverty reduction and greater access to health care, per crux. The surprise result was seen as a vote for naumann's more focused position opposing abortion. Naumann appeared to reinforce that view when he promised to keep the committee primed to fight abortion and euthanasia. \" i've been fortunate in my priesthood to work in the pro-life areas. I hope i can draw on that experience, \" naumann said, per the journal. A villanova theologian tweeted that the vote demonstrates francis ' \" message... Esp. On life and marriage \" is \" not adequate \" for the us catholic hierarchy. Other experts, however, see naumann's slight margin of victory as signaling support for francis. The national review, meanwhile, says \" the so-called francis effect is a media concoction that is difficult to define. \" the vote, the magazine says, validates francis ' preference that local churches \" know their own ecclesial experience \" and tailor this mission according to those principles.

Cupich, considered a protege of francis and the current head of the chicago archdiocese, is the current standard-bearer of the view, which combines pro-life activism on abortion with other issues such as access to health care and poverty reduction measures. This is the first time in nearly 40 years the u.s. Bishops have chosen not to elect a cardinal as head of the pro-life committee. This closely watched election has been viewed by many as a referendum on both the conference's approach to pro-life issues and how it aligns with francis. Naumann will replace outgoing head of the committee, cardinal timothy dolan of new york. During his report on the pro-life committee on monday, dolan praised nuamann's work on the committee and as a board member of human life action. Naumann"

A few hours before the 6am shooting, the suspect and his girlfriend were fighting at a gas station; she said he wouldn't return the keys to her home, while he said she had the keys to his vehicle. A police officer separated them; shortly after that, someone called police to report that the fight was continuing on the front lawn of a nearby home. An officer went to the house to talk to the couple, during which time someone else called police to report that the suspect, 31-year-old allen dion cashe, had a gun. Since the officer couldn't find a gun, cashe was allowed to leave, and the woman gave the officer a bag of cashe's belongings — including a gun. Hours after that officer left, a shooting was reported at the house. Police say the shootings inside the home left the woman, 35-year-old latina herring, dead, her father in critical condition, and her two boys, ages 7 and 8, hospitalized in critical and extremely critical condition. One of the boys is \" fighting for his life, \" per a police spokesperson. After the shootings, cashe allegedly ran off and opened fire at bystanders near a school bus stop; a man and a high school student were injured, but are in stable condition. A police officer who heard the second set of shootings followed cashe and took him into custody at a nearby apartment complex; a gun was found in his vehicle. A neighbor says the woman who was killed got \" messed up with the wrong people \" when she recently got involved with cashe, who has a criminal record.

        "summary": "Things to look forward to in 2011: all-natural frito-lay chips, a bunch of truly unnecessary movie sequels, and … the world's 7 billionth living person. That lucky baby will arrive sometime next year, according to the un population reference bureau, writes bryan walsh for time. The world's 6 billionth living person was born just 11 years ago in bosnia, and the population is expected to exceed 9 billion by the middle of the century. Can the planet really handle that? robert kunzig attempts to take on that question in a very lengthy national geographic cover story ( worth a read ). Walsh picks out a few highlights: kunzig calls out attention to the fact that it took nearly all of human history to get us to the 1 billion mark, but we're set to explode from 3 billion to 7 billion in about 50 years. By 2050, we ' ll be somewhere between 8 billion and 10.5 billion, according to the un. Space isn't the issue. Kunzig notes that if 9 billion people were spread throughout earth's habitable regions, the population density would be half of that in france. The potential problems: not enough food, water, energy. And a lot of aging people. Writes kunzig, \" fixating on population numbers is not the best way to confront the future. The number of people does matter, of course. But how people consume resources matters a lot more... It's too late to keep the new middle class of 2030 from being born; it's not too late to change how they and the rest of us will produce and consume food and energy. \"",

Cloth was leeuwenhoek's business but microscopy his passion. He'd had five children already by his first wife ( though four had died in infancy ), and fatherhood was not on his mind. \"before six beats of the pulse had intervened, \" as he later wrote to the royal society of london, leeuwenhoek was examining his perishable sample through a tiny magnifying glass. Its lens, no bigger than a small raindrop, magnified objects hundreds of times. Leeuwenhoek had made it himself; nobody else had one so powerful. The learned men in london were still trying to verify leeuwenhoek's earlier claims that unseen \"animalcules \" lived by the millions in a single drop of lake water and even in french wine. Now he had something more delicate to report: human semen contained animalcules too. \"sometimes more than a thousand, \" he wrote, \"in an amount of material the size of a grain of sand. \" pressing the glass",

( published wednesday, nov. 26, 2014 ) carlsbad fire death may be caused by hoarding a carlsbad woman whose cluttered home caught fire tuesday evening has died. The flames sparked at a condominium complex in the 2300 block of caringa way, just before 8 p.m., forcing residents next door to run from their home. Firefighters say clutter blocked their entrance into the home and, once inside, made it difficult for them to maneuver. The woman in her late 70s was found unresponsive on the first floor. Despite efforts to save her, she was pronounced dead at the home. Neighbor arlene cooperson told nbc 7 she warned the victim to clean her home or bear the consequences. \" she's a hoarder, \" she said. \" things have to be done; they can't avoid them. \" the 2-alarm fire damaged four of the adjoining units. Firefighters say the residents won't be allowed to return until wednesday. The cause of the fire has yet to be determined."

        "summary": "A potential new species — a coyote souped up with wolf and dog dna that some are calling the \" coywolf \" — is spreading throughout eastern north america in a phenomenon the economist says is \" astonishing. \" scientists believe coywolves got their start a century or two ago when struggling wolf populations in canada started breeding with dogs and coyotes. The economist reports this kind of interbreeding usually produces offspring that fail to thrive. But the mix of wolf, dog, and coyote dna proved to be an exception. Bigger, stronger, and faster than the typical coyote, the coywolf is comfortable hunting in forests like a wolf as well as in open areas like a coyote. One scientist who studied 437 coywolves found they contain 65 % coyote dna, 25 % wolf dna, and 10 % dog dna. It's that dog dna that is helping the coywolf thrive, even in urban areas like new york and boston, the economist reports. Some scientists believe the dog dna makes coywolves more tolerant of humans and noises. They eat both produce and pets, look before crossing the street, and have even become nocturnal to adapt to urban living. Their unique mix of genetics is allowing them to succeed where both wolves and coyotes have failed. \" [ it's an ] amazing contemporary evolution story that's happening right underneath our nose, \" says one researcher, who estimates there are millions of coywolves in north america by this point. But there is still debate about whether they are their own species. \" they are eastern coyotes, \" one coyote expert, who doesn't like the term coywolf, told the detroit free press earlier this year. \" they aren't really different from other coyotes. \" ( this new type of rat has odd pubic hair. )",

What lucky animals make the cut? \" if it tastes good you should sequence it, \" says bgi's chief executive. \" you should know what's in the gene of that species. \" also, \" anything that looks cute: panda, polar bear, penguin, you should really sequence it. \" the company says it's all for the greater in good terms of food production and health care. \" in many ways, that's pretty cool, \" writes jamie condliffe at gizmodo. \" this was supposed to be future, but it's happening here and now — but the sheer pace and questionable standards described by shukman provide at least some cause for concern. \" ( more wild cloning news: scientists clone \" unclonable \" tree. )",

        "summary": "Are \" measles parties \" — where parents purposely expose unvaccinated kids to infected ones to build up immunity — a good idea? some parents say yes, but california public health officials say absolutely not, the los angeles times reports. According to a kqed blog post, marin county mom julie schiffman received an invite from another mom to expose schiffman's two unvaccinated kids to an infected child — she reportedly declined. The underlying reasoning is similar to chickenpox parties held decades ago: some people believe it's safer for kids to build up \" natural immunity \" to a weaker form of the disease when they're younger than it is to introduce a vaccine into their bodies. Health officials say that claim is spotty — and dangerous. California state epidemiologist dr. Gil chavez says in a statement, \" measles is a serious illness that can have significant consequences, \" adding that 30 % of those with the disease in the current outbreak have been hospitalized. Plus, marin county public health officer matt willis tells the times, there's no proof immunity obtained naturally is better than vaccine-conferred immunity. Art reingold, a uc berkeley epidemiology professor and ex-cdc employee, points out that most \" pox parties \" took place years ago, before vaccines were widely available. \" [ parents thought ] this is my opportunity for my kid to get immune the old-fashioned way, the way god intended, \" reingold tells kqed, adding, \" it's looney tunes \" to hold a measles party. Willis notes that while his office hasn't confirmed any measles parties taking place, he's received calls asking about the \" benefits \" of natural immunity. If scientific advice isn't holding sway, willis has another suggestion: \" any parents who are considering this... Should have a look at a child who's really sick with measles, and i think they'd change their minds. \"",

Dc cat count, a collaboration by the humane society, humane rescue alliance, smithsonian conservation biology institute, and petsmart charities, aims to create an accurate estimate of the entire cat population, including pet cats, in order to better manage it. About 1,000 dc cats are trapped, spayed or neutered, and released each year by the humane rescue alliance; as many as 3,000 more are adopted out, with owners pledging to keep the cats inside. But it's \" impossible to say \" how many cats are really out there or how effective the programs are in terms of curtailing the cat population, community programs vp lauren lipsey tells dcist. \" we want to understand the movement and flow of cats. \" so far, though, \" just walking around the neighborhood counting cats, we were surprised at how few cats we've seen, \" lipsey tells the washington post. Cats — which threaten rodents like mice and rats, but also birds and protected or endangered species — are \" secretive animals \" and therefore \" hard to see, \" but that doesn't mean they aren't around, conservation biologist tyler flockhart tells the new york times. To ensure an accurate tally, the dc cat count will use 60 motion-activated cameras, shelter analyses, and household surveys, in addition to physical counts in sample locations, in an undertaking led by two full-time employees, per npr. The effort is expected to take three years, with an app to be released by christmas allowing locals to take part by snapping photos of the cats they see.

The neuroscientists analyzed 1,011 brain scans to come to their conclusion about whether people are indeed right-brain ( ie, creative ) or left-brain ( ie, logical ) dominant, and uncovered no proof that we actually use one side of our brain more heavily or have more robust neural connections there, reports the salt lake tribune. To understand how the study worked, a quick science lesson/refresher: lateralization is no myth, and refers to mental functions that largely rely on one side of the brain; for instance, speech is a mostly left-brain function, reports livescience. The scientists divided the brain into 7,000 regions and looked for connections. They counted the number of connections that could be described as left- or right-lateralized, and uncovered neither a preference for one side nor a stronger neural network on one side, reports science daily. \" we just don't see patterns where the whole left-brain network is more connected, or the whole right-brain network is more connected in some people, \" says one of the study's authors.

Here are some of the notable names and facts you ' ll want to know: the rising star: politico sees big things in store for freshman gop rep. Tom cotton, who left his law practice in 2004 to fight in iraq and afghanistan. He's already earned endorsements from such disparate gop figures as john mccain, mike huckabee, and the club for growth. The workaholic: before coming to congress, freshman democrat raul ruiz was working as an er doctor, running a mentorship program, opening health clinics, and running education seminars in poor areas. And he sounds ready to bring that level of dedication to washington. \" i ' m a doctor, we work in teams, \" he says. \" i ' m very committed to problem solving. \" the class president: republican luke messer has been named president of the freshmen, and sounds like he's already got a handle on things, reports the hill. \" at our first meeting i established a rule where … no one could talk more than two minutes, \" he said on tv recently, \" so our first meeting took 18 minutes, and everybody was very happy. \" the inspiration: expect veteran and double-amputee tammy duckworth to be a favorite of the democratic leadership. She's already proven herself a prodigious fundraiser, given a well-received speech at the dnc, and landed a spot on the armed services committee. The pro: she may be a newcomer to congress, but ann wagner has loads of experience, having chaired or co-chaired the missouri republican party, the rnc, and roy blunt's 2010 senate campaign. John boehner has already selected her to deliver the weekly gop address. The loudmouth: alan grayson is back, everybody. The wrangler: there's a decent bet you ' ll see ted yoho on cable news. A large-animal veterinarian by trade, yoho at one point ran an ad featuring mud-spattered politicians wrestling with and eating alongside pigs. Maybe he can hang out with fellow republican kerry bentivolio, a reindeer farmer from michigan. The empty seats: this congress will be notable in part for the colorful personalities that are departing: barney frank, ron paul, and dennis kucinich will all be gone.

In fact, it appears to have gotten \" drastically \" worse in the last year, reports the new york times. Commercial beekeepers say 40 % to 50 % of their already diminished hives were wiped out in the last months of 2012, though official federal stats won't be out until may. Beekeepers continue to blame a new class of pesticides called neonicotinoids, though conclusive proof remains elusive. The pesticide industry disputes the claim, but seems to be backing off a bit as pressure mounts. The european union, for example, is poised to institute a ban on \" neonics, \" prompting leading producers syngenta and bayer to promise a more thorough study of colony collapse disorder, reports reuters. It's not clear whether the offer — along with other ideas such as planting more bee-friendly habitats — will forestall the expected ban. One thing is clear, however: with an estimated 25 % of the us diet dependent on bee pollination, expect food prices to rise in correlation to the bee deaths.",

So report researchers at the university of british columbia in the journal of psychiatry and neuroscience after concluding that male lab rats given tch experience an observable reduction in their \" willingness to exert cognitive effort. \" to test this, researchers trained 29 rats to choose whether they wanted to perform a more difficult task to earn a larger quantity of a sugary treat or perform an easier task but earn less of the treat. Without thc, most of the rats preferred to exert themselves for the greater reward; after the dose of thc, however, they largely chose the easier path and settled for a smaller treat, even though their ability to perform the harder task was not impacted. \" what's particularly interesting is though they were less likely to do these more difficult tasks they were still able to, \" one researcher tells the guardian, adding that there's a clear need for more research on how thc impacts the human brain, whether any negative side effects can be reduced, and whether marijuana compounds other than thc play a role. When the researchers gave the rats doses of the non-psychoactive compound cannabidiol, or cbd, which is thought to have medical benefits such as pain relief and doesn't cause a high, they found that it didn't impact the rats ' cognitive behavior, but it also didn't help mitigate the effects of thc on motivation.

        "summary": "A new study suggests that even toddlers know the difference between an authentic leader and a bully — and they're willing to defy the bully if they can safely do so. The study out of the university of illinois and published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences analyzed the reactions of about 100 toddlers aged 20 to 22 months to animated scenarios. The kids watched videos in which a group of characters were told to go to bed by a respected leader or a violent bully, reports ctv news. The toddlers expected the characters to follow the leader's orders and expressed surprise when they didn't, even if the leader disappeared. They also expected the characters to follow the bully's orders — but they showed no surprise when the characters disobeyed if the bully was no longer present. The study shows that \" when someone beats you up, that person has some power over you in the sense that you may be afraid of them, and you may do what they say when they're around and could harm you, but of course when they leave then you ' ll do what you want, \" says lead researcher renee baillargeon. The researchers gauged the children's reactions by studying how long they stared, a previously documented way to understand whether an event syncs with their expectations. The more something doesn't jibe for them, the longer they ' ll stare, per a release at eureka alert. The study tested a third scenario, too, one in which the characters were told to go to bed by a nice but apparently powerless figure. \" the infants expected the protagonists to disobey, most likely because the character held no power over them, \" says baillargeon.",

        "summary": "Seven-year-old joshua hardy is improving after a social media campaign convinced a drug company to give him an experimental drug that could save his life. But the backlash has been intense, with numerous observers expressing concern over the idea of \" crowdsourcing medical decisions, \" the washington post reports. The problem? in order to help as many patients as possible, as quickly as possible, drug companies need to focus on getting their experimental drugs approved via clinical trials — not doling them out for compassionate use. ( in joshua's case, the drug company and the fda ended up fast-tracking a new clinical trial rather than going the compassionate use route. ) if something goes wrong with a patient using an experimental drug, the approval process could be delayed; it's also possible that the drug company would have to take the time to make more of the drug. Plus, there's the fact that since insurance companies usually don't pay for unapproved drugs, they could potentially be handed out only to patients who can pay. The idea of giving an experimental drug to one patient but not another, based solely on the story going viral, is an ethical quandary. \" for josh, we are glad, \" reads an editorial in the herald-sun, a newspaper in durham, nc, where the drug company is based. \" but the process leaves us pained.

            "One day back in college, i was shopping for some clothes in yamaguchi. I found a shirt that fit just right, but when i took it off and looked at the tag, i was surprised to see the size listed as \"la. \" curious, i asked the salesperson what it meant, and was told it was an abbreviation for \"large athletic, \" meaning it was cut for a person with large shoulders and a slim waist. I ' m not sure how much of that was really reflected in the design, but the unexpected written compliment put me in such a good mood i bought the shirt right away, and still have it to this day. Of course, this sort of psychology can cut both ways, and i ' m not sure how one japanese clothing manufacturer expects to drum up sales by calling out its larger customers in the least delicate way. For the most part, sizes in japan are labeled pretty closely to how they are in english-speaking countries. Oftentimes small, medium, and large are referred to as simply s, m, and l, though. Sizes at the far ends of the bell curve are named a little differently, too. For example, extra-small becomes double s, or sometimes s s.

        "summary": "The proposed bank deposit tax that has enraged cypriots and spooked bank customers across europe looks likely to die today, even with a last-minute tweak that would spare the smallest savers, reuters reports. Draft legislation sent to parliament amends the previous plan by exempting accounts containing less than about $ 26,000 from the tax, reports the wall street journal. The other levies — 6.75 % on all deposits under $ 131,000 and 9.9 % over that amount — would not be raised to make up for the lost revenue, meaning the levy wouldn't generate the $ 7.6 billion required by the imf and eurozone partners, notes reuters. Still, a government rep says parliament remains unlikely to pass the levy even with the change, and could punt on a vote if it becomes clear there's no chance of passage. Meanwhile, the island's banks will not reopen until thursday at the earliest, cnn reports. Eu officials insist that there is no chance of a similar levy being imposed on other nations, but the cyprus mess has raised fears of bank runs in other countries. \" if you're a small depositor in cyprus, you ' ll tell yourself that it would have been better to keep your money under the carpet than in a bank, \" says a french bank executive. \" and if you're a greek, a spaniard, or an italian, well, you ' ll tell yourself that you might be next. \" this isn't the first time european countries have moved to tax bank deposits, the ap adds.

Occasionally, individual deaths garner international attention, as in the case of the pair of deaf identical twins who were euthanized in december 2012 after learning they would go blind and not see each other again. Now, another case is grabbing headlines, this time of a woman who has not yet died, but has been granted the right to do so. The independent has the story of \" laura \" by way of the local de morgen. The 24-year-old does not have a terminal illness; rather, she suffers from depression but, as newsweek puts it, is \" otherwise healthy. \" she became a patient at a psychiatric facility three years ago after suffering from depression since childhood, she says. \" death feels to me not as a choice. If i had a choice, i would choose a bearable life, but i have done everything and that was unsuccessful, \" the independent quotes her as telling the local paper. It hasn't yet been established when she will die. In a piece published last month that has enhanced timeliness now, rachel aviv asked in the new yorker: \" when should people with a non-terminal illness be helped to die? \" her article details the case of godelieva de troyer, who had suffered from depression since age 19 and, after meeting wim distelmans — a professor of palliative medicine who has had a hand in more than 100 deaths by euthanasia — died with his help at age 64 in 2012. Her son has since challenged the laws around euthanasia, laws that aviv writes \" seem to have created a new conception of suicide as a medical treatment, stripped of its tragic dimensions. \"",

Now three amateur spelunkers from the israeli caving club have alerted authorities to a stash of ancient coins and jewels that appear to date back 2,300 years, to the time of alexander the great. What's more, the israel antiquities authority says that archaeologists who further explored the hard-to-reach stalactite-filled cave over the weekend found \" evidence of human habitation \" dating back 6,000 years to the chalcolithic period, reports discovery. Some of the pottery vessels found in the cave had even merged with the limestone sediments. \" presumably the cache was hidden in the hope of better days, but today we know that whoever buried the treasure never returned to collect it, \" said an iaa statement, speculating that someone stashed it in the chaos following alexander's death. Among the jewels, two silver coins allowed archaeologists to date the stash to the reign of alexander the great; on one side is a depiction of the man, while on the other zeus is raising his arms on a throne. Silver jewelry — including rings, bracelets, and earrings — are part of the find, which researchers say was probably initially stashed in a cloth pouch, reports cnn. The intricate and well-preserved earrings are thought to be especially valuable. An iaa official applauded the cavers ' \" exemplary civic behavior. \" ( not all spelunkers in israel have been quite so honest of late. )",

        "summary": "A surprisingly simple sniff test shows promise in detecting autism in kids — perhaps even in those who aren't yet toddlers because it doesn't involve responding to questions. Israeli researchers found that autistic kids don't react strongly to strong smells, of either the pleasant or unpleasant variety, reports cnn. In the experiment, they exposed 36 kids to nice scents such as roses and to awful ones such as rotting fish. Half the kids did not have autism, and they reacted they way you'd expect — they immediately inhaled more deeply on the pleasant odors and took shorter sniffs on the nasty ones. The other 18 kids, however, all of whom have autism, did not alter their breathing as rapidly, reports the new york times. \" the sense of smell is in fact a major component of human social interaction, \" says lead author liron rozenkrantz of the weizmann institute of science, as quoted by healthday. \" given that olfaction is probably altered in autism, could it be that this is a part of the social challenge in autism? \" researchers, whose findings were published in the journal current biology, didn't know which kids had the diagnosis during the tests, but they were able to correctly identify those with autism 81 % of the time. The average age of the kids in the study was 7, and rozenkrantz says the next step will be to conduct long-term studies on younger children. ( parents with an age gap might have a greater risk for autistic kids. )",

This behavior is so common that it's one of the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Now, a new study suggests that children with autism might also experience smells differently from children who have typical development. To explore how children with autism respond to odors, researchers built a device called an olfactometer, which delivered different scents through a small tube that fit into nostrils. A second tube measured how much air the children were breathing in during each scent -- in other words, how much of a sniff they were taking. The researchers exposed 36 children -- 18 who had autism and 18 who did not -- to alternating bouquets of pleasant smells, such as roses or shampoo, or unpleasant smells, such as sour milk or rotten fish. They found that children who did not have autism took a longer sniff for roses and a shorter one for rotten fish, and the difference in breathing happened quickly, within one-third of second of being exposed to the scent.

Which is to say: we're starting to get good polls from reputable pollsters that allow us to track patterns over time. Quinnipiac university put out a new poll thursday that tracks hillary clinton's performance against the panoply of possible republican challengers in three states: colorado, iowa, and virginia. The nice thing is that they polled in the same states two months ago, so we can see what's changed. In short: clinton's lead against any or all of the tested republicans has dropped in colorado and iowa and increased in virginia. The margins by which she leads ( or doesn't ) vary slightly, but the trends are all about the same. In other words, the movement here is on clinton, not on the challengers.

The train was making use of a new bypass, and a local mayor had warned earlier this month about potential accidents, as recounted in this story at komo, though the ap notes don anderson suggested the most vulnerable points involved crossings where a train could strike a car or passenger. The bypass was intended to help trains avoid slow curves and single-track tunnels along the previous route.",

Knight and his team may have found a way to eliminate the risks with a simple swipe. First, they recruited 18 babies and their mothers. Next, immediately after birth, they swiped four c-section babies with gauze held in the mother's vagina. Over the next month, the microbiome of the four infants was found to be more similar to that of babies delivered vaginally than other c-section babies. They weren't identical, though. \" for some taxa the transfer was essentially complete, but other taxa didn't really take, \" knight says. A gastroenterologist not involved in the study tells smithsonian that the babies ' gut microbes \" look much more like a c-section baby's than a vaginal birth baby's. \" knight admits it's not clear how the transfer might affect the long-term health of the c-section babies, but an expert tells the new york times the study is \" extremely important \" for the sole fact that it shows such a transfer is possible. Knight and his team are now planning a larger study that will follow a greater number of babies for a longer period. In the meantime, they warn that the mothers who took part in the study underwent \" a number of tests to make sure it is a safe procedure … the take-home message would be don't do this at home. \" ( c-sections are rampant in this country. )",

Minneapolis police chief janeé harteau says she wants to know why a police officer fatally shot justine damond, and she has called for a speedy investigation, the star tribune reports. Damond, 40, was shot dead after her fiance says she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault near her home. The officer involved has been identified as mohamed noor, who joined the force in 2015 and has three complaints against him on file, reports kstp. The two officers at the scene did not have their body cameras turned on and there are no other known witnesses to the shooting. Damond was reportedly shot in the abdomen after approaching the arriving squad car in her pajamas. Don damond, her american fiance, said monday that the family has been told almost nothing about the shooting. \" our hearts are broken and we are utterly devastated by the loss of justine, \" he said, per the bbc. \" sadly her family and i have been provided with almost no additional information from law enforcement regarding what happened after police arrived. \" minnesota's bureau of criminal apprehension, which is handling the investigation, says more information will be released after it interviews noor and partner matthew harrity, a community service officer who was reportedly speaking to damond, who was due to be married in august, when she was shot.

        "summary": "When president trump called for an investigation into voter fraud wednesday morning, he tweeted that it would include people registered to vote in two states. He might want to have a talk with top adviser steve bannon: the guardian reports that bannon is still registered in both florida and new york. Bannon voted for trump in new york, listing his rented apartment in manhattan for an address. However, state records in florida show that he remains registered there, too, with his given address the home of breitbart news friend andy badolato in sarasota county. The newspaper points out that it's not illegal to be registered in two states, only to vote in two states. \" now, no one is suggesting bannon has knowingly broken the law or committed voter fraud, \" writes chris anderson at the sarasota herald-tribune. \" this whole thing is probably a misunderstanding. \" but he notes a \" strange pattern, \" given that bannon had been registered in a different florida county, dade, before shifting to sarasota. It doesn't appear that he voted in either locale, reports the miami herald. An anti-trump group called avaaz previously filed a complaint with the state because it suspected bannon never lived at the sarasota address, but the state dismissed it, saying the allegations \" are neither factually sufficient or do not set out an incident of ' election fraud ' as defined. \"",

Though the man initially declined an invitation to dinner, the two eventually talked over chinese food, and the man said that while he found rome to be good about feeding the hungry, it was difficult to find a place to wash. The pope gave konrad the go-ahead to add showers, and a construction firm volunteered to install them, including one just feet from the pope's apartment. Tenor andrea bocelli also pitched in with a \" substantial \" donation, reports abc news. As for whether the well-heeled dislike sharing toilets with the homeless, the bishop says, \" the basilica exists in order to keep the body of christ, and we serve jesus'suffering body by serving the poor. \" ( see why pope francis also recently called for the end of life sentences. )",
