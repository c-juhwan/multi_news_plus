On saturday, that costa rican celebration turned deadly for four of the party attendees during a river rafting expedition after several rafts flipped over on the naranjo river; a local guide was also killed, the miami herald reports. The ap identifies the four us tourists as ernesto sierra, sergio lorenzo, andres dennis, and jorge caso, while the river guide — whose supervisor called him one of his most-skilled guides, per nbc miami — has been named as kevin thompson reid. Cnn reports the deceased were between the ages of 25 and 35, per costa rican officials. The news was confirmed by the us department of state, with spokeswoman heather nauert tweeting condolences, as well as thanks to costa rica \" for their support in this tragedy. \" the four tourists had been part of a group of 14 who traveled to costa rica \" to do something special for our friend before his wedding, \" per a gofundme. Authorities say rain had swelled the naranjo river on rafting day, and there was a flood alert. A party attendee who set up the gofundme to pay for his friends ' funeral costs says all three rafts they were in flipped after just a few minutes, tossing all 14 of them and their guides into the river. \" all of us struggled to stay above water, swallowing lots of it on the way down as our bodies ricocheted against the rocks in the water while struggling to survive, \" the page notes. Those who survived were able to grab onto rocks or other objects. Further condolences were offered by costa rican president carlos alvarado, who expressed his \" deep dismay \" in a saturday night tweet. ( a bachelor party went wrong at a casino. )",

Aquazzura, a luxury italian shoe company, says one of trump's shoe designs for her fashion collection is a copycat of one of its own popular sandals. The company is suing trump and three companies that work with her, and wants a court to stop her from selling her version of the shoe, usa today reports. The issue is over aquazzura's wild thing sandals, which have an insanely high heel and lots of fringe and cost $ 785, and trump's hettie high heel sandals, which have an insanely high heel and lots of fringe and reportedly cost $ 145 before they became unavailable on bloomingdale's website. Yahoo style has a side-by-side comparison photo. Aquazzura had actually called trump out way back in march, posting a photo of the two shoes on instagram and bemoaning that moment \" when someone blatantly steals your copyright designs and doesn't care. \" aquazzura's version has been seen on the feet of celebs including olivia palermo and solange knowles, and the lawsuit alleges that, \" seeking the same success aquazzura experienced but without having to put in the hard creative work, defendants resorted to knocking off plaintiff's popular designs. \" but two can play at that game: \" this is a baseless lawsuit aimed at generating publicity, \" says the chief financial officer of one of the companies being sued. \" the shoe in question is representative of a trending fashion style, is not subject to intellectual property law protection and there are similar styles made by several major brands. \" aquazzura's founding designer seems to sort of agree with that: he told footwear news last month, \" it's not only [ trump ], and i ' m glad to do other [ instagram ] posts.

As a european union deadline looms and the country's future looks increasingly uncertain, many of the greeks who still have money are spending it on anything they can find, even paying their taxes in advance in case the banks fail and their savings disappear, the new york times reports. Buyers are especially keen on items that can be resold, and one jeweler says he had to reject a customer who wanted to spend $ 1.1 million yesterday — because, like the customer, he felt that keeping the jewels was much safer than keeping money in the bank. \" i can't believe that there i was, turning away a million-dollar offer, \" the jeweler says. \" but i had to turn down the deal. It's a measure of the risk we face. \" when cyprus was bailed out in 2013, depositors with more than $ 110,000 in the bank lost around 40 % of their savings, and greeks with money in the bank are doing all they can to avoid a similar \" haircut, \" the times notes. But getting their money isn't easy: the greek government has extended bank closures and a $ 66-per-day withdrawal limit at atms until at least monday, the bbc reports. That's the day after an emergency summit of all 28 eu leaders, and the guardian notes that if the greek government fails to deliver an economic plan by the end of today, that summit could end up being about a greek exit from the eurozone.",

As exhibit a, it shares a 14-minute recording from 1991 of a trump spokesman who identifies himself as john miller talking with people reporter sue carswell. Miller sounds like trump as he says things like, \" he's a good guy, and he's not going to hurt anybody.... He treated his wife well. \" in fact, it is trump, declares the post, who was given the recording by an unnamed source who knew carswell. Speaking to nbc's today show friday morning, trump denied it. \" no, i don't know anything about it, \" he said, per the la times. \" it doesn't sound like my voice at all. \" carswell played the recording for several people at the time, including trump's girlfriend marla maples, all of whom identified miller as trump. The sub-headline on the resulting interview reads, \" and a mysterious pr man who sounds just like donald calls to spread the story. \" the post piece says trump did this regularly back in the day, using the name of john miller or john barron or baron. In fact, it became a running joke in the new york tabloids, with the latter turning up in trump-related stories as early as 1980, says the post. Trump was quoted in a subsequent people story describing the miller call as a \" joke gone awry. \" and the post notes that in a 1990 court case he testified, \" i believe on occasion i used that name, \" in reference to john miller.

Dan markel, a harvard law school grad who taught criminal law at florida state university, was shot at close range in the side of the head at his tallahassee home last week, abc news reports. Police believe it's a case of premeditated murder and say the toronto native, 41, likely knew his killer as there were no signs of forced entry. They've released a photo of what cbs news reports to be a silver or light green toyota prius, though police say it's not necessarily the suspect's vehicle and they won't say exactly where it was spotted. The new york daily news reports markel had two young sons, aged 3 and 5, with ex-wife wendi adelson, a fellow professor at florida state with whom markel was reportedly involved in a legal dispute over custody issues and finances. She is \" totally, totally shocked over what happened, \" her lawyer says. \" she's scared to death for her children. She's scared to death for herself. \" police say adelson has not been labeled a suspect, nor has anyone else. \" we are speaking to everybody who has an affiliation with mr. Markel, \" an officer says, adding that a tip line has already received some 50 calls. Meanwhile, a friend of markel's has created a fund to raise money for his two boys, which has reached nearly $ 50,000 after just three days.

That pressure became insurmountable when board members, including the head of the met's finance committee, demanded he leave his post in recent days, the times reports. After coming into the role in january 2009, campbell hired new digital staff and opened what is now the met breuer, which costs $ 17 million per year to operate, with approval from the board. But there were later buyouts and layoffs and campbell was forced to abandon his plan to build a $ 600 million wing for modern and contemporary art- — despite record attendance at the largest museum in the us. However, the met's chairman says campbell has led the museum \" in precisely the right direction. \" campbell will stay on until june, but daniel weiss, the museum's president and chief operating officer, will immediately become interim chief executive.

Abortion is largely illegal in northern ireland due to a 155-year-old law. That includes in instances of rape and incest, according to vice. With dozens of protesters there in support, 72-year-old diana king, 68-year-old colette devlin, and 69-year-old kitty o ' kane turned themselves in for either using abortion-inducing pills themselves or helping other women get them, the bbc reports. \"it is unforgivable how women are being treated, \" king tells the guardian. More than 200 other women signed an open letter admitting to the same crimes and stating their willingness to be arrested. The retired teachers and social worker were spurred to action by the prosecution last month of a 21-year-old woman for buying abortion pills online. A second woman is due in court in the near future for allegedly buying the pills for her teen daughter. \" if the police wish to criminalize one woman for a crime that so many of us have committed, then there can be no exception to the law, we must be arrested as well, \" a statement from the three women reads, per the bbc. Northern irish women in need of an abortion can either spend thousands of dollars to travel elsewhere in the uk to have one legally or buy the pills for considerably less money online and risk prosecution. Protesters say this creates a different set of laws for poor women. Devlin, o ' kane, and king were questioned and released monday. Authorities have yet to decide if they ' ll be prosecuted.",

As the new york times reports, the beads are a kind of \" microplastic \" small enough to evade wastewater facility treatment efforts; they've been found in the great lakes ( which are populated by tens of millions of them, say scientists ), the pacific, and the los angeles river; late last month, in fact, the lat dug into the damage the polyethylene and polypropylene beads are doing. The buffalo news reports the beads can persist for centuries, and they don't float there innocuously: marine life will eat the beads, which can become toxin-coated; they may then enter the food chain.

While some manufacturers are taking steps of their own — procter &amp; gamble and johnson &amp; johnson, for instance, are on a path toward doing away with the beads — the policy director behind the plastic-fighting group that is working with the state's politicians says the beads persist in thousands of products, and that trying to go after single manufacturers is \" akin to playing whac-a-mole. \" iphone app beat the microbead can alert you to whether a product contains the beads.",

Eriksen was searching for \" microbeads, \" bits of plastic no bigger than salt grains that absorb toxins such as motor oil and insecticides as they tumble downstream and into the pacific ocean. The tiny polyethylene and polypropylene beads are an emerging concern among scientists and environmentalists. The beads come mostly from personal care products such as facial exfoliants and body washes. They are not biodegradable, however, and because they are not removed easily by wastewater treatment plants, they flow out to sea and enter the food chain. \" microplastic is now a ubiquitous contaminant in the pacific ocean — and seas around the world, \" said eriksen, a scientist with the 5 gyres",

Scientists have warned that the plastic pollutants, which has shown up in studies of lake erie, can last for centuries. Schneiderman called his plan \"common-sense legislation \" that will reduce the flow of the tiny plastic particles into key waterways of new york. It would be the nation's first such legislation calling for a ban of the particles now used in more than 100 consumer products. The microbead-free waters act would ban the distribution, sale or manufacture in new york of beauty and other personal care products that contain plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in size.

            "Scientist marcus eriksen stood ankle deep in the murky los angeles river on friday and dipped a net into the water, looking for a problem. Eriksen was searching for \" microbeads, \" bits of plastic no bigger than salt grains that absorb toxins such as motor oil and insecticides as they tumble downstream and into the pacific ocean. The tiny polyethylene and polypropylene beads are an emerging concern among scientists and environmentalists. The beads come mostly from personal care products such as facial exfoliants and body washes. They are not biodegradable, however, and because they are not removed easily by wastewater treatment plants, they flow out to sea and enter the food chain. \" microplastic is now a ubiquitous contaminant in the pacific ocean — and seas around the world, \" said eriksen, a scientist with the 5 gyres",
            "Albany – tiny microbeads used as abrasives in everything from skin care products to toothpaste, which scientists say are polluting lake erie and the other great lakes, would be banned under legislation being proposed by attorney general eric schneiderman. Scientists have warned that the plastic pollutants, which has shown up in studies of lake erie, can last for centuries. Schneiderman called his plan \"common-sense legislation \" that will reduce the flow of the tiny plastic particles into key waterways of new york. It would be the nation's first such legislation calling for a ban of the particles now used in more than 100 consumer products. The microbead-free waters act would ban the distribution, sale or manufacture in new york of beauty and other personal care products that contain plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in size. The legislation comes",
            "Right now 86 ngos from 37 countries are supporting the campaign! already 446 brands from 117 different manufacturers promised to remove plastic microbeads from their products. To achieve a microbead free environment, we need your support. Any gift will help!",

She was right — doctors diagnosed her with the most malignant brain tumor you can get, a grade 4 glioblastoma on her frontal lobe, and gave her 14 months to live. She was eight-and-a-half weeks pregnant. Surgery was needed to remove the tumor, but the baby had more growing to do. So prater and her husband luke \" decided to wait as long as we could. \" she had surgery in her third trimester and it went well. But soon after, she had more seizures — the tumor had grown and doctors insisted on radiation. Though prater was worried radiation would increase her daughter's own risk of childhood cancer, this time she had no choice — without it, mother and child were both in danger. \" but [ june ] made it through, twice, \" she says; june lane was born monday by c-section, and is healthy. \" she came out pink and screaming, \" prater says. \" god was definitely with us through this. \" now prater is facing her tumor — chemo likely starts next week and the treatment's effectiveness is uncertain. \" now i ' m bound and determined not to be depressed, \" she says. \" i ' m not going to be in the fetal position, crying in my bedroom. \" ( another incredible pregnancy story — mom and daughter give birth on the same day. )",

At least six men were also massacred in the attack, which has the zayounah neighborhood reeling as it tries to figure out who carried out the slaughter and why. Afp reporters were able to slip past police and into the neighborhood, where they spotted the ominous sign and talked to residents, who claim prostitutes are murdered there every few months and that police do nothing to stop it from happening. \" if a person got shot right next to a policeman, they wouldn't say anything, \" a shopkeeper told one reporter. \" they're afraid. It's the rule of the strong over the weak. \" the post doesn't mince words: \" however rough life is for sex workers elsewhere in the world, it's rougher in iraq. \" the us state department in 2003 reported that iraqi militants who claimed to be fighting prostitution publicly beheaded more than 200 women — many of whom weren't even sex workers — and left their heads on their families'doorsteps. Mass \" honor \" killings of alleged prostitutes have reportedly continued even after prime minister nouri al-maliki entered office; one report says the ministry of interior \" openly managed mass killings of prostitutes in al battaween in central baghdad. \" further, the post points out that refugees are particularly at risk of being trafficked, and iraq has produced hundreds of thousands of refugees in recent decades. According to one report, an estimated 4,000 iraqi women have disappeared since the 2003 us invasion, and many are suspected to have been sold as sex slaves.

Fires killed 91 in athens last week and japan is enduring a heatwave that saw 125 die and tokyo push 104f for the first time. Yet the international response has been to boost coal demand and increase oil and gas investments, while renewable-energy subsidies diminish, reports the economist. Why the contradiction? a big contributor is asia, where emerging economies consumed 40 % more energy from 2006 to 2016; even coal, the worst offender, inched up by 3.1 % annually. Despite warnings from scientists, state-owned firms in russia and the middle east see good reason to invest. Then there's political inertia: fossil-fuel lobbies are well-entrenched, the economist says, and some countries can hardly imagine a turnaround. Yes, britain is now coal-free, but india's electricity is 80 % coal-generated; turning that around would mean damaging its poorest states and hurting its banking system, which lent big money to coal, per another economist article. Finally, there are non-energy industries like farming, cement, and steel, which generate more than half of global carbon and are protected politically. On the plus side, solar and wind energy are on the rise, as is public concern, but many politicians haven't yet rung the alarm bell. \" perhaps global warming will help them fire up the collective will, \" says the economist. \" sadly, the world looks poised to get a lot hotter first. \"",

The offending tweet by sportscenter host jemele hill, which she posted monday: \" donald trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists. \" she first got pushback on her own twitter feed, where she doubled down and called trump an \" unfit, bigoted, incompetent moron. \" piling on next was espn, which issued a statement the next day stating hill's actions were \" inappropriate \" and that her remarks on trump \" do not represent the position of espn. \" all of which has led to an online firestorm, with many trump supporters agreeing with what cnn calls the \" highly unusual \" white house move to appear to recommend that a trump critic on a tv network be fired. Others, however — including the national association of black journalists, espn co-workers, and other journalists who are posting their own statements on trump in solidarity — are rushing to the defense of hill, saying she only spoke the truth and that her comments are protected by the first amendment. Some note that similar commentary on trump in the journalism world hasn't been blasted, saying that hill being black has made her a target. Hill addressed the \" elephant in the room \" once more late wednesday on twitter, posting a short statement that explained what she'd stated were her \" personal beliefs \" and that her \" regret is that my comments and the public way i made them painted espn in an unfair light. \" she added her respect for espn and her co-workers \" remains unconditional. \" ( the new york times touches on accusations that espn has become too \" politically correct. \" )",

There's no proof rose bet against the reds in these documents, but mlb prohibits gambling whether you're betting for your team or against it, notes nbc sports. The pages appear to be the final nail in the coffin that dowd could never get ( he had sworn testimony from a bookie but no written proof ). What espn's excavation does document for this time period: rose bet on at least one mlb team on 30 different days, he put money down on the reds on days when he was at bat, and most of his bets were around $ 2,000. There's no comment yet from mlb officials or rose — who nbc notes is currently appealing his banishment; bertolini's attorney says his client \" is not interested in speaking to anyone about these issues. \" ( ah, timing: cincinnati.com just put up this nice piece about rose's \" potential redemption. \" )",

            "Pandu, one of the houston zoo's two elderly malayan tigers, was humanely euthanized today after a long life. The decision was made by the tiger's keepers and veterinary team after the 16-year-old tiger began to become uninterested in food, lethargic, and showing signs of pain. After an extensive medical review, our veterinary and tiger experts decided that the most humane option was to peacefully euthanize him. For many years, pandu received a combination of stem cell therapy and arthroscopic surgery to address orthopedic issues in his right elbow courtesy of dr. Brian beale of gulf coast veterinary specialists and michael coleman, ph. D. And jonathan davis, stem cell specialists with ingeneron, inc. These treatments greatly added to his quality of life, and gave him the energy to participate in some of his favorite activities – swimming and painting. Affectionately called \"professor \" by his keepers, pandu was an extremely vocal cat, so much that the team had to train",
            "Poachers have infiltrated the forests of malaysia and plundered its wildlife, including tigers. Malaysian wildlife is in high demand in asian markets for use as folk medicine and as a sign of wealth. Logging operations and road development pose big threats to malayan tiger habitats. Conversion of forests to agriculture or commercial plantations results in frequent encounters between tigers and livestock. The cost to farmers can be high — livestock loss due to tigers is estimated to have cost more than $ 400,000 from 1993 – 2003 in terengganu, one of the poorest areas in peninsular malaysia. In retaliation, tigers are often killed by authorities or angry villagers. Tigers killed as \"conflict \" animals often end up on the black market, creating a link between human-tiger conflict and poaching.",

        "summary": "Scientists have long wondered about the \" prosocial \" activity of bonobos, noting how the apes appear to be more sharing and cooperative than other primates such as chimps, per the los angeles times. But humans may still have them beat after a new study out of duke university suggests bonobos prefer \" jerks \" rather than more helpful subjects, a release notes — perhaps setting humans apart from our closest kin in the animal kingdom. The study, which appears in the current biology journal, notes that by the time human infants are 3 months old, they exhibit a preference for more helpful people, but \" whereas humans already prefer helpers by [ that age ], bonobos favor hinderers. \" the researchers went to work on this theory via four experiments on semi-free-ranging bonobos in a democratic republic of congo sanctuary. The scientists used both live-action participants and animated videos to see if the bonobos preferred \" prosocial \" or \" antisocial \" actors. In one experiment, for example, the bonobos had to choose whether to accept apple slices from a \" helper \" ( someone the apes had previously seen return a dropped toy to someone who'd dropped it ) or a \" hinderer \" ( someone who'd taken that toy and run away ). The bonobos tended to reach out to the thief. The researchers theorize the apes may think such insolent behavior is a signifier of dominance and social status, and by choosing the bully, they'd avoid being bullied themselves and increase their chances of getting food or mates. That trait may keep bonobos from working together in large groups like humans. ( bonobos are the closest humans can get to a \" living ancestor. \" )",

        "summary": "If your level of self-control involves spending like paris hilton on trust-fund day or needing to be physically restrained at an all-you-can-eat buffet, well, chances are that you also spend a fair amount of time navel-gazing and you have a hard time imagining what it's like from someone else's point of view. So say neuroscience researchers out of the university of zurich in a study published in science advances; they found that impulse control is probably rooted in a region of your noggin called the posterior temporo-parietal junction ( ptpj ), which helps you better put yourself in other people's shoes. \" it's not that surprising, \" co-author christian ruff tells live science of the tie between self-restraint and empathy, \" when you consider you can see yourself as another person in the future. \" the researchers offered study participants between $ 75 and $ 155 they could keep or $ 150 they could split, with either loved ones or strangers; researchers observed most people were willing to share with their nearest and dearest, but not so much with strangers. But when scientists zapped the ptpj, effectively silencing it, and offered participants a small, variable sum now or a bigger, known payout in three to 18 months, they observed more stinginess with others and little patience with waiting. When participants were then tested on their ability to perceive objects from an avatar's point of view, those with the most trouble doing so had lower self-control and less generosity with others. Ergo, being more generous with others may strengthen self-control — which could have implications in treating addiction, ruff says, in that \" we should perhaps think about interventions that actually foster our ability to take the perspective of others. \" ( and anyway, evolution frowns on selfish jerks. )",

            "Paradoxically, you could boost self-control by being less self-centered, a new brain study suggests. Self-control, the ability to resist that second chocolate-chip cookie or save up for a rainy day, may be affected not only by how impulsive people are, but also by how easily people see things from another's perspective, the research finds. Though the findings may be counterintuitive at first glance, they shouldn't be, said study co-author christian ruff, a behavioral neuroscientist at the university of zurich in switzerland. \" it's not that surprising when you consider you can see yourself as another person in the future, \" ruff told live science. In other words, people who exercise self-control can better imagine how their future self would respond, and therefore have a greater ability to put off gratifying the self in the here and now. [ 25 weird things people do every day, and why ] in recent years, scientists have hotly debated exactly how people develop self-control. A slate of studies has debunked the notion of ego depletion, which says that people use up a finite supply of self-control by exercising willpower. Instead, researchers have found that willpower is more like a muscle that gets stronger when exercised. People with greater self-control also have more efficient brain processes, according to a 2013 study published in the journal nature communications. And still other studies suggest that self-control is contagious, with social influences determining a person's level of restraint or impulsivity. \" people are very interested in this ability to control yourself, because it's highly relevant for everyday behaviors in life that are important for health and well-being, \" ruff said. But self-control is also implicated in a host of brain disorders, such as addiction. Until recently, however, most people thought the lack of self-control exhibited by those with addictions was mainly due to an inability to suppress impulses, a process governed by the brain's prefrontal cortex. However, a past study published in 2009 the journal judgment and decision making showed that delaying gratification required taking the perspective of the future self, who may be almost a stranger to the current self, the researchers wrote in the paper. Because of that, ruff and his colleagues wondered whether a brain region called the posterior temporo-parietal junction ( ptpj ), which plays a role in the ability to see things"

A slate of studies has debunked the notion of ego depletion, which says that people use up a finite supply of self-control by exercising willpower. Instead, researchers have found that willpower is more like a muscle that gets stronger when exercised. People with greater self-control also have more efficient brain processes, according to a 2013 study published in the journal nature communications. And still other studies suggest that self-control is contagious, with social influences determining a person's level of restraint or impulsivity. \" people are very interested in this ability to control yourself, because it's highly relevant for everyday behaviors in life that are important for health and well-being, \" ruff said. But self-control is also implicated in a host of brain disorders, such as addiction. Until recently, however, most people thought the lack of self-control exhibited by those with addictions was mainly due to an inability to suppress impulses, a process governed by the brain's prefrontal cortex. However, a past study published in 2009 the journal judgment and decision making showed that delaying gratification required taking the perspective of the future self, who may be almost a stranger to the current self, the researchers wrote in the paper. Because of that, ruff and his colleagues wondered whether a brain region called the posterior temporo-parietal junction ( ptpj ), which plays a role in the ability to see things",

But as the boston globe reveals, \" quiet skies \" is actually the name of a tsa domestic surveillance program that has been operating on the down-low. It's not entirely clear how you can end up on this particular watchlist, but if anything about your travel history — say, for example, you're a business person who travels to world hot spots — raises even a hint of suspicion, that's enough. That's when the remarkably detailed surveillance starts. Marshals in the program get a list of people to follow in airports and then onto flights. If they fidget, use the bathroom a lot, use a cellphone, have a \" jump \" in their adam's apple or a \" cold penetrating stare, \" or check their reflection in glass ( ostensibly to detect being followed ), it will be fully documented on a checklist. Tsa isn't saying much about the program, but the washington post and cnn have confirmed its existence. \" we are no different than the cop on the corner who is placed there because there is an increased possibility that something might happen, \" a tsa spokesman tells the post. \" when you're in a tube at 30,000 feet... It makes sense to put someone there. \" however, the agency wouldn't divulge details about how people get selected for surveillance, or about the surveillance itself. So how did the globe get wind of the program in the first place? from marshals themselves who think it's not only a waste of time and resources but perhaps a violation of ordinary people's privacy. \" cannot make this up, \" reads a text from one marshal who'd been tasked with surveilling a southwest airlines flight attendant.",

Now, prosecutors argue the woman buried in her wedding dress was perhaps the first of her husband's murder victims. In a trial playing out in illinois ' cook county, 76-year-old former lawyer donnie rudd stands accused of killing kumeta on a lonely stretch of road on sept. 14, 1973, to collect $ 120,000 from life insurance policies, per the washington post. \" the defendant married noreen because he wanted to kill her, and 27 days after he married her he did just that, \" assistant state's attorney maria mccarthy said tuesday during opening arguments, with prosecutors noting rudd had been living with another woman until the day before his marriage to kumeta and resumed living with her a week after kumeta's death. They would marry eight months later, per the daily herald. Yet defense lawyers say there's no evidence to suggest rudd knew he was beneficiary of kumeta's policies, or that she didn't die in a car accident as rudd has long claimed, per the daily herald. Indeed, kumeta's death was initially ruled an accident based on rudd's account of her hitting her head on a rock after being thrown from their car as another driver forced them off the road. But that narrative has since been called into question after a 2015 police interview in which rudd made no mention of a rock, per the daily herald, and a 2013 autopsy on kumeta's exhumed body indicating murder via blunt force trauma to the head. The developments coincide with an investigation into the 1991 murder of loretta tabak-bodtke, a rudd client shot to death in her home on the same day rudd's car was seen there.

        "summary": "A knife-wielding man went on a deadly rampage at the heart of britain's seat of power wednesday, first using what nbc news describes as a 4x4 vehicle to mow down pedestrians on london's westminster bridge before stabbing an armed police officer to death inside the gates of parliament. Four people were killed, including the attacker, and about 40 others were injured, the ap reports. Lawmakers, lords, staff, and visitors were locked down as the man was shot by police within the perimeter of parliament and just yards from entrances to the building itself after he scaled the security wall toward the parliament's grounds. He died, as did two pedestrians on the bridge, and the police officer. A doctor who treated the wounded said some had \" catastrophic \" injuries. Three teenage french students were among those injured on the bridge, the guardian reports. Police said they were treating the attacks as a terrorist incident and had launched a full counterterrorism investigation. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. \" we are satisfied at this stage that it looks like there was only one attacker, \" said metropolitan police counterterrorism chief mark rowley. \" but it would be foolish to be overconfident early on. \" the threat level for international terrorism in the uk was already listed at severe, meaning an attack is \" highly likely. \" wednesday was the anniversary of suicide bombings in the brussels airport and subway that killed 32 people, and the latest events echoed recent vehicle attacks in berlin and nice, france. As lawmakers were voting inside parliament, many reported hearing the sound of gunshots. Parliament was locked down for two hours, and adjoining westminster subway station was shuttered.",

It is in reaction to the kidnapping and murders of three israeli teenagers in june near bethlehem. Israel has named three palestinians as suspects. The murders and the revenge killing of a palestinian teen by israelis helped spark the recent fighting between israel and hamas in gaza. The u.s. State department is calling the israeli land takeover \" counterproductive \" in peace efforts and is asking israel to reconsider. Chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat is condemning the move as part of what he calls israeli crimes against the palestinian people and their occupied land. A spokesman for the anti-settlement group peace now, yariv oppenheimer, said the settlement expansion will hurt the chances for further israeli peace negotiations with palestinian president mahmoud abbas. \" this new declaration of expansion of settlement by the israeli government is very significant.

Officials say the 39-year-old delta force commando was shot to death in a firefight during a raid that freed at least 70 isis captives, including 20 members of the iraqi security forces, in northeastern iraq on thursday, reports nbc news and the sequoyah county times. A husband and father of four boys, wheeler joined the army in 1995 after graduating high school, and moved up the ranks from infantryman to rifle team leader, squad leader, weapons squad leader, and anti-tank section leader. He was deployed to afghanistan and iraq three times before joining the us army special operations command in 2004. He was then deployed 11 times in support of combat operations in iraq and afghanistan. The times reports that relatives of wheeler, who was based in fort bragg, north carolina, have traveled to that state, where wheeler will be buried. In speaking about the thursday raid, a defense official tells cbs news that a \" call was made on the ground \" for us forces to intervene when the kurdish region's organized militia, known as the peshmerga, fell under isis fire. A pentagon press secretary calls the mission a peshmerga rescue operation and says it was \" consistent with our counter-( isis ) effort to train, advise, and assist iraqi forces. \" he adds that defense secretary ash carter approved the mission because \" lives were at risk, \" per abc news. \" it is always a tragedy when we lose one of our own, \" a military rep says. \" in the end, we saved 70 people from execution that was planned in a few hours. \" the army times reports four peshmerga soldiers were also wounded.",

The 36-year-old has entered the 2017 edition of the record book with the \" largest collection of coprolite, \" gathered from 15 states and eight countries. Frandsen, who runs the poozeum website, secured his guinness spot with 1,277 samples, but his site notes he's gathered \" several thousand more \" since the august 2015 count. Per an article over the summer on earth touch news network, frandsen became \" immediately hooked \" on hardened dung when he came across a sample in a utah fossil shop as a college freshman, earning him the first entry in his collection. These types of fossils don't pop up very often, but they often offer valuable insight into what animals of a particular era ate. Another highlighted piece in frandsen's collection is one that shows signs of \" aborted coprophagy \" — meaning an animal tried to eat it and then spit it right back out. Guinness notes that an expert in this sort of thing has indeed verified each and every piece in frandsen's collection ( they're rock-hard and emit zero smell, if you were wondering how awful that job must be ). For other dream-seekers looking to make their mark in guinness, frandsen offers this nugget: \" have … lots of passion for whatever [ you're ] doing. Mine is … fossilized feces … whatever your passion, you should follow it. \" ( headed to the uk anytime soon? there's a poop museum you can visit. )",

Here's how fact-checkers score the bout: nearly every fact-checker blasted mitt romney for asserting that president obama \" has opened up no new markets for american goods around the world. \" actually, obama has opened up south korea, panama, and colombia, in the biggest free trade expansion since nafta. Though, as a romney spokesman points out to usa today, all were negotiated under bush; obama fought to get them through congress. Newt gingrich called obama the \" best food stamp president in american history. \" politifact rated that half-true; yes, more people are on food stamps than ever, but that's thanks to policies and economic conditions obama inherited. Ron paul said the us had no income tax until 1913, but one was actually instituted temporarily in 1861 to pay for the civil war. Rick santorum said his ads \" have been positive, \" and only contrasted himself with other candidates \" in a way talking about issues. \" but the ap points out that his latest ad dings romney as \" just like obama, \" among other attacks that go beyond issues. Gingrich asserted that chile's private retirement system is \" totally voluntary. \" actually, it's completely mandatory. Romney asserted that \" three years into office, [ obama ] doesn't have a jobs plan. \" the ap points out that \" like them or not, obama has proposed several plans. \" gingrich said romney \" raised taxes, \" and romney said he \" reduced taxes 19 times. \" neither is totally true; romney cut income tax, but raised revenue in business taxes and higher fees and fines.",

Police are investigating reports that hazing drove marquise braham to commit suicide, and the local police chief says it could result in homicide charges. \" depending on the nature of what this hazing was, it could rise to an assault, and if this young man was distraught over what happened, whether he received hazing or was part of it, we can link that to the perpetrators. \" one twist in this case is that braham's family thinks the main problem was that braham was the haz-er, not the haz-ee, and felt guilty about it, reports the altoona mirror. Braham served as the fraternity secretary of his phi sigma kappa chapter and participated in the hazing of pledges, says a family spokesperson. A photo from his cellphone obtained by the mirror shows a young man blindfolded with a gun to his head ( apparently a pledge, not braham ), and texts refer to the use of the drug ecstasy within the frat. Before his suicide, braham reportedly spoke to an aunt about his need to confess. \" it's what happened in altoona that sent him off the roof of the marrott in new york, \" says his father, rich. \" it's clear he didn't want to go back there. \" the school has suspended the fraternity while the investigation continues, and braham's former frat brothers aren't talking to police, reports wjac.",

All the victims were men, and authorities say five of them drowned while snorkeling — bringing the death toll in the space of two weeks to almost a third of the 17 snorkeling deaths hawaii experiences in an average year. The drownings have raised concerns about recently introduced models of full-face snorkeling masks, which critics say can trap dangerous levels of carbon dioxide, reports ktvu. \" some people say it makes them sleepy. We know that it can exacerbate panic, which i think is the big culprit in most of these incidents you are seeing now across hawaii, \" retailer robert winter tells hawaii news now. He says that after field-testing the masks, which cover the eyes, nose, and mouth, he refuses to sell them. Maui fire police chief edward taomoto says that while it's too early to make a connection to the equipment and the recent rise in drownings, \" there is speculation that there may be an unforeseen buildup of carbon dioxide within the breathing chamber in the one-piece, full-face mask design. \" \" if a person were not getting enough oxygen, then it is possible for that person to lose consciousness, \" he tells the san francisco chronicle.",

Every time i get up to use the bathroom, the number has gone up. \" didion published her first novel in 1963, notes the guardian, and soon after gained widespread acclaim for slouching towards bethlehem, a collection of magazine essays. She's been writing fiction and non-fiction alike since, including the year of magical thinking, which won the 2005 national book award for non-fiction. The memoir chronicles her grief after the death of her husband, john dunne. Fans who pledge can get some interesting stuff in return, from didion's list of the 12 books you must read before you die ( $ 35 ) to the chance to have your two-page letter read aloud to her ( $ 350 ) to a pair of her sunglasses ( $ 2,500 ).",

The lawsuit states wohlers was upset about byron's personal life and tried to \" intimidate, harass, and threaten her. \" he took away her sweet tea then shot her with a stun gun in the chest and neck when she tried to get it back, the lawsuit claims. According to the ap, wohler told his superior that he fired the stun gun into a pillow at his house. He also filed a false police report about it. The lawsuit claims wohlers later tried to apologize to byron by sending her a picture of a cake. ( the news journal originally reported he sent her the actual cake. ) frosting on the cake reads \" sorry i tased you \" and shows two stick figures, one apparently shooting something with wires at the other.

        "summary": "Yet another setback in the search for flight 370: the first undersea mission to search for the malaysia airlines jet, scheduled to last 16 hours, was cut short after the bluefin-21 underwater drone exceeded its 2.8-mile operating limit, authorities say. The drone collected around six hours of footage yesterday, which did not provide any clues, reuters reports. Its sonar search is concentrating on a zone of around 230 square miles of indian ocean seabed, and authorities say it could take months to scan the entire area. The australian official in charge of the search says the bluefin-21 has been redeployed and other vehicles capable of going deeper could be deployed depending on what the drone spots, reports the bbc. That might have to be the case: the us navy captain handling bluefin-21 says that if the drone goes past its depth limits one more time, it will effectively be rendered useless. \" it could probably go down further than that once, but it wouldn't be functional after that, \" he told the guardian australia, noting that while its \" speed of deployment \" gave the bluefin-21 an edge, \" it's certainly not the tool i would use to do a very, very broad area sonar scan. \" the new york times, meanwhile, looks at china's role in the search and finds that the country's eagerness to show off its technological abilities may only have delayed finding the aircraft. Officials involved with the search say that while china is certainly committed to the search, false leads from its ships and satellites ended up wasting valuable days.",

            "Photo advertisement continue reading the main story kuala lumpur, malaysia — when a chinese government vessel took the world by surprise this month with its announcement that it had detected underwater signals that might have come from the missing malaysia airlines plane, china suddenly looked like the hero of the multinational search effort. Within days, however, the chinese claims were discounted, and attention shifted to another set of signals recorded by american personnel aboard an australian ship hundreds of miles away. Still, the chinese claims have exasperated some officials from the united states and other participating countries. The announcement was only one in a series of moves by china that might have been intended to project competence, according to officials and analysts, but only served to distract and delay the search effort. \"everybody wants to find the plane, \" said a senior defense department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to appear overly critical of the chinese. But, he continued, \"false leads slow down the investigation. \" continue reading the main story video most of the passengers on board malaysia airlines flight 370 were chinese citizens, so the matter became a top priority for china.

We're literally looking for folks to print out the entire internet. We have over 500 square meters of space to fill, with ceilings that are over 6 meters high. \" this exhibition ( if that's the right word for it ) will go on view july 26; when it ends in august, the paper will be recycled. The project was inspired by, and is dedicated to, aaron swartz, the programmer-activist who committed suicide earlier this year, and who had been accused by federal prosecutors of breaking various laws in the course of downloading a giant cache of academic articles from the jstor service. Like swartz, goldsmith is a believer in information availability. \"the amount of what he liberated was enormous -- we can't begin to understand the magnitude of his action until we begin to materialize and actualize it, \" goldsmith said when reached via email. \"this project tries to bring that point home. \" if you're familiar with goldsmith, the idea to print out the entire internet may not be a surprise: currently serving as the museum of modern art's first poet laureate, and the founding editor of ubuweb, a sprawling online archive of avant garde creativity, goldsmith is an unusual thinker, to say the least. His books include day ( which involved retyping an edition of the new york times ); solilquy ( which documentedevery word that he spoke for an entire week ); the recent seven american deaths and disasters ( transcripts of media reports from 9/11, the day john f. Kennedy was shot, and so on ); and uncreative writing ( which makes the case for repurposing existing texts into new forms of literature ). Still, even by goldsmith's standards, this scheme sounds like a doozy. In cooperation with ubuweb and labor, a gallery in mexico city, goldsmith has issued an open call to everyone everywhere to \"print out as much as of the web as you want — be it one sheet or a truckload, \" and send the printouts to the gallery. Not surprisingly, some have reacted to this with eye-rolling, or outrage. \"might be",

Perfect for adults who color — or as cnycentral.com calls them, colorists — crayola color escapes come in geometric, kaleidoscope, nature, or garden themes and include either colored pencils, markers, or watercolor pencils to help you bring artist claudia nice's black-and-white illustrations to life, per gizmodo. The kits aren't yet priced, but they should probably be considered an investment: the illustrations are 11 by 17 inches, so they can be framed and hung as art. Only hoping to try out your skills? crayola has also come out with four smaller coloring books from various hallmark artists. Crayola is marketing its coloring kits as a relaxing pastime, and colorists understand why. \" i just get settled on the couch at night, and i get into the flow of it, and all of a sudden i ' m so relaxed, \" says a woman who meets at a barnes &amp; noble in ithaca, ny, to color with other adults once a week. Still don't see what all the fuss is about? keep in mind that you can now find a coloring book on almost any subject, from game of thrones to ryan gosling. The national post reports canadians are especially keen on the new coloring trend: nine of the top 10 \" most wished for \" books on amazon canada this week are adult coloring books. The top \" most wished for \" book on amazon us? a harry potter coloring book.",

The nazca lines — described by unesco as \" a unique and magnificent artistic achievement that is unrivaled \" elsewhere in the prehistoric world — are thought to have been etched into the desert by the nazca people sometime before 500ad, and they include long lines and geometric shapes as well the shapes of animals and plants. Many scholars believe they were used for astronomic rituals, but one of peru's top experts tells el comercio that the new finds confirm the relationship between \" the ancient people who occupied this arid desert with rain and worship of water. \" ( another prehistoric find was made in spain recently — the oldest human poop ever discovered. )",

An insider tells bloomberg that the money will come from softbank's $ 100 billion technology fund, which includes $ 45 billion from saudi arabia.

Later that month, a young man was killed in a car accident in emporia, va. He was a passenger, likely a hitchhiker, and police were never able to identify him, in part because the accident disfigured his face. But he wore a grateful dead shirt and had grateful dead ticket stubs in his pocket, along with a note addressed to \" jason, \" reports myrtlebeachonline. The victim has been known as grateful doe ever since, and he's had supporters trying to unravel his identity all this time. A few years ago, virginia police issued a composite sketch, and the case has been generating interest on social media, complete with specific pages on facebook and reddit. A seemingly big break came recently when a man in urbana, ill., saw the sketch online and recognized the victim as a fellow deadhead named jason, though he couldn't remember a last name, reports illinois homepage. He posted more photos to social media sites trying to crack the case, and it appears that this renewed interest is related to the filing of the missing person report.

Margaretta evans, 63, told a myrtle beach police department officer that \"she has not seen or heard from her son since early june of 1995, \" according to a police report. Evans \"advised that he left to follow the grateful dead at that time, \" reported officer traci chanaca. The missing man, jason patrick callahan, would now be 38, evans told police. She described him as \"approximately 5 ' 10 \" to 6 ' 00 \" in height and approximately 160 pounds \" with \"wavy brown hair and brown eyes. \" while the police report does not indicate why evans waited two decades to report her son missing, the notification appears connected to the recent social media interest in the 1995 death",

A story by bloomberg businessweek reports that the us is in the midst of a secret three-year investigation of the scheme, which it says was uncovered by none other than amazon. Investigators say that a unit of china's people's liberation army planted chips the size of a pencil point onto computer motherboards being built for a us company called supermicro. One source explains that the company is the \" microsoft of the hardware world \" — its motherboards are used in servers around the world. Supermicro itself is not implicated and disputes the bloomberg report. \" one official says investigators found that it eventually affected almost 30 companies, including a major bank, government contractors, and the world's most valuable company, apple, \" write jordan robertson and michael riley. Apple, which has since severed ties with supermicro for what it says are unrelated reasons, says it has never found \" malicious chips \" in its products. The story says amazon found the chips while investigating a potential partnership with a startup and alerted the government, though amazon also disputes the account.

Not that this is surprising; even without the stroke and cancer warnings, the word \" artificial \" alone conjures up images of shadowy figures in lab coats concocting solutions destined for your stomach. Much more reassuring are images of freshly plowed farms tucked in the mountains, like the one on the jar of lundberg family farms ' organic brown rice syrup. Brown rice syrup is just one of many \" natural \" sweeteners that have taken off in the wake of the backlash against artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose, which, of course, were invented to defeat the dietary axis of evil -- refined white sugar and high fructose corn syrup. Once confined to berkeley communes, these not-refined-sugar, not-man-made substances pose a huge marketing opportunity, since most people who avoid sugar don't want to get cancer but also aren't ready to commit to a joyless, dessert-free existence. Natural sweeteners are the perfect answer to this conundrum. Right? the biggest problem is that the term \" natural \" is a slippery one.

The texas court of criminal appeals struck down part of a 2005 law that made it illegal to engage in sexually explicit talk online with kids. The judges decided that the law was too broadly written, reports the houston chronicle. It \" may protect children from suspected sexual predators before they ever express any intent to commit illegal sexual acts, but it prohibits the dissemination of a vast array of constitutionally protected speech and materials, \" said the opinion. For example, it could be interpreted to outlaw discussions of everything from 50 shades of grey and lolita to janet jackson's wardrobe malfunction and miley cyrus'twerking, said the judges, who added that existing laws already protect kids from predators. The case centered around a 53-year-old man accused of sending dirty texts to a teenager, charges that have now been dismissed. \" parents have the job of dealing with this, \" says his lawyer. \" this is not the government's job. \" prosecutors — who argued that \"perverts will be free to bombard our children with salacious emails and text messages \" — are considering a supreme court appeal.",

Researchers say people with an extreme aversion to certain sounds — like chewing, foot-tapping, or sniffing — may suffer from a condition known as misophonia, meaning \" hatred of sound, \" per the sydney morning herald. Experts say up to 20 % of people may suffer from it, and christine robinson is one of those people. She's so bothered by the sound of her husband chewing popcorn that she sometimes wears headphones when they watch tv. Why do such sounds annoy her more than others? experts aren't sure — misophonia only recently became more well-known as people starting googling their symptoms — but it may be caused by \" enhanced neural connections in the brain between the auditory, limbic, and autonomic systems, \" per the wall street journal. A 2014 study found sufferers also tend to show symptoms of anxiety, ocd, or depression; there's still debate over whether misophonia is a psychiatric disorder. Robinson guesses she's missed hundreds of family meals over the years because of her sensitivity. She even banned cereal from her house, but arguments still spring up when a family member starts crunching or slurping in her vicinity. \" i suspect it's like living with anyone who has a disability, \" says her husband. \" i have to respect that if i want to spend quality time with my family. \" experts say those with the condition should learn to cope, rather than try to change the habits of those around them. But for those who have trouble — one woman equates the condition to being trapped in a room with your worst enemy — a form of cognitive behavioral therapy in which misophonia sufferers are slowly introduced to sounds has been shown to work.

At work one day, she found it difficult to concentrate when trying to check reports while gingerly waiting for each soft pop of the grapes being eaten by the person at the next desk. Matters escalated when her neighbour produced crispbreads and a jar of peanut butter. Mcintyre politely, but unsuccessfully, asked her to stop. Crunch, crunch, crunch.
