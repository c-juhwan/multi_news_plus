Dash cam video obtained by khou shows the officers ' patrol car barreling toward them, forcing lewis to leap over the side of the bridge. He fell 30 feet to the rocks by the side of the flat bank bayou. Of course, the patrol car didn't move on its own. It was struck from behind by another car, driven by an allegedly drunk woman. Christie diane biggers, 46, a physical education teacher at a nearby elementary school, has been charged with intoxicated assault, the houston chronicle and wptv report. Lewis suffered a partially ruptured aorta and a fractured pelvis, but he's in stable condition and expected to recover, officer.com reports.",

        "summary": "It's just a small piece of a jawbone with five teeth, but its discovery in ethiopia is changing the timeline of human origins. Researchers say the bone is from an individual who lived 2.8 million years ago and belonged to the genus homo, the lineage from which modern humans emerged. In fact, this is the earliest known member of the group ever found — by about 400,000 years, reports ap. A student from arizona state university found the fossil in 2013 in the same general area where one of the most famous fossils in history was discovered, that of \" lucy, \" an ape-like ancestor that lived about 3 million years ago. The newly discovered fossil might be the link between lucy, or australopithecus afarensis, and the first primitive humans, reports the bbc. \" that's what we are arguing, \" says brian villmoare of the university of nevada in las vegas. \" by finding this jaw bone we've figured out where that trajectory started. This is the first homo. It marks in all likelihood a major adaptive transition. \" it's not clear yet whether the fossil belongs to a species of homo previously known, such as homo habilis, or is an entirely new one, reports the guardian. An expert from george washington university not involved with the find says it seems safe to conclude that the creature was either at the start of the homo line or \" within shouting distance. \" ( elsewhere, archaeologists found a long-lost city under the honduran jungle. )",

The death of 17-year-old mohammed abu khudair is widely believed to be a revenge killing for the deaths of three kidnapped israeli teenagers in the west bank, the la times reports. Hundreds of palestinians clashed with israeli forces in jerusalem after mohammed's body was found, reports the ap, which notes that hundreds of right-wing israeli youths marched through the city yesterday calling for revenge after the funeral of three teenagers. A relative says that the teen was bundled into a car around 3: 45am today; he had been sitting on a fence with friends as they waited for a pre-dawn meal in advance of ramadan fasting. Police have yet to establish a motive, though they were reportedly given the car's license plate number. Jerusalem's mayor condemned the killing as a \" horrible and barbaric act, \" and justice minister tzipi livni said there is \" zero tolerance \" for such crimes and those \" seeking to turn israel into a terrorist society \" will be punished. A senior official of palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas ' fatah movement says mohammed's family in north jerusalem has identified his body, which was found partly burned and bearing signs of violence. \" the israeli government bears responsibility for jewish terrorism and for the kidnapping and murder in occupied jerusalem, \" he tells reuters.",

Past victors describe to the guardian the high stakes of competing and what they're doing now, with one calling it \" one of the most unique, odd clubs you can be in. \" of course there's the pressure, including the obsessive rote memorization ( you need to study the dictionary once you get to the national level ), the ability to master latin and greek roots, and the painful experience of the \" crying room, \" where kids go after they've misspelled a word. On the other hand, many admit their wins instilled in them confidence, ambition, and a stellar work ethic: past winners grew up to be a nasa aerospace engineer, an attorney, a pulitzer-prize winning journalist, and even a poker champ who won nearly $ 840,000 in 2014. But not everyone is enthusiastic about what the bee means, to the winners or losers. Rebecca sealfon, who won in 1997 by spelling \" euonym \" correctly, compares the competition to the hunger games and says \" americans particularly enjoy watching winners win and losers lose. \" and indian-american writer lavanya ramanathan, who grew up in a similarly competitive household, writes of the bee winners for the washington post, \" when they're 30 … will these kids wish that they'd played soccer instead? because i do. \" meanwhile, to help you while away ( not wile away ) the time before the main event, usa today wants to fill your brain with all things bee-related, including fun stats, the odd preponderance of foodie-related words in the contest so far, and an interactive quiz that throws past winning words at you to test your own skills.

A friend who lived with victim deah barakat until barakat's december wedding says hicks complained regularly — roughly once a month — that the men were parking in a visitor's space in addition to their assigned spot. \" he would come over to the door, knock on the door, and then have a gun on his hip saying, ' you guys need to not park here, ' \" imad ahmad tells the ap. Hicks returned after barakat and yusor mohammad abu-salha were married, per ahmad, who says property managers \" told us to call the police if the guy came and harassed us again. \" more details: hicks was unemployed, studying to be a paralegal, and had a concealed weapons permit. The new york times adds these details: he had posted an image to facebook of what he described as his.38-caliber, five-shot revolver; his apartment reportedly butted up against the building's main parking lot, while the victims lived in an area of the complex that was light on parking. \" anytime that i saw him or saw interaction with him or friends or anyone in the parking lot or myself, he was angry, \" a woman who lives nearby tells the ap. Karen hicks, who has defended her husband, now says she's divorcing him. She made the announcement through her lawyer and gave no reason for the split. Meanwhile, hicks ' ex-wife, cynthia hurley, says hicks was obsessed with the 1993 movie falling down, in which a divorced and unemployed engineer goes on a shooting spree: \" he watched it incessantly. He thought it was hilarious. He had no compassion at all. \" the couple's marriage ended in the late ' 90s. Mohammad abu-salha, father of victims yusor and razan mohammad abu-salha, remains confident the murders were a hate crime. \" the media here bombards the american citizen with islamic, islamic, islamic terrorism and makes people here scared of us and hate us and want us out, \" he says. The us attorney for the middle district of north carolina calls the shooting \" an isolated incident \" that was \" not part of a target campaign against muslims. \" funerals for all three victims will be held today at the islamic center of raleigh. Some 2,000 people turned out for a candlelight vigil on the university of north carolina campus last night, where friends described the young people as kind and selfless, wtvd reports.",

On friday, the longtime arizona senator underwent \" minimally invasive \" surgery to remove a 2-inch blood clot from \" above his left eye, \" per a statement from his office. The surgery involved a craniotomy, an opening of the skull, via an eyebrow incision. And while mccain's surgeons at the mayo clinic in phoenix aren't speaking to the press, dr. Nrupen baxi, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york city, tells the times, \" the recovery time from a craniotomy is usually a few weeks. \" mccain, 80, is currently recovering at home. Mccain's condition raises several questions, both medical and political. Doctors say mccain's age and history of melanoma could point to a possible stroke or a condition related to skin cancer. Meanwhile, politicians and pundits are speculating on the effect an extended recovery for mccain could have on the republicans ' health care legislation. On sunday, sen. Rand paul, one of two republican senators who've come out so far against the gop bill, said on face the nation, \" i think the longer the bill's out there, the more conservative republicans are going to discover that it's not [ a ] repeal, \" cbs news reports.

A federal register post last week announcing that cbd hemp oil is now considered a schedule 1 drug offered a new code for \" marihuana extract \" and spelled it thusly in the dedicated section. But while some pot advocates have mused the alternate spelling may have been employed as a way to dodge web searches on marijuana policy changes, the post takes a closer look at a spelling \" freighted with historical significance. \" to wit: in the late 19th century, the pot plant was usually just called \" cannabis, \" but things changed after 1898's spanish-american war, when \" american resentment toward mexicans and mexican immigrants exploded, \" per brookings institution expert john hudak. \" marijuana \" and \" marihuana \" were both used in mexican spanish speech at the time, and so us anti-drug officials decided to hijack both spellings to turn people off to smoking pot by \" [ exploiting ] prejudice against despised minority groups, especially mexican immigrants, \" medical marijuana activist martin lee notes in a 2013 book he wrote on the subject. Maybe by chance, the \" h \" spelling ended up being the version that landed in the marihuana tax act of 1937, as well as in the controlled substances act decades later. So why did the \" h \" start getting phased out in the ' 60s? experts aren't sure, but one theory is that as more americans caught on to the pronunciation of spanish words, the \" j \" became more commonplace. The post notes that even \" marijuana \" may be falling out of grace, with drug advocates and researchers pushing to go back to the simple and non-loaded \" cannabis. \"",

Per cnn, the american destroyer uss decatur was aggressively approached by a chinese warship while conducting what are called freedom of navigation operations in the spratly islands. In a statement, capt. Charles brown with the us pacific fleet said a chinese luyang destroyer approached the us vessel in an \" unsafe and unprofessional \" maneuver. According to cbs news, the chinese vessel came with 45 yards of the decatur, a dangerous proximity that forced the decatur to maneuver away in order to prevent a collision. The encounter is an extreme example of the recent tense us-china relations in the region. Just last week, china refused a request for the us navy's amphibious assault ship, the uss wasp, to dock in hong kong next month. In spite of these and other setbacks, including his own canceled state visit to beijing, defense secretary jim mattis said monday that us-china relations are not worsening, per the ap. \" there's tension points in the relationship, but based on discussions coming out of new york last week and other things that we have coming up, we do not see it getting worse, \" mattis told reporters in paris. \" we ' ll sort this out. \" back in the pacific, capt.

The little girl, identified as zainab, 2, was diagnosed just a few weeks ago with neuroblastoma, a rare kind of blood cancer that typically only strikes children ages 5 and younger, wplg reports. She's going to require a substantial number of blood transfusions during upcoming cancer treatments, so the oneblood nonprofit blood distributor has opened up a worldwide search for donors. The reason it needs such a wide-reaching effort: zainab requires \" o \" or \" a \" blood types, and only from donors whose birth parents are 100 % iranian, pakistani, or indian. Narrowing the field further is the fact that donors would also need to be missing the \" indian b \" antigen commonly found in blood, just like zainab. \" the possibility of us finding a compatible donor for this little girl within the right ethnic group we want to screen is less than 4 %, \" a oneblood lab manager says. Even zainab's own parents don't qualify. Oneblood, which hopes for between seven and 10 donors, has set up a dedicated page where interested parties can apply to see if they're a perfect match, per cbs miami. So far the group says it has found three matches: two right here in the us, and one across the pond in the uk. Fox 35 notes it's the first time oneblood has found an international donor for a local recipient. \" what you're doing to save a human life, my daughter's life, is amazing, \" zainab's dad tells those who've already applied, per wplg.

Legal experts tell the washington post that the remarks from giuliani, who recently joined president trump's legal team, could provide investigators with new leads and new evidence. Giuliani not only revealed that trump reimbursed lawyer michael cohen for a hush money payment to stormy daniels, analysts note, he strongly suggested it was made to protect the campaign, strengthening the case for a possible campaign finance violation. He also hinted at other payments, saying that out of a $ 35,000-a-month retainer, \" there probably were other things of a personal nature that michael took care of. \" in other developments: \" trump just added to the chaos. \" insiders tell the new york times that other members of trump's legal team were blindsided by giuliani's remarks and scrambled to find out whether he had meant to reveal that trump reimbursed cohen. \" everyone is wondering, what in the world is he doing? \" says new york democratic consultant george arzt. \" i would not have sent out rudy to talk about the investigation.

The experiments on lab mice showed that those immune cells, called microglia, began to \" divide and change \" in the disease's early stages. The cells released an enzyme that consumes the nutrient arginine, which cbs news ' chief medical correspondent explains is key to \" the health of neurons of nerve cells, \" particularly in parts of the brain tied to memory. When researchers then used a cancer drug ( one not previously tested on alzheimer's ) to block the enzyme release before the onset of symptoms in mice, they were able to prevent the disease's \" characteristic brain plaques and memory loss, \" the release explains. Lead author carol colton says the findings \" break the stalemate of ideas in alzheimer's, \" and the guardian explains why. Trials for alzheimer's drugs have been a resounding failure ( 99.6 % of them between 2002 and 2012 ), and those drugs have mainly attempted to do the same thing: chip away at the accumulation of sticky plaques. But new research suggests that by the time the plaques are there, it's already too late. The guardian does present one caveat to the study, explaining that the lab mice used \" are not a perfect parallel for what happens in human brains. \" ( another potential cause of memory loss: sleep apnea and snoring. )",

Figure 1.71 days. That was the average time for six brave volunteers who swallowed a lego head, then dutifully kept an eye on their bowel movements, reports forbes. Yes, this is an actual study, one that appeared in the journal of paediatrics and child health. But, no, even the researchers themselves aren't taking it too seriously, calling it \" a bit of fun in the run up to xmas \" in a related blog post. Further proof of that sentiment is found in the study itself, which uses a stool hardness and transit score, as well as a found and retrieved time score. It's all about the acronyms. Still, six people did ingest the lego heads and then keep an eye on things, leading to the study conclusions: \" a toy object quickly passes through adult subjects with no complications. This will reassure parents, and the authors advocate that no parent should be expected to search through their child's faeces to prove object retrieval. \" but maybe the most notable result is that, as gizmodo reports, one of the six never found the lego head. Did the person miss it? is it still in there somewhere? the researchers — all pediatric health professionals who doubled as the lego-eating volunteers — have no clue, but they don't sound worried. \" perhaps one day many years from now, a gastroenterologist performing a colonoscopy will find it staring back at him, \" they write. ( if you've ever stepped on a lego, you can relate to this man's feat. )",

Daryl kemsley, a 22-year-old youtuber and car aficionado, tells fox 13 that his dream car, a 1981 delorean driven just 8,100 miles, began to smoke after it was rear-ended in a hit-and-run in orem on friday, after kemsley had decided to sell it for $ 70,000. Kemsley says he pulled into a rite aid parking lot and watched as the car — one of about 9,000 made between 1981 and 1982 — caught flame. The vehicle was eventually destroyed, but kemsley says he could've saved it — and perhaps avoided minor burns — if a rite aid employee hadn't impeded him. According to kemsley, a female employee refused to let him borrow the store's fire extinguisher, claiming it was company property, and declined to use it herself, saying she didn't know how. \" i stood there in front of her for minutes begging and pleading … all while the flames got bigger, \" kemsley writes in a facebook post.

On tuesday, the deadliest sectarian clashes in several years left 13 people dead in a village south of cairo after muslims clashed with christians, who make up 10 % of egypt's population. A us state department spokesman condemned the violence. \" it's important for egyptians to remember the sense of unity in tahrir square just a few weeks ago and to refrain from any kind of violence — and to go back to that sense of peaceful demonstration and expression, \" he said.",

Greer, who's suing the department and two officers for $ 15 million over an incident in 2014 that led to him being shot seven times, is accused of shooting 22-year-old kevin larry dead less than two weeks ago in a dispute over a dice game, usa today reports. Police say a bulletin warning that greer was armed and dangerous was issued within hours of the may 27 shooting, and officers were sent to arrest him as soon as the department learned of the press conference he was holding. At the press conference, greer and his attorney released video of the july 4, 2014, incident showing him running away from two officers, the tribune reports. Greer, who was accused of involvement in another murder days after the incident but wasn't charged, admits that he was carrying an illegal gun, which discharged as he threw it away during the chase. The lawsuit accuses the officers of using excessive force by shooting him so many times, including four times while he was on the ground. \" i asked why is they shooting me this many times, \" greer told reporters. \" i thought i was fixin'to die. \" greer, who says he has been unable to work since he was shot, is still awaiting trial for unlawful discharge of a weapon over the incident and also has a pending domestic battery charge.

Reduced winds are expected today, but forecasters still see \"extreme \" growth potential for the bastrop fire; some 5,000 people have been evacuated. The blaze continues a disastrous year for texas wildfires, with 3.5 million acres burned and six of the 10 biggest wildfires in texas history occurring this year. \"there are so many big fires — 23 and counting — there are simply not enough firefighters and aircraft to go around, \" says an npr reporter.

A federal judge has ordered the release of the 67-year-old, who was placed in solitary in 1972 after the death of a guard in a riot at louisiana state penitentiary, which is better known as angola, the guardian reports. In his ruling, us district judge james brady took the unusual step of banning the state from trying woodfox for the guard's murder for a third time, citing his age, health, the \" prejudice done onto \" him by more than 40 years in solitary confinement, and \" the very fact that mr. Woodfox has already been tried twice, \" the ap reports. Woodfox, who was in prison for armed robbery at the time of the guard's death, has always maintained his innocence and says he and the two other members of the \" angola three \" were singled out because of their black panther activism, reports the guardian. A supporter tells the ap that the order for unconditional release is a \" unicorn \" because it is so rare — although the state seems determined to keep woodfox behind bars. Officials say louisiana attorney general buddy caldwell is seeking an emergency stay \" to make sure this murderer stays in prison and remains fully accountable for his actions, \" the new orleans times-picayune reports.

They accounted for 18 % of cases, while fruit and eggs each accounted for 12 %. Chicken was the most problematic meat, explaining 10 % of cases, with beef and pork close behind. Meat was the biggest culprit, however, when it came to a type of e. Coli, with beef accounting for 46 % of illnesses. Vegetable row crops were second, at 36 %. The february study supports previous findings that plants can be more risky than meats in terms of illnesses from food. Along with salmonella and e. Coli o157, researchers looked at two other \" high priority \" illnesses: listeria, for which fruit was the top source, and campylobacter, which was most associated with dairy, the atlantic reports.

Knowing britain could starve without us supplies, he approved a test project aimed at delivering 2,000-foot-long ice ships with 40-foot hulls that german torpedoes could never sink. Canadian scientists helped out by building a model-sized version and reported good results — but the chief scientist was mortified when britain ordered 11 full-scale vessels. He knew that huge carriers needed hulls made of stronger stuff. Herman mark, a refugee chemist from austria, suggested building the ships from a new material called pykrete that froze wood pulp mixed with water. He even impressed churchill by tossing a pykrete sample into the british leader's tub while he bathed, proving how slowly it melted. But britain eventually scuttled the idea in favor of less zany developments, like air bases in iceland and longer-range bombers. Newly unearthed archives show that new zealand also tested unusual technology during wwii: underwater bombs designed to trigger tsunamis in the pacific.

Author ray waru said he wrote secrets and treasures to highlight the material publicly available at archives new zealand in wellington - where almost 100 kilometres of shelf space is crammed with historical artefacts. \" it was totally overwhelming at the beginning, \" he said. \" i knew i wanted to get in the important things, the treaty of waitangi ( new zealand's founding document ), the declaration of independence, the women's suffrage petition, and a few other things. \" but once you start digging, one story leads onto another and i'd just follow my nose. \" the suffrage petition waru refers to contains 36,000 signatures and was dramatically unfurled on the floor of the new zealand parliament in 1893 by supporters of women's right to vote. Stretching for almost 300 metres, the petition, currently undergoing restoration, proved successful and led new zealand, then a british colony, to become the first country in the world to grant women the vote later that year. Alongside notable historical documents, such as a letter written by explorer captain james cook before his final voyage, are curiosities like \" project seal \", a top-secret us-new zealand attempt to create a doomsday device to rival the nuclear bomb. The project was launched in june 1944 after a us naval officer noticed that blasting operations to clear coral reefs around pacific islands sometimes produced a large wave, raising the possibility of creating a \" tsunami",

President barack obama met cuban president raul castro on saturday in the highest-level talks between the two countries in nearly 60 years, and the two men agreed to push ahead on improving relations after decades of hostility. Describing their private meeting as \" historic, \" obama said the two countries can end the antagonism of the cold war era, although he said he would continue to pressure the communist-led country on democracy and human rights. ‎ \" we are now in a position to move on a path toward the future, \" obama told castro as they met in panama, where they were both attending a summit of leaders from across the americas. Speaking to reporters later, obama made plain the two countries would still have their differences. \" we have very different views of how society should be organized and i was very direct with him that we are not going to stop talking about issues like democracy and human rights and freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, \" he said. The two men agreed in december to move to normalize relations, including seeking to restore diplomatic ties that were broken off by washington in 1961. Obama said he decided to overturn longstanding u.s. Policy on cuba because the old approach of open hostility and economic sanctions had failed to force through major changes on the island and it was time",
            "Panama city ( cnn ) this was the handshake that shook the western hemisphere. President obama briefly met his cuban counterpart, raul castro, on friday night at a dinner for the dozens of latin american leaders convening in panama city for the summit of the americas. This was historic. The two nations have barely been on speaking terms -- officially -- for more than 50 years. The meeting was so important that bernadette meehan, national security council spokesperson, issued a statement: \" at the summit of the americas this evening, president obama and president castro greeted each other and shook hands. \" president obama greets and shakes hands with cuban leader raul castro at the summit of the americas in panama city, panama. Cuba and the united states had endured a half-century of enmity, the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart. Key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern u.s. History, such as the cuban missile crisis, the bay of pigs and the mariel boatlift of 1980. But the two leaders have been building up to the historic face-to-face. Obama spoke by phone wednesday with the cuban leader before heading to panama. They met friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on saturday when the summit begins in earnest. Obama arrived in panama"

        "summary": "Mercury's mysterious surface darkness has baffled scientists: though it's far closer to the sun than our moon, the latter reflects more sunlight. Last year, it was proposed that the root cause is carbon. As patrick peplowski of the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory tells the christian science monitor, \" when you think of charcoal or you think of pencil lead, it's really dark. So if there was a little bit of carbon mixed in \" with the surface elements, that would explain the darkening. But the solar system's planets don't have much carbon in their crusts, meaning mercury would have to be an anomaly. And as peplowski and his team determined after reviewing data taken during the 2011-2015 messenger mission, it is. His team surmises that when mercury was but a young planet 4.6 billion years ago, its hot surface was likely covered in an ocean of molten lava, which when cooled slowly over time would see its minerals solidify and sink, per a press release. But graphite ( a crystalline form of carbon ) is so light it would remain buoyant and harden into the planet's original crust. As the millennia passed, a new crust would have covered that one courtesy of volcanic activity, and \" we propose that the heavily disrupted remnants of this ancient layer persist beneath the present upper crust, \" they write in nature geoscience. Further, whenever a meteor hit the planet hard enough to expose that ancient layer, what universe today terms the \" peculiar \" dark spots also visible today would have occurred. ( nasa's impact on mercury can literally be measured as a 52-foot-wide crater. )",

            "Ever since the messenger spacecraft entered orbit around mercury in 2011, and indeed even since mariner 10's flyby in 1974, peculiar \"dark spots \" observed on the planet's surface have intrigued scientists as to their composition and origin. Now, thanks to high-resolution spectral data acquired by messenger during the last few months of its mission, researchers have confirmed that mercury's dark spots contain a form of carbon called graphite, excavated from the planet's original, ancient crust. Commonly found within and around impact craters and volcanic vents, the dark spots on mercury — also referred to as \"low-reflectance material, \" or lrm — were originally suspected to contain carbon delivered to the planet by comets. Data from messenger's gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer ( grns ) and x-ray instruments confirmed the lrm to contain high amounts of graphitic carbon, but likely originating from within mercury itself. It's thought that mercury was once covered by a crust composed of graphite, when much of the planet was still molten. \"experiments and modeling show that as this magma ocean cooled and minerals began to crystallize, minerals that solidified would all sink with the exception of graphite, which would have been buoyant and would have accumulated as the original crust of mercury, \" said rachel klima, co-author of a recent study on lrm and a planetary geologist",
            "Washington, d.c. — scientists have long been puzzled about what makes mercury's surface so dark. The innermost planet reflects much less sunlight than the moon, a body on which surface darkness is controlled by the abundance of iron-rich minerals. These are known to be rare at mercury's surface, so what is the \"darkening agent \" there? about a year ago, scientists proposed that mercury's darkness was due to carbon that gradually accumulated from the impact of comets that traveled into the inner solar system. Now scientists, led by patrick peplowski of the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory, have used data from the messenger mission* to confirm that a high abundance of carbon is present at mercury's surface. However, they also have also found that, rather than being delivered by comets, the carbon most likely originated deep below the surface, in the form of a now-disrupted and buried ancient graphite-rich crust, some of which was later brought to the surface by impact processes after most of mercury's current crust had formed. The results are published in the march 7, 2016, advanced online publication of nature geoscience.

            "Ever since the messenger spacecraft entered orbit around mercury in 2011, and indeed even since mariner 10's flyby in 1974, peculiar \"dark spots \" observed on the planet's surface have intrigued scientists as to their composition and origin. Now, thanks to high-resolution spectral data acquired by messenger during the last few months of its mission, researchers have confirmed that mercury's dark spots contain a form of carbon called graphite, excavated from the planet's original, ancient crust.

The emergency huddle of the finance chiefs of the us, uk, german, italy, france, japan, and canada underscores a mounting panic about the crushing debt of the european union. Greece, ireland, and portugal are all operating under international bailout programs, and officials fear a bank run in spain, fallout from greece's upcoming election, and an increasingly dire global impact. Germany appears willing to pool eu debt, but only if member nations agree to stricter controls and some kind of central supervision of government spending, reports the new york times. Finding the way to \"more europe, not less \" is the task for europe's leaders now, german chancellor angela merkel said yesterday. One likely scenario is a plan to combine much of europe's bad debt into a single fund with an aim to pay it off over 25 years. Accompanying that would be an expansion of executive power in brussels over member nations ' fiscal targets, as well as supervision of banks, and europe-wide deposit insurance, notes the times. \" we will discuss to what extent we need to put systemically relevant banks under a specific european supervisory authority so that national interests do not play such a large role, \" merkel said yesterday. The plan faces stiff resistance from the powerful german banks, which argue that european-wide deposit insurance would mean using german savings to prop up weak banks beyond their borders, and weaken german institutions in turn, notes the wall street journal.

        "summary": "The syracuse post-standard has a medical story equal parts amazing and scary: doctors who thought a 41-year-old woman was dead were preparing to remove her organs when she opened her eyes in the operating room. St. Joseph's hospital health center eventually got fined $ 6,000 by the state after investigators found a series of mistakes in the near disaster, the most jarring of which is that doctors disregarded a nurse's observation that the patient had been showing signs of improvement and was not, in fact, dead. The woman had overdosed on xanax and other drugs, and doctors concluded she had suffered not only a \" cardiac death \" but irreversible brain damage, reports the newspaper. Neither was the case. Doctors scheduled the organ removal even after a nurse noticed that the woman's toes curled during a reflex exam; she also appeared to be breathing independently of her respirator. And still, the operation went forward, or would have had the woman not opened her eyes. A sad coda: the patient was released from the hospital two weeks after the incident, but she killed herself more than a year later, in 2011. ( details are just now coming to light thanks to a foia request by the post-standard. ) st. Joseph's tells the new york daily news it regrets the error and worked to set things right by the patient's family, which did not want the incident discussed publicly. Click for the full story. ( this isn't the first instance of a supposedly dead person waking up, either; there was this time. And this time. And this time. And this time. Yeah, it happens a lot. )",

Two bodies were found inside a room of a building at joint base san antonio-lackland, bexar county sheriff's spokesman james keith said. It's believed the shooter is among the two dead, keith said, adding that sheriff's deputies and other law enforcement officers are continuing to search the building and nearby facilities. Joint base san antonio-lackland is the home of air force basic training. The army's fort sam houston and lackland air force base were combined during base realignment several years ago to become the military's largest joint base. About 160 miles northeast of the joint base is fort hood, which in 2009 was the site of the deadliest shooting at a u.s. Military base, when 13 people were killed and 31 were injured. ___ this story has been corrected to show that fort hood is northeast of the joint base, not southwest."

        "summary": "It seems that palindromes — phrases that read the same forward and backward — have been popular for a very long time. Researchers have discovered an amulet in cyprus dating back some 1,500 years, and the words inscribed form such a phrase, livescience reports. Translated from greek, the words say, \" iahweh is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of re secure in his shrine. \" well, they almost say that: the person who carved the amulet made a few mistakes with the letters, an expert says. The amulet was actually discovered in 2011, but professor joachim sliwa of the university of krakow is detailing it now. It's one of several examples of ancient palindromes, he says. On the other side of the amulet, there's an image which also has some apparent mistakes; it features what appears to be a pair of gods, osiris and harpocrates, along with a being called a cynocephalus that has a dog's head. \" it is iconographically based on egyptian sources, but these sources were not fully understood by the creator of the amulet, \" sliwa writes in studies in ancient art and civilization. The amulet is further evidence of how paganism continued to exist despite bans in the eastern roman empire, another researcher notes. The amulet was discovered at nea paphos, an ancient city that is part of a unesco world heritage site, as ancient origins notes. ( shipwrecks recently offered a new look at the byzantine empire. )",

The reporter explains her star power with these standout figures: an average 16,000 letters were sent to her a month; one birthday, fans sent her 167,000 presents. Temple was spotted at a los angeles dance school, and soon appeared in a series of one-reelers called \" baby burlesks, \" which she later called \" a cynical exploitation of our childish innocence that occasionally were racist or sexist. \" her first feature film was stand up and cheer in 1934, the bbc reports; at age 6, she was making $ 1,250 per week — with her mother serving as her hairstylist for each film, forming an exact 56 curls every time.

The sydney morning herald reports an unnamed 35-year-old was charged with common assault and destroying or damaging property following the friday afternoon islamophobic incident, which spurred two viral videos. Ramzy alamudi and and his wife, a muslim student who had just sat for the last exam of her medical science degree at macquarie university in sydney, were in their car in a university parking lot when the asian woman walked up to them. \" the lady... Sticks her middle finger right at us, \" writes alamudi, who says he then asked the woman if everything was ok. \" she blows up in a rage... Starts pointing at my wife and screaming ' f**k you! take it off!! ' \" \" it \" was her niqab, the islamic veil his wife wears, he explains. As the woman approached their car, alamudi told his wife to start recording. The ensuing video has been watched more than 1.5 million times. Alamudi writes that the woman keyed his car, repeatedly banged on the windows and tried to open the doors, while dropping the f-bomb and saying \" who are you? \" over and over, before suggesting his wife was a \" terrorist \" who scared her. Witness emily guff, whose own video has been viewed 250,000 times, writes, \" the whole time this woman was having her rant, her baby was sitting in her unlocked car, meters from where she was hurling abuse. \" added alamudi, \" her hate clearly held priority over her child. \"",

Thanks to misguided laws, they can't be refinanced and the debt can't be shed through bankruptcy. To make matters worse, the government uses an \" army of private debt collectors \" to harass student borrowers without relief. \" how do we quit loading up 18-year-olds with a risky gamble that could impact the rest of their lives? \" some interesting proposals are out there, including one to refinance student loans at 4 % and another that would link the amount students have to pay back to their income. \" ultimately, keeping college affordable is the answer, \" writes dayen, and katrina vanden heuvel at the washington post hits on a similar theme today. \" this isn't complicated, \" she writes. \" washington should be moving boldly to make advanced education affordable for all. The federal government should be increasing grants to states for public colleges, on the condition that the states increase their own contributions and act to curb college costs. \" cracking down on shady for-profit colleges also would help.

Trump and his national security adviser, michael flynn, didn't elaborate on what retaliatory actions the u.s. Could pursue. Trump tweeted, \" iran has been formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile. Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the u.s. Made with them! \" he added in another tweet: \" iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the u.s. Came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the iran deal: $ 150 billion. \" as part of the nuclear deal struck during the obama administration, iran received access to an estimated $ 100 billion of its own money that had been frozen in foreign bank accounts. The u.s. Did not give iran $ 150 billion",
            "He added: \" iran will continue to test its capabilities in ballistic missiles and iran will not ask any country for permission in defending itself. \" velayati did not identify any u.s. Official specifically. On wednesday, national security adviser michael flynn said the white house was putting tehran \" on notice, \" an apparent threat of retaliation for sunday's ballistic missile test. Flynn, a retired army general and former head of the defense intelligence agency, delivered his remarks in a surprise appearance at the daily white house press briefing. He cited other examples of what he called iran's \" destabilizing behavior across the middle east, \" including reported attacks on u.s. Allies by iran-backed houthi rebels in the red sea. National security officials told reporters later wednesday that the administration was considering a range of options, including economic sanctions and supporting forces that counter iranian action in the region. President donald trump echoed flynn's remarks on twitter early thursday. Iran used to be prohibited from test-firing ballistic missiles under previous u.n. Resolutions. However, these were superseded by a new resolution passed alongside the nuclear deal. This only \" called upon \" iran not to test-fire missiles that could be used to deliver nuclear weapons."

Dewani returned to the uk and fought extradition for years, but he was finally sent back to south africa in april, cnn reports. The couple had been married just two weeks when anni was murdered; the bbc reports that they started dating in the summer of 2009 and had a volatile relationship. In may 2010, the court was told, they had an \" angry disagreement \" that led to anni wanting to call off the wedding because dewani was too controlling; dewani sent her a letter that included the line, \" i really do love you. Want to be with you forever. \" through his lawyer, dewani, now 34, told the court, \" we really frustrated each other, we were in love. \" he says his \" whole world came crashing down \" when she died; he fought extradition based on mental health grounds, with experts testifying he was suffering from ptsd and depression and had even attempted suicide.

        "summary": "When the british warship lord clive was blasted by spanish cannon fire just off the coast of uruguay in 1763, about 270 crew members went down with the ship. Now a treasure hunter from argentina hopes it's also still home to more than $ 1 billion in gold coins, reports the london times — half of which he could be entitled to. Ruben collado also thinks the ship is stocked with the likes of rum, opium, and silk, and he plans to prove it by raising the vessel next month. Collado himself found the ship by accident in 2004, just 380 yards off the coast and 16 feet underwater. ( spaniards had pinned it under rocks to keep it submerged ). The shallow depth is what gave up its location: collado's vessel struck its mast in the river plate estuary, reported afp. He then waited more than a decade for uruguay's permission to salvage it. The lord clive went down during a military mission amid the seven years ' war, in which british and portugal were trying to take the city of colonia del sacramento. Collado thinks the 64-gun ship, which belonged to the british east india company, made the fatal error of anchoring too close to shore, within range of spanish cannons. The feb. 10 operation is expected to cost about $ 5 million for the team of 80 divers, technicians, and other support staff to raise the ship. The hope is that it can shed more light on british naval expeditions in south america. \" the rescue of the ship would have an impact on the city no less important than when unesco declared it, justly, a world heritage site, \" says colonia's director of tourism. ( one famous wreck has been particularly dangerous for divers. )",
