The family hopes to get sponsors and make it an annual event, carol tells wbur. A rep for hosea feed the hungry said the nonprofit initially thought the fowlers were pulling their leg: \" it's a very creme de la creme wedding venue, so to say that you're going to host 200 homeless individuals at villa christina — it sounds like a prank call. \" the fowlers'daughter attended the event, and her dad says it was a \" bittersweet but rewarding \" experience; her mom tells today tamara found it \" surreal but incredibly rewarding. \" carol has this advice: \" if you have canceled an event, do not walk away. Pick up the phone and call your favorite charity and offer it to them. We're regular, working people and anybody can do this. This is not star stuff. \" ( in boston, a homeless man who did a very good deed is being handsomely rewarded. )",

According to a police report, caleb died of a neck injury. Two women on the raft with caleb also suffered facial injuries. On tuesday evening, schlitterbahn waterparks and resorts released the following statement, saying once the investigation is concluded and permission is given by the court, \" verrückt will be decommissioned – closed permanently and the slide removed from the tower.

        "summary": "The aug. 14 execution of carey dean moore in nebraska garnered national attention because authorities used a heretofore untested cocktail of four drugs to end the life of the convicted killer. But now, another aspect of the execution is attracting attention: the fact that authorities at nebraska state penitentiary closed curtains for some 14 minutes, preventing observers from seeing the execution from start to finish. According to observers, about 15 minutes after authorities began to administer the drugs to moore via iv, corrections director scott frakes — in the same room as moore — spoke into his radio and the curtains closed the lincoln journal star reports. Some say closing the curtains \" hindered transparency \" because observers — and, by proxy, other states looking for new execution methods — were not able to see the full effect of the drug combination. \" speculation cannot help but be rife, state sen. Ernie chambers, a death penalty opponent, wrote to frakes days after the arrest, saying that witness reports of the events before the curtains closed \" only tantalized. \" those reports include accounts of moore's face turning red, and then purple, the omaha world-herald reports, as well as moore taking rapid, heaving breaths and coughing, per the journal star. However, a corrections spokeswoman says the curtain closing wasn't unplanned, telling the journal star that it \" is consistent with past practice.

Wilkie is a former pentagon undersecretary for personnel and readiness, and a former adviser to gop sen. Thom tillis of north carolina. He's led the agency for two months, ever since trump fired david shulkin amid an internal revolt and questions about his compliance with ethics rules, reports the ap. Wilkie appeared in the white house press briefing room thursday to accept a check for the amount of trump's first-quarter salary, which he donated to the agency. Trump revealed his decision during a prison reform event at the white house. Trump previously nominated white house physician dr. Ronny jackson for the job, but jackson withdrew last month. Politico sees wilkie's path to confirmation as much smoother than jackson's, though it points out one potential wrinkle: wilkie was one of three congressional aides present when trump's campaign supported ditching a provision in the gop's 2016 platform that called for tough action against russia.

Second place goes to michael jackson, and third to pope pius xii. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that adolf hitler ranked the most important person, while michael jackson was again second and madonna third, reports the guardian. \" our analysis shows that most important historical figures across wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male, \" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, google's pagerank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using pagerank on wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century swedish naturalist carl linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \" father of taxonomy. \" so the researchers added an algorithm called cheirank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together — an approach they dubbed 2drank — no one beat out frank sinatra on english pages or adolf hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed karl marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the smithsonian.

        "summary": "It seems to be a rite of passage that \" young adults \" in the us ( classified as those between the ages of 18 and 34, per the us census bureau ) take a bit of guff from the generations that preceded them. Millennials, id'd by pew research as those born between 1981 and 1997, haven't escaped this fate, but while many label the current younger set as simply hanging out \" in the basement playing video games, \" as usa today notes, that's not quite the case. The census bureau released a population report wednesday that looks back at the 18-34 demographic over the past four decades, comparing today's young adults to those going back to 1975. \" if one theme describes how adulthood has changed over the last 40 years, it is growing complexity, \" the report notes. A few notable trends stand out, and the internet is buzzing about them: parents who dread an empty nest can relax, because the kansas city star notes your millennial boarders may not be going anywhere anytime soon. In 2005, just 26 % of young adults still shacked up with mom and dad, but that number settled in at around 34 % in 2015 — a 30 % spike in just 10 years. Per the miami herald, millennials seem to look more highly upon a good education than their predecessors, with 37 % boasting at least a bachelor's degree in 2016, compared with 23 % in 1975. The extra schooling likely explains a drop homeownership among millennials, from 52 % in 1975 to 29 % today. You won't find millennials starting families as soon as they're done with that schooling, and women especially aren't as eager to be relegated to homemaker roles as past generations, nbc washington reports. Economic security comes before marriage — and while about 84 % of young men are in the workforce ( a number that's stayed constant this whole time ), that percentage has jumped from 50 % to 70 % for women since 1975. A separate study finds that the most popular brands among millennials are victoria's secret, sephora, and nike, reports bloomberg. Pew research dispels the myth that millennials are flakes when it comes to holding down a job, pointing out that millennials in 2016 stayed at their jobs for five years or longer at around the same numbers as generation xers did when they were the same age — and actually outpaced gen xers by a few percentage points when it came to sticking it out with an employer for 13 months or longer.

That equals a 2.6 % and 2 % jump in a man's bmi, respectively, according to a northwestern university release. And men, don't try to pass off the weight as a side effect of marriage. Though a recent study found marriage does add a little to your waistline, the fatherhood weight gain is a separate issue \" above the already known effect of marriage, \" says lead author dr. Craig garfield. Regardless of marital status, childless men actually lost weight in the same period: about 1.4 pounds. So why are men gaining weight while chasing after little ones? it likely comes down to a change in eating habits and lifestyle, researchers say. \" you have new responsibilities when you have your kids and may not have time to take care of yourself the way you once did in terms of exercise, \" garfield says. While many men quit smoking or cut back on alcohol when they have children, there may be more snacks and leftovers lying around, he tells time. \" we all know dads who clean their kids ' plates after every meal. \" as first-time fathers often feel they're too young to have their own doctor, garfield suggests pediatricians strike up conversations with child-accompanying dads about their own health, since \" the more weight the fathers gain and the higher their bmi, the greater risk they have for developing heart disease as well as diabetes and cancer. \" ( here's how much weight marriage packs on. )",

As for robinson's criminal history, \" i ' m not here to do a character workup on someone who lost his life less than 24 hours ago, \" said koval. The ap, however, checked state records and found that robinson pleaded guilty in october to felony armed robbery in connection with a home invasion; he was sentenced to three years ' probation. A neighbor says she asked him about the robbery, which she deemed out of character. \" he felt he was under a lot of pressure from the others to do what he did, \" she says. \" he told me he would never do anything like that again. \"",

While reading his statement, he \" quickly dissolved into tears, \" reports the new york times. And he might yet end up in jail. Related coverage: divorce: the new york post reports that huma abedin also filed for divorce from weiner on friday. It's uncontested, suggesting no fight is expected over assets or custody of their son. What he said: cbs news has the full text of his court statement here. Prison: weiner faces up to 10 years when he is sentenced in september, but don't bet on it. Prosecutors said 21 to 27 months would be \" fair and appropriate, \" and the ap notes that weiner agreed not to appeal any sentence of that length. He also could be spared jail altogether. Keeping track: having trouble remembering all the weiner scandals? this timeline of his career from the ap might help. Affecting an election: if hillary clinton blames james comey for her loss, then she should be blaming weiner, too. Cnn lays out how his sexting got tangled up in her email trouble. How sad: amber phillips assesses it all at the washington post, including the question of why on earth weiner and abedin allowed a documentary to be made about them. The \" sad \" weiner story is not just \" one of the weirdest political stories of the social media age, \" she writes. It's \" guffaw-worthy. Cynical. Just plain puzzling. Gross. Criminal. And somehow totally impactful. \" moving on: at cnn, chris cillizza makes a plea likely to have plenty of support: \" now, can we please agree to just stop talking about weiner? \"",

The university said in a statement that it notified the fraternity that its recognition as a fraternity chapter at asu has been permanently revoked for violating the university's student code of conduct. Revoking recognition means the 65-year-old local chapter is no longer affiliated with asu. The group won't be listed on the university's website and cannot recruit members or hold meetings on campus. >> read asu's statement asu president michael crow said in the statement that the university's student code of conduct establishes behavior standards. \"at asu, students who violate these standards will be subject to disciplinary sanctions in order to promote their own personal development, to protect the university community, and to maintain order and stability on our campuses, \" he said. Asu said the fraternity violated four provisions of the conduct code: engaging in discriminatory activities, violating alcohol rules, violating the terms of earlier disciplinary sanctions and off-campus conduct that may present a risk or danger. University officials are still investigating and deciding how to handle individual cases of student discipline. National fraternity spokesman alex baker said in a statement",
            "Tempe, az - arizona state university permanently revoked its recognition of fraternity tau kappa epsilon on thursday in the wake of tke's controversial martin luther king day party, university officials say. The university said that the party \"encouraged a racially insensitive theme and created an environment conducive to underage consumption of alcohol. \" the unregistered, off-campus party involved students posing in basketball jerseys and flashing gang signs and drinking out of watermelon cups. They also posted photos on social media with the hashtag #blackoutformlk. Revoking recognition means the 65-year-old local chapter is no longer affiliated with asu, the group won't be listed on the university's website and it cannot recruit members or hold on-campus meetings. The fraternity had previously been placed on probation in 2012 and was suspended immediately after the university became aware of the party on monday. Upon its initial suspension after the party, the university stated, \"asu has one of the most diverse student bodies of any major university in the country, and it is unfortunate that a few individuals held an offensive party at a time when asu, the state and the nation were celebrating dr. King's achievements and legacy. \" university officials said they still are investigating the event and deciding how to handle individual cases of student discipline.

Here's what the critics have to say: for mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle, the movie starts off \" brilliant, not just a triumph of story but of strategy, \" and maintains that momentum throughout … until the last 20 minutes. That's when lasalle says the movie \" frays \" — a \" swiss watch of storytelling [ that ] turns into a bad digital clock circa 1986, flashing the wrong numbers. \" he praises the acting, especially that of pike, proclaiming that \" everyone who sees gone girl will walk out raving about \" her. Manohla dargis is similarly thrown off by the shift midway through the film, writing for the new york times that \" by the movie's second half, you may wish that amy would stay gone. \" although dargis concedes that david \" fincher's compositions, camera work, and cutting are, as always, superbly controlled, \" she adds that the film \" plays like a queasily, at times gleefully, funny horror movie about a modern marriage. \" but evenutally, \" dread descends like winter shadows, darkening the movie's tone and visuals until it's snuffed out all the light, air, and nuance. \" james rocchi writes at the wrap that fincher's humor is \" the spoonful of sugar that helps the malevolence go down in his films, \" and gone girl is no exception, with \" top-notch suspenseful storytelling \" and \" razor-edged wit. \" he also lauds the supporting cast ( including neil patrick harris and tyler perry ) as \" a thing of wonder \" and praises the movie overall as \" that rare entertainment that rewards your intelligence instead of insulting it, that rare thriller interested in emotional wounds as much as physical ones. \" but gone girl isn't as alluring as fincher's the social network, laments anthony lane in the new yorker, asking: \" who could have predicted that a film about murder, betrayal, and deception would be less exciting than a film about a website? \" the film that lane at first calls \" natural fincherland \" soon devolves into a movie that \" lacks clout. \" he also can't help but note that gone girl is \" meant to",

According to npr, the 3-feet-long rats are quicker, better, and cheaper than lab technicians when it comes to screening for tb. It takes one lab technician four days to screen 100 samples; a rat can screen that many in 20 minutes. And all it wants in compensation is a bit of banana. Baby rats start their training as soon as their eyes open. They're socialized to humans ( trainer \" uncle albert \" takes them on motorbike rides in between copious petting ) and taught to sniff out the presence of tb in mucus samples. Once fully trained at nine months, they have a nearly 100 % accuracy rate in detecting tb. Then it's off to work. One rat named chewa does two 40-minute screening sessions per day with a break for napping and playing in between. And the usually enthusiastic rats are allowed to retire when they no longer appear to enjoy smelling mucus samples. \" they can live out their days lounging with their friends, snacking on watermelon, running on wheels, chasing their tails, whatever they want to do, \" an apopo community manager tells npr. \" the life of a retired rat is especially blissful. \"",

The cause of the crash hasn't been determined, though officials believe the rugged terrain may have played a role. \" there's a possibility the aircraft hit a peak and then fell into a ravine because the place that it was found is steep, \" a search and rescue official tells reuters, which notes that trigana has a very patchy safety record, with 14 serious incidents since it started flying in 1991, including 10 in which the aircraft was destroyed. The plane was also carrying $ 468,750 in cash, which was to be distributed to poor families.",

It arrived at that figure by asking its members to submit three years of detailed data, touching on factors like total water use and the type of treatment used.

The ibwa chose to stop there in its calculations, but the truth is that the actual \" water footprint \" is much larger: for instance, oil is needed to make plastic, and drilling for it requires, yep, water — in some cases as much as seven times what the plastic bottle ultimately contains.",

Usually, they point to the roughly 50 billion ( mostly plastic ) bottles we throw away every year. The international bottled water association, ever sensitive to criticism that it's wasting precious resources, has commissioned its first ever study to figure out how much water goes into producing one liter. The results, released this month, show that for north american companies, it takes 1.39 liters to make one liter of water. That's less than the global averages of a liter of soda, which requires 2.02 liters of water. A liter of beer, meanwhile, needs 4 liters of water, wine demands 4.74 liters.

Bottled water companies ( along with many other beverage companies ) should include the water in their supply chain, says ertug ercin with the water footprint network. Ercin says a true water footprint includes all freshwater used in production, including the water used for packaging. \" packaging makes a significant footprint, \" he says, adding that three liters of water might be used to make a half-liter bottle. In other words, the amount of water going into making the bottle could be up to six or seven times what's inside the bottle. Drilling for oil to make plastic, ercin says, uses a substantial amount of groundwater. And you need water to make the paper, too, he adds.

The dnc learned of the attempt on tuesday, cnn reports. The attack, which was detected by a cloud service provider and a security research company, involved a fake login page intended to gather usernames and passwords for a service called votebuilder, which hosts the dnc's voter database. It's a method called \" spearphishing, \" according to the new york times. \" it was very convincing, \" mike murray of the cybersecurity firm lookout tells cnn, adding that it would be tough to tell the real page from the fake one, even if they were side-by-side. The fake login page was ultimately removed by the cloud hosting company digitalocean. The company's chief security officer says the threat was identified before the attack was launched. \" we see no evidence that any sensitive data was stolen, \" he says. A dnc official tells the times that it is not clear who the hackers were in this case. But, the paper recalls, a 2016 hack of the dnc was ultimately traced to russia. This latest attempt, dnc chief security officer bob lord tells the times, \" is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks. \" earlier this week, microsoft reported that it had uncovered new russian hacking attempts targeting conservative organizations in the us.",

Yesterday, a judge waived gonzalez's conviction and three-year sentence for property damage — the 41-year-old broke a sink while in solitary confinement, his lawyers say — allowing for his release. Nerheim apologized outside court, though it was prosecutors under his predecessor, michael waller, who secured gonzalez's wrongful conviction, as well as three others that have since been overturned. Nerheim told the chicago tribune that the victim was \" devastated \" to learn gonzalez would be cleared. The then-35-year-old victim was taken from her waukegan home, put in a sedan, and driven to a location where she was raped by two men. Gonzalez was stopped the next day while behind the wheel of a car similar to the one she had described. In 1994, gonzalez, who speaks little english, gave a statement to police admitting to taking part in the assault but said he didn't ejaculate; he has since maintained his innocence, and testified he was with his girlfriend at the time.

The guardian reports bellingcat and investigative partner the insider say they have identified one of the men accused of poisoning the skripals with novichok as a colonel with russia's military intelligence service, the gru. That man is col. Anatoliy chepiga, who fought in the war in chechnya and in 2014 received the state's highest award: hero of the russian federation. The bbc notes the award is generally given by vladimir putin, who has previously stated that boshirov and companion alexander petrov are merely civilians; the men have said they traveled to salisbury as tourists to see a well known cathedral there. Bellingcat suspects the mission that spurred that honor was a secret one; while most recipients ' heroics are described in detail, chepiga simply received his award \" by decree from the russian president. \" as for how the alleged identification came to be, bellingcat explains a source suggested it look at whether the men could have attended the far eastern military command academy, which had \" the best reputation for foreign-language training and overseas clandestine operations. \" it came upon a photo that it thought could be boshirov and continued its web searching, which ultimately led it to chepiga's name and passport file. A 2003 photo in the file \" strongly resembled a younger ' boshirov. ' \" the bbc had this to say: \" british officials have not commented.

All five will be eligible to play in the sugar bowl on jan. 4. Not that it made the news that much more palatable, ohio state coach jim tressel said. \" there is a gut-wrenching feeling when you lose a game, and then there is one that goes beyond when you don't feel as if you did what you should do as people, \" tressel said. \" so whatever the next step of gut-wrenching is, that's the way you feel, and we feel a responsibility for our kids on and off the field. Obviously, it's painful. \" the other four involved in the five-game suspension next season are wide receiver devier posey, running back dan herron, left tackle mike adams and backup defensive end solomon thomas. The five were sanctioned for first accepting discounted rates on tattoos and then letting that escalate into selling personal osu memorabilia to the owner of a local tattoo parlor for thousands of dollars over a period starting in 2009.

A cleveland police detective said all three women were abducted after castro offered them a ride and that each was chained in his basement and sexually assaulted within a few hours of being kidnapped. The fbi agent testified that castro created a makeshift alarm system and removed doorknobs, among other things, to turn his house into a prison. He also testified that castro would occasionally pay his victims after raping them, but he then would require them to pay him if they wanted something special from the store. In a court filing, the cuyahoga county prosecutor said castro chained his captives by their ankles, fed them only one meal a day, and provided plastic toilets in their bedrooms that were infrequently emptied. At one point, he locked all of them in a vehicle in his garage for three days while he had a visitor, according to the filing. Details also came out of how castro used his own children to lure the victims into his car and home.",

The bin laden family split up after 9/11, but abdulfattah joined her husband in the pakistani city of peshawar in 2002, she said. The family hid in rural northwest pakistan, not far from islamabad, though not in the tribal regions where western authorities were searching. In 2003, they moved to haripur, nearer to islamabad, where abdulfattah had two children in government hospitals, apparently under a fake name.

That's an increase of 18.5 %. Men, who weighed 166.3 pounds in the 1960s, now tip the scales at an average of 195.5 pounds, for a 17.6 % gain. Is it as bad as it seems? essentially, yes, though the typical height of men and women has grown by an inch, which at least accounts for something. But the main reasons for our growing bellies are no surprise: americans are eating more food, but less health food, and are exercising less. The data shows 35 % of americans over 20 are considered obese, while 69 % of adults are either overweight or obese, reports cbs atlanta. As for children, one in five between 12 and 19 and 18 % between 6 and 11 are obese. A 2012 study found americans were the third-heaviest people on the planet behind residents of tonga and micronesia. The average american was 33 pounds heavier than a frenchman, 40 pounds heavier than a citizen of japan, and 70 pounds heavier than a person in bangladesh, adds the post. Dying to get back to that 1960s frame? it's actually more important to watch what you eat rather than exercise constantly, though exercising and eating healthy together is obviously beneficial.

Overall weight gain since 1960 is slightly greater for women ( 18.5 percent ) than for men ( 17.6 percent ). And both sexes have gained roughly an inch in height over the same period, which accounts for some of that weight gain. But story is mostly one of growing girth, and it basically boils down to three factors: we're eating less healthy food, we're eating more of it, and we're not moving around as much.

And u.s. Men have expanded greatly in the same time period, having gained nearly 30 pounds from the 1960s to 2010 – 166.3 pounds to 195.5 pounds today. The cdc data shows that both sexes have gained almost an inch in height from the 1960s, which factors into some of the overall weight gain. But women have seen an 18.5 percent increase in weight gain from 1960 and men have shown a 17.6 percent increase in overall weight gain. Today's american male weighs nearly as much as 1.5 american females from the 1960s, with today's u.s. Male weighing an average 195.5 pounds and having a nearly 40-inch waist circumference ( 39.7 inches ). American women today have an average waist circumference of 37.5 inches and weigh in at 166.2 pounds, up from about 140 pounds in 1960.

Michael whalen says his dog allie was one of his best friends. \" we did everything together, \" he says. Last year, allie was diagnosed with cushing's disease. Whalen says a vet offered to put her down, but neither he nor allie were \" ready \" for that. Instead, he put allie on medication. But early one morning in late january, allie started having intense seizures, according to the virginian-pilot. Whalen says he didn't think he could get allie to a 24-hour vet safely, so after 40 minutes he decided to end her misery. Whalen tells wvec he thought shooting allie would be a \" painless, instantaneous \" way for her to go. He says shooting his dog was \" so emotionally disturbing \" he still cries when he thinks about it. He buried allie's body at a beach nearby because he says she used to like watching him surf, and he would wave to the spot when he walked by in the coming days. But a few weeks later, a passerby spotted allie's partially buried body. Whalen was charged with animal cruelty and burying trash. Vets don't consider a gunshot an appropriate form of animal euthanasia. But whalen says he's no animal abuser. \"if your animal needs you, you gotta be there for her, \" he says. \" you have a duty and obligation. \" a court date is set for june.",

Aslam, who is 5 feet, 10 inches tall, 165 pounds and has medium-length black hair, was first reported as being kidnapped on april 27 at 10 a.m. Johns creek police responded to his morton crossing address, where officers were told he was missing from his home. \" aslam's family reported that they had received a phone text stating that he had been kidnapped, \" a news release from the city said. Bringing the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) and the georgia bureau of investigation ( gbi ) into the case, investigators found the phone used to send the text and discovered that aslam had been the one to purchase it.

Starting in 2003 when their remains were first discovered on the island of flores, scientists believed homo floresiensis — who averaged 3.5 feet tall and 75 pounds — lived until as recently as 12,000 years ago, national geographic reports. But a new study published this week in nature found they actually died off sometime between 60,000 and 50,000 years ago — right around the time humans showed up in the area. \" the exact cause of the demise of the hominids … is not yet understood, but in my view, may be related to the appearance in the area of the most aggressive of all hominin species, homo sapiens, modern humans, \" one expert tells discovery. Discovery calls the timing of the hobbits'disappearance \" suspicious, \" but the study found no proof they were wiped out by humans, and further excavations on flores are needed. Other possible causes for the extinction of homo floresiensis include volcanoes, overhunting of pygmy elephants, and climate change. But it's not just their death that is mysterious. Scientists still don't know why these real-life hobbits were so small, how they got to flores, or if they're even a different species. Some experts have posited they are actually humans suffering from dwarfism or down syndrome. ( meanwhile, ancient humans having sex with neanderthals may be why we have allergies. )",

Forces from the rapid action battalion ( rab ) arrested farabi shafiur rahman, who was previously jailed for his ties to the extremist hizbut tahrir islamist group, at a bus stop in dhaka, a rab spokesman told reporters. The spokesman said farabi had confessed to threatening to kill blogger avijit roy. Farabi was still being interrogated. Roy, an engineer of bangladeshi origin, was killed by machete-wielding assailants on thursday while returning from a book fair. His wife and fellow blogger rafida ahmed suffered head injuries and lost a finger. She remains in hospital. The police said farabi was arrested in 2013 for social media comments that supported the murder of another blogger, ahmed rajib haider, but he was later released on bail. Last year, farabi posted on facebook: \" it's a holy duty of bangalee muslims to kill avijit \", the police added. Roy's killing comes amid a crackdown on hardline islamist groups, which have increased activities in recent years in the south asian nation. In 2013, religious militants targeted several secular bloggers who had demanded capital punishment for islamist leaders convicted of war crimes during bangladesh's war for independence.

        "summary": "It started with a candy wrapper and ended ( for now ) in a courtroom. Nestle's attempts to trademark the shape of its \" four-fingered \" kitkat have been rejected by the european court of justice, which ruled that shape alone isn't enough to recognize it as a kitkat, the bbc reports. The decision was a setback for nestle — which manages the brand overseas; hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the us — and a victory for cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $ 60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the uk from kitkat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the kitkat brand over the past eight decades, bloomberg notes. But cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think \" kitkat, \" and the court agreed. The bbc even notes that in norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called kvikk lunsj ( \" quick lunch \" ) has been around for nearly as long as kitkat. The fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they've had in recent years: in 2013, nestle managed to block cadbury's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers, per bloomberg. Kitkat case now heads back to the uk high court, which will render a final decision. ( claims of excess lead in nestle noodles led to a major recall in india. )",

The european court of justice said that the company had to demonstrate the public relied on the shape alone to identify the snack. The judges concluded this was difficult to prove if goods also showed a brand name such as kitkat. Rival cadbury has battled to prevent nestle obtaining the trademark. Both nestle and cadbury said they were \" pleased \" with the ruling. The case will now return to the uk high court for a final decision. Nestle claimed that in the 80 years since the chocolate bar was introduced, the four fingers have become almost completely associated with kitkats. In june, a senior european court lawyer, the advocate-general, disagreed saying such a trademark did not comply with european law. Nestle has not sought to trademark the two-fingered bar.

The judgment gave both sides an opportunity to claim victory. The eu court decision will help guide a u.k. Tribunal handling a clash between cadbury, the u.k.'s biggest chocolate maker, and nestle over the swiss company's 2010 application to trademark the four-fingered chocolate bar, which brought in 40 million pounds ( $ 61.7 million ) a year between 2008 and 2010 in the u.k. Cadbury separately is fighting an eu trademark nestle got for the shape of its chocolate bar in 2006 in a case that's been pending in a lower eu court since 2013.

He also called on countries to stop stockpiling nuclear weapons. Obama said both al-qaeda and isis are still seeking nuclear material for weaponizing, and the risk of nuclear terrorism remains very real. He pointed out recent news that isis members had been following a belgian nuclear plant's senior manager and secretly recording his daily activities. \" we cannot be complacent, \" he said. In addition to isis and al-qaeda, world leaders also expressed concern with north korea's nuclear weapons program. Us officials estimate there is approximately 2,000 metric tons of material worldwide that could be used to build a nuclear weapon, nbc news reports. The us and russia ( putin refused to attend the summit ) account for 90 % of the world's nuclear weapons with more than 14,000 nuclear warheads between them.",

It \" leaves you pondering whether you have just seen a monumentally stupid movie or a brilliant movie about the nature and consequences of stupidity. \" but \" why choose? \" \" the combination of the words ' michael bay ' and'steroids'should be enough to give any moviegoer pause, \" observes liam lacey in the globe and mail. The film \" plays like goodfellas as performed by the three stooges. As a genre-mashing exercise it's almost interesting, but, really, why bother? \" \" pain &amp; gain is arguably too much of everything — everyone jabbers on incessantly, and the movie is in love with its own outrageousness, \" writes joe neumaier in the new york daily news. \" but its biggest lift comes from the pumped-up ( mark ) wahlberg and ( dwayne ) johnson. They manage to find the humanity in all the adrenalized muscle. \"",

The gang's reaction: a bounty on the pooch's head that may be up to $ 70,000. The telegraph reports that sombra ( spanish for \" shadow \" ) has had to be moved from the drug-trafficking hot spot of turbo, in colombia's uraba region, to the relatively safer el dorado international airport in bogota after what the bbc calls the country's \" most powerful criminal organization \" decided she should be killed. The 6-year-old german shepherd also now has a dedicated security detail, with extra officers keeping her and her handler safe from the urabeños, aka the gulf clan. The washington post notes sombra, who has been with the national police of colombia since she was a puppy, is \" something of a folk hero \" in the country due to her legendary drug busts, with local media dubbing her \" the terror \" of narcotics traffickers. The \" friendly, calm canine \" often shows up on tv and in pictures with fans, and the police boast about her on twitter. Which is why urabeños members were enraged enough to offer the bounty, which police intelligence reports note could range anywhere from $ 7,000 to $ 70,000. \" the fact they want to hurt sombra and offer such a high reward for her capture or death shows the impact she's had on their profits, \" a police rep tells the telegraph.

That's because the country crooner is headlining a \" turn out for texas \" rally in austin for beto o ' rourke, the democratic challenger to gop sen. Ted cruz, and many of nelson's fans aren't happy about it, ktrk reports. Per austin360, it's \" the first public concert nelson has held for a political candidate, \" the singer's publicist says in a release, though rolling stone notes he's put on private concerts for politicians in the past. \" my wife annie and i have met and spoken with beto and we share his concern for the direction things are headed, \" nelson says in the release. \" beto embodies what is special about texas, an energy and an integrity that is completely genuine. \" the site notes nelson even brought o ' rourke out on stage during his fourth of july concert. None of this pleases nelson's more conservative fans, who see his ties to o ' rourke as a \" breaking point, \" per the washington post. \" i am certain you've lost your mind, \" one commenter wrote on nelson's facebook page, while another noted: \" willie's position is proof positive that marijuana use over time kills brain cells. \" still others are dumping already purchased tickets to future nelson shows. Many, however, applauded nelson's decision. \" so glad you are involved in this good cause. I have always been a fan, and am now a bigger fan, \" noted one well-liked post. The post notes nelson has long been politically active, throwing his support behind barack obama, hillary clinton, and bernie sanders, and advocating for pot legalization, gay marriage, and the environment.",
