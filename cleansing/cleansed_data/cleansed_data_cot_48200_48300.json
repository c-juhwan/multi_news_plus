        "summary": "Everyone knows rudolph the red-nosed reindeer has \" a very shiny nose \" that even, some might say, \" glows. \" but why? a new — and, the local notes, tongue-in-cheek — investigation explains. Researchers in norway and the netherlands compared reindeer noses to human noses and found that reindeer have 25 % more blood vessels in their nasal lining, which help control body temperature — an important task when you're flying all around the globe in a single evening. Researchers had reindeer walk on a treadmill, and observed that afterward, \" they do indeed have red noses, \" medpage today reports. \" rudolph's nose is red because it is richly supplied with red blood cells, comprises a highly dense microcirculation, and is anatomically and physiologically adapted for reindeer to carry out their flying duties for santa claus, \" say the researchers. They also estimated that in order to get christmas presents to everybody on time, rudolph would have to lead santa's team at 650 miles per second — a speed that would vaporize them, unless rudolph could protect them with an ion shield.",

        "summary": "Anxiety over how the absence of net neutrality rules could affect things has manifested itself in california. Ars technica reports on a new lawsuit that includes a statement from santa clara county fire chief anthony bowden alleging verizon throttled the fire department's data services ( specifically tied to its vehicle oes 5262, which uses a verizon sim card to get online ) while it was in the midst of fighting the state's wildfires. To make things worse, bowden adds, \" verizon imposed these limitations despite being informed that throttling \" was curtailing the department's emergency response. His declaration is an addendum to a legal challenge against the fcc filed by nearly two dozen state attorneys general and a slew of government agencies looking to overturn the repeal of net neutrality rules that went into effect in june. Ars technica details the email back-and-forth — starting in late june and continuing as the mendocino complex fire raged on — between verizon and fire officials, including one in which a fire it officer begs, \" please work with us. \" even though the fire department had an \" unlimited \" data plan, ars technica notes big carriers sometimes slow things when a certain amount of data is exceeded. A verizon rep eventually convinced the department to upgrade from a monthly $ 37.99 data plan to a $ 99.99 one. In a statement to the verge, verizon says the throttling had \" nothing to do with net neutrality; \" it was a \" customer support mistake. \" \" regardless of the plan emergency responders choose, we have a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations. \"",

That's a significantly tighter gap than in june, when trump's total was $ 51 million to clinton's $ 69 million.

Clinton said that her campaign and a joint fund-raising operation with the democratic national committee had $ 102 million on hand, not including cash held directly by the party. But mr. Trump's announcement suggests that after months of dithering and false starts, he has begun to exploit an opportunity: marrying his powerful credibility among grass-roots republicans with targeted small-donor fund-raising, particularly online, where mr. Trump's website features buttons soliciting $ 50, $ 25 and even $ 10 contributions. At the end of may, mr.",

That nears the $ 102 million the democrats banked after their july fundraising, per clinton campaign spokesman josh schwerin. And with 80 % of the trump campaign's haul last month coming in through direct fundraising appeals, the success of its digital and direct mail operation is giving senior republicans hope that their nominee can compensate for his poor relationship with traditional, deep-pocketed republican donors to still compete with clinton in the general election."

Those figures include the fundraising of both the campaigns and their joint fundraising committees, which allow rich donors to give hundreds of thousands of dollars, which then gets divided up among the campaigns, the national party committees and state parties",
            "Moreover, mr. Trump's surge is coming very late in the campaign, at a point where advertising rates climb and the chance to invest in a long-term digital and campaign infrastructure is long past. Advertisement continue reading the main story and mrs. Clinton's own fund-raising operation is rapidly expanding as well. In a twitter post on wednesday, a spokesman for mrs. Clinton said that her campaign and a joint fund-raising operation with the democratic national committee had $ 102 million on hand, not including cash held directly by the party. But mr. Trump's announcement suggests that after months of dithering and false starts, he has begun to exploit an opportunity: marrying his powerful credibility among grass-roots republicans with targeted small-donor fund-raising, particularly online, where mr. Trump's website features buttons soliciting $ 50, $ 25 and even $ 10 contributions. At the end of may, mr.",
            "Story highlights the trump campaign says it raised $ 80 million in july but the campaign struggled to make a significant dent in tapping bigger donors ( cnn ) donald trump's campaign posted $ 80 million in fundraising last month in conjunction with the republican party, powered by a small-dollar program that is allowing him to slowly close the gap with hillary clinton. The trump campaign and its joint fundraising operation with the gop now boast $ 74 million in cash-on-hand. That nears the $ 102 million the democrats banked after their july fundraising, per clinton campaign spokesman josh schwerin. And with 80 % of the trump campaign's haul last month coming in through direct fundraising appeals, the success of its digital and direct mail operation is giving senior republicans hope that their nominee can compensate for his poor relationship with traditional, deep-pocketed republican donors to still compete with clinton in the general election."

But paying those fees wasn't technically illegal for mericle; his crime was lying about them to investigators, the wilkes barre times-leader explains. Prosecutors had suggested mericle spend only six months in jail, noting that he'd eventually cooperated with the government and testified against the corrupt judges — who got far longer sentences. A number of character witnesses also spoke up for mericle, wnep reports, and mericle's lawyer cited his record of philanthropy.

He noted he's able to go places now with his kids ( they hit disney world in 2016 ) and that people usually have no idea from looking at him that he's had a face transplant. \" it's the first time my two little boys had been anywhere where people didn't say, ' what happened? ' … they could tell something had happened, but nobody ever looked at me and said, ' he got a face transplant. ' another momentous occasion last november: hardison met rodebaugh's mom. After studying \" every angle \" of hardison's new face, per abc news — even finding an old chicken pox scar she remembered her son had had on his forehead — nancy millar told hardison, \" i am as proud of you as i was of my own son. It's not david's face, it's your face. \"",

The man was pat hardison, who underwent a groundbreaking face transplant last year, which was only made possible because of millar's decision to donate her son david rodebaugh's face and organs. Rodebaugh died last summer after sustaining a head injury in a bicycle accident in brooklyn, new york. He was 26 years old. Millar wondered if hardison's forehead would still show the chicken pox scar her son's once had. \"he [ rodebaugh ] used to always just bend over and kiss me on the forehead and so we'd reciprocate it, \" she said. \"as soon as he'd leave that'd be the last thing i do.

He said khan died fighting in a region made unstable by the \" disastrous decisions of barack obama and hillary clinton, \" and asserted that trump's policies — including a suspension of \" immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism \" — will help bring down the islamic state and make it less likely that more american soldiers will die. The issue has been making headlines since khan's father, khizr, spoke at the democratic national convention and said trump had \" sacrificed nothing and no one, \" which led to a series of counter-punches from both sides over the weekend. Meanwhile, top republicans mitch mcconnell and paul ryan both issued statements praising humayun khan for his sacrifice without mentioning trump, notes politico. The controversy \" has emerged as an unexpected and potentially pivotal flash point in the general election, \" observes the new york times, while a post at the conservative daily caller makes the case that the \" incredibly objective media \" is distorting the story to fit a false narrative: \" namely, trump hates the families of dead veterans. \"",

As the east idaho news reports, court documents show that ayala-doliente, 22, and sward, 23, were hauling pot from las vegas to montana when at some point they broke the cardinal rule of dope dealing: don't get high off your own supply. They came to believe, incorrectly, that undercover cops were following them. \" hi, uh, we're the two dumb asses that got caught trying to bring some stuff through your border and all your cops are just driving around us like a bunch of jack wagons, and i'd just like for you guys to end it, \" ayala-doliente tells the dispatcher in audio of the call obtained by the news. The entire exchange sounds very much \" like a deleted scene from pineapple express, \" notes the new york daily news. Other highlights: asked if they have weapons, ayala-doliente says no, \" just a bunch of snacks and stuff. \" they also have \" really nice \" pitbull. \" oh, cool, \" says the dispatcher, who plays the call perfectly, at one point asking, \" what was your name, man? \" speaking to sward, ayala-doliente says of the dispatcher: \" he's a nice guy. Want me to jump in the air and click my heels twice or what? \" regarding the phantom undercover cops, ayala-doliente says, \" we tried waving them down and that didn't work. \" ayala-doliente and sward were each charged with felony drug trafficking, given that their haul had a street value of $ 16,000, reports the idaho state journal. Sward received a five-year suspended sentence, five years of probation, and a month in jail. Ayala-doliente, who tested positive for pot, cocaine, and oxycodone on his november sentencing day, received a year-and-a-half to eight years in prison. ( this guy called 911 on himself, too. )",

        "summary": "A capital murder trial put on hold after a literal shock will resume in smith county, texas, on monday and for the first time, defendant james calvert will not represent himself. After calvert was accused of murdering ex-wife jelena sriraman and abducting their 4-year-old son in october 2012, the 45-year-old chose to represent himself. A rep for the texas defender service tells nbc news calvert is mentally ill and \" people with a history of mental illness are supposed to show a much higher level of competence \" than he has in order to do so. Even so, calvert defended himself until sept. 15, when he received a shock from the shock belt judge jack skeen had ordered he wear in court for safety reasons, reports reuters. It isn't clear who ordered the shock, but it followed several outbursts noted by skeen, who seemed to lose patience with calvert as the hearing progressed. At one point, calvert laughed out loud and skeen told him that another outburst would mean he'd be removed from court by \" whatever means they have to control you, \" reports kltv. When calvert afterward refused to stand while speaking to the judge, a deputy administered a shock that caused calvert to scream for five seconds. Skeen then ended calvert's self-representation. \" i should have done this a lot sooner, \" he said, per kltv. \" i don't have to take it. You're out. \" a smith county sheriff's lieutenant says a shock belt is commonly put on defendants at jury trials. \" it's really pretty effective when we use it. It's kind of like a taser, \" he says. However, legal experts say the belt is only to be used \" if the defendant poses an immediate security risk, \" per reuters, which means the judge could be penalized and calvert could be granted an appeal if he is convicted. \" this is just a travesty of justice as far as i ' m concerned, \" a lawyer says.",

A federal judge decided to advise boston bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev of his miranda rights, even though investigators apparently still wanted to question him further under a public-safety exception. The judge's move, made on monday in the hospital where mr. Tsarnaev was recovering, has prompted some republican lawmakers to press the justice department as to why it didn't make a stronger bid to resist the judge's plans. Those lawmakers say mr. Tsarnaev's interrogation should have continued without him being advised of his right to remain silent, because they say agents should have had more time to determine if there were other undetected bombs or plotters. After being read his rights, the suspect stopped talking to investigators, officials said. \" there will be more instances like this, and we will need to have a much better understanding about what is appropriate, \" house intelligence committee chairman mike rogers ( r., mich. ) said in an interview thursday. \" we have a long-standing tradition that the judiciary does not interfere with investigations.

A badly wounded but awake dzhokhar tsarnaev showed little signs of fear or remorse during his hospital room court hearing earlier this week and his heart monitor didn't register a blip when he was told he was facing the death penalty in the boston marathon bombing case, according to a source familiar with the events inside the hospital room when he was read his rights. Tsarnaev's face was splotched and swollen, his left hand was bandaged, and he was unable to talk during the brief court hearing presided over by u.s. Judge marianne bowler on monday afternoon.

            "European pressphoto agency the bombing suspects ' father, anzor tsarnaev, left, who plans to travel to the u.s., and mother, zubeidat tsarnaeva, center, at a news conference thursday in makhachkala, a city in the russian republic of dagestan. A federal judge decided to advise boston bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev of his miranda rights, even though investigators apparently still wanted to question him further under a public-safety exception. The judge's move, made on monday in the hospital where mr. Tsarnaev was recovering, has prompted some republican lawmakers to press the justice department as to why it didn't make a stronger bid to resist the judge's plans. Those lawmakers say mr. Tsarnaev's interrogation should have continued without him being advised of his right to remain silent, because they say agents should have had more time to determine if there were other undetected bombs or plotters. After being read his rights, the suspect stopped talking to investigators, officials said. \" there will be more instances like this, and we will need to have a much better understanding about what is appropriate, \" house intelligence committee chairman mike rogers ( r., mich. ) said in an interview thursday. \" we have a long-standing tradition that the judiciary does not interfere with investigations. This sets a very dangerous precedent. \" enlarge image",
            "Nbc's michael isikoff reports on what a source, inside the hospital room with dzhokhar tsarnaev, is telling him about tsarnaev's interaction with investigators. Nbc analyst roger cressey also joins to discuss what authorities are now saying about the tsarnaev brothers ' possible plans for an attack on new york city. A badly wounded but awake dzhokhar tsarnaev showed little signs of fear or remorse during his hospital room court hearing earlier this week and his heart monitor didn't register a blip when he was told he was facing the death penalty in the boston marathon bombing case, according to a source familiar with the events inside the hospital room when he was read his rights. Tsarnaev's face was splotched and swollen, his left hand was bandaged, and he was unable to talk during the brief court hearing presided over by u.s. Judge marianne bowler on monday afternoon. The surviving bombing suspect mouthed rather than said the word \"no \" when asked if he could afford a lawyer and nodded in the affirmative when asked if he understood his rights. But tsarnaev appeared to fully follow the proceeding, the source said.

Researchers investigating the species ' hearing capacity blared frog sounds in seychelles rain forests, and male gardiner's frogs replied. Scientists used x-rays to figure out what was going on: gardiner's frogs have less tissue between their mouths and inner ears than do most frogs. The animals ' mouths were amplifying the sounds, whose frequencies then traveled through their skulls to reach the inner ear. \" the combination of a mouth cavity and bone conduction allows gardiner's frogs to perceive sound effectively, \" says a researcher.

It's likely they never would have sold had they known palij's past — he served as a nazi prison guard at a death-camp in poland, then lied about that in order to enter the us after the war, say justice department officials. On monday, immigration officials rousted the 95-year-old from his queens residence and shipped him to germany to face possible war crimes charges, reports abc news. Palij is believed to be the last nazi war crimes suspect in the us who had been facing deportation. He is now in a german nursing home as prosecutors there try to figure out if they have enough evidence to convict, reports the washington post. Palij's nazi history has been long known. A fellow guard at the trawniki camp tipped off authorities back in 1989, per the ap, and investigators first confronted him a few years later. In 2001, he finally admitted he worked as a guard, but said he did so because he feared he'd be killed otherwise. \" i know what they say, but i was never a collaborator, \" palij told the new york times back in 2003, the year his us citizenship was revoked. The us tried to deport him then, but germany, poland, ukraine all refused to take him. The us says monday's deportation took place after \" extensive negotiations \" with germany. \" trawniki was a camp where people were trained to round up and murder the jews in poland, so there's certainly a basis for some sort of prosecution, \" said efraim zuroff of the simon wiesenthal center.",

        "summary": "If you're drinking diet soda or consuming other products with artificial sweeteners to cut your risk of obesity and diabetes, a new study published in nature has some bad news: you might be doing more harm than good. Researchers found that sweeteners such as saccharin, sucralose, and aspartame can interact in a complex way with bacteria in our gut and lead to higher blood-sugar levels, reports the wall street journal. Scientists say studies on both mice and people back up the assertion, though the findings may not apply to all. In one of the human experiments, for example, researchers gave foods with such sweeteners to seven people who normally never consumed them and found that four of the subjects had markedly higher blood-sugar levels in just four days. \" in other words: some people are more susceptible to the effects of artificial sweetener than others, \" explains the verge. It all depends, apparently, on your particular microbiome, which the washington post describes as the \" vast and enigmatic ecosystem of bacteria in our guts. \" the sweetener industry is already disputing the research, but \" the scope of our discovery is cause for a public reassessment of the massive and unsupervised use of artificial sweeteners, \" says a study co-author at israel's weizmann institute of science. Far more research is needed before it's definitive, but npr grabs this quote from the director of the human microbiome program at new york university: \" i can just tell you... As a middle-aged man who's concerned about his diet and his waistline — and [ as ] somebody who drinks diet soda — i didn't drink any yesterday. \" ( meanwhile, us bellies are getting bigger. )",

Following a 2007 study that found palm trees in the foothills of the swiss alps, an international team of researchers set out to learn how cold is too cold for palm trees. Upon surveying global data, they determined most palm species ( there are 2,500 ) grow successfully in the wild if a region's coldest month is above 41.36 degrees fahrenheit on average, per atlas obscura. A handful of cold-tolerant palms, like the windmill palm, however, can grow in areas with a coldest month temperature above 36 degrees on average. With an average temp of 34 degrees in january, washington, dc, isn't quite there, researchers say, but they note it could warm enough \" in the coming decades \" to allow palms to flourish, reports weather.com. The same goes for the northeast, northwest, parts of canada, and other parts of the world that have long been too cold for palms. \" in all of these areas palms in people's gardens are flowering and setting fruit, \" study co-author david greenwood says, per earther. But \" just because you can grow a windmill palm or another cold-tolerant palm in your yard in utah, british columbia, or ohio, doesn't mean that species can colonize the nearby woods. \" for that to happen, seedlings — which are less tolerant of the cold than adult plants — must be able to survive their first winter, and that will take \" a little bit more warming, \" greenwood says. The study in scientific reports also looked at palms in the fossil record, noting their presence suggests a minimum temperature of roughly 36 degrees. ( los angeles is losing its palm trees. )",

            "Palms flourish in tropical zones, but as the world warms, they ' ll show up in new places. Hitchster/cc by 2.0 fifty-three million years ago, antarctica wasn't an unpleasant place for a midwinter sojourn. Back then, its shores and hills were ruffled with palm trees, beeches, and conifers. Winter temperatures hovered near 50 degrees fahrenheit, so the region wasn't frost-nipped, even if it was blanketed by near-constant darkness. Today, of course, the landscape is harsher and notably empty of palms. The trees ' notorious intolerance to chilly conditions makes them useful proxies for estimating historical temperatures. The places fanned by fronds have varied over time. When they turn up in the fossil record, researchers can infer that the region's temperatures probably once fluctuated within a fairly specific range.

        "summary": "A team of researchers has made a sure-to-be controversial breakthrough in both stem cell and cloning research, creating stem cells from two adults using cloning techniques. The researchers took dna from skin cells from two men, aged 35 and 75, and injected it into unfertilized eggs whose dna had been removed, nbc news explains. They then zapped the eggs with electricity to coax them into dividing until they became early-stage embryos, which were then used to make embryonic stem cells — with dna identical to the donors. In theory, the technique could be used to produce tissue perfectly suited to patients. The technique has been carried out successfully once before, but using cells from infants. \" if you can't do this with adult cells, it is of limited value, \" a study co-author tells the wall street journal, because there are more diseases the therapy can treat for adults. What the research paper leaves unsaid is that this is also a breakthrough in human cloning, the washington post points out. While the very early-stage embryos might not be viable in a womb, the prospect is now closer.",

Founder elizabeth holmes and former president and coo ramesh balwani with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud, reports the wall street journal. They allege holmes and balwani defrauded investors, doctors, and patients out of millions of dollars. The indictments are the culmination of a 2½ year investigation into the blood-testing company. Theranos is a cautionary tale for red-hot startups. Once lauded as the youngest self-made female billionaire, holmes sold investors on unproven claims that the company's devices could test for conditions such as cancer and cholesterol with just a pinprick of blood, reports bbc. If convicted holmes and balwani face up to 20 years in prison, a fine of $ 250,000, and restitution, per cnn. The wall street journal first sounded an alarm about the company in a series of articles beginning in october 2015. They found that theranos's much-hyped blood-testing technology was unreliable, and in fact the company relied mostly on commercial products purchased from other companies. Compounding the problem, the company altered the products they purchased in ways that compromised the accuracy of the testing results. Prosecutors say holmes, 34, and balwani, 53, knew their product was faulty. Eventually, the company was forced to void or correct nearly a million test results and reimburse tens of thousands of customers. Theranos is nearing the liquidation stage. Fortress investment group, which loaned theranos $ 65 million last year, is expected to seize the company's assets soon.",

        "summary": "Always check your pockets. That's the message bob hoffman learned the hard way after his wife donated one of his old shirts — and $ 8,000 he had stuffed in a pocket. The man from long beach, calif., was keeping the secret stash to surprise his wife, linda, with a dream trip to italy after he retired in 2018, the orange county register reports. For six years, hoffman, 65, had been padding the wad, which he had kept in a bank account. He withdrew the cash earlier this month with the intention of helping out a relative who had fallen on hard times. In the meantime, he tucked in an envelope in the pocket of an orange shirt deep in his closet. Then he forgot about it until he had another $ 100 to contribute. Hoffman remembered that two days earlier his wife was making a goodwill run and he helpfully offered to donate a bunch of old shirts. In the pile was the cash-stuffed orange shirt. Hoffman confessed his botched romantic plan to his wife, and the pair raced to the charity shop. But there no trace of the shirt. \" bob is an extremely strong human being, \" linda hoffman tells the register. \" i don't want to hurt his male ego... But he was crying. \" they went home and prayed. The next morning at 7: 30 a phone call restored their faith in humanity. A goodwill worker searching the warehouse found a bin of men's shirts — including an orange one. The couple recovered the cash and offered a fat reward. Goodwill refused. The hoffmanns compromised and footed a pizza party for the staff. \" what touched our hearts the most is how honest they were, \" linda hoffman tells abc 7.",

The university of central florida made national headlines in february 2013 when it decided to suspend all greek life activities following a series of violations within the school's fraternities and sororities. Here's a look at some of the organizations that have faced suspension following allegations of hazing, underage drinking and other offenses.",
            "Multiple sigma nu fraternity members can be heard making graphic and disturbing comments, like \" let's rape some bitches, \" \" we're raping some bitches \" and \" we're gonna rape ' em, who cares. \" knight news obtained the uncensored video of the june 9 incident from a source close to the investigation. The university of central florida has suspended its sigma nu fraternity and will pursue a title ix investigation over a recording where several members can be heard chanting about rape and promoting sexual assault. A woman who is not a ucf student made the recording after spending time in the off-campus fraternity apartment with her then-boyfriend, a sigma nu member, according to a ucf incident report obtained by the huffington post. The woman then turned the recording over to a ucf student, who filed a complaint with the university. \" she sent me the videos because she felt that they may be able to help me, \" the complainant said in the incident report. As a result of the video, the fraternity was notified of its interim suspension related to charges of sexual misconduct on july 20, according to a letter the university's office of student conduct shared with huffpost. Sigma nu will remain on suspension at least until a student conduct hearing scheduled for aug. 20, the university said in"

        "summary": "A planned vote on senate republicans ' overhaul of the tax code was called off thursday night as they struggled to find 50 votes — and an extra $ 400 billion or so. Senators say deficit hawks led by tennessee's sen. Bob corker have delayed the bill's progress by insisting it doesn't drive up the nation's deficit, politico reports. Earlier thursday, the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation released estimates saying that despite sweeping cuts, the tax overhaul wouldn't stimulate economic growth as much as earlier predicted, meaning it would add an estimated $ 1 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, reports the washington post. Gop leaders rewrote the $ 1.4 trillion tax bill behind closed doors in an effort to add $ 400 billion in revenue, changing it so that some tax cuts were rolled back after six years, the ap reports. Corker had suggested a \" trigger \" that would raise taxes if deficit targets were not met, but this was deemed to be against senate procedural rules. Sen. Jeff flake joined corker as a deficit holdout while sen. Ron johnson demanded a better deal for \" pass-through \" businesses that pay tax under the individual code. With senate leaders hoping for a final vote on the legislation friday, sen. Susan collins is also seen as a potential holdout, though sen. John mccain has given the overhaul the thumbs-up. Collins, unlike most of her colleagues, has said she is open to raising the proposed corporate tax rate above 20 %. If the tax bill does make it through the senate, the next step will be to try to reconcile with the house version in the hopes of handing president trump a bill to sign before christmas.",

The bill targets school officials who allow transgendered students to use their preferred bathrooms — as well as officials who don't \" take reasonable steps to prohibit the person encountered \" from doing so, us news and world report reports. In such cases, students could sue in state courts and win $ 2,500, plus more funds for psychological harm inflicted. The bill, sponsored by state senator cb embry, was apparently spurred by a request from the family foundation of kentucky; that group drafted it, he tells wbko. The bill would also require \" the best available accommodation \" for transgendered people who are uncomfortable with single-sex bathrooms. Students, embry says, are \" certainly welcome to live their lives as they choose. If they want to dress as the opposite sex and the school is ok with that, that's fine, \" he notes. The bill, he says, is aimed at preventing discomfort among other users of the bathrooms. Will it pass? it seems highly unlikely: embry isn't aware of a single fellow lawmaker who supports the bill. What's more, notes the head of the kentucky fairness campaign, the bill \" is in direct violation of title ix, the law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in schools. \" embry does, however, point to one person who apparently supports it. \" i have a friend, and we can all say these things, who is a homosexual and she agrees that she doesn't want men in her bathroom. \"",

That's the gist of amazon's announcement of prime day, a \" global shopping event, offering more deals than black friday \" only to prime members to celebrate its 20th anniversary next week, reports cnnmoney. \" step aside black friday — meet prime day \" is the header of today's gently trash-talking press release, deeming july 15 the day when new and existing members in the us, uk, germany, france, spain, italy, japan, canada, and austria will be able to take advantage of said deals starting at midnight, with new bargains popping up as often as every 10 minutes. \" members tell us every day how much they love prime and we will keep making it better, \" the vp of amazon prime promises. Techcrunch notes that amazon's swagger doesn't specify if by \" more deals than black friday \" it means if there will be more deals quantity-wise, if the value of the deals will surpass that of the day after thanksgiving, or \" if it hopes prime day eventually trumps black friday as each year's main celebration of consumerism. \" the site adds, though, that amazon has definitely had a significant effect on both black friday and cyber monday by reducing prices on 80 million or so of its products ( which, subsequently, put more pressure on competitors ). If you're not a prime member and aren't sure yet if you want to cough up the $ 99 yearly membership, the company is offering a free 30-day trial so you can take part in prime day. The big question: is this a one-off, or is amazon planning on celebrating prime day every year? a spokeswoman says the company \" doesn't have any future plans to share \" that information, per cnet. ( amazon is still trying to give flight to its drones plan. )",

Amazon isn't just launching prime day because it's in a celebratory mood. Amazon prime was instrumental in helping the company turn a profit of $ 214 million in 4q2014, a quick and dramatic reversal from the larger-than-expected loss it reported in the previous quarter.

In the study published in the journal sleep, a university of chicago team led by dr. Erin hanlon found that blood levels of an endocannabinoid known as 2-arachidonoylglycerol ( aka 2-ag ) — a chemical produced in the brain that's similar to those found in pot and that typically appears in the blood at peak levels in the afternoon and stays low overnight — actually kept rising after the afternoon spike and remained high all evening in subjects who were sleep-deprived. Not only did the drowsy participants find it harder to resist nibbling, they chose not-so-healthy snacks. People who use marijuana and overeat also \" tend to eat things that are yummy and rewarding, \" hanlon says. In this admittedly small study ( 14 people in their 20s ), the subjects camped out for four days at a time at a sleep center, with some volunteers allowed to doze for 8.5 hours a night while others only got 4.5 hours. On the fifth day, the subjects ' first meal was delayed until 3pm, followed by unlimited snacks, then a second meal at 7: 30pm. All subjects gorged during the first meal, taking in around 2,000 calories each, but the subjects with less shut-eye ate 1,000 more calories during the rest of the day ( and mostly salty or sweet junk food ); the rested subjects consumed just 600 more calories. Some of the tired subjects had trouble resisting these \" reward \" foods even when full, per the guardian. \" if you have a snickers bar, and you've had enough sleep, you can control your natural response, \" hanlon tells nbc. \" but if you're sleep-deprived, your hedonic drive for certain foods gets stronger, and your ability to resist them may be impaired, so you are more likely to eat it. Do that again and again, and you pack on the pounds. \" ( here's something else that can have a similar effect. )",

Science fiction movie? no, just apple's latest project. Residents of sunnyvale, calif., who live near a complex of buildings apple started occupying in 2014 tell the san jose mercury news it's clear something is going on at the complex, where the sheet metal fences are 12 feet high and security is intense, but no one knows what. One local says he hears \" bangs, \" \" thumps, \" and beeping ( like a truck when it backs up ) in the wee hours; another says he hears what sounds like a person \" waving around \" a big piece of sheet metal. Both say there's also sometimes an odd whine or hum that increases in pitch ( abc 7 describes it as sounding like \" some type of industrial machine ramping up \" ) and is \" loud enough to wake you. \" one family describes being followed by the aforementioned white priuses when they walk their dogs near the complex, and say that if they get too close, they're \" intercepted \" by security guards who use clipboards to hide their shirt logos. What does apple have to say? \" yeah, no, we're not going to provide an official response, \" says a rep. But clues, including two recent permit documents describing a \" repair garage \" and an \" auto work area \" inside the complex, suggest apple might be working on a car, likely some sort of high-tech automobile ( electric or self-driving, perhaps ). Prior reports on the noises described some as sounding like \" motors. \" asked about the permits, the rep did confirm that apple has, in the past, worked on projects related to cars. But the people who applied for the aforementioned permits wouldn't comment on what exactly they were for, and not much else is known. ( yeah, it's probably a car. )",

        "summary": "Good news for those who keep meaning to exercise, but can never seem to find the time: if you can manage a few minutes of running a day — even going slowly — you may cut your risk of death from cardiovascular disease. So suggests a new, 15-year study of more than 55,000 adults. Researchers found that the risk of death from any cause among runners in the group was 30 % lower than the risk among non-runners; runners also faced a 45 % lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease, according to a press release. The fascinating part: \" the benefits were the same no matter how long, far, frequently, or fast participants reported running, \" the release notes. Nor did a person's sex, age, or body mass index matter, and even smokers saw the same benefits. Runners lived an average of three years longer than non-runners. The study prompts the researchers to suggest that running should be promoted as seriously as smoking and obesity are discouraged. Researchers do, however, note a caveat: the study doesn't prove that running causes longer life, and it's possible — despite efforts to control for outside factors — that those who run are just healthier in general, webmd adds. ( but be careful: earlier this year, another study found that running too much could kill you sooner. )",

The event marked the start of a six-day family reunion between the two koreas, the first since 2010. It almost didn't happen — north korea threatened to pull out a day after the reunions were announced — but talks last week seem to have calmed concerns, allowing fathers to reunite with daughters, and brothers and sisters to exchange small gifts of clothing, medicine, and food, after having no communication since the korean war, the bbc notes. The south korean participants, who gathered along with 58 other family members, were chosen by computer-generated lottery from a waiting list of more than 70,000, but some were lucky to make it at all. Many were in wheelchairs and one 91-year-old man was so frail, he came in an ambulance. Upon seeing their relatives — 180 north koreans attended, according to reports — some fell to the ground and cried, others held hands and told family stories over old photographs. \" it's hard for people to understand what it's like when you've been separated so long, \" a south korean man told the bbc before he left. \" all that was missing in my life was my brother, and now that i can see him again, i'd have no regrets whatsoever if i were to die tomorrow. \"",

A senior law enforcement source tells usa today that while he won't comment on the specific case, \" there is no credible information to suggest an airplane's flight control system can be accessed or manipulated from its in-flight entertainment system. Nevertheless, attempting to tamper with the flight control systems of aircraft is illegal and any such attempts will be taken seriously by law. \" roberts — who allegedly claimed he was able to make the plane briefly fly sideways — tells forbes he has been advised to stay quiet about the case, though he adds that software that can be accessed through entertainment systems is typically \" for monitoring only, not influencing. \" earlier, he told wired that the information about the sideways flying was \" one paragraph out of a lot of discussions, so there is context that is obviously missing, which obviously i can't say anything about. \" boeing appears to agree that such a feat is impossible, at least on its aircraft: entertainment systems are by design isolated \" from the other systems on airplanes performing critical and essential functions, \" a rep tells cnet, which notes that roberts has not been charged with any crime.

Shear at the new york times, and his display of \" perfect calm \" was tailor-made for a front-runner. \" shots so not fired, \" adds elspeth reeve at the atlantic blog. Some notable moments: paul-santorum: ron paul accused rick santorum of being a \" big-government person \" who also was \" corrupt \" for taking lobbyists ' money. Santorum called the corruption charge \" ridiculous \" and said his record was \" pretty darn good. \" santorum-romney: santorum called romney a manager, not a leader. \" being a president is not a ceo. You've got to lead and inspire, \" he said. Romney also had to defend his work years ago at bain capital and said he helped create 100,000 jobs overall while there. ( that's a tricky figure to verify, notes the times. ) santorum-romney ii: santorum called romney's economic plan \" not particularly bold, \" reports the washington post. He also objected to the term \" middle class, \" saying, \"there are no classes in america. We are a country that ( doesn't ) allow for titles.... That's not the language that i ' ll use as president. I ' ll use the language of bringing people together. \" paul-gingrich: newt gingrich bristled at an accusation from paul that he took a deferment to avoid war. He said he was married with a child at the time. Paul followed up: \" i was married and i had two kids and i went. \" romney joke: \" contraception? it's working just fine. Leave it alone. \" perry-huntsman: jon huntsman called for bringing home us troops from afghanistan and elsewhere, while rick perry said he would return them to iraq as fast as possible.",

In a jargony four-page letter sent to homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen, some 19 ice investigators propose that ice be done away with, and that two distinct entities emerge. The letter explains ice is made up of two distinct components: enforcement and removal operations ( ero ) and homeland security investigations ( hsi ); those signing the letter work in the latter section. The letter outlines \" numerous reasons \" why turning those into two standalone agencies would make sense, among them the low approval ratings that have surfaced in employee surveys. But their larger point is that their work is polluted by that of ero, which detains and deports undocumented immigrants, while hsi has an \" extraordinary global reach \" and focuses on \" transnational criminal organizations that facilitate cross border crimes \" like drug smuggling and human trafficking. They say there is misunderstanding about what hsi does, and that the \" political nature \" of what ero does has led local law enforcement in some cases to refuse to work with hsi under the misguided idea that it is involved in the \" politics of civil immigration \"; others partner so long as \" ice \" isn't referenced in any public-facing materials.

He tells nbc news the screen wasn't shattered, and only one element was missing: a protective case that contained an external battery. Wilson says he confirmed the distance his iphone fell thanks to another bit of technology: the flight-tracking site flightaware, which provided his altitude.

The bbc reports on the \" major step forward \": researchers at king's college london studied differences in the blood of 1,148 people — 476 with alzheimer's, 220 with mild cognitive impairment, and 452 healthy controls. They zeroed in on blood proteins and out of 26, found 10 that were able to predict which patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment would develop alzheimer's within the year, new scientist explains. The predictions were 87 % accurate. These proteins could help doctors develop a blood test that will identify future sufferers more quickly, with doctors indicating that a current hurdle to treating the disease is that symptoms can take a full decade to appear. Still, there is no cure. But as researcher simon lovestone points out, he has no option but to tell patients who are worried about what might be happening to them to come back in a year to see if things are worse. \" that's grim, \" he says. Still, he downplays his findings, published in alzheimer's &amp; dementia, a bit: \" lots of blood tests said to be the next big thing haven't come to anything — we have to replicate these results with larger numbers. \" ( march saw the announcement of another potential alzheimer's blood test that makes use of blood fats. )",

Such brain-training exercises will not prevent mental decline or ward off dementia, suggests their new study in the british medical journal. However, the researchers do see a benefit for puzzlers, making a subtle distinction in what they call the \" use it or lose it \" debate: doing puzzles regularly throughout life seems to result in people having a \" higher cognitive point from which to decline. \" the puzzlers just shouldn't expect the decline to be any slower once it begins, reports the bbc. The study looked at nearly 500 people born in 1936 who first took an intelligence test at age 11 and have participated in followup tests over the years, per the aberdeen evening express. The researchers note that theirs is an observational study, not one that proves cause and effect. And as for the common practice of working puzzles into cognitive training programs for seniors, well, they can't hurt — \" the intentions appear laudable with no apparent ill effects. \" they also note that the holidays are coming up, and they don't want their study to ruin any gifts such as a big sudoko book or chess board. \" if family and friends give you a disappointed look on opening their christmas present, remind them that investment in intellectual activities throughout life could provide them with a higher cognitive point from which to decline, \" they advise. \" surely, this is as good a gift as any! \" ( changes in your speech could offer a clue into mental decline. )",

            "Conclusion these results show that self reported engagement is not associated with the trajectory of cognitive decline in late life, but is associated with the acquisition of ability during the life course. Overall, findings suggest that high performing adults engage and those that engage more being protected from relative decline. Results intellectual engagement was significantly associated with level of cognitive performance in later life, with each point on a 24 point scale accounting for 0.97 standardised cognitive performance ( iq-like ) score, for processing speed and 0.71 points for memory ( both p<0.05 ). Engagement in problem solving activities had the largest association with life course cognitive gains, with each point accounting for 0.43 standardised cognitive performance score, for processing speed and 0.36 points for memory ( both p<0.05 ). However, engagement did not influence the trajectory of age related decline in cognitive performance. Engagement in intellectual stimulating activities was associated with early life ability, with correlations between engagement and childhood ability and education being 0.35 and 0.22, respectively ( both p<0.01 ). Introduction loss of mental competence can cause substantial anticipatory concern among older adults ( that is, age> 65 years ) by suggesting that such loss heralds the onset of progressive cognitive decline and dementia.1 public health guidance on successful ageing highlights the importance of social and physical activity and engagement.2 cognitive endeavours that engage multiple activity domains might have important benefits.3",

The move also comes as starbucks hikes prices on some drinks by up to 20 cents, reports usa today.",

        "summary": "Napoleon's hats were a big deal. The bbc explains he had a system for breaking in and wearing the \" bicorne \" military hats that he famously wore sideways so as to be better spotted by his troops: he introduced four new ones each year that were first worn by valets and then put into rotation. With a three-year lifespan, he had 12 \" active \" hats at a time, and he's thought to have had roughly 120 in total. Nineteen are said to still exist, and what's arguably one of the most famous of those went up for auction in france on monday: the one he wore during his waterloo defeat. And while it was expected to fetch less than $ 50,000, it sold for many times that: roughly $ 407,000, to an unnamed european private collector, reports the new york times. Afp reports the provenance of the two-pointed hat isn't rock-solid, but records do date it back to a dutch captain who died in 1821 and said he retrieved it from the battlefield in 1815. Auctioneer etienne de baecque explains other hallmarks that led to the identification of the hat: it's the correct size, had been scrubbed of the trimming that napoleon \" hated, \" and was reinforced \" at certain points where he always held it. \" a hat worn by napoleon during the battle of marengo in 1800 was sold for 1.9 million euros ( $ 2.2 million in today's dollars ) in 2014. As for why this hat fetched far less, it's in worse shape, with cracking and dried leather. The bbc notes the red ankle-length cloak napoleon wore at waterloo has been a part of the uk's royal collection for more than 180 years. ( here's how a neurosurgeon brought down napoleon. )",

Florida-based nervana, a wearable tech company run by nurses, doctors, and engineers, is about to take pre-orders for its $ 299 electric headphones with an anticipated spring delivery, reports discovery. But the science is still out: while nervana reports that its proprietary earbud tech sends electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve by way of the ear canal to stimulate feel-good hormones like dopamine, the company calls it a \" lifestyle and wellness \" device instead of a medical device, thereby sidestepping rigorous scientific inquiry, fda approval, and the like. Anecdotally, early reviews are somewhat divided. The folks who tried the device out for futurism at the consumer electronics show this week had only praise; the writer notes that dopamine has \" special effects \" for women and goes so far as to confess, \" honestly if i had one of these sets i'd be doing this every day. \" engadget writer daniel cooper, meanwhile, describes his 15 minutes with the headphones differently, having felt only a \" mild sense of elation that lasted until i shut down the device, and for the next five minutes, i was a little spaced out. \" he notes the elation may have simply been due to the fact that he'd been given momentary respite from the loud din of a trade show.

        "summary": "The new york woman accused of murder in her fiance's kayaking death confessed to sabotage even before the body of vincent viafore was found, a police investigator testified at a pretrial hearing. Senior investigator aniello moscato told the hearing monday that during a trip to lay a wreath for the missing man last april, angelika graswald told another investigator that she had pulled out a plug on viafore's kayak, which capsized in the hudson river, abc news reports. Moscato testified that on a boat ride back to police barracks, graswald seemed \" happy-go-lucky \" and joked about jumping off the boat. Viafore's body was found in the river more than a month after he disappeared. At monday's hearing, one of the first police officers to respond to the scene said he found graswald, whose kayak had also capsized, oddly calm and \" matter-of-fact \" when describing events, the poughkeepsie journal reports. He said he heard her cellphone ring at the scene, though she had claimed it had fallen in the water. Prosecutors say graswald, 36, sabotaged viafore's kayak so she could collect his life insurance policy and confessed to the killing during a police interview last year, news 12 reports. Her defense argues that the confession was coerced and police faced a language barrier when dealing with graswald, who's from latvia. Pretrial testimony on what statements can be admitted in court will continue this week, but her trial is not expected until next spring.",

        "summary": "Friends and neighbors of the castro brothers say there is nothing about the three men that signaled they were capable of a crime as horrific as the kidnapping and decade-long imprisonment of three young women, the cleveland plain dealer finds. Onil, 50; ariel, 52; and pedro, 54, are members of a large and well-known family who was among the first hispanics to settle in cleveland. Associates describe the men as smart and funny, though ariel has a history of domestic violence and the other two were very heavy drinkers. Onil and pedro hadn't worked in years, while ariel was fired from his job as a school bus driver last fall. \" they were all good kids, \" says a lifelong friend of the brothers, who have six other siblings. \" that's why this news is devastating. It's not only horrifying to the families of the kidnapped girls, it's devastating to us, because these brothers were all very good kids who grew up in a very good family. \" ariel, a musician who played in local latin bands, had become more withdrawn in recent years, his uncle tells the new york times. \" it could have been because of the hiding personality. He had to have two personalities, \" he says. Ariel, the only brother to have lived at the home where the women were found, had a wife and three children but that marriage ended and the other two brothers never married. One of ariel's children, 25-year-old emily castro, is serving a 25-years-to-life sentence for trying to murder her infant daughter in 2007, usa today reports. In 2004, shortly before kidnap victim gina dejesus went missing, ariel was investigated by police for abduction and child endangerment, the guardian reports. A police report states that castro kept a child on his school bus for two hours instead of dropping him off at school, at one point ordering the boy to \" lay down, b****. \" police determined that no assault had taken place and no law had been broken, though castro was suspended from his job for 60 days. During that investigation, police visited the home at which the three women were held, but after finding nobody home, they went away and didn't return.",
