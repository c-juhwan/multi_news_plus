        "summary": "Israel launched a round of airstrikes on gaza today, wounding two militants and eight bystanders, including some children. Israel says the attack was retaliation for a round of palestinian rockets fired yesterday, which palestinians say were in response to another israeli airstrike earlier in the day, reuters reports. More than 470 rockets have been fired from gaza since june, but this was the first time hamas acknowledged responsibility. As usual the rockets failed to harm anyone, though one did kill some goats at a petting zoo. The incident comes in the wake of a drone flight into israeli airspace this weekend, which some have speculated came from iran. An iranian military official today boasted that the incident proved that israel is vulnerable, and that its anti-missile defense system \" does not work and lacks the necessary capacity. \" but he denied that the drone was made by iran, saying such accusations represented a \" psychological operation \" on israel's part. \" the zionist regime has many enemies, \" he said. Iran, meanwhile, is blaming israel for a hack attack on its oil rigs.",

Dubai ( reuters ) - the incursion by an unmanned aircraft into israeli airspace at the weekend exposed the weakness of israeli air defenses, an iranian military official was quoted as saying on monday. The israeli air force shot down a drone on saturday after it crossed into southern israel, the military said, but it remained unclear where the aircraft had come from. Jamaluddin aberoumand, deputy coordinator for iran's islamic revolutionary guard corps, said the incident indicated that israel's iron dome anti-missile defense system \" does not work and lacks the necessary capacity \", fars news agency reported. The iron dome system, jointly funded with the united states, is designed to shoot down short-range guerrilla rockets, not slow-flying aircraft. It intercepted more than 80 percent of the targets it engaged in march when nearly 300 rockets and mortars were fired at southern israel, the pentagon said at the time.

The armed wing of hamas, the islamists who control the gaza strip, said it had joined in monday's rocket attack along with the smaller islamic jihad group. Gaza has been under the control of hamas since 2007. The islamist group rejects permanent peace with israel and the two sides fought a three-week war in december-january 2008-2009.

Just a day after the attack, the cia's reports were already referencing al-qaeda in the islamic mahgreb. The following day, david petraeus appeared before house and senate groups; he, too, mentioned the terrorists, and was asked to compile unclassified talking points that congress could use. By noon on sept. 14, a draft was circulating — and it referenced al-qaeda. But an exhausting process of editing followed, with more than two dozen cia officials weighing in on the copy over email — and battling about the inclusion of al-qaeda. Those opposed argued it should be removed because the intel was shaky ( sourced from intercepted phone calls ) and over fears it could alert al-qaeda members to the fact that they were being watched. The opponents won out, though the term \" extremists \" remained; the fbi agreed with the call. It also contained this line: \" the demonstrations in benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the us embassy in cairo. \" on sept. 15, the cia station chief in tripoli began to voice his concern with the assertions that the attack was both spontaneous and that demonstrations were occurring. He sent the cia an email summarizing his thoughts the next day — but susan rice had already been hand-delivered the 94 fateful words the night before, so that she could prep for her news show appearances.

        "summary": "Mother earth has given birth to new land. An island has formed in the pacific ring of fire, where a volcano has been erupting since dec. 20. Tonga's ministry of lands, survey, and natural resources tells the weather network the volcano is erupting from two vents. One is spewing ash and rock onto an uninhabited island; the other is underwater. An expert who came within a mile of the new island, 40 miles northwest of the capital, says it's roughly a square mile in size. But as it's made of loose scoria — a dark volcanic rock — he says it should erode away within a few months once the volcano quiets, the ap reports.

Ministry officials say rocks are being thrown some 1,300 feet into the air, while the volcano is sending steam into the atmosphere. Bits of ash are now climbing about 6,000 feet, down from 30,000 feet last week. That means planes diverted from the area can now pass over safely. However, ash and acidic rain are still showering anything in a 6-mile radius, killing tree leaves on neighboring islands, abc australia reports. The volcano last erupted over five years ago.",

That number is particularly alarming when compared to pre-recession levels: in 2007, some 9 million, or one in eight, kids were on food stamps. There are currently about 46 million americans total on food stamps, down from the 2013 peak of 48 million. The jump signals what reuters says is a \" lop-sided \" economic recovery that has left low-income people behind, but it also underscores a fundamental partisan divide over social welfare programs. As the blaze notes, republicans want to scale back the supplemental nutritional assistance program — arguing that the end of the recession should indicate less need — and trimmed $ 8.6 billion and 850,000 people from its rolls with last year's farm bill. Democrats, meanwhile, argue that it's too soon to scale back the program. Meanwhile, some other highlights from the census numbers: 27 % of children live in single-parent homes, three times the 9 % who did in 1960 10 % of kids live with a grandparent, 15 % have a stay-at-home mom, 0.6 % have a stay-at-home dad, and 38 % have at least one foreign-born parent 48 % of households are made up of married couples, down from 76 % in 1940 americans are continuing to marry later, at a median age of 29 for men and 27 for women; that's up from 24 and 21 in 1947",

Officials suspect salt poisoning as the cause, pointing to higher salinity in water sources in their new home.

The species is targeted by poachers who aim to collect their horns for the black market in asia. Moving endangered animals from one sanctuary to another is called translocation and is done in hopes of establishing healthy populations in new areas.

Gold hunters in the area tell the chico enterprise-record the floods have \" rearranged the rivers \" and \" move things around. \" that means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed. According to cbs san francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While kcra reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer — which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997 — stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. \" i ' m going to have a ball, \" one prospector tells the chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the oroville dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time.

( photo: michael sears / milwaukee journal sentinel ) anissa weier plans to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect in the slender man stabbing case next week. Weier's co-defendant, morgan geyser, had already entered such a plea, often referred to as ngi, at a hearing last month.

One of weier's attorneys, maura mcmahon, said the defense had not yet decided. But in a pleading filed this week, mcmahon indicated that weier now wants to change her not guilty plea to the insanity plea. A hearing was set for sept. 9 for that change of plea. Weier and geyser, both 14, were 12 when prosecutors say they plotted and attempted to kill their sixth-grade classmate and friend payton leutner in may 2014.

After the medical examiner concluded that she had been murdered by somebody who tried to make the death look like a suicide, investigators used surveillance footage to determine that stepfather anthony aiello had visited her the day of her death. He told them he had seen her later in the day — but her fitbit revealed that her heart rate spiked, slowed, then stopped while he was at the house. During a police interview, \" aiello was confronted about the information from fitbit and the corresponding surveillance video indicating that his car was in the driveway, \" police said in a statement. After police explained \" the abilities of the fitbit to record time, physical movement and heart rate data, \" aiello claimed somebody else must have been in the house. He also claimed that two shirts with blood splatter found in his garage must have gotten that way after he cut himself and shook his hand, koat reports. Aiello, who is married to navarra's 92-year-old mother, was arrested and charged with murder last week. ( a fitbit told a different story after this man said a fat intruder killed his wife. )",

Booker called his act one of civil disobedience, reports npr. \" i openly invite and accept the consequences, \" he said, per cnn. \" the penalty comes with potential ousting from the senate. \" indeed, senate majority whip john cornyn read aloud rules stating that a senator who divulges \" the secret or confidential business \" of the senate faces expulsion, reports the washington post. \" bring the charges, \" said booker. \" all of us are ready to face that rule, \" added fellow democrat richard blumenthal. Democrats have been chafing that too many of kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the new york times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when kavanaugh was working in the white house of george w. Bush, he objects to language that roe v. Wade is \" settled law. \" he was going over a draft opinion stating that \" it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land, \" but he took exception to the phrase. \" i am not sure that all legal scholars refer to roe as the settled law of the land at the supreme court level since court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the court would do so, \" he wrote at the time.

Mitt romney has raised far more money than mr. Obama this year from the firms that have been among wall street's top sources of donations for the two candidates. That gap underscores the growing alienation from mr. Obama among many rank-and-file financial professionals and mr. Romney's aggressive and successful efforts to woo them. The imbalance exists at large investment banks and hedge funds, private equity firms and commercial banks, according to a new york times analysis of the firms that accounted for the most campaign contributions from the industry to mr. Romney and mr. Obama in 2008, based on data from the federal election commission and the nonpartisan center for responsive politics. It could widen as mr. Obama, seeking to harness anger over growing income inequality, escalates his criticism of the industry, after a year spent trying to smooth ties bruised by efforts to impose tougher regulations. Since this spring, mr. Romney has raised $ 1.5 million from employees of firms like morgan stanley; highbridge capital management, a hedge fund; and blackstone, a private equity firm. Mr. Obama has raised just over $ 270,000 from firms that were among his leading sources of campaign cash in 2008. Employees of goldman sachs,"

Jimmy causey, 46, has been missing from the lieber correctional institution since around 2pm wednesday, the ap reports. In his previous escape, he broke out of the broad river correctional institution in columbia in 2005 with convicted murderer johnny brewer by hiding in a trash truck. After three days on the run, they were recaptured at a motel 100 miles away on interstate 95 when a pizza delivery driver recognized them and tipped off authorities. Residents near the ridgeville, sc, prison have been urged to \" remain vigilant, keep vehicles and homes secured \" while the search continues. Causey, who first went to state prison for grand larceny in 1992, is serving a life sentence for kidnapping prominent columbia attorney jack swerling and his wife and daughter, the post and courier reports. He held the lawyer — who had represented him in previous cases — at gunpoint and demanded money. During the trial, the court heard that swerling had managed to get reduced sentences for causey on two occasions in the 1990s, but causey still held a grudge about having been sent to prison at all.",

Per usa today, the veteran was injured by an ied years ago while on combat tour in afghanistan. Surgeons from the johns hopkins university school of medicine announced the historic news on monday after performing the unprecedented surgery in baltimore last month. The patient is expected to recover both urinary and sexual function, according to the surgeons. Surgeons said they rebuilt the man's entire pelvic region over the course of 14 hours. Per the ap, the scrotum transplant did not include the donor's testicles, meaning reproduction won't be possible. \" we just felt there were too many unanswered ethical questions \" with that extra step, said hopkins'dr. Damon cooney. Three other successful penis transplants have been reported, two in south africa and one in 2016 at massachusetts general hospital. Those transplants involved only the penis, not extensive surrounding tissue that made this transplant much more complex. Hopkins is screening additional veterans to see if they are good candidates for this type of reconstructive transplant. The hopkins patient received an extra experimental step, an infusion of bone marrow from his donor that research suggests may help a recipient's immune system better tolerate a transplant. Surgeons said that is enabling the veteran to take one anti-rejection drug instead of several. In a statement from hopkins, the patient was quoted as saying: \" when i first woke up, i felt finally more normal. \"",

At a sheraton in waikiki, those looking to tie the knot could join in a giant ceremony. \" we started this battle 23 years ago and we get to finish it tonight, \" says an activist at the hotel. Indeed, hawaii played a key role in the early gay marriage debate: when same-sex hawaiian couples sought marriage licenses in the 1990s, a court battle ensued, resulting in the defense of marriage act. In the state, couples can apply for a marriage license and get married in the same day. That could be a boon for destination weddings in a state already well-equipped for tourist ceremonies. A university of hawaii researcher says the state could see a $ 217 million increase in tourism thanks to the process.

How to avoid such a tragic fate? well, for starters, keep your per-shovel load to 24 pounds or less. Beyond that, however, the recommendations get muddled, notes timothy noah on slate: shovels that make it easier to gather the snow make it harder to lift the snow, and vice versa. There is one obscure shovel supposedly better suited to both parts of the job, but good luck finding one in a hardware store. A few other things will lessen your risk: don't start shoveling while snow is still falling ( it's colder, so you ' ll put additional strain on your heart ); don't bundle up too much ( getting too hot isn't good, either ); and don't drink coffee ( it increases your heart rate ) or hot cocoa ( who knows why? ) right before shoveling. If that all sounds like too much trouble, \"wait till someone younger or poorer than you knocks on your door and offers to shovel your walk for $ 20 or $ 30, \" noah recommends. \"delegate.

Now, however, a new series of tests \" corroborates our historical accounts \" as a national geographic writer puts it to nbc news. It's easiest to understand the significance by understanding the history: around ad 325, experts believe roman emperor constantine the great arrived in jerusalem on the hunt for places linked to jesus; his team identified the cave that they believed jesus was buried in and built a shrine ( known as the edicule ) to enclose the tomb and then a church around it. That church was destroyed in 1009, recounts national geographic. It was rebuilt, and all archaeological dating coincided with that rebuilding — proving it was at most about 1,000 years old. The tomb was opened for the first time in centuries in october 2016 to allow for the edicule to be restored. A marble slab was discovered beneath marble cladding, and mortar samples taken from the slab dated to around ad 345.

It's not clear how bad the damage is to le marin, or the sailor, or even how the damage occurred, but the auction house said in a statement that two outside conservators \" have made recommendations for the successful restoration of the painting, \" reports abc news. One weird twist: the painting belongs to former casino mogul steve wynn, who previously had bad luck with a different picasso painting. Back in 2006, wynn stuck his elbow through picasso's le reve while showing it to friends in his las vegas office, reports bloomberg, which adds that wynn has a disease that messes up his peripheral vision. That restoration had a happy ending: the painting had been valued at $ 139 million prior to the damage, and wynn eventually sold it for $ 155 million. This hasn't been a stellar year for wynn: he stepped down as ceo of wynn resorts amid a slew of sexual harassment allegations.",

W. Samuel patten entered his plea in federal court in dc, after prosecutors released a charging document that accused him of performing lobbying and consulting work in the us and ukraine but failing to register as a foreign agent. Patten has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, reports bloomberg. Patten was a business associate of konstantin kilimnik, a man us authorities have said has ties to russian intelligence. Kilimnik worked closely with manafort, who was found guilty this month of eight financial counts. Kilimnik also is a co-defendant in a pending case against manafort, brought by special counsel robert mueller's team, that accuses them both of witness tampering. The patten case was referred by mueller's team to the united states attorney's office in washington, which is handling it. Andrew weissmann, one of the lead mueller team attorneys in the manafort prosecution, was seen at court friday. Court papers don't refer to kilimnik by name, but say patten worked with a russian national on lobbying and political consulting services. Prosecutors say patten, who formed a consulting company with a person identified only as \" foreigner a, \" worked to set up meetings with members of congress and also drafted talking points for capitol hill meetings. The goal, prosecutors say, was to influence us policy, but they say patten never filed under the foreign agents registration act. The law is aimed at promoting transparency about lobbying efforts in the united states.",

            "Listen to article 5: 30 a former associate of paul manafort pleaded guilty to a lobbying crime and agreed to cooperate with the u.s., giving prosecutors access to insights from a longtime international political operative whose russian business partner has already been indicted in special counsel robert mueller's probe. The lobbyist, sam patten, 47, admitted that he failed to register in the u.s. As a foreign agent for his work lobbying on behalf of a ukrainian political party. The nature of his cooperation isn't clear. Patten worked with manafort and on ukrainian campaigns, and reportedly worked on microtargeting operations with cambridge analytica. Mueller's office referred the prosecution to u.s. Attorney jessie liu in the district of columbia, according william miller, a spokesman for liu, who declined to comment about the nature of the cooperation or other matters relating to an ongoing investigation.

            "Listen to article 5: 30 a former associate of paul manafort pleaded guilty to a lobbying crime and agreed to cooperate with the u.s., giving prosecutors access to insights from a longtime international political operative whose russian business partner has already been indicted in special counsel robert mueller's probe. The lobbyist, sam patten, 47, admitted that he failed to register in the u.s. As a foreign agent for his work lobbying on behalf of a ukrainian political party. The nature of his cooperation isn't clear. Patten worked with manafort and on ukrainian campaigns, and reportedly worked on microtargeting operations with cambridge analytica. Mueller's office referred the prosecution to u.s. Attorney jessie liu in the district of columbia, according william miller, a spokesman for liu, who declined to comment about the nature of the cooperation or other matters relating to an ongoing investigation.

        "summary": "If your political scandal lasts longer than four hours, maybe get rid of all that viagra you've got stashed in the presidential office. The bbc reports authorities investigating south korean president park geun-hye for corruption discovered more than 300 viagra pills in her office. A spokesperson for park tells reuters the 364 pills — a combination of viagra and a generic knockoff — were purchased last december to treat aides and employees for altitude sickness during park's trip to ethiopia, uganda, and kenya in may but never used. The guardian notes that all three countries have capitals thousands of feet above sea level. Viagra can reportedly be effective against altitude sickness because it reduces blood pressure and improves oxygen transportation in the blood. But that didn't stop the discovery from causing a stir in south korea, where park is facing potential impeachment efforts. Park is accused of letting a friend have influence over government decisions and pressuring businesses to give money to foundations that support her policies. There are also rumors that park was involved in \" cultish rituals. \" thousands have been protesting and calling for her to step down in recent weeks. A bbc reporter says the discovery of the viagra will \" add an air of remoteness \" to park, who many already see as living in a \" different world. \"",

A hearing is underway at which he is trying to convince members of the nevada board of parole that he should go free. \" i haven't made any excuses in the nine years that i've been here and i ' m not trying to make an excuse now, \" said the 70-year-old simpson early in the proceedings, per the ap. Later, he added, \" i am sorry that things turned out the way they did. I had no intent to commit a crime. \" he also appeared to stifle a sob in his appeal to the board. Simpson has been imprisoned since 2008 over an armed robbery and kidnapping case, but he and many legal analysts think that the board will vote to release him. If so, he's expected to be out on oct. 1. The televised hearing is being livestreamed at various sites, including cnn. Per cnn, one of the first questions posed to simpson by a board member in regard to the robbery, in which he and other men entered a vegas hotel room to reclaim sports memorabilia, was, \" what were you thinking? \" simpson called it a \" big mistake \" and emphasized that he wasn't armed. \" i would never pull a gun on anybody. \" he insisted that he learned only afterward that one of the men with him, who was \" behind me, \" brandished a gun. Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing. Other simpson quotes: \" i ' m at a point in my life where all i want to do is spend as much time with my children. \" \" i've basically spent a conflict-free life. \" daughter arnelle simpson said her father is \" remorseful, \" and she wants him to come home so they can \" move forward, \" adding, \" it's been hard. \"",

Baio reportedly claims he asked mack to calm down in the interest of the children present; tmz's sources say she was \" undeterred, \" and continued to loudly repeat trump's taped claim that he could \" grab \" women \" by the p ----. \" baio apparently told police the argument turned physical when mack grabbed, shook, and pushed him — an accusation mack has reportedly refuted by saying \" she was merely trying to"

After an initial report on three former wrestlers, nbc news interviews a fourth accuser, shawn dailey, who says he was groped several times by dr. Richard strauss in the mid- ' 90s, when jordan was the team's assistant coach. \" it was very common knowledge in the locker room that if you went to dr. Strauss for anything, you would have to pull your pants down, \" dailey, now 43, says, adding he never approached jordan about his own abuse but took part in locker room discussions about strauss with jordan. Dailey specifically backs up the account of former teammate dunyasha yetts, saying jordan's reply to yetts after yetts complained about strauss was: \" if he tried that with me, i would kill him. \" dailey notes he's a republican, like jordan, whom he calls a \" close friend \" and \" good guy \" whose campaign he donated to in 1994. Still, \" what happened drove me out of the sport, \" he says. \" so i was surprised to hear jim say that he knew nothing about it. … that's kind of hurtful. \" former ufc champ mark coleman also speaks out, telling the wall street journal \" there's no way unless [ jordan's ] got dementia or something that he's got no recollection of what was going on at ohio state. … i have nothing but respect for this man, i love this man, but he knew as far as i ' m concerned. \" meanwhile, president trump has weighed in, telling reporters thursday that he believes jordan \" 100 %, no question in my mind. \" \" jim jordan is one of the most outstanding people i've met since i've been in washington, \" trump said, adding he doesn't believe the allegations against him \" at all. \"",

Verizon provided the location of the woman's phone, and police stopped her and her boyfriend, nicholas mattevi, in fayetteville. Mattevi, 32, was arrested and charged with false imprisonment. \" i can go to bed, \" medlin recalls feeling upon hearing of the arrest. \" we've done our job. \" he says he's planning to buy a smartphone for the office to replace the old flip phone and make it easier to text if there's a next time.

Consumers have been receiving new cards with fraud-prevention chips and on thursday, a lot more retailers will be asking customers to put their card in a reader instead of swiping it, reports the los angeles times. Oct. 1 is the day that the credit card industry will start shifting liability for fraudulent transactions to issuers and merchants that haven't adopted the new technology, which is already used in much of the rest of the world and is credited with dramatically reducing fraud by making it harder to duplicate cards. Cards without chips will continue to work until they expire, though experts tell the new york times that consumers who have the choice should always opt to dip a card in a reader instead of swiping it. The chips in the new cards use a system known as emv, for creators europay, mastercard, and visa. They contain buyer information and add an extra level of security by creating a new code for every purchase, tech times explains. In europe, consumers need to enter a pin, but us retailers will only require signatures. Around 70 % of cards will have chips by the end of this year, according to the la times, though the full switch is expected to take years. Retailers worry that the extra few seconds per purchase will slow down businesses at peak times — and that more fraud will now take place online. \" it's like closing the front door but leaving the back door open, \" a national retail federation exec tells the new york times. \" the thieves will figure out that the back door is unlocked. \"",

One of the xxx sites responded by adding a disclaimer on the home page, saying the sex tape is not sponsored, endorsed by or affiliated with the studio.so far, it's unclear how columbia feels about the compromise.fyi, you won't believe how popular the pippi porno websites are -- we're told they both average over 200k views per day.

        "summary": "Frat-house accidents and sexual assaults are getting so common they're impossible to ignore — but how did it get this bad, and why does it keep happening? in an extensive atlantic piece, caitlin flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \" that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses, \" writes flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at wesleyan university to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at marshall university — and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued alpha tau omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \" vast national organizations \" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow — so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents ' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? largely because fraternity dorms save schools \" untold millions of dollars \" in housing, writes flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives — like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training. But parents should know the dangers: \" until proven otherwise, \" a lawyer tells flanagan, \" they all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in. \" click for her full piece.",

            "One warm spring night in 2011, a young man named travis hughes stood on the back deck of the alpha tau omega fraternity house at marshall university, in west virginia, and was struck by what seemed to him — under the influence of powerful inebriants, not least among them the clear ether of youth itself — to be an excellent idea: he would shove a bottle rocket up his ass and blast it into the sweet night air. And perhaps it was an excellent idea. What was not an excellent idea, however, was to misjudge the relative tightness of a 20-year-old sphincter and the propulsive reliability of a 20-cent bottle rocket. What followed ignition was not the bright report of a successful blastoff, but the muffled thud of fire in the hole. Also on the deck, and also in the thrall of the night's pleasures, was one louis helmburg iii, an education major and ace benchwarmer for the thundering herd baseball team. His response to the proposed launch was the obvious one: he reportedly whipped out his cellphone to record it on video, which would turn out to be yet another of the night's seemingly excellent but ultimately misguided ideas. When the bottle rocket exploded in hughes's rectum, helmburg was seized by the kind of battlefield panic that has claimed brave men from outfits"

The charges essentially accuse liang of acting recklessly, says the newspaper. Police have previously said that liang's gun fired accidentally as he and a partner were patrolling a public housing complex and preparing to descend a dark staircase. The bullet struck gurley, who was on a landing one floor below. \"they didn't present themselves or nothing and shot him, \" gurley's girlfriend, who lives in the building, told dnainfo after the shooting. \"they didn't identify themselves at all. They just shot. \" liang, who has been on desk duty since the shooting, is expected to turn himself in tomorrow morning.

By the afternoon, a helicopter had found both the haystack and the needle, to tragic ends. Ron and mary tarnowski were found dead in the brookston area, near a hunting shack the family owned about 30 miles from duluth. Foul play isn't suspected. The washington post reports the couple lived near one of their sons, karl tarnowski, who noticed they uncharacteristically didn't return home on july 29. The duluth news tribune reports the couple didn't have cellphones or credit cards on them, nor did their car's onstar system engage, leaving authorities with little to go on. But there was, perhaps, a general area: their last sighting had been at 1pm on the day they went missing at a corner store near brookston. Kare reports the tarnowskis ' chevy tahoe was found in a remote area, apparently stuck on what seemed to be a \" swampy \" trail typically accessed by snowmobilers in the winter. Mary, 78, was in the vehicle; ron, 82, was outside it, some 50 feet from the road, suggesting he had gone in search of help. Karl tells the post that it's thought both died the day they went missing; mary is believed to have succumbed to dehydration and heat. The couple is depicted as a devoted one: a stroke at age 42 left mary paralyzed on her right side; ron was constantly by her side, but had himself begun to show early signs of dementia.

The soldier from the 2nd platoon, c company, 3rd battalion, 21st infantry regiment tells the newspaper that although epithets were never hurled his way, he was told upon arrival that the special day was a \" tradition \" in which soldiers \" can say any racist remark you want without any consequences. \" \" it's degrading to the soldiers, \" the staff sergeant says. \" we've had soldiers almost fight over the crap that's going on here. \" a junior enlisted soldier anonymously backs up the nco's claim, telling the times that \" you didn't have to participate, but they'd remind you. \" he recalls a latino soldier being called a \" wetback \" and \" border jumper \" before almost getting into a scuffle when the others wouldn't stop. The alaska unit is the same one in which 19-year-old pvt. Danny chen served before killing himself in 2011 after being deployed. Chen, who was chinese-american, reportedly had rocks thrown at him and was called names like \" dragon lady \" and \" egg roll \" in the weeks before his death in afghanistan, the los angeles times reported in 2012. A spokesman for the alaska unit tells the army times an investigation into the recent claims is underway and that \" there is absolutely no connection between this current investigation and the case of pvt.

Bustle calls her a \" shiny apple to sanders ' orange. \" sources close to clinton say the top priority for a running mate is someone who would be ready to step in as president, and that advisers aren't really looking at what a nominee does for clinton's campaign in terms of demographics and geography.",

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy ( 53 % to 48 % ) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years ( 68 % to 67 % ). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms ( like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia ), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says hendren. \" unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids, \" a scientist adds, per reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, medical daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \" an effect in our environment \" are all possible causes, a harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \" this would be a big and costly change, \" says hendren, who recommends \" a lot of research \" be done first.

Four years later, saunders has been hit with a five-year probation and ordered to pay the agency back almost $ 100,000 after he pleaded guilty to orchestrating a scheme in which he printed fraudulent money orders and gave them to others to cash, the cherry hill courier-post reports. Saunders ' accomplices, who helped him find people to cash the money orders ( including residents of homeless shelters ), fared worse on the prison front: anthony bell, 39, was given a year and a day behind bars and a $ 22,400 restitution bill; eugene bowen, 36, a 20-month prison sentence and $ 18,500 restitution; and andre sutton, 39, a nine-month sentence and $ 4,700 restitution. An affidavit filed in camden federal court by david bannan, a special agent for the usps ' office of inspector general, details how the new lisbon branch phased out the old money-order machine in 2013. Because it couldn't fit inside the office safe, however, the new lisbon postmaster placed it inside a cabinet; it remained there when she moved to another branch later that year. The agent details his \" evidence pointing to an inside job, \" noting saunders ran his scheme between august 2015 and december 2016. Most of the money orders were cashed in the philly area, as well as in knoxville, tenn. Once the stolen money orders started to emerge, bannan traced the serial numbers to the new lisbon office, where the machine had gone missing. Investigators then tied people who did the cashing to the suspects via their facebook connections and cellphone info.",

        "summary": "Thinking of giving up booze for the month after a hedonistic holiday season? well, you might be an alcoholic making a big mistake, writes tom sykes at the telegraph. As a recovering alcoholic, sykes should know. \" i managed several sober januaries, and they became an important weapon in my armory of denial, \" he writes. A real alcoholic, after all, couldn't make it, he reasoned. But the truth is the ritual appeals deeply \" to the classic all-or-nothing, getting-away-with-it mentality of the addict, \" while \" normals \" have no use for it. He advises instead trying to have just one drink a night — if stopping after one is difficult, you ' ll know you have a problem. But if you actually are a \" normal, \" it turns out there might be some merit in the month-long detox. The staff at the new scientist ran a small-scale test on themselves, and got some pretty astonishing results. Ten staffers laid off booze for five weeks, and saw their liver fat, blood glucose, and blood cholesterol levels all fall significantly — reducing their risk for liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease — while four staffers who kept drinking saw no changes. But it was a fairly limited experiment, offering no clue how long those effects will last. Heather timmons at quartz argues that such \" detoxes \" are \" useless \" in the long-term, since the body regularly clears out toxins all on its own. So instead, she recommends taking two or three consecutive days off from drinking each week, since it takes the liver a full day to recover from heavy drinking — plus, over the course of a year, that ensures as many as 150 alcohol-free days.",

            "( cnn ) a rare enigma machine used by nazi germany during world war ii was sold at auction tuesday for 45,000 euros ( $ 51,500 ). The collector who put the machine up for sale at the artmark auction house in bucharest, romania, had spotted it at a flea market in the city and bought it for just 100 euros ( $ 114 ). Vitally important to nazi war efforts, the enigma machine was used by the german military to encrypt messages into a form they believed was unbreakable. But the code was cracked by a team of cryptologists at bletchley park in southern england -- a breakthrough widely credited with having shortened the war by at least two years. The instrument sold tuesday -- to an unnamed online bidder -- was made in germany in 1941 and is in almost perfect condition, vlad georgescu, relationship manager at artmark, told cnn.

The \"typewriter \" was, in fact, a german wehrmacht enigma i, a world war two cipher machine, and the collector who bought it put it up for sale at the bucharest auction house artmark with a starting price of 9,000 euros ( $ 10,300 ) ( www.artmark.ro ). On tuesday, artmark sold it to an online bidder for 45,000 euros. \"the collector bought it from a flea market. He's a cryptography professor and... He knew very well what he was buying, \" cristian gavrila, the collectible consignment manager at artmark, told reuters.

In theory, the development by researchers at oregon health &amp; science university means that doctors might someday be able to grow tissue from an ailing patient's own dna, thus reducing the chance of rejection in a transplant. Commonly cited examples are growing brain tissue to help a patient with parkinson's disease, or pancreatic tissue to help diabetics. It's \" one landmark step in a very long journey, \" says an expert at children's hospital boston who wasn't involved with the work. The oregon scientists say they don't think the embryos used in their process could develop into babies, reports nbc news, but the procedure is nonetheless controversial because it requires that the embryos be destroyed. Nature notes that competing technology in the last decade has made the push toward embryonic stem cells less intensive, but adds that the new paper in cell is sure to reignite the debate. The scientists used eggs from donors, and it took six years to replicate the success they had with monkey embryos. They chalked it up to a series of small revisions over the years instead of a single aha! moment.",

Maroney had initially tweeted that the photos were fakes. At reddit, users of a forum that has been used to share leaked pics have been warned that some pictures of maroney and mtv star liz lee were taken when they were underage and if they're not deleted, \" this subreddit will most likely be banned, very quickly. \" the warning was followed by panicked discussion of how to erase the images, reports the daily dot, which describes efforts to advise users how to \" remove all record of their criminal activity \" as the \" aiding and abetting \" of a crime. The prostate cancer foundation, meanwhile, has decided to return thousands of dollars donated by users of the same subreddit as \" guilt money \" for viewing the celeb photos, rather crudely \" in honor of jennifer lawrence \" ( gawker has the explanation here ). \" guys, we're literally worse than cancer, \" one user wrote after the donations were returned, as per the washington post.

        "summary": "In 2012, a marketing research company determined pantone 448 c ( aka \" opaque couché \" ) was the world's ugliest color — and it's been used to try to save lives ever since. Per the guardian, gfk surveyed 1,000 smokers back then to find out which hue turned them off the most, and this pantone pick — a greenish-brown blend that survey participants said reminded them of \" death \" and \" tar \" — emerged the winner. Time notes the agency had been commissioned by the australian government to find a color so repellent it could be used on cigarette packaging to discourage people from lighting up. The new color was found to have the most ability to \" minimize appeal \" and \" maximize perceived harm \" and was implemented on plain cigarette packs with health warnings across australia, the brisbane times reported at the time. Early results are now in, and it appears the color that cnn describes as \" sludge-like \" may have made an impact: cigarette sales have fallen, and now other countries such as the uk, france, and ireland are following suit, per metro. So what is it about the color that makes it such an effective sales deterrent? a color consultant tells cnn it may be the strong resemblance to, well, poop. But not everyone's on board with trashing opaque couché. Pantone sniffs to the guardian, \" at the pantone color institute, we consider all colors equally, \" noting that the color's \" deep, rich earth tones \" make it a oft-chosen pick for sofas. But perhaps the saddest entity of all? the long-silent pantone 448 c twitter account, which back in 2012 reacted to the news of its denigrated status by tweeting, \" i used to feature so much in all your 70s couches, curtains, and wallpapers.

As in, \" the legend of kyle schwarber \" as the chicago cubs catcher puts it, per usa today. The 23-year-old suffered a devastating knee injury in the third game of the season on april 7 and sat out the rest of the year. In a surprise move, the cubs put him back in the lineup for the world series as a designated hitter. After doubling in game 1 — one of the few bright spots for the cubs that game, which came after tv analyst pete rose predicted he'd strike out three times — schwarber had two rbi singles in the cubs ' game 2 victory and scored another run himself. He's batting.429 with two walks. \" they're going to make movies about him, \" says teammate kris bryant. No position player has ever recorded his first hit of the season in the world series. And his \" eye \" at the plate is astonishing his teammates, notes the chicago tribune. The problem for the cubs is that schwarber is not medically cleared to play the outfield, but that could change before friday's game in chicago, where no designated hitter is allowed. But \" the next plot twist — \"will schwarbs be in left field? ' — likely will not be a twist at all, \" writes ken rosenthal at fox sports. \" he will be in left. He will receive a standing ovation for the ages. He will hit a ball into lake michigan, and then ride a chariot down michigan avenue, woe to any billy goat that stands in the way. \"",
