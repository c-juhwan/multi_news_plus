The body of alleged attack mastermind abdelhamid abaaoud was positively identified thursday, and forensics experts also confirmed the body of hasna aitboulahcen, said to be abaaoud's cousin, per the guardian. The third body found at the scene of the saint-denis raid has yet to be ided, and there's some confusion on the gender: the guardian says it's \" understood to be a man, \" while sky news reports it's a female. And a lawyer for omar abaaoud, abdelhamid's father, says the family is upset that abdelhamid wasn't captured alive — not because of familial devotion, but because they want to know where abdelhamid's younger brother younes is, per the times. A security source tells reuters that a younger brother ided as yassine abaaoud has been in moroccan custody since october, though it's unclear if younes and yassine are the same person. French police stayed busy thursday into friday, conducting 182 raids that brought in dozens of weapons and 17 detainees, the wall street journal reports. And two belgian men appeared in a brussels court friday, accused of driving missing suspect salah abdeslam to the belgian capital after the attacks, the times notes.

        "summary": "The antikythera shipwreck has yielded many exciting results since its discovery off greece a century ago, most notably the world's oldest known computer ( the 2,000-year-old antikythera mechanism ). Now divers say they've unearthed surprisingly well-preserved human remains ( as well as huge anchors and a teardrop-shaped lead weight ), raising the hope that enough dna has survived to be sequenced, reports the guardian. A leading expert who examined the skull from the new find says it's \" amazing \" that both petrous bones behind the ear are intact because dna is best preserved there, reports nature. If dna is recovered, it could give clues as to hair and eye color, as well as geographic origin. Uncovered in late august, the remains include parts of a skull with three teeth, two arm bones, rib pieces, and two femurs, and the early guess is that they all belong to a young man who was trapped as the ship went down and buried quickly. Researchers dubbed him \" pamphilos, \" a common greek name found etched into a wine cup recovered from the wreck. \"your mind starts spinning, \" says one researcher. \"who were those people who crossed the mediterranean 2,000 years ago? maybe one of them was the astronomer who owned the mechanism. \" finding human remains in shipwrecks is so rare that one of the only other instances is from this same wreck, when jacques cousteau excavated the site in 1976 and uncovered scattered remains from at least four individuals.

Juan gonzález: in a major victory for civil rights advocates, arizona's republican governor jan brewer vetoed a bill wednesday that would have allowed businesses to deny services to lgbt people. Gov. Jan brewer: senate bill 1062 does not address a specific or present concern related to religious liberty in arizona. I have not heard of one example in arizona where a business owner's religious liberty has been violated. The bill is broadly worded and could result in unintended and negative consequences. After weighing all of the arguments, i have vetoed senate bill 1062 moments ago. Amy goodman: the bill was passed by both houses of the arizona legislature earlier this month and sparked outcry not only from human rights activists but also from major corporations. Delta, petsmart, american airlines group, marriott and apple were among the many companies that urged governor brewer to block the bill. Some companies threatened to pull out of arizona altogether. Governor brewer also faced pressure from within her own party to",

        "summary": "Another reported first in the nascent world of three-parent babies: an infant born to a previously infertile couple, the bbc reports. The baby born jan. 5 in ukraine was created via pronuclear transfer, explained in more detail by new scientist: the mother's egg and a donor's egg are both fertilized by the father's sperm. The nucleus from the mother's egg is then extracted and replaces the nucleus in the donor's egg, meaning the resulting child would have dna from three different parents. A baby boy born in april 2016 in mexico also boasted dna from three parents, but for religious reasons, his jordanian mom and dad didn't want to destroy one of the fertilized eggs — so he was created using a slightly different method called spindle nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus from the mother's egg replaced that in the donor's egg before the donor's egg was fertilized ( the mother's egg was left unfertilized ). One other major difference between these two groundbreaking babies: the three-parent ivf procedure for the baby born in mexico was used because the mom was a carrier for leigh syndrome, a serious neurological disorder, the telegraph reported at the time. By moving the nucleus from the mother's egg into the donor's egg, it could ostensibly avoid the disease thanks to the donor egg's healthy mitochondrial lining. In the ukraine baby's case, however, the ivf treatment was used to combat infertility; a second baby created via pronuclear transfer is due any day now in ukraine. \" it's like the opening of a new era, \" the head doctor of the kiev clinic where the procedures took place tells the london times, via the telegraph. Scientific american, meanwhile, outlines some issues that have cropped up with three-parent ivf methods. ( here's how to get pregnant at 50 without ivf. )",

According to the suit, he once told her to \" turn around so i can get a good look at you, \" told her she'd look good in a bikini, and forbid her from wearing pants on her shows because he wanted to see her legs. Tantaros says that when she complained to other execs, she was rebuffed and told to drop it, reports the new york times. Eventually, she says she was taken off the air in retaliation. \" fox news masquerades as defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, playboy mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency, and misogyny, \" says the lawsuit. Fox isn't commenting on the pending litigation. Ailes resigned from the network following an internal investigation launched when former host gretchen carlson sued over similar allegations. Ailes has denied them. In her suit, tantaros also says that bill o'reilly made unwanted advances toward her and that fox execs made unflattering comments about her via fake, or \" sock puppet, \" accounts on social media.",

        "summary": "Movie executives surely thought the great wall — a $ 135 million film shot entirely in china but starring american actor matt damon — had the potential to be a blockbuster in both the chinese and north american markets. Unfortunately, they may have overlooked the fact that the movie about warriors and marauding beasts is kind of lame. It has a measly 38 % rating at rotten tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: jake coyle senses a \" whiff of propaganda \" to the film and points to director zhang yimou's close relationship with the chinese government. But that's hardly his only objection. The film \" isn't well stitched together. Characters appear largely as cardboard cut-outs. The pacing is frantic. There's surprisingly little sense to the entire ordeal, \" he writes at the ap, concluding the flick is just a bad monster movie. \" the great wall isn't terrible — you might call it the not-bad wall, \" but it should \" be better, something more than a lord of the rings wannabe, \" writes stephanie zacharek at time. It's visually appealing and the action scenes are \" ambitious and massive … but there's little magic in them. \" she adds the film tries too hard \" and to watch all that striving is simply exhausting. \" at the chicago sun-times, richard roeper sums it up like this: there are \" admittedly gorgeous costumes and sets and some pretty cool visual effects, but scads of unintentionally hilarious dialogue and one of the most ludicrous story lines in recent memory. \" to boot, \" this is one of damon's very few underwhelming performances in one of the worst movies he's ever headlined. \" in other words, steer clear. Leah greenblatt is only slightly less harsh. The great wall \" could be a really amazing video game \" but it's \" kind of a brick \" of a movie, she writes at entertainment weekly. The cgi work is nothing special and does little to boost the \" two-dimensional story line, \" but perhaps most problematic is that the film features yet another white man come to save his chinese counterparts, she writes.

        "summary": "Popcorn pops because... You set your microwave to two minutes on high, right? as you might expect, there's a little more science to it than that, and two french engineers have dug into exactly what happens when a kernel of corn does its thing. Their formula-filled study, published in the journal of the royal society interface, kicks off with this sentence: \" popcorn is the funniest corn to cook, because it jumps and makes a ' pop'sound in our pans. \" but emmanuel virot and alexandre ponomarenko get far more scientific from there, noting that while previous studies have examined the conditions needed to properly pop corn, the physical origin of a kernel bursting open, jumping, and making that sound remain \" elusive in the literature. \" using elementary tools of thermodynamics and fracture mechanics ( along with an oven, a microphone, and some cameras ), they set out to solve the mystery. Through a series of tests, they determined that at 356 degrees fahrenheit, 96 % of corn kernels are popped. But before that, at 180 degrees, some of the kernel's internal moisture ( the guardian reports kernels are 14 % water ) begins to turn to steam. At the 356-degree point, pressure has multiplied to roughly 10 bars; that's 10 times the atmosphere at sea level, explains phys.org, and it causes the hull to fracture. A camera taking 2,900 frames per second captured what happens next: at 6.9 milliseconds, the starch expands; at 13.8ms, \" we observe the formation of a ' leg ' which is compressed on the plate. \" some 7ms later, \" this leg bounces and the popcorn jumps. \" as for the pop, they determined that it's not caused by the kernel cracking or the popcorn jumping ( as in a pan ) — it's triggered by the pressurized vapor being released. \" more precisely, the pressure drop excites cavities inside the popcorn as if it were an acoustic resonator. \" ( scientists have also finally figured out how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop. )",

As the temperature rose to around 180 c ( 356 f ), pressure built to around 10 bar, or 10 times the atmosphere at sea level. Unable to withstand the stress, the outer shell broke open, causing a dramatic drop in pressure that forced the kernel's starchy innards to expand and protrude. \" we found that the critical temperature is about 180 c ( 356 f ), regardless of the size or shape of the grain, \" said virot, an aeronautical engineer at the elite ecole polytechnique.

        "summary": "When california single mother of six mariza ruelas joined the facebook group 209 food spot a few years ago, she and other members would exchange recipes, meet for potlucks, and sometimes swap or sell their dishes among members. So ruelas said yes when a member of the group asked to buy her signature ceviche dish last december, not knowing it was an undercover investigator from san joaquin county who, according to court documents, was on a sting because most members didn't have permits to sell food. \" food prepared in a facility that does not inspect it creates a risk to the public, \" the county deputy district attorney tells fox40. Ruelas maintains this wasn't a business venture, just a harmless hobby among like-minded folks. She was one of several members to be cited for misdemeanors in the sting, but while everyone else accepted a plea deal, she has refused — her proposed plea bargain carried three years of probation, 80 hours of community service, and a $ 235 fine, reports the new york daily news. Now she faces up to a year in jail and is worried about what will happen to her kids. Ruelas, who called the sting a \" waste of time and resources \" in a facebook post friday, is due in court wednesday. Facebook, meanwhile, prohibits using the site to sell guns, ammunition, and drugs, but it doesn't mention food on its \" community standards \" page.

The woman and one teen were able to escape. Manzanares kidnapped the third victim and took her to his home in mission, a small town some 350 miles from houston, police allege. When the woman came across authorities, she told them a man in a green uniform had her child. Law enforcement officials tell the monitor that manzanares, divorced as of january and with the patrol since 2008, tied up the girl, put a sock in her mouth, then went back to finish his shift. He returned and allegedly raped her, then killed himself with a single gunshot heard by agents who had just arrived outside the home, according to the fbi. The victim was found inside, still tied up but alive. \" we believe he is the person responsible for the kidnappings and the assault of all three of them, \" an fbi rep told the ap. \" you would never think he'd do something like this, \" said a neighbor.

China remained the world's top executioner – but the true extent of the use of the death penalty in china is unknown as this data is considered a state secret; the global figure of at least 1,032 excludes the thousands of executions believed to have been carried out in china. Excluding china, 87 % of all executions took place in just four countries – iran, saudi arabia,"

They now have a relationship, the express-times reports. It took longer to find his biological family. In june 2015, a dna testing service helped him to locate a man believed to be his second cousin; in 2016, he found his brother, sister, and mother. He waited on dna testing results — and those came back last month, confirming they are his immediate family. He announced the news on facebook monday, but tells the express-times that while he's \" relieved \" to be done searching, there are still \" a lot of unanswered questions. \" volk, who was in \" tremendously good health \" when he was found, per the new york daily news, is not revealing the identities of his family members, but says he's met his siblings and has exchanged emails with his biological mother.

The accident disrupted red line service thursday, with mbta staff temporarily shutting down power at the downtown crossing station as a precaution. After the woman was struck, riders poured out of the station and were rerouted to buses running between the harvard square and broadway stops. Transit police are releasing photographs of the man to ask for help tracking him down. Anyone with information can call 617-222-1050 or text tips anonymously to 873873."

But when i approached people for interviews, i discovered that nobody, and i mean nobody, was interested in helping me make this film.

The judgment represents three times the profit of $ 3.7 million tiffany is said to have lost to costco over the 2,500 or so rings sold through the warehouse club, plus $ 8.25 million in punitive damages awarded by a jury last year. Swain also barred costco from selling any item with the name \" tiffany \" on it, unless it's qualified by words such as \" setting, \" \" style, \" or \" set \" to make it clear it's not an official tiffany product. The suit comes as tiffany is trying to regain customers who've started going elsewhere for their gems. Per the complaint cited in the washington post, costco sold the rings next to signs that \" promoted [ them ] … as tiffany diamond engagement rings, \" and a salesperson used the term \" tiffany ring \" to refer to several different rings. But costco argued the word \" tiffany \" has entered the generic realm as a way of describing a certain ring style, the rings were stamped with the name of the actual manufacturer, and, per the street, the rings were sold in brown boxes, not in tiffany's trademark blue packaging. However, swain said costco management \" displayed at best a cavalier attitude \" in using the tiffany name to sell their wares and that its defense was \" not credible. \" ( tiffany originally wanted billions of dollars in this case. )",

The description for the podcast, which focused on gay's new memoir hunger: a memoir of ( my ) body, mentioned gay's \" super-morbidly obese \" frame and wondered whether she would \" fit into the office lift \" and whether there would be \" a comfortable chair that will accommodate her, \" among other things. Mamamia founder mia freedman also published an article on the website, since removed but available via archive, detailing the steps she says needed to be taken to accommodate gay, whose size, per freedman, can be a \" logistical nightmare \" for the author. Gay responded with outrage, tweeting monday that her treatment by the website was \" cruel and humiliating. \" \" ' can she fit into the lift?'shame on you, \" gay tweeted. The criticism continued throughout the week; she added in a tweet tuesday, for example, that \" i have never once in my life worried about fitting into an elevator nor have i made such a request. \" she gave a statement to the new york times tuesday mentioning that at least now the world can see \" what fat-phobia looks like. \" on wednesday, freedman apologized in a statement on her website, noting, \" i am beyond mortified, horrified and ashamed that i could have, in any way contributed to roxane gay feeling anything other than fierce, brilliant and beautiful. \" mamamia also issued an official statement explaining that the podcast intro and description had been updated after gay's complaints, but also pointing out that \" many requests \" were made by gay's publishers related to \" logistics. \"",

The country now says it has that evidence, reports the ap. Russia's foreign ministry said it yesterday submitted to the un a revised bid for more than 460,000 square miles of arctic sea shelf that extends some 350 nautical miles from the shore. The ministry said that the resubmitted bid contains \" ample scientific data collected in years of arctic research. \" the telegraph explains that the united nations convention on the law of the sea \" allows countries to claim an exclusive economic zone up to 200 miles from their coastline or as far as their land territory naturally extends from shore beneath the sea. \" what russia is arguing in its bid is that the undersea lomonosov ridge and the mendeleev ridge ( among others ) are indeed extensions of russia's continental shelf. The telegraph notes that the area russia is claiming reaches to the north pole, which the barents observer reports puts it at odds with denmark, which submitted a claim to the north pole in december. Denmark has argued that the lomonosov ridge is the natural extension of the greenland shelf ( greenland is a semi-autonomous danish territory, hence denmark's claim ). On its website, the un noted that denmark's submission would be included in the provisional agenda of the 38th session of the commission, which will run from july 20 to sept. 4; russia's submission will likely be considered then as well.",

Part of the east sussex coast was engulfed by the cloud and about 150 people were treated for breathing problems, stinging eyes and vomiting. The maritime and coastguard agency ( mca ) said emissions from the area's many shipwrecks might be the cause. It is also investigating discharges from passing ships or lost cargo. Birling gap beach was evacuated after people began suffering unexplained symptoms from a \" mist \" that descended.

Medical marijuana is already legal in 23 states plus dc, per the national conference of state legislatures. What this means broadly: if you're 21 and older in oregon, you can possess and use marijuana in the privacy of your own home or on other private property, keep up to 8 ounces at your home ( and carry 1 ounce outside the home ), and grow up to four pot plants per residence, as long as they're kept out of public view. Other things to know, per cnn, the ap, and the oregonian: what portland revelers did in the streets today, per reuters, was technically still illegal: partaking in public isn't allowed ( that includes on public transportation ). Even your front porch could be considered a public place if your neighbors see you toking up ( the oregonian recommends you head out to your back porch instead ). The only way you can acquire pot in oregon right now is to grow it or have it gifted. There's no way to purchase or sell it legally until licensed retail outlets open — something the portland chapter of a pro-legalization group guesses won't happen until the middle of next year. What's grown or exchanged in oregon, stays in oregon. Weed can't cross state lines, even to the fellow cannabis-friendly state of washington.

For the record, curry used family birthdays, along with what she called the family's lucky number of 7 for the mega ball spot. She did not, however, relay any of her plans for her newfound riches. A state lottery exec described her as being in a state of shock, reports ap.

That's because the town's government is initiating a pretty appealing sounding experiment: testing a 30-hour workweek, in which workers will be paid as if they're working full-time. The hope is that the six-hour days will bump up mental and physical well-being, increasing efficiency while reducing the number of sick days that are taken. The deputy mayor says the plan has been in the works for a while, though the opposition is dismissing it as a political ploy ahead of 2014 elections. Regardless, it's going forward, with a somewhat scientific approach involving control and test groups. One unlucky department will stick with its regular schedule; the independent reports by way of sweden's metro newspaper that the elderly care department will drop to 30 hours per week for a year, then the results will be compared. The local reports that the mayor says a car factory in town recently tried the six-hour day, with positive results. But the local in 2005 reported on another town, kiruna, whose municipal employees logged six-hour days for 16 years before it gave up the approach in the absence of clear health or productivity benefits.",

That's pretty much what scientists do, he writes. \" can collecting specimens for scientific research threaten a species's survival? \" he asks. \" the short answer is no, there is absolutely no evidence that any scientist has ever driven a species to extinction. \" and if taking one specimen would doom a species, the species was doomed anyway.

How could he have killed this innocent arthropod, commenters asked, referring not to the practical difficulties of subduing an invertebrate that weighs more than an iphone 6 ( aapl ), but to the perceived injustice of the execution. \"you had to murder the poor thing so you could benefit? pathetic. \" said lizbeth hull on naskrecki's facebook ( fb ) page. \"did you kill this amazing animal because you have to own it? \" asked ian freedman. One person sent an e-mail saying that a member of naskrecki's family should be killed for what he did. Why did the scientist kill his specimen? because, he says, that's what"

The washington post calls it \" one of the surest signals to date of autocracy's return to the country, \" and it's apparently tied to the ongoing \" grudge match \" between prime minister viktor orban and hungarian-american philanthropist george soros, who founded the ceu. The school has been a target since at least spring 2017, when hungary pushed through legislation that mandated foreign schools establish academic programs in their home countries. Ceu set up a program at new york's bard college, but hungary refuses to recognize it. \" arbitrary eviction of a reputable university is a flagrant violation of academic freedom, \" ceu announced. \" it is a dark day for europe and a dark day for hungary. \" orban has long gone after the liberal soros, a feud that escalated in 2015 after the orban-led right-wing government took issue with soros calling for the humane treatment of refugees, per the guardian. Buzzfeed also paints the development as a \" defeat for the trump administration, \" as us officials had lobbied to keep the school where it is, and trump has tried to curry favor with orban rather than isolating him, as previous us presidents had done. Al jazeera notes the university had set a dec. 1 deadline for a deal to be struck with hungary and that its decision to leave wasn't by choice. \" ceu has been forced out, \" says the school's president, michael ignatieff, per euronews. \" this is unprecedented. \" the university will relocate to vienna.

Now the man nicknamed \" duterte harry \" is warning corrupt officials he will toss them from his helicopter — and he says he's already done it. \" if you are corrupt, i will fetch you with a helicopter and i will throw you out on the way to manila, \" duterte said on tuesday, per the philippine star. \" i have done that before, why should i not do it again? \" duterte even furnished details about how high the pilot had to fly so \" the body's splatter wouldn't cause a commotion, \" per the star. Speaking in the northern town of camarines sur after touring areas devastated by a christmas day typhoon, it didn't take long for the strongman to turn the topic to one of his favorite topics, execution of drug dealers and other criminals. Earlier this month duterte said that as mayor of davao he hunted down criminals on motorbike to show the police \" that if i can do it, why can't you. \" he once threatened to kill his children if they used drugs. In his latest speech, he stressed his campaign against drugs and corruption will remain the centerpiece of his six-year term. Human rights groups have railed against duterte's extrajudicial war that has left more than 5,000 dead since he took office in june. While some 2,000 deaths resulted from anti-drug operations, many of the executions have been carried out by hit squads and unidentified assailants, per the guardian.

She was airlifted from bird valley to anchorage within an hour — \" amazingly fast \" by alaska standards, notes adn — with severe, but not life-threatening, injuries. A wildlife biologist says two things didn't help: knudsen was wearing ear buds and wasn't carrying pepper spray or any kind of deterrent. The attack is the third this summer — two months ago, a woman was mauled after she and her husband were separated while running at joint base elmendorf-richardson — this one also involved cubs.

        "summary": "With his deal to keep carrier's factory in indianapolis open, donald trump has fulfilled a big campaign promise, saved 1,100 highly paid american jobs — and, once again, created an enormous controversy. Carrier, which had planned to shift production to mexico, will receive at least $ 7 million in financial incentives from indiana. Critics say this sets a dangerous precedent, and wonder whether trump is planning to make deals with every company that threatens to move jobs overseas. A round-up of coverage: trump praised the deal in a visit to the factory thursday, cbs reports. \" companies are not going to leave the united states anymore without consequences. It's not gonna happen, \" he said. United technologies, carrier's parent company, \" took trump hostage and won. And that should send a shock wave of fear through all workers across the country, \" bernie sanders writes in a washington post op-ed. With the deal, he writes trump has endangered previously safe jobs by signaling \" to every corporation in america that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives. \" white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters the deal is \" obviously good news, \" but hardly comparable to the 804,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector he said president obama created, the guardian reports. Trump would need to \" make 804 more announcements just like that \" to equal what obama did, earnest said. Trump revealed to carrier workers that despite his promise to keep jobs there, he hadn't really been talking about that particular factory. \" i said carrier will never leave, \" he said. \" but that was a euphemism. I was talking about carrier like all the other companies from here on in. \" he said he decided to get on the phone to execs anyway \" because of the love affair i've had — this has been a very special state to us. \" jimmy pethokoukis, an analyst at the conservative american enterprise institute, didn't pull his punches in an interview with cnbc. He said trump's remarks were the worst economic speech since walter mondale's attack on reaganomics in 1984.

For some, it's even more personal than simply fulfilling citizen duties: one navy vet guarding a recruiting center in madison, wis., told wkow that his son was a recruiter inside that center. But not everyone's thrilled these diy defenders are taking matters into their own hands. \" while we greatly appreciate the support of the american public during this tragedy, we ask that citizens do not stand guard at our recruiting offices, \" a marine corps public affairs officer says in an emailed statement to the ap.

Dustin gray, 29, had pulled to the side of the road and wandered about 50 feet into the woods to let clover, his 11-month-old lab mix, pee, when a black bear attacked the puppy. Gray said he punched and kicked the bear until it stopped biting her, which prompted the animal to knock him over as it ran off. \"i stuck my finger right in its eye, \" he said. Game warden shannon fish confirmed that there were traces of a bear living in a small den where the attack occurred. \"this does not happen, except in freak instances, and monday was a freak instance, \" fish said. It appeared to be the first time in maine that a human had fought off a bear since 2010. Black bears, which rarely attack other animals, hibernate in dens during the winter months, and typically don't emerge until spring, fish said. It's likely that the bear in this case had recently relocated to the spot off of route 1a after last month's heavy rains flooded many of the area dens, and the bear hadn't fallen back into deep hibernation, he said. \"definitely that was the last thing on my mind, seeing a bear in the winter, \" said gray, who walked away with only scratches and bruises. Clover is in worse shape, and still recovering from significant puncture wounds, he said. Monday's attack occurred around 3: 30 p.m., after gray",

            "Courtesy of dustin gray courtesy of dustin gray by callie ferguson, bdn staff • february 9, 2018 2: 23 pm updated: february 9, 2018 8: 01 pm related stories here are 6 tips to avoid a black bear confrontation an orrington man said he fought off a black bear that attacked his puppy in the woods off of route 1a in dedham. Dustin gray, 29, had pulled to the side of the road and wandered about 50 feet into the woods to let clover, his 11-month-old lab mix, pee, when a black bear attacked the puppy. Gray said he punched and kicked the bear until it stopped biting her, which prompted the animal to knock him over as it ran off. \"i stuck my finger right in its eye, \" he said. Game warden shannon fish confirmed that there were traces of a bear living in a small den where the attack occurred. \"this does not happen, except in freak instances, and monday was a freak instance, \" fish said. It appeared to be the first time in maine that a human had fought off a bear since 2010. Black bears, which rarely attack other animals, hibernate in dens during the winter months, and typically don't emerge until spring, fish said. It's likely that the bear in this case had recently relocated to the spot off of route 1a after last month's heavy rains flooded many of the area dens, and the bear hadn't fallen back into deep hibernation, he said. \"definitely that was the last thing on my mind, seeing a bear in the winter, \" said gray, who walked away with only scratches and bruises. Clover is in worse shape, and still recovering from significant puncture wounds, he said. Monday's attack occurred around 3: 30 p.m., after gray",
            "Dedham, maine ( ap ) — a maine man says he punched and kicked a 150-pound bear, scaring it away after it attacked his puppy in the woods. Twenty-nine-year-old dustin gray said the bear lunged at him and his 11-month-old puppy on monday. The 6-foot-5 man tells the bangor daily news that he punched and kicked the bear until it fled and knocked him over in the process. Gray suffered scratches and bruises, but his labrador mix, clover, suffered severe puncture wounds. The dog was being treated. Gray said the attack happened near route 1a in dedham when he stopped to let the puppy relieve herself. The maine warden service is investigating. Bear attacks are unusual and even rarer in the winter when bears are supposed to be hibernating. ___ information from: bangor daily news, http://www.bangordailynews.com"

In his 2003 application to become texas solicitor general, cruz revealed that as a 17-year-old high school senior, he was ticketed for possession of alcohol as a minor after he was pulled over and a case of beer was found in his trunk. \" teenagers often make foolish mistakes, and that certainly applied to me as well, \" he tells buzzfeed.

But before we get to that point, let's enjoy some of the funny crimes people on twitter had to offer. Conservatives also used the opportunity to talk about all of their favorite cruz moments, while liberals used the hashtag to post crimes they feel cruz actually committed. But, guys, a politician having unopened alcohol in his car when he was high-school aged is hardly grounds for alarm.

        "summary": "The new tesla model 3 has no speedometer or other gauges behind the steering wheel. In fact, it has \" very few buttons or controls of any kind. \" the first 30 model 3s were unveiled friday night — handed out to tesla employees — giving the world its first look at elon musk's vision for a mass-market car. Mashable has the details on the \" sleek and minimalist \" interior. All necessary information and controls for the driver are contained on a 15-inch digital display. The result is a dashboard that's \" striking \" for its emptiness. The model 3's roof is nearly entirely glass — in order to make it feel roomier — and the three rear seats fold down for extra storage. Here's everything else you need to know about the tesla model 3: there is no key to unlock or start the model 3, cnet reports. And unlike other cars with keyless technology, there isn't even a key fob. Instead, model 3 owners will use their smartphones to unlock and start the car. \" my first reaction was a profound sense of delight. It wasn't bland, nor sterile, nor cheap feeling. Here was something different, \" states the verge, which took a test drive of the model 3, calling it \" the car elon musk promised to make 14 years ago. \" motor trend has a far more in-depth test drive for readers who understand car talk. For example: \" the ride is alfa giulia ( maybe even quadrifoglio ) – firm, and quickly, i ' m carving stunt road like a sochi olympics giant slalomer, micrometering my swipes at the apexes. \" meanwhile, the washington post has the broad strokes of what we learned about the model 3 on friday: top speed of 130mph, range of between 220 and 310 miles depending on the battery, six colors available, an enhanced autopilot feature that can change lanes and park for you, and more. The post also goes into pricing. While tesla is touting the model 3 as affordable, analysts say it's more of \" an aspirational vehicle. \" the base price of $ 35,000 can balloon to up to $ 60,000 with premium options — well above the $ 36,000 the average us consumer spends on a new car. Finally, musk himself is warning of \" manufacturing hell \" in the coming months as the tesla factory attempts to ramp up to producing 10,000 model 3s per week, the wall street journal reports. The company says it has 500,000 reservations for the new model, and it has missed production goals in the past.",

In what the verge calls a \" mind-boggling wrinkle in an already stranger-than-fiction legal tussle, \" jk trotter reports that thiel \" lawyer-for-hire \" charles j. Harder sent gawker a letter last week railing against ashley feinberg's investigative piece on edward ivari and his company, ivari international, which may have given trump his \" $ 60,000 weave. \" harding's letter takes issue with the hair-extension expose, saying the \" false and defamatory \" story — he lists what he says are 19 different defamatory statements — invaded ivari's privacy and caused emotional distress, and threatens legal action if certain conditions aren't met. Trotter, not unsurprisingly, calls his claims \" ridiculous \" and annotates his letter with its own rebuttals ( even though he initially said gawker wasn't going to post the \" confidential \" letter for fear of \" distracting litigation \" ). But more pressing for gawker than \" the absurdity of harder's threats \" is the \" underlying mission of the man who pays him: to intimidate gawker and its reporters from publishing true things about public figures. \" trotter notes harder has pursued ( and is pursuing ) other cases against gawker. As for harder's demands that gawker take down the trump hair story, apologize, and give up feinberg's sources, the annotations on harder's letter addresses those points with a big ol ' ( paraphrased ) \" nope. \" what gawker does agree to with a cheerful \" will do! \" is harder's demand to \" immediately preserve \" all emails, texts, and other correspondence related to the story.

            "Image credit: nicole rivelli/nbcexpect a huge void on tgs in march: ew has learned exclusively that tracy morgan — aka tracy jordan, the star of the show within the show, 30 rock – will miss at least two episodes of the nbc comedy because he's recovering from surgery. The comedian underwent a kidney transplant on or around dec. 10 and though the surgery was successful — he was seen at a knicks game on friday — the writers are giving him plenty of time to recover. Ew has learned that executive producer tina fey and her team of scribes plan to address morgan's absence by saying he has some sort of a meltdown because of a good thing that's happened to him. He's expected to miss at least two, maybe three episodes, that will air march. A representative for morgan released this statement to ew: \"tracy is doing well and taking some much needed time to recover after the surgery. He is looking forward to going back to work after the holidays. \" morgan is the second member of the cast to undergo a kidney transplant. Grizz chapman, who serves as a member of tracy's security detail on the show, underwent surgery earlier this year. He's the national spokesperson for the kidney foundation. In 1996, morgan was diagnosed with diabetes. He told time last year that during the first season of 30 rock, he didn't take the disease seriously. \"then one day i got really sick, \" the actor said. \"the doctor was like, ` hey, listen, we may have",

He's the founder of the voluntary human extinction movement, which aims to rid earth of humans. Sounds like a depressing goal, right? well, vhemt ( say it as \" vehement \" ) is actually pretty upbeat about the whole thing. To clarify, the organization's website notes it doesn't advocate for suicide, it's not a suicide cult, and yes, it likes babies. But it also states that the annihilation of humans would give earth a chance to recover. This idea isn't exactly new: the awl points to an overpopulation-minded essay published in 1798. But as the awl puts it, vhemt is \" the only serious organization committed to peacefully annihilating all of humanity. \" as its unofficial motto goes, \" may we live long and die out. \" knight — who had a vasectomy at 25, per big issue — started the group in 1991 and gained supporters with the zine these exit times, which included essays and comics, and, once, a valentine's day contest to win a free vasectomy. Those who are fully on board are known as \" volunteers, \" though all they had to do to \" join \" was \" make the choice to refrain from further reproduction. \" writing for the awl, joe veix sees a problem: \" if we are to assume that humans are so selfish/destructive that the earth is better off without us, it also holds that we're too selfish/destructive to ever actually allow ourselves to die off. \" knight offers this counterpoint: \" we're spreading memes, not genes, so the more people who learn of vhemt, whether they agree or not, it's a success, \" he says. \" i'd like to think there are more than a few people who don't exist thanks to our encouragement. \" the awl has more.",

She says she asked him to leave on july 5, 2015, \" due to his conduct the night before. \" they formally separated three months later and have been living separately since that time. ( beau biden died in may 2015. ) tmz notes that october 2015, when the couple separated, was two months after stories came out that hunter's email address was linked to cheating site ashley madison; he denied it. ( he was also kicked out of the navy for cocaine use in 2014. ) kathleen's divorce filing also claims hunter spent quite a bit on \" drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations, \" leaving the couple in massive debt. She wants sole physical and legal custody of their one minor child ( their two others are adults ), who is 16, per the wall street journal; hunter wants joint custody.

        "summary": "An eagle-eyed viewer in wyoming watching a hunting show on cable tv noticed something amiss — an observation that's led to two hunters from bedford, ky., being sentenced for poaching and forced to pay hefty fines, the ap reports. Per a release from the wyoming game and fish department, the \" concerned \" viewer was watching an episode of the pursuit channel's hunting in the sticks show entitled \" western redemption \" when he noticed that the licenses of hunters ricky mills and jimmy duncan, who killed two bull elk on the show, didn't seem to match up with the area in which they were hunting. They claimed to be in one spot but were in fact in another \" highly coveted hunt area \" in which elk can only be harvested every other year. The department, along with a local game warden, received the viewer's tip and opened an investigation, in which they visited the kill sites and started gathering proof. They also discovered that mills and duncan had tried to do the same thing in 2013, and that duncan had succeeded that year in killing an antelope without a license. The department's investigative lead says he thinks the men made \" bad decisions \" under pressure to get footage for the show. At their sentencing monday, duncan, 25, was told to pony up $ 17,500 in restitution and fines, while mills, 37, was hit up for $ 13,460. Both suspects were also banned from hunting and fishing in 44 states, including their home state, for 15 years, per the wildlife violator compact. The men also have to hand over their elk mounts.

            "Interstate wildlife violator compact purpose the interstate wildlife violator compact is an agreement that recognizes suspension of hunting, fishing, and trapping licenses in member states. This means that illegal activities in one state can affect a person's hunting or fishing privileges in all participating states. Any person whose license privileges or rights are suspended in a member state may also be suspended in oklahoma. If a person's hunting, fishing, or trapping rights are suspended in oklahoma, they may be suspended in member states as well. This cooperative interstate effort will enhance the wildlife department's ability to protect and manage our wildlife resources. The interstate wildlife violator compact also establishes a process whereby wildlife law violations by a non-resident from a member state are handled as if the person were a resident, meaning they can be served a ticket rather than being arrested, booked, and bonded. This process is a convenience for hunters, fishermen, and trappers of member states, and increases efficiency of game wardens by allowing more time for enforcement duties rather than violator processing procedures.
