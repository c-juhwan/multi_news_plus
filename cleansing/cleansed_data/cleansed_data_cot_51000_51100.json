They caused a big threat to the world heritage site by preying on native birds, bugs, and plants, and the five-year effort to do away with them got an assist from the public, with the \" million mouse project \" fundraising campaign bringing six figures. The department of conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016. A team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none. \" this is huge news for conservation both in new zealand and internationally, \" says new zealand conservation minister eugenie sage. She says more than two dozen types of birds, 21 uncommon plants, and more than 150 insect species will benefit. Both radio new zealand and npr note the mice originally found their way to the antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the antipodes isn't a stand-alone: the island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel. New zealand's ultimate goal is to rid itself completely of all invasive pests by 2050, per nature. ( scientists are bashing in the heads of invasive iguanas in florida. )",

Carrey has repeatedly denied the accusations, and his lawyer says \" there's nothing in his deposition that is going to change the truth. \" the lawsuit also accuses carrey of giving white three stds, and claims that's why she committed suicide.

According to the orlando business journal, this would allow disney to track guests ' favorite rides and paths through the park. It could also allow them to have donald duck greet guests by name or get souvenir photos or videos to them more quickly. The scanners could discern everything from shoe color, to wear patterns, to gum stuck on the sole. Disney filed for the patent back in 2015; it was issued by the us patent &amp; trademark office on july 19. The company, however, says it has no plans to actually use its foot camera patent. A spokesperson tells the times that disney files a lot of patents in an \" ongoing effort to relentlessly innovate and push the boundaries of creativity and technology to create immersive experiences and legendary guest service. \" disney had already decided against biometric scanning — such as fingerprinting, retinal scans, and facial recognition — to track visitors because it considers it too invasive, the stack reports. Plus those methods can be thrown off by things like hats and sunglasses. The company also didn't want to track clothing because that would \" require cameras that are visible to the person. \" the shoe-scanning cameras throughout the park would be \" out of a person's line of sight. \" ( but will members of \" club 33 \" have their photos taken? )",

Best's involvement is an interesting one: authorities stumbled on the gun smuggling operation during a drug investigation, after the rapper posted instagram photos of handguns and cash. Turns out, best was helping walker sell his guns, the new york post reports. Walker and campbell bought the guns both on the black market and through gun dealers, and would then stuff a dozen or more into bags and courier them on cheap chinatown-based bus services, the ap reports. On one occasion, authorities say, campbell brought along his girlfriend, who carried a deconstructed assault rifle in her zebra-striped suitcase. She then tried to reassemble the gun by looking up a youtube instructional video on her phone, but couldn't put it back together. The undercover officer bought it for $ 1,100 anyway.",

Undergrads can still keep hard alcohol in their dorm rooms, provided the bottles are smaller than 750ml. \"our intention is not a total prohibition of a substance, but rather a targeted approach that limits high-risk behavior, \" says a school official.

They sipped a mere 15 milliliters over 15 minutes, which allowed them to experience the taste of both without getting even close to buzzed by the beer's alcohol content. The scientists scanned the men's brains during this demure drinking game using positron emission tomography, looking for signs of dopamine release. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with alcohol and other drugs. They found that the dopamine levels rose much higher when the participants tasted their beers, compared with when they just drank the gatorade. The effect was more pronounced in participants who had a family history of alcoholism. The findings suggest that the jacking-up of dopamine levels in response to alcohol-related triggers could be a hereditary risk factor for alcoholism"

The gardiner water and sewer treatment district is suing none other than the national park service, reports courthouse news service, and it's over less-than-pristine water coming from yellowstone national park — specifically, water it's being forced to treat that contains high levels of arsenic. The district says that dealing with its sludge ponds will cost an estimated $ 2 million. Per the lawsuit: an \" engineer recommended that the district address this infiltration problem with the park prior to beginning any sludge removal project. \" otherwise, the problem would simply return again. But as the district \" cannot await the park service's responses any longer, it has been compelled to file suit. \" yellowstone is estimated to be contributing 95 % of the arsenic present; the engineer doesn't think the arsenic is coming from wastewater, but possibly from leaky pipes or manholes within the park, reports the bozeman daily chronicle. Arsenic can occur naturally in geothermal areas, and it's not uncommon in montana, notes cns. The district — which first wrote the park service in march 2015, then again in december 2015, to no response — wants a court injunction to force yellowstone to clean up its act, to compensate the district, and to monitor its sewer lines; it's also requesting a jury trial. A yellowstone rep said only that interior department lawyers are \" looking into it. \" ( meanwhile, one of our largest water sources is contaminated. )",

One of the six 136-foot covers draped over one of the plant's nuclear reactors to keep radioactive materials from seeping out is being painstakingly removed. Tepco officials say it will take till the end of 2016 to pry all six covers off, and till at least 2020 to remove the nearly 300 spent fuel rods lurking underneath. The project, which was supposed to commence last july, was previously postponed because of fears of radiation escaping. \" for the safety of fukushima's residents, we would like the work to proceed with extra care, \" says the chief of a group of monitors overseeing the project. The total cost and time for the entire decommissioning assignment: tens of billions of dollars over 30 years or so, nbc notes. Meanwhile, the japanese government today approved an increase in compensation payments to tepco to a total of $ 57.2 billion, reuters reports.

The fukushima daiichi nuclear power station suffered meltdowns in three of its six reactors after a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the country in march 2011. The disaster killed around 16,000 people, forced some 300,000 to evacuate their homes, and left a huge area of land unusable for decades. The plant's operator, the tokyo electric power company, or tepco, installed six 136-foot covers over one of the reactors in october that year to stop radioactive materials escaping. Related: thousands of fukushima nuke refugees to be allowed home the operator began on tuesday to remove the first of these covers, an essential stage before they can extract the 292 spent fuel rods inside. They hope to remove all the covers by the end of next year, and begin extracting the fuel rods in 2020.",
            "Tokyo ( reuters ) - japan on tuesday approved an increase in compensation payments for the fukushima crisis to 7.07 trillion yen ( $ 57.18 billion ), as tens of thousands of evacuees remain in temporary housing more than four years after the disaster.

            "Tokyo — a crucial stage in the decades-long job of decommissioning japan's crippled fukushima nuclear plant began tuesday, with operators starting to dismantle huge protective covers from one of the reactors. The fukushima daiichi nuclear power station suffered meltdowns in three of its six reactors after a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the country in march 2011. The disaster killed around 16,000 people, forced some 300,000 to evacuate their homes, and left a huge area of land unusable for decades. The plant's operator, the tokyo electric power company, or tepco, installed six 136-foot covers over one of the reactors in october that year to stop radioactive materials escaping. Related: thousands of fukushima nuke refugees to be allowed home the operator began on tuesday to remove the first of these covers, an essential stage before they can extract the 292 spent fuel rods inside. They hope to remove all the covers by the end of next year, and begin extracting the fuel rods in 2020.",

        "summary": "After four years of mapping our planet's gravity, the european space agency's goce satellite has plunged back to earth. The goce — gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer — was last heard from 75 miles over antarctica, reuters reports. It is believed to have burned up on re-entry, with hundreds of pounds of surviving debris scattering somewhere in the western pacific. Its gradiometer, the instrument used to make gravity measurements, is made of materials tough enough to survive the fall to earth, the bbc notes. Goce — the planet's lowest-flying scientific satellite — mapped earth's gravitational field in never-before-seen detail, revealing how gravity's pull is uneven across the world. The satellite's fall to earth, which was inevitable after it ran out of fuel a few weeks ago, was the esa's first uncontrolled re-entry in decades. But since goce was relatively light at 1.2 tons, it didn't attract the same attention as other recent re-entries, including the crash of a failed russian probe last year.",

Per the kansas city star, the ring had already been found when dixon and salas appeared on jimmy kimmel live! on tuesday, where they re-created the ill-fated proposal, then accepted a brand-new diamond ring from kimmel to replace their lost one.

Harvey is expected to make landfall as a category 3 hurricane late friday or early saturday, and accuweather meteorologist alex sosnowski says it \" may be nothing short of a flooding disaster \" for texas, usa today reports. Forecasters say that after it moves ashore, harvey is likely to end up trapped between two areas of high pressure, keeping it stalled over texas for up to five days, dumping as much as 35 inches of rain on parts of the state. The latest developments: the national weather service says ingredients including warm water and calm air high up have made harvey a potentially life-threatening storm, with a possible storm surge 12 feet high and winds up to 125mph. \" it's a very dangerous storm, \" national weather service director louis uccellini tells the ap. \" it does have all the ingredients it needs to intensify. And we're seeing that intensification occur quite rapidly. \" the service's safety resources can be found here. The latest from the national hurricane center is here.

        "summary": "There's no doubt about it: the human body goes through major changes in youth and old age. And these biological and social changes may be the reasons behind what researchers are calling less stable personalities at those life stages. In fact, according to a study of almost 4,000 new zealanders between the ages of 20 and 80, the stability of one's personality increases through youth and into middle age and peaks in our 50s, before we slide back into less stable versions of ourselves, reports research digest. As the smithsonian puts it, \" in some ways, our 80-year-old selves mirror our 20-year-old selves. \" some traits peaked at different times; the most stable traits in one's 30s are extraversion and neuroticism, while in the late 40s and early 50s it is openness, honesty-humility, and conscientiousness. The only trait that showed \" gradually reduced stability \" throughout life was agreeableness; apparently we are simply less and less agreeable as we pack the years on. Still, one's most basic personality — introvert vs. Extrovert, for example — tends to remain consistent throughout one's life, even if the stability of traits waxes and wanes, notes the smithsonian.

            "Most psychologists agree that a person's basic personality — whether they are an introvert or extrovert, for example — remains the same throughout life. What we might see as personality changes are actually just responses to external factors, such as getting a job, getting married or becoming a parent. That said, research does indicate that our personalities become more solidified, or stable, as we get older. That change is not linear, however. New research indicates that our personalities become increasingly stable as our 20s melt into our 30s, 40s and even 50s, but that that stability then often begins to taper off in old age, research digest reports. Researchers in new zealand recruited 4,000 men and women aged 20 to 80 to complete a personality questionnaire twice, with a gap of two years in between. The survey measured a person's honesty-humility factor as well as five major personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience, research digest writes. They compared how people's scores varied between years, and analyzed how all of the participants personalities related to one another, depending on age. Most people's personalities were generally stable, they found, but the stability of those trait followed a bell curve over time, peaking at middle-age and then dropping again. For certain traits — conscientiousness, openness to experience, and honesty-humility — research digest writes, the oldest participants ' personality stability matched those of the youngest. Other interesting finds included \" domain specific \" variations, or ones that seem to be linked to what a person is dealing with at a particular point in their life. People in their 30s, for example, showed high levels of neuroticism, but by the time they reached their 50s that had tapered off and had been replaced by conscientiousness, openness and honesty-humility."

It churned out lethal tides of gas and ash known as pyroclastic flows for over 100 miles, inundating parts of nevada and california, sciencedaily reports. By analyzing the vast volcanic deposit left by silver creek caldera, researchers found that large rocks had been moved considerable distances. Their conclusion: only a constant, heavy flow would have moved rocks that were already miles from the eruption.

In a statement, the national security council said it expects moscow to look at \" all options available to expel mr. Snowden back to the us to face justice \" especially in light of \" intensified cooperation after the boston marathon bombings and our history of working with russia on law enforcement matters, \" cbs reports. But \" intensified cooperation \" may not be coming: the washington post reports that a russian official today told interfax that moscow doesn't have the legal authority to comply with the us government's request. Other officials add that air travelers who don't cross passport control aren't technically on russian land; because snowden is without a russian visa, there's no way he could have gone through passport control. John kerry is chiming in, adds the ap, calling it \" deeply troubling \" if russia allows snowden to flee. But is snowden actually cuba-bound? the airline aeroflot told the ap he was booked on a moscow-havana flight this morning ( the expectation being he'd then travel to venezuela and then to ecuador, where wikileaks says he will seek asylum ), prompting a number of journalists to grab seats on said flight. But snowden apparently never boarded, reports business insider via an article with this headline: \" russia just punked a bunch of journalists who are now on their way to havana. \" ap moscow correspondent max seddon confirmed that there was no sign of snowden, tweeting, \" cuba here we come. Taxiing down sheremetevo runway and no sign of snowden. Seats empty still by 17a. \" how did snowden get out of hong kong yesterday to begin with? despite the chinese territory's autonomy, the final decision came from beijing, sources tell the new york times. The move lets china save face while avoiding a drawn-out extradition battle. Some legal experts are telling the new york times the us government goofed in waiting until saturday to revoke snowden's passport, though charges were filed june 14. Says a former federal prosecutor, \" they missed an opportunity to freeze him in place. \" still, the times notes that snowden may have still been able to fly to moscow sans passport thanks to special refugee travel documents from ecuador that wikileaks helped snowden obtain.",

That's the upshot of a vice article about the sport, which succinctly expresses why: \" at 20 feet, a pole vault accident is like someone falling off the roof of their house, while running as fast at they can with a thick pole in their hands. \" if that sounds like a brush with death, it quite literally can be: a 2001 study analyzed the 32 catastrophic pole-vault injuries that were reported to the national center for catastrophic sports injury research between 1982 and 1998; half the accidents resulted in death, and 6 in permanent disabilities. A follow-up study published in 2012 noted that one safety-related change made in 2003 was an expansion of the landing pad's minimum dimensions. In the 8 years that followed, the study noted only two of the 19 catastrophic injuries were fatal. But the rest weren't pretty: major head injuries and spine or pelvic fractures were among them. And a study of collegiate pole vaulters published this last january found 41 % sustained some kind of injury, a figure that researchers saw as suggestive of the fact that \" injuries are very common in experienced vaulters. \" the injury stats aren't good, and the potential pay and fame aren't much better. So why the heck do it? vice talked to us record-holder brad walker ( one of 18 men to ever clear 6 meters ), who sums up vaulters as \" risk-takers, usually with something to prove to themselves... You won't find a vaulter jumping high who doesn't have at least one screw loose. \" as for why they stay with it, vice points to its highly technical and challenging nature: as you approach the box you're a sprinter; then you're a gymnast.

            "An 18-year-old wimauma man is recovering at tampa general hospital after he was bitten on the lip by a cottonmouth he was keeping in a pillowcase on his bed, officials said. The snake, also known as a water moccasin, escaped from the pillowcase at about 11: 45 p.m. Saturday and slithered across the stomach of austin lane hatfield, said gary morse, spokesman for the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission. When hatfield tried to recapture it, the snake bit him, morse said. A bite from a cottonmouth can be deadly; its venom usually causes massive swelling. Hatfield was rushed to the emergency room. \"his condition has improved today and he is expected to recover, \" morse said. Hatfield had captured the snake sometime last week and was illegally possessing it, morse said. Because cottonmouths are venomous, a state permit is required to keep them. The fish and wildlife conservation commission is investigating and hatfield could face charges, morse said. The snake was captured and euthanized so a proper identification could be made, he said. A spokeswoman for tampa general said tuesday that hatfield and his family asked that no more information be released about his condition. He and his family declined to be interviewed or share photos, the spokeswoman said. The cottonmouth, a member of the viper family, gets its name",

Israel is in the process of evacuating the ulpana outpost on the orders of its supreme court, which determined that five apartment blocks had been illegally built on private palestinian land, reports the washington post. The ulpana settlers, who were moved to prefabricated homes on a nearby military outpost, said a prominent rabbi had advised them to avoid confrontation with the military. \" this is not a happy day for israel, \" one departing resident said. \" to leave a house is very simple, but to leave a home is very difficult. \" several other evictions based on similar court orders are expected to take place over the next few weeks. Prime minister benjamin netanyahu responded to the court order by vowing to build 850 new apartments in the west bank to replace the 30 emptied units. He has also promised to uproot the five apartment blocks from their foundations and move them to another location, although engineers say doing so would be expensive and impractical, ap notes.",

She told the daily telegraph francis had jokingly said \" no, please no \" at the prospect of being the next pope. \" i didn't want him to become pope because he's going to be very far away and second because it is such a large responsibility.

Speaking from her home, four doors down from where francis grew up in flores, argentina, damonte revealed her parents had kept the two apart because they disapproved of their budding romance. \" when we were young, he wrote me a letter and i didn't reply to him, \" she told the argentinean press. \" my father had hit me because i had dared to write a note to a boy. \" damonte's revelation came as the sister of the 266th pontiff, maría elena bergoglio, said she was concerned her brother would face \" infinite loneliness \" in his new role. She told the daily telegraph francis had jokingly said \" no, please no \" at the prospect of being the next pope. \" i didn't want him to become pope because he's going to be very far away and second because it is such a large responsibility. But i am also totally proud that he is the new pope - because he's the first from outside europe, because he's latin american, he's argentine and he's my brother, \" she said. Despite his apparent reluctance, francis, 76, was elected the catholic church's leader on wednesday, replacing 85-year-old benedict, who stepped down last month. Bergoglio inherits a church wrestling with an array of challenges that intensified during pope benedict's tenure - from growing competition from evangelical churches in the southern hemisphere to a priest shortage and a sexual abuse crisis. ·"

The fire came from some 20 navy seals who shot dead bin laden and three other men and a woman, only one of whom was armed, officials say now. Bin laden's courier, ahmed al-kuwaiti, fired on the seals as they launched the raid. After he and his wife were shot dead, the americans weren't fired on again, reports ap. The others were killed because us forces believed they all posed a \" serious threat, \" said a federal source. Initially, white house officials said the special forces came under heavy, prolonged small-arms fire as they moved into bin laden's hideout. Instead of chaos amidst a hail of gunfire, the team moved methodically from room to room in what the new york times characterizes as a \" one-sided \" 40-minute operation, confronting bin laden aides and gathering some 22 children and women, some of whom were placed in plastic handcuffs. The us forces ended up in bin laden's bedroom, shooting his wife in the leg and the apparently pajama-clad al-qaeda leader in the head and chest, reports msnbc. Bin laden was shot as he appeared to be reaching for a nearby weapon, said a spokesman. Cia chief leon panetta had reported that the men were \" engaged in a firefight throughout the operation. \" white house officials said all details of the raid were not initially clear. \" they were in a threatening and hostile environment the entire time, \" one official told the times.",

        "summary": "Seth owen was over the moon when he received what appeared to be the path to his \" life goal \" of going to college: an acceptance letter from georgetown university. But the florida 18-year-old, who was the co-valedictorian of his senior class, had his hopes dashed when he later received his financial aid package from georgetown, which had been based on the expected contribution from his family. The problem: he's estranged from his southern baptist parents, and was essentially forced out of his home, because he's gay, nbc news reports. Owen says his parents found out he was gay when he was a sophomore, made him go to christian-based conversion therapy, and eventually told him he had to keep going to their church — which owen says bashed the lgbt community — or leave. And so in february, he did, crashing with friends instead. He says he was \" devastated \" when he realized he couldn't afford the tuition for his first year at georgetown — annual tuition and fees comes to around $ 70,000, and owen would have to pay about $ 22,000 of that, per the advocate — let alone for all four years. Enter jane martin, owen's former bio teacher, who says owen always \" stood out to me. \" martin, who's also gay, set up a gofundme for her ex-student, who also served as the ring bearer in her wedding. She explained she wanted to \" help … bring a rainbow in the midst of seth's storm \" and \" make the impossible possible. \" the gofundme has so far raised more than $ 82,000 — and if georgetown eventually acquiesces and adjusts owen's financial aid package, martin and owen say they ' ll use leftover donations to set up a scholarship fund for other gay teens. Owen plans on studying to become a criminal defense lawyer for teens, per wjxt.",

One of perry's felines — granpa rexs allen, who lived to be 34 — broke the guinness world record for oldest cat in 1998. Seven years later, his kitty crème puff topped that record, living to be 38. Plenty more of his cats have made it to at least 30, while, on average, cats live to be 12 to 15 years old. In a profile in atlas obscura, christina couch writes that she first met perry when he fixed her bathtub in 2012.

Officials say that chinese authorities have never imposed such a widespread ban on shellfish before and although the national oceanic and atmospheric administration is expected to enter negotiations with the chinese government, the closure could last months, forcing seafood producers to find new markets or lay off thousands of workers. \" it's had an incredible impact, \" the geoduck harvest coordinator for puget sound's suquamish tribe tells kuow. \" a couple thousand divers out of work right now. \"",

China said it decided to impose the ban after recent shipments of geoduck clams from northwest waters were found by its own government inspectors to have high levels of arsenic and a toxin that causes paralytic shellfish poisoning. The restriction took effect last week and china's government says it will continue indefinitely. It applies to clams, oysters and all other two-shelled bivalves harvested from the waters of washington, oregon, alaska and northern california. U.s.

Right now they're waiting to hear back from chinese officials for more details that will help them identify the exact source.

The obamas have said they plan to remain in d.c. While their younger daughter, sasha, finishes high school at sidwell friends. After leaving the executive mansion in january, the family settled into a rental home owned by bill clinton press secretary joe lockhart and his wife, giovanna gray lockhart, an 8,200-square-foot home that was built in 1921 and renovated in 2011. The obamas still own a georgian-style home in the hyde park neighborhood on the south side of chicago, the city that will house the obama presidential library. Spokesman kevin lewis, in a statement, said the purchase just made sense for the family: \"given that president and mrs.

            "The herded became the herders monday when a woman fleeing police through a pasture was chased down by more than a dozen cows, leading her straight to officers and arrest, according to the sanford police department. A seminole county sheriffï ¿ ½s office helicopter team captured video of the cows bucking trends and defying traditional roles to become the heroes in this tale of justice, not just mere namesakes. The video shows jennifer anne kaufman running through the field being chased by the cows, who worked together to corral the suspect. Authorities said kaufman, 46, was riding in a stolen subaru suv being pursued by officers when the vehicle crashed near the pasture after officers attempted to disable it with stop sticks. Kaufman and another occupant, jamie michael young, fled into the pasture. A third occupant, erin thomas, 38, stayed with the vehicle. Young, 46, was chased down by a k9 unit, but kaufman made it deeper. Then, video shows, police got an animal assist. \" actually, a large group of cows is following her for a good visual. It looks like they may attack her, \" the helicopter team can be heard saying. \" sheï ¿ ½s pretty far into the field now. If you see the large group of cows, theyï ¿ ½re literally following her and chasing her. \" the herd of cattle chased kaufman right to a fence, where authorities were waiting on the other side. Police said the subaru was stolen out of brevard county. A search of the vehicle yielded more than a gram of cocaine, a crack pipe, syringes and a metal spoon. Kaufman was charged with petit theft, possession of cocaine, possession of drug paraphernalia, trespassing, resisting arrest and violation of probation. She is currently being held in seminole county jail. This is a developing story. Stay with tampabay.com for updates. Daniel figueroa iv can be reached at [ email protected ] follow @danuscripts"

        "summary": "A sad milestone out of japan: two weeks after the quake struck, its official death toll has broken the 10,000 mark — and that number is still on the rise, with more than 17,400 missing. Police estimate the toll will surpass 15,000 in the hardest-hit prefecture alone. Among survivors, hundreds of thousands remain in temporary shelters, 660,000 homes lack water, and 209,000 have no electricity. And with the damage expected to cost as much as $ 310 billion, it's set to be the most expensive natural disaster in recorded history, the ap reports. Japan has extended the evacuation zone from a 12-mile radius around the troubled fukushima plant to an 18-mile one, notes the los angeles times. Water is in short supply as bottles fly off the shelves; the government is weighing importing drinking water. Even in tokyo, 150 miles from the plant, there are reports of radiation in the food chain. The government has now restricted sales of 11 leafy vegetables, prompting farmers ' fear for their livelihood, reports the washington post.",

        "summary": "Amazon ceo jeff bezos sent out his annual letter to shareholders this week, and business insider takes note of one part in particular about the company's \" pay to quit \" program. Amazon offers some employees up to $ 5,000 to leave, and bezos explains that the principle is \" pretty simple \": \" once a year, we offer to pay our associates to quit. The first year the offer is made, it's for $ 2,000. Then it goes up one thousand dollars a year until it reaches $ 5,000. The headline on the offer is ' please don't take this offer. ' we hope they don't take the offer; we want them to stay. Why do we make this offer? the goal is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don't want to be isn't healthy for the employee or the company. \" the tennessean fills in some gaps: the offer is good only for employees in the company's \" fulfillment centers \" — the warehouses where all those online orders get packed and shipped. A spokeswoman tells the paper that only a \" small percentage of employees take the offer. \" the huffington post, meanwhile, notes that many of those warehouse workers are part-timers, and it's unclear whether they would qualify for the deal. Still, it's an interesting idea, writes max nisen at quartz, and it shows how bezos isn't afraid to experiment to improve his workforce.",

Reuters reports that carver county judge kevin eide ordered genetic testing for six other claimants: prince's sister, tyka nelson, three half-siblings by his father, and a possible niece and grandniece. Two half-brothers from prince's mother will not be tested under the judge's ruling, which will determine the future of an estate thought to be worth up to $ 500 million. Other rejected claimants include at least five people who claimed prince was their father, and several who claimed that their father had an affair with prince's mother, making their father prince's real father and the late star their half-brother, the ap reports. Under minnesota law, the estate of prince — who left no known will or surviving offspring — will be split between siblings, half-siblings, and the offspring of any deceased siblings. Despite the order for genetic testing, eide's ruling says he \" is not aware of any objection or dispute \" to the six siblings or half-siblings being legitimate heirs.

Though 200 demonstrators camped out overnight, traffic was back to normal today and riot police had left the area. In yesterday's clashes, 35 protesters and 40 police officers were hurt. And things are looking to heat up again soon: the muslim brotherhood has called for a protest at the palace today against the \" oppressive abuses \" of the opposition, and the opposition in response called for leftist demonstrators to head back to the palace, leading to fears of violent clashes. Opposition protesters want morsi to retract his expanded powers and stop a dec. 15 vote on the new constitution hastily drafted by islamists. Though they called yesterday's protest a \" last warning \" to the president, reuters notes that they have little real chance of stopping the vote, which morsi is confident will approve the constitution.",

The editorial ends with a plea for voters, protesters, members of congress, state legislators, the courts, the media, etc., to be vigilant about protecting america from its own president. On monday, part two focuses on trump's capacity to lie. Plenty of politicians lie, of course, but what trump \" brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies, if he believes they serve him, and the truth. \" what makes this especially dangerous is that trump repeats the lies of others, even crackpots. \" he gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief. \" verification seems to be a foreign concept to trump, but it can't be for everyone else, write the editors, who close with advice: \" investigate.

But it wasn't prepared for what it faced this week: a 30-mile ice jam that literally jammed the yukon river and unleashed intense flooding on the town. The waters began to rise sunday and by yesterday many of galena's 500 residents had fled via plane, with a few holdouts camping at the airport, one of the only dry spots left. Homes have been ripped from their foundations, cell and electrical service is down, and the bridge to the airport was knocked out. A weather service hydrologist at the scene tells the anchorage daily news that bathrooms aren't functioning and \" there are houses that are totally submerged in water up to the roof. \" though no injuries or deaths have been reported, locals say just about every house has suffered damage. And with temps hitting the 80s, the jam is starting to break up — putting a community 14 miles downriver from the jam at risk. Says koyukuk's mayor, \" we're looking at a flash flood. Something like a dam breaking. \" the expectation is that when the jam breaks, it will send a wave of water toward koyukuk, reaching it in about four hours.",

        "summary": "A los angeles mom accused of running a multimillion-dollar marijuana grow operation in san bernardino is now suing the city to overturn its pot regulation ordinance, the ap reports. Stephanie smith, a 43-year-old real estate developer and mother of five, owns three buildings in san bernardino that were raided by police in december. Thousands of marijuana plants were confiscated, cbs los angeles reported at the time. Smith was not arrested or charged, but police accused her of being in charge of the pot \" fortress \"; she said she was simply the landlord and that her tenants ' activities were legal. In her lawsuit, she argues san bernardino's ordinance \" is a backdoor ban that continues the city's illogical campaign against a legal product, \" cbs reports. California legalized recreational marijuana last year, but sales did not begin until jan. 1, cbs reported at the time. Smith, who says she is the biggest landlord of marijuana businesses in the state, argues that under the san bernardino ordinance — which was passed by the city council after smith's buildings were raided — \" any person who has ever had anything to do with cannabis is banned for life from entering the legal market, \" per the san bernardino sun. That's because smith says her tenants were in the process of being licensed when they were raided, and got approval to operate a week after authorities shut them down, but the ordinance bars anyone who has violated local or state laws related to the cannabis industry from ever entering the commercial cannabis business in the city. \" san bernardino is... Guaranteeing that anyone in the city who operated prior to this law has to remain in the black market, \" her attorney says. Smith says that could result in monopolies forming in the cannabis industry, and could also prevent her from renting to those in the industry.",
