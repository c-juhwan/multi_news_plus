This according to \" top secret nsa documents \" cited in an exclusive report in der spiegel, which the ap notes is co-bylined by laura poitras. Yes, the nsa can access data that includes your contact lists, sms messages, notes, and gps information; the agency has also reportedly set up teams to deal with the specifics of different operating systems. The documents don't appear to indicate mass spying, but rather targeted individuals. This is particularly bad news for blackberry, notes gizmodo, which has long touted its email as ultra-secure. The nsa documents do note that it was temporarily unable to hack blackberries, but that a change in rim's data compression in march 2010 restored access. The response of the nsa team dedicated to blackberry: \" champagne! \" rim is refusing comment, other than to deny it had installed a \" ' back door ' pipeline to our platform. \" spiegel's full report is due out tomorrow. Meanwhile, iphone users shouldn't be too smug: the report says the nsa had access to at least 38 iphone features.",

Of course, there were fulsome tributes to senator mccain's bravery and courage and public service, stark reminders of the torture he endured as a prisoner of war, and of the policies he fought for ( and against ) in his many decades as a republican politician from arizona. But mccain knew that would not be the headline from the grand service, whose many details he personally oversaw.

        "summary": "You're not imagining things: gas prices could soon fall as low as $ 1 per gallon at some us gas stations, usa today reports. Some midwest states — michigan, wisconsin, illinois, minnesota, north dakota, oklahoma, indiana, ohio, and kansas — are already seeing the lowest prices in 12 years. And one in four us gas stations is currently selling gas for $ 1.50 per gallon or less, according to time. \"incredible as it sounds, we wouldn't be shocked to see a few stations in these states as low as 99 cents a gallon, \" says one expert. As of tuesday afternoon, the nationwide average was $ 1.72 per gallon. That's approximately 7 cents less than last week, 26 cents less than last month, and 46 cents less than last year. It's the lowest average price the us has seen in six years. The low prices — caused by a combination of falling demand and increasing production in the us and middle east — are good news for consumers but bad news for oil companies. Oil prices hit 13-year lows last month, and the stocks of companies like bp and exxon mobil were down tuesday. But not everyone is enjoying the savings. Cnn reports the average price of gas in california is around $ 2.50 per gallon. That's due to both a larger-than-average gas tax and cleaner-than-average gasoline. California's requirement for gasoline that creates fewer emissions keeps prices higher but has made a huge impact on the state's air quality. One expert warns the rest of the country better enjoy low gas prices while it can. Refineries not turning a profit at these prices may close down for maintenance, sending gas supplies down and prices up.",

        "summary": "Florida is next: hurricane irma continued to batter cuba early saturday as it powered its way toward the us. In fact, south florida already has begun to feel the outer bands, reports the miami herald. As of 5am eastern, irma was 245 miles southeast of miami's coast and moving at 12mph with sustained winds of 155mph. That puts irma back in category 4 status after it briefly regained category 5 strength late friday. One small bright spot: the latest forecasts suggests its landfall will be southwest of the heavily populated miami metro area when it eventually arrives, per the ap. Still, given the breadth of the storm, the entire florida peninsula braced for a devastating hit. In one of the country's largest evacuations, about 5.6 million people in florida — more than one-quarter of the state's population — were ordered to leave, and another 540,000 were ordered out on the georgia coast. Authorities opened hundreds of shelters for people who did not leave. Hotels as far away as atlanta filled up with evacuees. Meanwhile, miami international airport said it has no scheduled flights saturday and sunday, reports usa today. So far, the death toll in the caribbean from irma is at 20. Elsewhere in the atlantic, hurricane jose is a category 4 hurricane, about 190 miles east-southeast of the northern leeward islands. In the gulf of mexico, hurricane katia made landfall late friday north of tecolutla, mexico, and weakened to a tropical storm. By early saturday morning, it was 135 miles south of tampico, mexico, moving sluggishly at only 2 mph.",

Innovations are occurring mostly on the industry's margins, where quirky products are cropping up and nudging powerhouses like samsung and apple into using all that forgotten real estate. A few examples: jolla's other half, an nfc-powered backplate, lets users customize a smartphone's theme and access certain content, like news feeds and product catalogs. The russian yotaphone has a rear e-ink screen that can display weather, sports scores, health data, and other data. It can even keep info there ( like a map or mobile ticket ) when the phone's battery dies. Google's project ara prototype smartphone has \" modules \" on its backside to provide various functions, like a geiger counter or heart rate monitor — but won't come out until next year at the earliest. Google has patented touch controls for the back of a smartphone, so users can scroll through a book or photos without smudging the screen, patent bolt reports. Samsung has added a heart-rate monitor to the back of its s5, and htc has put a second lens on one m8's backside. And the new, curved lg g flex has a \" self-healing \" back cover designed to remove nicks and scratches — but it doesn't always work, reports global news.",

        "summary": "Higher cancer rates have been linked generally to taller people, but university of minnesota researchers are reporting a startling find: men with longer legs have a 42 % higher risk of developing colorectal cancer than those with shorter legs, reports live science. More specifically, they found that the men with the longest legs ( at an average length of 35.4 inches ) had a 91 % greater risk of colon cancer than men with the shortest legs ( at an average length of 31.1 inches ). But in women, any differences in risk between the tallest and shortest legs were so small as to be statistically insignificant. They also note that it is leg length in particular, not total body length, where the differences in men arise. The researchers offer up two theories as to why leg length matters. One is that taller people have longer colons and thus more real estate on which cancer can grow. The other, which these findings seem to support, is that the growth hormones that increase leg length may contribute to colon cancer risk. The research hasn't yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, notes live science, but it's not all grim news: researchers in south korea have observed that a diet rich in nuts appears to reduce colon cancer risks for both men and women, reports live science. And webmd has a small but compelling study that a recently fda-approved stool-based dna test may help screen for colon cancer.

Here's what critics are saying: like aronofsky's other films ( black swan, requiem for a dream ), mother! is \" assaultive \" and clearly \" not for everyone. \" but \" viewers willing to accept the challenge will be rewarded with passages embodying extraordinary moods and images \" in \" another of aronofsky's ominous extravaganzas, \" writes walter addiego at the san francisco chronicle.

The actress \" proves once again what a supernatural screen presence she is, delivering a performance of transparency, stillness, physical grit and self-sacrificing courage, \" writes ann hornaday at the washington post. Mother! on the other hand is an \" intriguing but ultimately frustratingly undisciplined experiment … whose sense of claustrophobia becomes woozily stifling, \" writes hornaday. An \" outlandish climax \" is off-putting, to boot. But lindsey bahr calls the movie \" one of aronofsky's best. \" it's \" an audacious, bold and fascinating fever dream of a film \" and an \" allegory for, well, everything, \" she writes at the ap.

His gastrointestinal troubles didn't help the cause, either. \" soylent's creators have forgotten a basic ingredient found in successful tech products, not to mention in most good foods, \" writes manjoo. \" that ingredient is delight. \" for an opposing view, see lee hutchinson at ars technica, who has boxes of the stuff at home. He gets the point made by manjoo and others, but \" not every meal needs to be a festive life-affirming display of cultural pageantry where we march from kitchen to table bearing the carefully plated masterpieces of locally sourced delicacies while hidden speakers blare the ' circle of life'song from the lion king. \" sometimes you're busy, and that's where soylent works.

Two missiles hit a house near the main market in miranshah, the provincial capital of the tribal region of north waziristan. The region is considered a taliban stronghold. Many were wounded in the attack, local tribesman kaleemullah dawar said, but rescuers delayed for fear of falling victim to a second attack, a common tactic with drone strikes. \" it was not possible for the people to start rescue work for some time, as the drones were still flying over the area, \" dawar said. Sharif, who won elections in may, has called for an immediate end to u.s. Drone strikes on the grounds that they are a breach of pakistan's sovereignty. The u.s. Says it is attacking militants in areas the pakistani army cannot reach. A drone strike in may killed the pakistani taliban's second-in-command and six others.

            "Peshawar, pakistan a u.s. Drone strike killed at least 17 people in pakistan's restive border region early on wednesday, pakistani security officials said, in the biggest such attack this year, and the second since prime minister nawaz sharif took office. Most of those killed were fighters for the haqqani network, according to three taliban commanders and security officials. Two missiles hit a house near the main market in miranshah, the provincial capital of the tribal region of north waziristan. The region is considered a taliban stronghold. Many were wounded in the attack, local tribesman kaleemullah dawar said, but rescuers delayed for fear of falling victim to a second attack, a common tactic with drone strikes. \" it was not possible for the people to start rescue work for some time, as the drones were still flying over the area, \" dawar said. Sharif, who won elections in may, has called for an immediate end to u.s. Drone strikes on the grounds that they are a breach of pakistan's sovereignty. The u.s. Says it is attacking militants in areas the pakistani army cannot reach. A drone strike in may killed the pakistani taliban's second-in-command and six others.

After missing items were found to have been sold by caliban, a warehouse search uncovered 42 stolen items worth $ 260,000, according to police. A copy of a book by isaac newton, valued at more than $ 800,000, has also been recovered. \" greed came over me, \" priore allegedly told investigators of what the washington post calls one of the largest library thefts in history, involving a still-missing book by george washington and another signed by thomas jefferson.

More than 20 of the apparently confused creatures were reported on the sand on friday night, and the telegraph notes the migration continued the following two nights.

Wright says there were a few other octopus sightings last week in areas hit by storms. Hurricane ophelia, then brian, battered the irish and welsh coasts earlier this month. The cephalopods, which the guardian notes grow to about 20 inches, may be injured or sensitive \" to a change in atmospheric pressure, \" wright tells the telegraph. A marine biologist says \" it's hard to imagine \" the wandering octopuses found a new food source on shore. He speculates the solitary species may be looking to reproduce. Dry land isn't hospitable to the creatures, who hide in rocks some 10 feet below the surface. Since a number of the octopuses were dead, jones hints they became stranded.

Meanwhile, the coroner is investigating the possibility of a drug or alcohol influence, a process that could take weeks. Hastings wrote about having a drinking and drug problem, including noting a drunk-driving crash at age 19, though he wrote last year that he'd been alcohol-free for 10 years. Meanwhile, the inevitable conspiracy theories are coming out: hastings wrote in a 2012 book that an aide to gen.

She resisted blaming eric harris for years. \" given what i have learned about psychopathy, i now feel differently. \" from the book's introduction by andrew solomon: \" eric was a failed hitler; dylan was a failed holden caulfield. \" visiting the school library after the shooting, klebold recognized her son's shape marked on the floor.

But i just couldn't sustain that anger. \" on the morning of the massacre, klebold says her son's shouted goodbye to her had a \" flat, nasty \" sound. \" was he saying to me, you were a bad mother? \" regarding dylan's depression: \" if we had known enough to understand what those signs meant, i believe that we would have been able to prevent columbine. \"",

And usa today reports the bacteria has been resistant to treatment so far. According to npr, tilikum has been at seaworld for 23 years and is one of its \" most prolific breeders. \" tilikum has been involved in three human deaths, the most lurid of which was in 1999 when a naked man was found \" draped dead across his back \" after getting into the park after hours. But it was the 2010 drowning death of a trainer that inspired blackfish. In the documentary, experts argue that killer whales are highly intelligent creatures who can become depressed and dangerous if kept in confinement. Since blackfish was released in 2013, seaworld has lost attendance, revenue, and sponsors. A seaworld spokesperson wouldn't say whether or not the ailing tilikum is still performing at the park. But a trainer in the company's video says \" if he's ready to go out and do a show … i ' m excited to do that with him. \"",

Andreas vlachopoulos has been directing fieldwork on the aegean island of astypalaia, and the professor may have given the students working with him a little more insight than he'd at first intended when he happened upon extremely explicit erotica chiseled into the limestone rocks that line the cape. In one instance, dating back to 5th century bc, two gigantic penises are etched next to the name dion; in another, dating to 6th century bc, one man boasted: \" nikasitimos was here mounting timiona. \" \" we know that in ancient greece sexual desire between men was not a taboo, \" vlachopoulos tells the guardian. \" but this graffiti … is not just among the earliest ever discovered.

The world calls it the athenian acropolis! the acropolis of athens is a designated unesco world heritage site ( unesco, 1987 ), \"[ … ] symbolizing the idea of world heritage \" ( unesco, 2006 ) the history of the acropolis of athens is long, with moments when democracy philosophy and art flourished, leading to its creation. Then there were the times when its best standing pieces were removed and shipped away from the city, dividing the monument in two. Today, the international community wants to reunite all of the acropolis sculptures in athens and restore both its physicality and meaning. The acropolis, and the parthenon in particular, is the most characteristic monument of the ancient greek civilisation. It continues to stand as a symbol in many ways: it is the symbol of democracy and the greek civilisation. It also symbolises the beginning of the western civilisation and stands as the icon of european culture. The parthenon was dedicated to athena parthenos, the patron goddess of the city of athens and goddess of wisdom.

The parthenon was constructed between 447 and 438 bc and its sculptural decoration was completed in 432 bc. In 1987 it was inscribed as a world heritage site ( unesco, 1987 ).

        "summary": "The average american born in 2015 is expected to live to 78.8 years of age. Hiv patients aren't far behind. A lancet study finds a 20-year-old who begins treatment for hiv today can live to an estimated 78 years due in part to advances in antiretroviral therapy, reports the bbc. The latest drugs are better at keeping the virus from replicating and prevent resistance, are less toxic, have fewer side effects, and are more likely to be taken effectively as they often involve only one daily pill, the study notes. Young hiv patients are also starting treatment sooner and benefit from improved screening and prevention programs, say university of bristol researchers, who reviewed 18 studies involving 88,500 patients in europe and north america. They found patients who began treatment between 2008 and 2010 were less likely to die over the next three years than those who began treatment between 1996 and 2007, per a release. Twenty-year-olds who started treatment between 2008 and 2010 and survived their first year were also expected to live to 73 for men and 76 for women, compared to 63 for men and 67 for women who started treatment years earlier. If those same 20-year-olds had a higher than average immune cell count, they were predicted to live to 78, though those who acquired hiv from injecting drugs had a lower life expectancy, per the telegraph. One doctor calls it \" a tremendous medical achievement. \" another warns new challenges await as one in three hiv patients is over age 50. ( an antibody could stop up to 90 % of hiv strains. )",

The magazine's long profile paints a depressing picture: chris heath spoke to cyrus mostly in shadow ( he likes to have the lights out ), just five days after he first saw the infamous bong-hit video. Highlights... Or, as it were, lowlights: on hannah montana: \" it destroyed my family. I ' ll tell you right now — the damn show destroyed my family.... I'd erase it all in a second if i could. \" on miley: \" every time something happened in miley's career, every time the train went off the track, if you will — vanity fair, pole-dancing, whatever scandal it was — her people, or as they say in today's news, her handlers, every time they'd put me...'somebody's shooting at miley! put the old man up there! ' well, i took it, because i ' m her daddy, and that's what daddies do. ' ok, nail me to the cross, i ' ll take it... ' \" why he didn't go to her 18th birthday party: \" because they were having it in a bar. It was wrong. It was for 21 years old and up. Once again all them people, they all wanted me to fly out so that then when all the bad press came they could say,'daddy endorsed this stuff... ' i started realizing i ' m being used. \" on his parental failings: cyrus says he's never been able to discipline his children and that he tried too hard to be a friend. \" i should have been a better parent. I should have said, ' enough is enough — it's getting dangerous and somebody's going to get hurt. ' \" on miley's future: he brings up kurt cobain, anna nicole smith, and michael jackson as others for whom the \" world was just spinning so fast. \" does he really think miley is in a situation like theirs? \" i don't know. I ' m her daddy so maybe i ' m a little sensitive to it, but now's a real good time to make sure everything's ok, \" he says. But he is \" scared for her. She's got a lot of people around her that's putting her in a great deal of danger",

        "summary": "A size-adjustable superhero finds trouble and a partner in marvel's ant-man and the wasp, so far much better received than its predecessor. The film from director peyton reed features paul rudd and evangeline lilly ( kate, from lost ) in the titles roles — a first for a female marvel character. As of friday, the movie had an 87 % rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. Samples: it's \" an engaging goof that resists bludgeoning you with bigness and instead settles for good vibes and jokes, \" writes manohla dargis at the new york times, giving much credit to reed. He \" persuasively embraces the story's alice in wonderland weirdness \" and \" handles the new, fairly unencumbered material with a generally light touch, so that for once a marvel movie feels shorter than its running time, \" she writes. Calvin wilson calls the film \" one of the most entertaining releases from marvel studios \" and \" a vast improvement \" over 2015's ant-man. \" reed deftly balances action and comedy with special effects that are impressive but not overwhelming, \" while rudd's \" everyman appeal seldom has been put to such brilliant use, \" wilson writes at the st. Louis post-dispatch. He also commends \" scene-stealer \" michael pena. Lilly as hope, aka the wasp, impresses, too. In this sequel, she \" actually gets to do something this time besides root from the sidelines … and she's excellent, \" g. Allen johnson writes at the san francisco chronicle. But it's the \" loose and breezy \" feel and \" spirit of childlike fun \" that dominate the film, appropriately. After all, \" how seriously can you take a movie where weapons include a huge salt shaker and giant pez dispenser? \" \" if you're not going to reach the mythic heights of black panther, the light-hearted antics of ant-man and the wasp are your next-best bet, \" as jake coyle puts it at the ap. Having \" adopted the goofball charm of its leading man, \" the film is \" pretty much exactly what i'd want in a superhero movie: a funny cast, zippy action scenes and not an infinity stone in sight. \"",

        "summary": "A friend of john kelly, president trump's new chief of staff, says the retired general will bring order and stability to the white house. \"he knows how to do this: with common sense and good leadership, \" the unnamed friend tells the washington post. \"he won't suffer idiots and fools. \" kelly, who spent 45 years in the marines and was currently serving as the head of the department of homeland security, was tapped by trump to replace reince priebus on friday. Kelly's friend also offered a hint of how the new chief of staff will handle the leaks that are so vexing trump's aides: \"simply go dark and do not engage. \" here's what else you need to know about kelly and his new role in the white house: the new york times reports the success of kelly — the first general to be chief of staff since the nixon administration — will hinge on bringing trump's staff to heel. The president must give kelly \" the authority to crack down on the behavior of his other aides. \" kelly got the job as chief of staff because he and trump are simpatico when it comes to terrorism and immigration, according to nbc news. Kelly has said \" smugglers \" are bringing \" tens of thousands of people to our nation's doorstep. \" he's also called leaks \" darn close to treason \" and defended jared kushner on the russia front. Cnn's john kirby says if trump is \" wise enough to use \" kelly, he could \" actually come out on the far side of these first six tumultuous months looking pretty good. \" the national security analyst calls kelly \" a marvel of organization and efficiency, of candid counsel and dogged persistence. \" while kelly has had bipartisan support in the past, not everyone is excited about his promotion, the hill reports. Democratic rep. Barbara lee calls kelly an \" extremist \" and accuses trump of \" militarizing the white house. \" and the nation calls kelly's promotion a \" disaster for immigrants. \" it looks at six policies kelly has put in place during his time at the department of homeland security that have caused fear to take hold of immigrant communities. Finally, while trump enjoys having \" my generals \" around — preferring them to wear their uniforms even if they're retired and bragging that they look like they came from \" central casting \" — he doesn't have a history of actually listening to them, slate reports. That's something kelly needs to recognize as he starts his new white house gig.",

Cordray's resignation isn't unexpected: the ohio native had been widely expected to make a run for governor of his home state in 2018, and he couldn't hold his position as director of the cfpb and run at the same time. His memo to employees didn't provide a reason for the resignation. The cfpb was created as part of the laws passed following the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession. The agency was given a broad mandate to be a watchdog for consumers when they deal with banks; credit card, student loan, and mortgage companies; and debt collectors and payday lenders. Republicans, however, accuse the cfpb of overreach. \" we are long overdue for new leadership at the cfpb, a rogue agency that has done more to hurt consumers than help them, \" said rep. Jeb hensarling upon hearing the news, per the washington post. As chair of the house financial services committee, hensarling has sought to curb the cfpb's power. Cordray's agency suffered a big setback last month when the senate scrapped a cfpb rule making it easier for consumers to sue banks.",

        "summary": "If you've struggled to meet the world health organization's five-a-day fruits and veggies recommendation, you may want to reassess your consumption strategy. An imperial college london study published in the international journal of epidemiology has found that doubling the current suggestion to 10 servings a day could stave off 7.8 million early deaths annually if people followed the new formula, the bbc reports. The study also pinpointed specific fruits and veggies that may help prevent heart disease and stroke ( including apples, citrus fruits, and the cruciferous family of broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage ) and cancer ( spinach, peppers, and carrots, among others ). The health boost from these victuals may come from the \" complex network of nutrients they hold, \" says study author dagfinn aune. The mega-study examined 95 separate studies that covered up to 2 million people and examined tens of thousands of different types of disease cases and 94,000 deaths. Researchers found upping fruit and veggie intake to about 28 ounces a day ( a 10-serving equivalent ) was tied to a 24 % reduced risk of heart disease, a 13 % decreased risk of all cancers, and a 31 % slashing of premature deaths. Sarah toule, head of health info at the world cancer research fund, says not to go bananas if you can't hit that magic 10 each day — simply start with the baseline of five servings and try to sneak in a few extra whenever you can, maybe by \" swapping one of your naughty snacks for a piece of fruit, \" she tells the guardian. ( at the very worst, you could end up much happier. )",

Reduced fruit and vegetable consumption is linked to poor health and increased risk of noncommunicable diseases ( ncds ). An estimated 5.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption in 2013. Including fruits and vegetables as part of the daily diet may reduce the risk of some ncds including cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. More limited evidence suggests that when consumed as part of a healthy diet low in fat, sugars and salt/sodium, fruits and vegetables may also help to prevent weight gain and reduce the risk of obesity, an independent risk-factor for ncds. Moreover, fruits and vegetables are rich sources of vitamins and minerals, dietary fibre and a host of beneficial non-nutrient substances including plant sterols, flavonoids and other antioxidants and consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables helps to ensure an adequate intake of many of these essential",

        "summary": "Microsoft sued the justice department thursday in a case that will test broad principles of privacy in the digital age. But the root of the complaint is far more specific: microsoft says the feds have demanded access to customer data 5,624 times in the past 18 months — and 2,576 of those demands came with gag orders that prevented the company from letting people know the us was snooping, reports techcrunch. The government says it can do so under the electronic communications privacy act, but microsoft argues that the law, written more than 30 years ago, is outdated and, worse, unconstitutional. The government \"has exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations, \" says microsoft. What's more, 1,752 of the demands were open-ended, meaning the government can keep spying on someone for as long as it wants. Some coverage: the suit \" raises a fundamental question of how easily, and secretly, the government should be able to gain access to individuals ' information in the cloud-computing era, \" observes the wall street journal. The key point of the case is that it \" focuses on the storage of data on remote servers, rather than locally on people's computers, which microsoft says has provided a new opening for the government to access electronic data, \" reports reuters. Engadget notes the business angle: \" sure, microsoft's lawsuit aims to protect civil liberties, but the company says it also wants to ensure it can continue to sell products that its customers can trust. \" the new york times points out the broad scope: the suit, \" unlike apple's fight with the federal bureau of investigation over access to a locked iphone, is not attached to a single case.

Its take: that the documents show a \" pair of mothers — one dictatorial and eccentric, the other constantly working and seldom home — who doled out cruel punishments. \" some of the details are expansions of already reported allegations; others are new. One of the minnesota reports states that the school the children attended stopped calling jennifer hart ( the more assertive parent ) and sarah hart ( a manager at kohl's ) regarding any issues with their kids because they feared the calls would trigger harsh punishment for the children. The oregon reports include a friend's recollection of an overnight visit the family made to her home during which jennifer restricted the kids ' pizza consumption to one tiny piece. When the leftovers were discovered in the morning to have been eaten, and none of the kids owned up to it, the friend said jennifer punished the kids by denying them breakfast and making them lie on a bed with their arms by their sides and sleep masks on for as long as five hours, the oregonian reports. As for the bruising spanking that led to a misdemeanor domestic assault charge for sarah in minnesota, cnn reports sarah allegedly took the fall for jennifer, who reportedly punished elementary-school-aged abigail for saying she'd found a penny she had; her mothers accused her of stealing it.",

Now, that family must stop an evil hacker who's enlisted one of their own in a plot for world domination. Oh, how things change.

The scenes featuring dwayne johnson and jason statham, however, \" are some of fate's best. \" stephanie merry agrees \" putting statham and johnson together is a particularly ingenious move \" and \" their constant bickering is among the movie's main pleasures. \" but the \" clunky dialogue and absurd plot twists \" suggest the franchise \" peaked three movies ago, \" she writes at the washington post. At least the action \" doesn't disappoint, \" which is all fans are likely to care about. If you're willing to throw logic out the window, you're in for \" a wildly entertaining thrill ride that never lets its foot off the gas, \" despite a running time of over two hours, writes adam graham at detroit news.

Predictably unimpressed is peta, which was never a fan of zoos to begin with and is calling for a federal investigation, reports the alexandria town talk. Says deputy general counsel delcianna winders, \" these tamarins lived a sad life of deprivation in captivity, and their deaths were totally preventable. This fatal neglect is all too common in zoos and other places where animals are displayed for human amusement, and that's why peta's motto reads, in part, that ' animals are not ours to use for entertainment. ' \" in a letter bemoaning the zoo's \" gross oversight, \" it's asking the usda to look into violations of the animal welfare act and \" hold the zoo fully accountable. ( things turned out much better for a rhino who survived a poaching attempt and gave birth tuesday. )",

It took a jury less than an hour to find that kent easter and his now ex-wife jill easter — both former lawyers — acted with malice, oppression, or fraud in february 2011 when they stashed pot, vicodin, and percocet in kelli peters ' car, the orange county register reports. \" this was really not about money, this was about standing up to people that pick on other people and telling them it's not ok to do this, \" an emotional peters tells the register. \" i feel like justice has been served. \" the attempt to frame peters was the culmination of a yearlong campaign to get her dismissed as a volunteer at plaza vista school in irvine. It all started in february 2010 when jill easter was upset that her son wasn't waiting in front of the school at pick-up time. Peters testified that she said the 7-year-old may have been \" slow to line up. \" perceiving an insult to her son's intelligence, jill easter ( now calling herself ava everheart ) became enraged. Here's a rundown, according to oc weekly, of the easters ' actions: they claimed peters had locked their son in the school. Jill easter distributed fliers at school outlining peters ' fictitious misdeeds. They filed a police report against her. They claimed peters was stalking their son. They filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against her. Kent easter was ultimately sentenced to 87 days in jail in the drug-planting incident, while jill easter got 60 days. During the recent civil trial, kent easter claimed that peters was exaggerating her level of distress ( she was detained at the school for some two hours while parents, students, and her daughter watched ). \" the fact that something really bad was done to a person does not give them a winning powerball number, \" he told the jury.",

Nbc news reports the country's tourism ministry has thus far confirmed that 10 are dead, but the toll could very well rise. Indeed, usa today reports an unknown number of people are missing, and the ap says some climbers may be cut off on routes leading to the summit. As for the scene at base camp, usa today points to this from danish climber carsten lillelund pedersen: \" our sherpas believe that a lot of people may have been buried in their tents. \" the ap spoke with ang tshering of the nepal mountaineering association; he says at least 30 tents were flattened at base camp. Reuters quotes ministry officials as saying at least 1,000 people, about 40 % of them foreigners, were on the mountain when the quake hit. The confirmed deaths establish today as at least the second deadliest day on the mountain. Exactly 51 weeks ago, 16 sherpas died on everest, doubling the toll experienced in the previous worst day, the 1996 incident captured in jon krakauer's into thin air. The ap reports today's avalanche began on mount kumori, a 22,966-foot-high mountain just a few miles from everest, and grew stronger as it barreled toward the base camp.",

        "summary": "Since 2007, the dea has seized a total of $ 3.2 billion in cash from people suspected of being involved in the drug trade but never charged with a crime, the washington post reports. That statistic comes from a department of justice watchdog's report released wednesday. According to the ap, the inspector general reviewed 100 cases of civil asset forfeiture at random and found only 44 were verifiably connected to an ongoing investigation, responsible for starting a new investigation, or led to arrests or prosecutions. That means that 56 % of the time \" there was no discernible connection between the seizure and the advancement of law enforcement efforts, \" business insider quotes from the report. Civil asset forfeiture allows law enforcement to seize cash, homes, cars, and more without criminal or civil charges or judicial review. Departments can then keep the forfeitures to pad their budgets unless people win a challenge in court. The report found that 81 % of the dea's seizures since 2007 fall under this category. The report says this \" creates the appearance, and risks the reality, that [ law enforcement ] is more interested in seizing and forfeiting cash than advancing an investigation or prosecution. \" for example, a police department in florida arrested 84 people, seizing $ 49 million in cash, without ever filing a charge.

But the real treat is the science itself — which, in addition to being funny or preposterous, can also be extremely useful; it's not unheard of for someone who wins an ig nobel to go on to win an actual nobel prize, reports nbc news. ( there is, for instance, the university of manchester's andre geim, who both claimed an ig nobel for studying levitating frogs and later a nobel for physics due to his research on graphene. ) here's a quick list of some of the highlights from the 2014 ig nobel winners: the physics prize goes to a team that measured the amount of friction between a shoe and a banana skin and then a banana skin and the floor, when a person steps on a banana skin that's on the floor. The neuroscience prize goes to a team that attempted to dissect the inner workings of the brains of people who see jesus in their toast. The biology prize goes to a team that discovered when dogs poop and pee, they tend to align their body axis with earth's north-south geomagnetic field lines. The medicine prize goes to a team that was able to treat \" uncontrollable \" nosebleeds using strips of cured pork. The arctic science prize goes to a team that observed how reindeer behave upon seeing humans disguised as polar bears.

In all, his office is committing $ 5 million to pay for the drugs at police departments across the state, reports the new york times. One big reason for the decision is the success of naloxone in pilot programs. Authorities say they've saved 184 lives in suffolk county since 2012 with the drug, and on friday alone, two men on staten island were revived.

More than 19,000 officers will be trained on how to use the kits. The drug will be distributed in high-risk areas first. It comes in nasal spray form, which officials say make it safer and easier to use than the injectable form. \" the big breakthrough was when they developed the nasal spray so it's now safe to administer, you don't have to worry about get it.

The president is expected to release an executive action on gun control sometime before his jan. 12 state of the union address. According to politico, the main component of the executive action would make the definition of who is a gun seller more specific than someone who sells guns with the \" principal objective of livelihood and profit. \" that means people who only sell a few guns per year or sell their own gun collections could be required to be licensed and conduct background checks, cnn reports. According to politico, this change would shrink — but not close — the \" gun show loophole. \" a second part of the executive action would require guns that are lost somewhere between the seller and buyer to be reported, politico reports. Thieves will target packages addressed to gun sellers in order to get their hands on unregistered firearms. Currently, all reporting of those crimes is voluntary. According to cnn, the executive action could also increase funding to enforce gun laws. While the exact contents of the executive action are still under wraps or being decided, politico reports it's almost certainly less than what obama pushed for following the sandy hook shooting in 2012. Both increased licensing and mandatory reporting of stolen guns are opposed by gun-rights activists. Obama has taken 25 executive actions on gun control since 2013.",
