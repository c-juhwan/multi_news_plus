        "summary": "Somebody at chicago's loyola university wasn't laughing when hannibal buress started cracking jokes about catholic church sex scandals during a performance saturday night. The funnyman, who'd been booked to appear at the jesuit college's two-night \" colossus \" show, had his microphone cut soon after his set began, when he displayed an email he'd received about content restrictions — including a ban on discussing race or sexual assault — and joked about priests molesting children. Audience members were angered when his sound was cut and the background music was turned up when he tried to continue. \" i literally thought like i was about to witness a riot and i was ready to participate, \" one student tells the loyola phoenix. Buress, who's credited with bringing the bill cosby allegations to wider attention, \" is known for his uncompromising style of comedy and for calling out sexual assault, \" the root notes. He left the stage and returned to a standing ovation around 15 minutes later. The rest of his set featured many jokes about having his mic cut, but apparently no violations of his contract. Loyola \" cut the mic on hannibal buress ' performance... Because he violated the mutually agreed upon content restriction clause in his contract, \" the university said in a statement to the chicago tribune monday. \" it is standard for the university to include a content restriction clause in entertainment contracts; buress is the only entertainer to disregard the clause to the degree that his mic was cut. \"",

        "summary": "Any clue about the disappearance of amelia earhart should thrill ric gillespie, who's spent nearly three decades trying to solve the 80-year-old case. But a lost photograph included in a history documentary, which purportedly shows that earhart and navigator fred noonan survived a 1937 plane crash in the marshall islands, is actually rather dull, gillespie says. The head of the international group for historic aircraft recovery ( tighar ) tells tmz he's known about the photo for a year but doesn't believe it shows earhart or noonan. Of course, a photo proving the pair reached the marshall islands would put a damper on tighar's search for earhart's bones on nikumaroro. But gillespie says the overall evidence disputes the documentary's theory. For one thing, earhart's plane didn't have enough fuel to reach the marshall islands after taking off from new guinea, gillespie says. He adds that the photo simply shows two indistinguishable white people in an area known to host missionaries at the time. It's \" absolute myth, \" he tells usa today. Dorothy cochrane of the smithsonian national air and space museum isn't 100 % against the idea that earhart and noonan crashed in the marshall islands, were taken captive by the japanese military, and later died in saipan — a theory that's percolated since the 1960s, per the guardian. But she says she \" can't really comment definitively \" on a \" blurry photograph, \" per smithsonian, and suggests investigators instead stick to the facts known so far.

The 37-year-old candidate, who has spent more than a quarter of his life on the u.s.

Mainland and flies an american flag outside his home near san juan, sees statehood as the key to reviving an island that is such an economic basket case that congress imposed a fiscal oversight board this year in exchange for helping the territory's government dig out from $ 70 billion in public debt. Puerto ricans remain divided over whether to try to change their relationship to the u.s., and congress appears lukewarm to the idea of adding two new senators and a handful of representatives from the island of 3.5 million people. But rossello is ready to fight for it. \" we feel statehood or the lack thereof is one of the critical root problems in puerto rico, \" he said. He told the associated press that as governor he would draft a state constitution, hold elections to choose two senators and five representatives to congress and send them to washington to demand statehood, a strategy used by tennessee to join the union in the 18th century. \" we reserve the right to use all means necessary so we can finally finish the 500-year debacle that has been colonialism, \" he said.

In a security alert, the us embassy in baghdad notes more than a million people could be drowned or left homeless if iraq's largest hydro-electric dam on the tigris river breaks apart near mosul. The dam — built on a soft mineral easily eroded by water — has been impaired by structural flaws since it was built in 1984 and requires workers grouting around the clock to keep it strong, report the new york times and guardian. But when the islamic state captured the dam for a two-week period in 2014, all work stopped. Few engineers returned when government forces recaptured it and regular maintenance couldn't continue. \" it is going from bad to worse, and it is urgent, \" says a former engineer. \" all we can do is hold our hearts. \" an italian company has been awarded a contract to make repairs, but they're expected to take 18 months and engineers say melting snow has pushed the reservoir to maximum capacity. Officials warn a breach could put mosul under 70 feet of water within hours, reports reuters. Cities including tikrit, samarra, and baghdad could be flooded with 13 feet in a day. \" we have no specific information that indicates when a breach might occur, but out of an abundance of caution, we would like to underscore that prompt evacuation offers the most effective tool to save lives of the hundreds of thousands of people, \" the us alert reads, advising americans to keep three miles from the river.

Among those who have used the beat are big names like david bowie, oasis, nwa, nine inch nails, and salt-n-pepa, not to mention those behind the futurama theme song, rolling stone reports. But the winstons never received any royalties for the usage. The sampling of what's known as the \" amen break \" began in the 1980s, and at the time, the legal rules surrounding it weren't clear. The drummer who played the beat, one gc coleman, died homeless in 2006 in atlanta, and frontman richard spencer doesn't think coleman was aware of the song's influence. But there's something of a happy ending to all this: british musicians have started an online fund to repay spencer for the band's work, and they've collected more than $ 32,000 on gofundme. \" if you have ever written or sold any music with the amen break, or even just enjoyed one of the countless hundreds and hundreds of tunes that contain … please donate towards the good cause, \" the campaign requests.

Those sources tell reuters that the groups appear to have ignored malik because she was completely unknown to them and they feared her approaches were part of a sting operation. The syrian al-qaeda affiliate nusra front was probably among the groups she tried to contact, though investigators have yet to find a strong link to isis, the sources say. Investigators searched a lake in san bernardino thursday for electronic evidence, including a missing hard drive, according to the los angeles times'sources. Investigators have already found evidence that the couple may have been planning a large-scale second attack, possibly on a school, sources tell the times, though images of schools found on farook's phone may be connected to his work as a health inspector. Lawmakers briefed in closed-door sessions on capitol hill yesterday tell the ap that they asked officials, including fbi director james comey, whether any intelligence that could have predicted the rampage was missed. Reuters reports that comey told lawmakers that farook and malik discussed extremism online as far back as 2013, a year before they met in person and she came to the us, but the conversations were apparently not intercepted. ( authorities say the neighbor who bought the guns used in the massacre plotted an attack with farook in 2012. )",

        "summary": "California's french laundry may have three michelin stars, but it also has a discrimination lawsuit on its hands. The restaurant is accused of firing a server because she was pregnant, reports the napa valley register. The suit also names chef thomas keller; the thomas keller restaurant group; and keller's new york restaurant, per se. Server vanessa scott-allen says she worked at per se for five years before she moved across the country to accept a gig at the french laundry. But the job disappeared before she actually started, and scott-allen says that happened after a manager began asking her questions about how long she planned to be out on maternity leave. Scott-allen is now seeking $ 5 million in damages for a slew of allegations, including fraud and deceit, and violation of the pregnancy disability leave law, according to her lawsuit filed last month in napa county superior court. A rep for the keller restaurant group says it doesn't comment on pending lawsuits. The suit comes at a rough time for keller, notes eater, given that a new york times food critic delivered a scathing review of per se earlier this year. Bloomberg, meanwhile, notes that he's branching into fancy hot dogs in london. ( thieves once stole $ 300,000 in wine from the french laundry. )",

        "summary": "Justifying concerned mothers everywhere, a group of researchers believes neanderthals could have survived the ice age if they'd just worn a dang jacket. According to a study published wednesday in the journal of anthropological archaeology, dozens of ancient campsites — both human and neanderthal — contain little evidence that neanderthals ever figured out how to make cold-weather clothing. Humans on the other hand — well, we're still here. Remains of rabbits, foxes, minks, and wolverines were found at human campsites, phys.org reports. Of those, wolverine is the most important. It's still used to make warm clothing by people living in the arctic. However, no wolverine remains were found in neanderthal camps, notes the telegraph. Other evidence for humans unlocking the power of prehistoric north face includes bone needles and ancient figurines that appear to be wearing furs. Meanwhile, researchers conclude neanderthals never made it further than wearing capes, whether because they weren't smart enough or their culture stopped them from doing so. Without good cold-weather clothing, neanderthals couldn't hunt further north, lie in wait for their prey, or spend long amounts of time away from shelter. A professor at the natural history museum in london calls the study \" a really interesting bit of work. \" ( those jacket-wearing humans may have also given neanderthals herpes. )",

As the pool reporter representing five networks during trump's meeting with european commission president jean-claude juncker wednesday, kaitlan collins asked trump about the michael cohen tape and vladimir putin. The white house later announced that juncker would be at a press event in the rose garden. Collins says she was told she was \" dis-invited \" to the event by deputy chief of staff for communications bill shine. White house press secretary sarah sanders confirmed that collins had been banned from the rose garden event for \" shouting questions \" at the earlier meeting and refusing to leave. Other journalists who were present, however, say collins, who can be heard on video here, was respectful and spoke at the same volume as any other reporter. The white house correspondents association denounced the banning of collins as \" wholly inappropriate, wrong-headed, and weak, \" the guardian reports. Fox news also condemned the move, with president jay wallace saying the network stands with cnn \" for the right to full access for our journalists as part of a free and unfettered press. \"",

In his new autobiography, that's the way it was, excerpted in the daily mail, the french actor ventures into what's probably tmi territory, revealing he was a male prostitute and grave robber in his youth and why he and russian president vladimir putin have become such good friends, the hollywood reporter notes. Among the nuggets revealed in the book: when he was a teen and young adult, he worked as a male escort in both his hometown and in paris. \" i've known since i was very young that i please homosexuals, \" he says. He went to prison for a bit for auto theft and also dug up dead bodies with another man to loot them for clothes and jewelry. Another confession: he sometimes mugged his prostitution customers, proclaiming, \" at 20, the thug in me was alive and kicking. \" his mother didn't want a third child and so tried to get rid of gerard in the womb: \" i survived all the violence that my poor mother inflicted on herself with knitting needles and things, \" he says in the book, according to the independent, though later in life ( ostensibly after he became successful ) she allegedly \" fondly \" told him, \" and to think i almost killed you. \" in a recent interview with so film magazine, depardieu admits to downing up to 14 bottles of wine a day, though he has a good explanation via the reporter for all that: \" i ' m obsessed with the racket in my body, the beating of my heart, the gurgling of my intestines, my joints cracking. … i must drink so as not to hear it, so as not to go mad from it. I can't get to sleep unless i am dead drunk. \" according to the independent, he also denied being an alcoholic on french tv last week, saying \" alcoholics never get drunk. \" as for his friendship with putin, he believes \" we could have both become hoodlums. … i think [ putin ] immediately liked my hooligan side … that i had occasionally been picked up off the pavement dead drunk. \"",

Highlights from the reviews: \" with his extraordinary new film her, spike jonze has made a heartrending romance that will ring true for all those who've found, lost, or are still impatiently awaiting their own soul mate. In other words, it's for all of us, \" writes elizabeth weitzman in the new york daily news. \" jonze is a master at transforming genres, and with her, he renders formulaic romantic dramedies instantly obsolete. \" at slate, dana stevens agrees that it's about more than technology. \" her isn't, in the end, a political or socio-cultural satire, much less a nostalgic tract about the need to throw away our devices and truly live. It's a wistful portrait of our current love affair with technology in all its promise and disappointment, a post-human annie hall. \" in the atlantic, christopher orr calls the movie the best of the year. \" though intimate in scope, her is vast in its ambition. Every time it seems that jonze may have played out the film's semi-comic premise, he unveils an unexpected wrinkle, some new terrain of the mind or heart to be explored. \" as for the actors, \" phoenix is heartbreaking in his vulnerability, \" and johansson's \" voice — breathy, occasionally cracking — warms the entire film. \" \" at once a brilliant conceptual gag and a deeply sincere romance, her is the unlikely yet completely plausible love story about a man, who sometimes resembles a machine, and an operating system, who very much suggests a living woman, \" writes manohla dargis in the new york times. \" the great question isn't whether machines can think, but whether human beings can still feel. \"",

        "summary": "It's high time for tomatoes to taste like tomatoes again, and a group of researchers believes it knows how to make that happen, according to a study published thursday in science. The smithsonian reports tomatoes found in today's grocery stores are \" nearly unrecognizable \" from what tomatoes used to look and taste like. They're up to 1,000 times larger and can last ages without rotting, but they've also lost their tomato-y taste. Researchers studying nearly 400 varieties of tomato discovered at least 25 chemicals and aroma compounds that combine to create what we think of as a tomato's flavor. But they found 13 of those were \" significantly reduced \" in modern tomato varieties, either because growers were breeding for cheaper, bigger, longer-lasting tomatoes, or because they just weren't paying attention. Not only did researchers figure out the chemicals and compounds responsible for a tomato's taste, but the 100 genes it takes to make sure they're present, the guardian reports. According to the los angeles times, researchers believe they can use that knowledge to breed tomatoes that taste as good as they used to. And while that may not be a realistic outcome for mass-produced tomatoes — because capitalism — researcher harry klee believes they can still bring back some lost flavor in tomatoes that can stand up to the trip from farm to store to dinner table. He says the science can also be applied to other fruits that have lost their traditional taste, such as strawberries. ( meanwhile, keeping tomatoes in the fridge may mar their flavor forever. )",

Jose pimentel, 27, who goes by the name muhammad yusuf, intended to test three bombs in mailboxes before using explosives on soldiers returning home from afghanistan and iraq, said new york police commissioner raymond kelly at a press conference yesterday. He also planned to target nypd cruisers, postal facilities, and a new jersey police station, said kelly. Pimentel allegedly told an informant that the bombings would show the public \"there was mujahedeen in the city ready to wage jihad, \" reports the new york daily news. Pimentel, an american citizen born in the dominican republic, was just an hour away from finishing his first bomb when police raided his home in upper manhattan saturday, according to investigators. \" we had to act quickly because he was putting this bomb together. He was drilling holes and it would not have been appropriate for us to let him walk out the door with that bomb, \" kelly said. The suspect was a \" so-called lone wolf, motivated by his own resentment of the presence of american troops in iraq and afghanistan, as well as inspired by al-qaeda propaganda, \" said mayor michael bloomberg. The mayor emphasized that there was no evidence pimentel had any connection to an al-qaeda cell, though he pledged support for the organization on the website trueislam1.com, notes the news.",

Pell — australia's most senior catholic and, as vatican treasurer, the church's no. 3 official worldwide — formally pleaded not guilty to the charges at a hearing in melbourne tuesday, the bbc reports. Around half of the historical charges, including the ones pell's attorney described as the most \" vile, \" were dismissed, but pell will stand trial on charges relating to alleged sexual offenses in a pool in the town of ballarat in the 1970s, and at melbourne's st. Patrick's cathedral when he was the city's archbishop in the 1990s, radio australia reports. More than 30 witnesses testified during a pretrial hearing that lasted for four weeks. Magistrate belinda wallington said some of the charges were dismissed because of inconsistencies and a lack of evidence; others were dismissed because one accuser died and another was found medically unfit to give evidence. Pell, 76, took a leave of absence from rome last year to return to australia and face the charges. His passport has now been confiscated by authorities. \" last year, the holy father granted cardinal pell a leave of absence so he could defend himself from the accusations. The leave of absence is still in place, \" the vatican said in a statement.",

The bright-red billboard will show a smiling lecornu under the words \" find my killer \" and a $ 32,000 reward offer. For carrieri, it's yet another push for justice in a murder she feels police have abandoned. Lecornu was shot in her car at a shopping center in towson, maryland, at roughly 4am on march 2, 1996. A bullet in her back, 23-year-old lecornu drove to a nearby road where a stocky man was seen taking something from her vehicle and driving off in a white bmw. Since then, per carrieri, it's been frustration: \" over the last several years, more information is coming out, \" she told wbal-tv in 2016. \" ( i've ) seen that leads aren't being followed up on. I ' m hearing new information..... I feel like our case is being ignored. \" carrieri even sued baltimore county police for a copy of lecornu's investigative file and settled the case last year on terms she can't disclose. But she keeps searching, despite the emotional pain. \" i don't want her to be forgotten, \" she says. ( a 35-year-old disappearance is getting renewed attention thanks to a podcast. )",

With only 10 of 22 leaders in attendance, the league is apparently backing down from a call for syrian president bashar al-assad to step down, and despite the fact that assad has apparently agreed to un envoy kofi annan's proposed peace plan, arab leaders are split on how to handle the continued fighting, reuters reports. Further complicating matters: the syrian national council has not formally accepted the plan, since it does not call for assad's immediate resignation; opposition representatives are set to meet with western foreign ministers sunday. Syria said yesterday that it won't accept initiatives from the arab league as a whole, but would deal with individual states. The annan plan has been met with skepticism by western powers, but russia and china have endorsed it and un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged assad to implement it immediately. But assad has not taken the steps necessary to do that, according to a us state department spokesperson. Meanwhile, as the arab summit opened today, two explosions were heard in baghdad, the ap adds.

        "summary": "A detroit inmate who stabbed a deputy in the neck with a comb and stole his uniform has been recaptured after a day-long manhunt. Abraham pearson, who uses the alias derreck white, escaped from the courthouse just before he was due to receive a 15-year sentence for carjacking and he forced a woman out of her van as he made his escape, reports the detroit free press. He took off running after crashing the minivan into another vehicle and was captured late last night after police received a tip about a man walking along a freeway. Pearson was taken into custody after a short chase and tried to escape again but failed. Pearson will now face 11 additional charges relating to his escape, and \" he's looking at a considerable amount of time, \" the sheriff tells the ap. The stabbed deputy, a 63-year-old man who joined the sheriff's department after retiring as a detroit police officer last december, suffered non-life-threatening injuries from the sharpened comb. The sheriff says he would prefer to have more than one officer at a time escorting inmates, but the county can't afford it.",

        "summary": "Kevin ewing was declared brain-dead wednesday, bringing an end to what pennsylvania cops and prosecutors call a harrowing, decades-long cycle of domestic abuse. Police say ewing shot himself tuesday night after fatally shooting his wife, whom he had kidnapped for a second time while on bail for kidnapping and abusing her for 12 days, the ap reports. Washington county assistant da kristen clingerman says she tried to keep ewing in jail, and secured a protection-from-abuse order when a judge declined to raise his bail — even though his wife changed her mind about getting one. Clingerman says she was heartbroken to see the body of 48-year-old tierne ewing in the barn where her husband had taken her. The couple, who had been together since eighth grade and raised two children together, had been known to authorities for many years. In 2001, kevin ewing was sentenced to seven months in prison for assaulting his wife. Police say that in the days before he forced her into a car at gunpoint monday, tierne ewing had been staying with her husband at his mother's house. \" anybody you would talk to would ask ' why did she go back? ' but, mental health professionals will tell and i've seen it again and again, battered women, this is what they do. They go back, \" state police trooper sarah teagarden tells the pittsburgh post-gazette. \" mrs. Ewing is the classic, quintessential example of battered women's syndrome. The question is, how do you teach these girls, these women not to go back? \"",

        "summary": "Suddenly, \" alt-right \" is the political phrase of the moment. Hillary clinton on thursday called out donald trump for being linked to what she calls a racist, \" paranoid fringe \" movement, while trump denied even knowing what the phrase means. Coverage: what clinton said, per gothamist: \" these are race-baiting ideas, anti-muslim and anti-immigrant ideas, anti-woman — all key tenets making up an emerging racist ideology known as the 'alt-right. '... The names may have changed. Racists now call themselves ' racialists. ' white supremacists now call themselves ' white nationalists.'the paranoid fringe now calls itself ' alt-right. ' but the hate burns just as bright. \" what trump said, per the hill, on cnn: \" nobody even knows what it is, and she didn't know what it was. There's no alt-right or alt-left. All that i ' m embracing is common sense. \" trump campaign ceo steve bannon, formerly of breitbart media, told mother jones last week that breitbart is the \" platform for the alt-right. \" read the interview here. ( asked about it on cnn, trump responded, \" i don't know what steve said. I can only speak for myself. \" ) cnn's brian stelter has an explainer video on the movement here. The washington post's dave weigel has a primer here. At breitbart, editor milo yiannopoulos says clinton herself is responsible for the rise of the alt-right. Earlier this year, he wrote \" an establishment conservative's guide to the alt-right. \" read it here. A usa today columnist offers a definition: \" it's an online movement of white people — young white guys, mostly — including white supremacists, nationalists, nativists and plain ol ' racists. They're anxious. They're afraid. They worry whites are losing power and influence in america, and so they generally oppose immigration and multiculturalism. \" this video blogger and alt-right supporter says the movement is \" about us having a home, a place where we can be with people like ourselves. \" when clinton called out the alt-right movement, the alt-right loved it.

We checked. \" that declaration in the latest ad from billie is talking about women's body hair, and not only is the razor company revealing body hair's presence — it's embracing it with eye-catching visuals. Usa today reports on the minute-long promo, labeled \" project body hair \" and featuring women with unibrows, hairy legs, and all kinds of other fuzzy body parts; one woman is even shown post-shower turning a hair dryer on her armpit. It's the newest addition to billie's overall \" project body hair \" campaign, which claims billie is \" the first women's razor brand to show hair \" and notes its mission to promote more images of hirsute women in the media to make ladies feel comfortable in their own stubbly skin. Honoring hairy bodies may seem an odd approach for a razor company to take, but billie co-founder georgina gooley explained to glamour last month each woman should make her own personal-grooming choices. \" we all have body hair, \" she said. \" some of us choose to remove it, and some of us choose to wear it proudly. \" the brand, which has lobbied against the so-called \" pink tax \" that's often tacked onto women's hygiene products, is also offering free stock photos showing hair-proud women and using the #projectbodyhair hashtag to ask the public to upload their own pics. Billie's efforts are receiving praise online, per the guardian and bbc. \" this is damn beautiful, \" one commenter wrote on instagram, while others noted, \" finally! \" and \" [ it's ] about damn time. \" ( you may do well to leave your pubic hair alone. )",

Although the hugely popular snow monkeys are also macaques, it is illegal to breed the native monkeys with their non-indigenous cousins. When it was discovered that about one-third of the zoo's 164 monkeys contained the errant genes, their death sentence was ordered by lethal injection. It was unclear when the crossbreeding occurred. An environmental ministry official says the radical action was necessary so the crossbred monkeys wouldn't reproduce in the wild and \" threaten the natural environment and ecosystem. \" a buddhist memorial service organized by the zoo for the monkeys'souls did little to mollify critics. The zoo didn't do enough to \" explore humane alternatives, \" a world animal protection rep tells the huffington post. A born free rep adds that the monkey episode has \" all the echoes of marius the giraffe, \" referring to the outrage heaped upon the copenhagen zoo when it euthanized marius in 2014 and fed its meat to lions.

But the senate, in an effort fueled by mississippi republican roger wicker, voted to continue funding the construction. \" when it comes down to their pork, they're always going to defend it, \" a space policy expert told bloomberg early this year in a piece that dubbed the stand \" useless. \" even now, to actually use the stand would require a few more years ' work, says a nasa official.

Kim chose to forego his usual navy and black suits and appeared in front of tv cameras in a light grey jacket and tie. The look — including rimmed glasses and slick hair cut above the ears — was more modern than usual for the north korean leader, who spoke of melting \" frozen north-south relations. \" but it was probably a political, rather than a personal, choice. With the new york times noting south korea is \" known for its attention to outward appearances, \" reuters reports the look \" was likely carefully calculated to project a softer, more relaxed image to go with his surprise offer for talks with seoul. \" \" the change from the previous dark maoist suits to a softer toned grey western-style suit likely aimed to underpin peace, \" says the south korean-run korea institute for national unification. A leadership and image consultant adds that clients in less-than-ideal situations are often advised to wear grey or white in an attempt to deflect negative attention. Kim's speaking style might've also helped his message. Once a shaky talker, kim spoke clearly, barely looking at his notes, per reuters. It was a showing of confidence perhaps derived from what analysts say was a resemblance to his grandfather, kim il sung, who sometimes wore western suits. Kim, however, is \" the same ruthless sob as his father, \" kim jong il, who favored drab mao-style suits, analyst robert kelly tells the times.",

Departing from his usual black or navy suits, kim gave his televised speech wearing black-rimmed glasses and slicked back hair, speaking fluently and rarely looking down to read as he raised the possibility of sending a delegation to the upcoming winter olympics in south korea. \"in this new year's address, north korea seems to have taken great pains with the image portrayed by kim jong un, \" said an analysis by the state-run korea institute for national unification after kim's speech. \"the change from the previous dark maoist suits to a softer toned grey western-style suit likely aimed to underpin peace, which kim stressed in his address, \" the institute said.

After a year dominated by fiery rhetoric and escalating tensions over pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme, kim declared monday that his country was \"a peace-loving and responsible nuclear power \" and called for lowering military tensions and improving ties with the south. Kim also said he was open to dialogue with seoul, prompting south korea on tuesday to propose high-level talks between the two countries on jan. 9 at the border truce village of panmunjeom. Analysts said the north korean leader's speech on monday showed more confidence compared to previous years, his old habit of swaying from side to side while making speeches nearly undetectable.

The changes allow the national counterterrorism center ( nctc ), the intelligence community's clearinghouse for terrorism data, to keep information for up to five years.

            "The obama administration has approved guidelines that allow counterterrorism officials to lengthen the period of time they retain information about u.s. Residents, even if they have no known connection to terrorism. The changes allow the national counterterrorism center ( nctc ), the intelligence community's clearinghouse for terrorism data, to keep information for up to five years. Previously, the center was required to promptly destroy — generally within 180 days — any information about u.s. Citizens or residents unless a connection to terrorism was evident. The new guidelines, which were approved thursday by attorney general eric h. Holder jr., have been in the works for more than a year, officials said. The guidelines have prompted concern from civil liberties advocates. Those advocates have repeatedly clashed with the administration over a host of national security issues, including its military detention without trial of individuals in afghanistan and at guantanamo bay, its authorization of the killing of u.s.-born cleric anwar al-awlaki in a drone strike in yemen, and its prosecution of an unprecedented number of suspects in the leaking of classified information. Officials said the guidelines are aimed at making sure relevant terrorism information is readily accessible to analysts, while guarding against privacy intrusions. Among other provisions, agencies that share data with the nctc may negotiate to have the data held for shorter periods. That information can pertain to noncitizens as",

He was arrested dec. 3, 2009, while working for usaid as a subcontractor and sentenced for bringing telecommunications gear into the country. Us officials have turned down one potential avenue to freedom: a prisoner exchange involving three cuban agents. They say gross shouldn't be compared to spies, reuters notes. But the white house, which has said that the detention is \" hurting the relationship between the united states and cuba, \" tells abc it's working on securing his release.",

A baby girl with severe microcephaly was born at a hospital in hackensack, nj, on tuesday to a mother infected with the zika virus, abc news reports. The cdc confirmed in april that the mosquito-born virus causes the condition. Dr. Manny alvarez, chairman of the obstetrics department at hackensack university medical center, tells the new york times that the 31-year-old mother was visiting the us from honduras, where she contracted the virus. He says that after she tested positive for zika and an ultrasound found that the baby was underweight, doctors opted to deliver the girl by cesarean section at 35 weeks to prevent the virus from doing any more damage. The mother \" is receiving exceptional care during this difficult time and we would appreciate everyone respecting the mother's privacy, \" a hospital spokeswoman said in a statement to ktla. Babies born with microcephaly have exceptionally small heads and often have brain damage. They usually behave much like other newborns, nbc new york notes, but learning problems and physical disabilities appear later on. In january, a baby with the condition was born to a mother in hawaii who caught zika while living in brazil. ( the cdc recently determined that the risk of having a baby with microcephaly is up to 14 % for mothers infected with zika during the first trimester. )",

The rare inherited condition, known formally as vibratory urticarial, causes an allergic reaction in patients during the most mundane exercises — think mowing the lawn, jogging, riding the bus, or even clapping, explains popular science. Headaches, fatigues, and a case of the hives are typical symptoms, though they're usually short-lived. Now scientists at the national institutes of health say they've zeroed in on what causes the problem, and the discovery could shed light on the little-understood way our genes affect the allergies we get, reports motherboard. After studying the dna of patients with a three-generation family history of the condition, 36 people in all, researchers identified a shared mutation on a gene called adgre2. Essentially, the mutation causes the body's adgre2 protein — present on the surface of cells known as mast cells that play a role in the immune system — to be a little shaky, the researchers explain in the new england journal of medicine. Random vibrations can break the protein apart, and when a break occurs, the mast cells fear something is attacking the body and release inflammatory chemicals such as histamines that trigger an allergic reaction, reports medical daily. \"this work marks, to the best of our knowledge, the first identification of a genetic basis for a mast-cell-mediated urticaria induced by a mechanical stimulus, \" says a federal researcher who co-authored the study. Scientists hope to next look for additional mutations in the hope of developing treatments or perhaps even a cure. ( this rare disease traced to a gene mutation affects only one family. )",

However, shear stress destabilizes this adhesion, probably through disruption of the interaction between the α and β subunits. 16 furthermore, studies of n-terminal truncation mutants of the adhesion gpcrs adgre5, 17 adgrb2 ( bai2 ), 18 and adgrg1 ( gpr56 ) 19 have shown that their β subunits are constitutively active. Noncovalent binding of an autoinhibitory extracellular α subunit thus provides a plausible regulatory mechanism for signaling in response to physical forces. In this report, we describe the identification of a novel missense variant in adgre2 in families with a rare, hereditary, vibration-induced urticaria, implicating the encoded adhesion gpcr as a mechanosensor in mast cells.

The former nyc mayor would be what the times calls a \" startling choice \" due to his lack of actual diplomatic experience. But that's not all that might give the senate pause before confirming him. According to politico, giuliani took money — said to be in the millions of dollars — as a consultant for multiple foreign governments. His benefactors included a state-run oil company in qatar, a singapore gambling project with ties to north korea and organized crime, a venezuelan state oil company controlled at the time by hugo chavez, and the oil ministry in saudi arabia. Giuliani gave multiple paid speeches in 2011 and 2012 for an iranian group called mek, the washington post reports. It's an exiled group of iranian marxists that \" resembles a cult \" and at the time was considered a terrorist organization. It's that last part that could make giuliani taking money from them illegal. And if giuliani believes the mek is iran's legitimate government, as the group claims, it could completely upend iranian-us relations if he becomes secretary of state. While giuliani is seen as the most likely candidate for secretary of state, he's also been floated as attorney general, a position he says he won't take, according to fox news.

More recently, heard was missing from depp's recent promotional appearances for alice through the looking glass, and depp was not at heard's side for the most recent met gala in may or her 30th birthday celebration in april. ( the divorce could end up a $ 400 million battle. )",

Whether the strike on a vehicle actually killed the 27-year-old briton is uncertain, and will remain so until the intelligence can be assessed. Outlets including cnn and the guardian quote sources who are confident that the strike killed the militant, who had been under \" persistent surveillance. \" still, \" we cannot yet be certain, \" british prime minister david cameron told reporters friday morning. Cameron called the mission an \" act of self-defense \" and \" a strike at the heart \" of isis, and he said the uk had been working closely with the us to track down the militant. Emwazi was born in kuwait but was a naturalized british citizen, and the new york times notes that the idea of going after him troubled rights advocates — similar to the criticism over the us decision to kill american citizen anwar al-awlaki. Last year, emwazi grabbed the world's attention with gruesome videos showing the beheading of western hostages, including three americans. Former isis hostages have described him as a sadist who was fond of torturing and taunting the group's western prisoners, the ap reports.

Now, however, the arizona resident who created a small empire focused on bogus online information has been found dead in his bed at age 38, reports the arizona republic. Police don't suspect foul play. Horner had a history of drug abuse, and authorities say evidence at the scene points to that as the cause of death. Horner unapologetically made up fake stories that frequently went viral, perhaps most famously one with the headline, \" donald trump protester speaks out: ' i was paid $ 3,500 to protest trump's rally. ' \" in interviews, he said he considered his work satire designed to get people to think more critically. \" anybody who gets tricked by my stuff is people that i ' m targeting, trying to make them change the way they think, \" he once said. Horner also credited himself with changing the world. \" i think trump is in the white house because of me, \" he told the washington post in november, expressing regret about it. \" trump supporters — they just keep running with it! they never fact-check anything! \" horner had a formula: he used standard journalistic prose and style to write his stories, especially the tops of them, which were then posted on sites with legit-sounding domain names such as cnn.co.de and microsoftsite.com. Horner said he typically made $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 per month, but sometimes cleared as much as $ 18,500. ( another popular story claimed that president obama had banned the national anthem at sporting events. ) the stories often included a reference to a charity called sockitforward, and that turned out to be authentic. It was created by horner himself to provide socks for phoenix's homeless.",

Her drawing of yesterday's courtroom drama in the deflategate scandal depicted tom brady in what espn calls a \" rough and approximate portrayal \" of the suspended patriots quarterback. Others weren't as charitable in their description of the sketch, with headlines such as \" this courtroom sketch of tom brady will haunt your dreams, \" comparisons to the lord of the rings ' gollum and lurch from the addams family, and ( of course ) plenty of memes on twitter. There's even a @tombradysketch twitter handle that's already popped up to cull the cream of the crop. Rosenberg defends her likeness of brady by explaining that \" i try to capture somebody's essence quickly, so it's not going to be perfect, \" per cbs new york. She adds to the boston globe, \" i don't tend to flatter people and make them look beautiful \" and notes that brady made it more challenging for her because he barely looked up from checking his cellphone for most of the hearing. Rosenberg tells vice she probably won't be scanning the memes on twitter — \" i ' m sure it's horrible \" — but she does say she's sorry, via the new york times: \" obviously i apologize to tom brady for not making him as good-looking as he is. \" behold below: some of our favorite memes ( including this amazing gif ).",

Later, the prosecutors ' office said botha misspoke initially because forensics tests haven't been completed. ( pistorius has said the substance was some kind of an herbal remedy. ) botha also gave two different estimates about how far away a key witness was when screams were heard — it was 600 yards at first, then half that later, reports the guardian. He acknowledged overlooking a bullet in a toilet, walking through the scene with unprotected shoes, and generally not having any evidence to contradict pistorius ' claim that he shot girlfriend reeva steenkamp because he mistook her for a burglar. \" pistorius looked more calm and composed than at any point so far, while the smiles on his family's faces suggested that they felt momentum was shifting his way, \" writes david smith in the guardian. The telegraph has point-by-point examples of the police case getting picked apart, including the fact that an autopsy showed steenkamp's bladder to be empty.

The dog promptly bit a passenger and a flight attendant. Us airways said that the passenger was expressly told not to open the carrier door. According to flight tracking website flightaware.com the plane was west of pittsburgh when the pilot of the airbus a319 decided to divert the phoenix-bound plane to pittsburgh international airport because of the canine bites. A us airways spokesperson described the diversion as precautionary and said the captain did not declare an emergency. Upon landing in pittsburgh the plane taxied to a us airways gate where it was met by law enforcement officials and the fire department. An airport spokesperson tells abc news the dog, whose breed was not immediately known, and its owner were deplaned and interviewed before being released. Once the dog and its owner were off the plane the flight continued to phoenix without them. Joann jenny, a spokeswoman with the pittsburgh international airport, said the dog and its owner were later released to board another plane to phoenix. Airlines, including us airways, united, and american airlines, limit the number and type of pets allowed in cabins. Those banned from carry-on travel in the belly of the plane, where kennels are placed in a special pressurized and temperature-controlled section of the plane.

According to flight tracking website flightaware.com the plane was west of pittsburgh when the pilot of the airbus a319 decided to divert the phoenix-bound plane to pittsburgh international airport because of the canine bites. A us airways spokesperson described the diversion as precautionary and said the captain did not declare an emergency. Upon landing in pittsburgh the plane taxied to a us airways gate where it was met by law enforcement officials and the fire department. An airport spokesperson tells abc news the dog, whose breed was not immediately known, and its owner were deplaned and interviewed before being released. Once the dog and its owner were off the plane the flight continued to phoenix without them. Joann jenny, a spokeswoman with the pittsburgh international airport, said the dog and its owner were later released to board another plane to phoenix.

In at least one video, he praises the afghan taliban. In a 2015 video, he declares himself a candidate for afghan president, though there was no election that year. On a \" provisional government of afghanistan \" facebook page, seddique mateen's latest post came just hours before the shooting. In a video, he wears army fatigues while pretending to be afghanistan's president and ordering the arrest of multiple politicians. Seddique mateen, who told reporters sunday that his son may have been motivated by anger at seeing two men kiss, apologized for the shootings sunday night, saying his son was \" a very good boy \" and that he is in shock. \" i never figured out that he had a grudge in his heart, \" he said, per the bbc. Reuters reports that seddique mateen lives in florida, but it isn't clear when he first came to the us. Sitora yusufiy, omar mateen's ex-wife, tells the guardian that he was \" short-tempered, \" abusive, used steroids, and did not get along with his parents. \" he would often get into fights and arguments with his parents, but because i was the only one in his life, most of the violence was towards me at that time, \" she says.

According to the guardian, 100 officers were involved in the arrest, which took place at a suburban apartment. Cnn reports police found bomb-making supplies and a number of counterfeit passports, at least two of them turkish, in the suspect's apartment. The attack at the erawan shrine — a destination popular with both thai and chinese tourists — is the worst bombing outside of war in thailand's history, killing 20 people and wounding more than 120. Cnn reports the suspect is also believed to be responsible for a second bombing aug. 18 in which no one was harmed. So far, police are hesitant to label the bombing a work of terrorism. \" he is a foreigner, but it's unlikely that he is an international terrorist, \" the national police chief tells the bbc. \" it's a personal feud. \" the chief says the suspect was angry on behalf of friends and family members but wouldn't clarify a motive any further. The guardian reports some have suspected the bombing was in response to thailand deporting 109 uighurs — an oppressed muslim minority — to china last month. According to cnn, the man arrested is not the main suspect seen in surveillance footage leaving a backpack at the shrine prior to the blast, and police are continuing to investigate.",

Details linking daval to the killing are now trickling out. Per afp, a neighbor heard a car leaving the couple's home on the night of oct. 27, and tire tracks from daval's work vehicle matched those found near alexia's body, which was reportedly covered with a sheet believed to be from the couple's home. Tensions between the pair were high as they struggled to conceive a child, sources add, per the local. Daval had earlier told police that bite marks and scratches on his hands resulted from an argument the pair had the day before alexia vanished, per the bbc. \" alexia had an overwhelming personality, so he felt diminished, \" schwerdorffer says. \" at one point too many words were said, a fit of anger proved too much, and he couldn't control himself. \" he says daval maintains he didn't burn his wife's body.",
