Kyle lydell canty made his case in october at an immigration and refugee board hearing, where he said black americans are \" being exterminated at an alarming rate \" and said his own life may be at risk. He also mentioned well-known cases ( like the deaths of eric garner and michael brown ) and showed video of him apparently interacting with off-screen us police officers — but officials on the board weren't persuaded, vice reports. \" on these clips the claimant is interacting with police officers, addressing them with comments such as ' you guys are just ridiculous ' and ' you're dumb, ' \" writes board member ron yamauchi in his decision. \" his demeanor, in these videos, is not redolent of intimidation. \" while yamauchi agreed that blacks are stopped \" at the highest rate \" by us police, he says canty doesn't appear to be personally at risk. Canty ( who is from new york but has lived in several states, vice reported in october ) faces charges including disorderly conduct, intimidation, trespassing, jaywalking, and threats, but denies the charges and says he was racially targeted. He's disillusioned about canada, he says, but adds, \" i still hate america. \"",

And they're not the only new target to emerge. The ap reports that police suspect phone hackers also hit the lawyer who represented the family of dodi al-fayed at the inquest into princess diana's death. The scandal might be about to bubble over, reports cnbc: sources tell it that as many as five news of the world employees will be arrested within days. Personal details of the families of britain's war dead have been found in the files of a private investigator employed by the tabloid, which is already accused of hacking the phones of families of terror victims, a murdered girl, and scores of other people connected to major news stories over the last decade. The families of murder victims and of people killed in natural disasters like the 2004 indian ocean tsunami are now urging police to inform them whether they were among the paper's targets. As the scandal spreads, dozens of firms are scrambling to pull their ads from the news of the world, cnn reports. Ad buyers at media agencies say some of their clients are being phoned and emailed relentlessly as a social media campaign to boycott the paper spreads.",

            "London ( cnn ) -- several major advertisers in the united kingdom are pulling advertising from the uk's news of the world newspaper amid a wave of public outrage over a phone hacking scandal. Carmakers ford and vauxhall, virgin holidays, halifax and the co-operative group are among those to say they are withdrawing adverts that were scheduled to run in the newspaper. Other big firms, including cell phone providers t-mobile and orange and utility firm npower, say they are reviewing their position with regard to advertising in light of the turmoil over the allegations against media baron rupert murdoch's flagship british sunday paper. The scandal around the news of the world widened wednesday, with the father of a victim of the 2005 london terror attacks saying his phone may have been hacked. That followed claims tuesday that its journalists also hacked into the phone messages of missing teenager milly dowler, who was later found to have been murdered. Prime minister david cameron called the allegations \" absolutely disgusting. \" ford was among the first to act to distance itself from news of the world, saying tuesday that it was \" concerned by the serious nature of the allegations of past activities against the news of the world, and the high level of public concern. \" \" while we are not prejudging the outcome of the ongoing investigations, we believe it"

But this week he underwent a first-ever procedure that's left him \" feeling great, \" reports the australian broadcasting corporation. Doctors at australia's royal north shore hospital in sydney permanently implanted a spinal cord stimulator in grewal's back. The device senses pain signals traveling up the spine and sends electrical impulses to the brain. The brain gets confused and interprets the mixed signals as a \" pleasant tingling \" instead of pain, explains surgeon charles brooker. Immediately following the procedure, grewal said his pain level was down from an eight out of 10 to a two or three, according to the telegraph. Similar implants have been around for decades, but they were touchy when it came to the electric currents they were sending out, the telegraph reports. The strength of their signals could be affected by everything from walking to an increased heart rate. The new implant receives signals back from the nervous system to better regulate its behavior and thus marks a huge advance, says brooker. \" that means a machine can adjust itself to produce whatever set level the patient wants. \" experts think implants like grewal's could be used to treat other conditions, such as parkinson's disease, and might help replace pain killers for people with chronic pain. Doctors plan on testing the implant on 30 patients in australia and are seeking permission to test it in the us, as well.

        "summary": "The investigation into what caused tuesday's deadly metro-north crash in valhalla, ny, is focusing on how a mother of three described by friends as \" responsible \" ended up in the crossing as a train hurtled toward her. Ellen brody, 49, of edgemont was the driver of the suv; she was headed home from the chappaqua jewelry store job she had held for 15 years when witnesses say brody exited her vehicle after a crossing gate lowered onto it. She re-entered the car, drove forward on the tracks, and was hit; one witness described her as not appearing to be in a hurry. The crash happened in the dark in an area where the tracks are straight, notes the ap. Talking to nbc new york, a friend describes the mom of three daughters, who was married to playwright alan brody, as \" very responsible, \" \" very reliable, \" and \" a saint, because she was the most selfless person. \" ntsb investigators are currently reviewing the tracks, interviewing the crew, and looking into whether brody's mercedes suv had a data recorder. The five others who died in the crash, as per nbc: eric vandercar, 53, of bedford hills wasn't only a seasoned finance executive — he recently exited morgan stanley after 27 years to go to a top directorial position at mesirow financial — the married father was also said to be an avid skier, whitewater rafting guide, and diver, as per lohud.com. Staff at nyc's metropolitan museum of art are grieving for one of their own: 69-year-old walter liedtke of bedford hills, who had worked as a curator and art historian at the met for more than 30 years, specializing in dutch and flemish artists. Aditya tomar, 41, of danbury, conn., was born in india and worked in finance in new york city, his mother-in-law told nbc. She added that the family was \" shocked and grieving. \" robert dirks of chappaqua was a 36-year-old father of two young children. Born in thailand, dirks got his phd from caltech and worked in the \" development of novel computational chemistry methods. \" joseph nadol, 42, of new castle was managing director and analyst for jpmorgan's us aerospace and defense equity research group; he was reported to have had three children.",

        "summary": "Henry viii once called hops a \" wicked and pernicious weed, \" but they're crucial to the production of most beers, especially when it comes to \" hoppy \" india pale ales, or ipas. In fact, more than 4,000 brewers are battling for less than a dozen popular hop varieties \" like a bunch of wolves going after a carcass, \" wicked weed brewing co-owner luke dickinson tells the wall street journal. The result is a shortage of the weed even as its production continues to rise; farmland devoted to the crop has jumped 65 % in the past five years alone, but the number of brewers has grown faster, doubling from 2,000 to 4,000 in that same period. Competition is so fierce, and hops so slow to mature ( it takes the vines two to three years ), that some brewers are forced to turn away thousands of barrels of beer orders. Ironically, the resulting slowdown in craft beer production growth this year has farmers worrying about a coming glut of hops, not to mention a concern about how reliable all the new breweries will be two, three, four years down the road. This has farmers cautious even as demand outpaces supply. Further complicating matters is that craft brewers are looking for aroma hops to add flavor, not alpha hops that give budweiser and miller lite their bitterness, resulting in a wide variety of new and niche hops, many of which have small orders. \" to deal with a few boxes of this [ variety ] and few pellets of that is a real challenge, \" says diane gooding of gooding farms in idaho. And then there's climate change, reports slate, with hot weather in europe destroying huge hop harvests, which could lead to pricier beers. ( pumpkins have caused brewers headaches, too. )",

And according to the wall street journal, that shortage is one factor slowing down the rise of craft beer sales — which last year increased 8 percent, \"ending six years of double-digit growth. \" i wouldn't exactly say it's time to pour one out for the craft beer boom based on those numbers, but the hop problem does illustrate how what economists call \"frictions \" — and what the rest of us call real life — can muck with the laws of supply and demand. Given the boom in fancy beer sales, you'd expect american farmers to be planting hops like mad to cash in on a blooming industry. And indeed they are. Farmers are devoting 65 percent more acres to growing hops than they were five years ago, according to the journal. But it takes a few years for hop plants to reach their full yield.

        "summary": "Michael phelps will try to break an ancient olympic record this week. The swimmer has won 21 olympic gold medals, 12 of them in individual events — and those dozen personal medals mean phelps has tied an olympic record that had been held for 2,168 years, deadspin reports. Olympic historian bill mallon was first to report that phelps had tied the record held by leonidas of rhodes, a sprinter who won multiple events at the 154th olympiad in 164 bce, and then at the next three games, ultimately winning 12 individual titles. But, as deadspin notes, he got wreaths instead of medals to mark his victories. Phelps could potentially overtake leonidas: he competes in the 200m individual medley thursday and the 100m butterfly friday.

They found that the amount of time mothers spent \" engaged with \" or \" accessible to \" children between the ages of 3 and 11 didn't affect the children's behavior, emotional well-being, or academic performance. Not convinced? melissa milkie, an author of the study published earlier this month in the journal of marriage and family, puts it bluntly to the washington post: \" i could literally show you 20 charts, and 19 of them would show no relationship between the amount of parents'time and children's outcomes.... Nada. Zippo. \" one of the rare exceptions: among kids ages 12-18, \" more engaged maternal time was related to fewer delinquent behaviors \" — things like drug use, sex, and antisocial behavior. The authors observe that, \" interestingly, the intensive mothering ideology is not typically focused on this age group. \" the post notes the researchers also found that teens who had roughly 50 minutes of engaged family time each day benefited. As for what could negatively affect one's kids, per the study: a mother's stress, income, or educational level, suggesting the best way to help kids is \" through social resources that help the parents in terms of supporting their mental health and socio-economic status, \" writes milkie, whose study interestingly noted this: the amount of time mothers spend with their kids has actually increased from 10.5 hours a week in 1965 to 13.7 in 2010. At the blog for the institute of family studies, anna sutherland lists a few caveats with the research: since kids under 3 weren't involved, \" the study is not relevant to debates over... Whether day care or parental care is better for toddlers. \" she observes the study also didn't define \" engaged \" time — meaning activities like actively reading a book or passively watching tv were treated identically.

            "In 1965, american mothers spent an average of eight hours a week on paid work and 10 hours a week on child care. In 2011, they worked 21 hours a week — and spent 14 hours on child care. That is, even as they became much more likely to spend a significant amount of time at work, moms came to devote more time, not less, to their kids. Do you think children benefited from that change? restricting the question to today, are kids who spend more time with their moms more likely to do well on standard academic and behavioral measures? i had always assumed that all else equal, the time mothers spend with their kids would be associated more positive outcomes for them — better academic achievement, fewer emotional and behavior problems, less risk-taking in adolescence. But a new study by sociologists melissa milkie, kei nomaguchi, and kathleen denny in the journal of marriage and family examined exactly that question and found essentially null results: \"in childhood and adolescence, the amount of maternal time did not matter for offspring behaviors, emotions, or academics. \" the researchers used data from the child development supplement of the panel study of income dynamics on about 1,600 kids ( ages three to 11 ), roughly half of whom they followed into adolescence ( ages 12 to 18 ), and"

Severe thunderstorm watches were in effect at one point thursday evening for a continuous stretch from oklahoma through new jersey. The danger could lurk for several hours longer, with the national weather service issuing such warnings in delaware, maryland, new jersey, kentucky, virginia, arkansas and other points in between. Well before then, the system had already packed a punch. In pennsylvania, a tree crushed a woman in her car as she sought shelter at a campsite, killing her, said glenn dunn, the emergency management coordinator for potter county. A 61-year-old man in brooklyn, new york, died after lightning struck a church sending a scaffold crashing down on him, authorities said. Witnesses reported trees in the region buckling under the impact. \" the trees were bending sideways, ( and ) the sky just went really dark",

Officials received reports that lightning struck the seven-story, new york avenue building shortly before smoke and flames began flowing from the roof, fdny spokesman jim long said.

But since then, investigators have stopped speaking publicly about the ongoing probe, allowing rumors to fly in the small town, reports the indianapolis star in a look at the case. Some wonder whether a family member could be to blame; others, particularly those who saw the girls'single mother, 29-year-old gaylin rose, screaming frantically for her daughters after escaping the fire but being unable to save them, decry that idea. There's also the complicating factor that the arson investigator at the state's department of homeland security who determined the fire was intentionally set resigned after a private investigator consulting on the case called that finding into question, claiming it was based on speculation, as wthr reported in june. Indiana state police and the county prosecutor say they still believe the fire was arson. Rose didn't speak to the star, but she told fox59 in may that she was upset with how the investigation has been handled and the rumors that were flying.

        "summary": "Beware the ides of march... Or the withdrawal of six-figure sponsorships. Delta air lines and bank of america on sunday night pulled their sponsorship of new york's public theater over its production of julius caesar. The issue: in this reimagining, it's a president trump lookalike ( gregg henry ) who plays the title character — and is ultimately stabbed to death by a group of women and minorities. Similarly, tina benko plays caesar's wife with what the new york daily news calls a \" thick slavic accent. \" more on the timeline and the fallout: nbc new york sums up the play thusly: \" in a production that may as well have been renamed donald trump, the conquering hero... Puts a hand on the crotch of his slavic wife, picks on a'reporter ' planted in the audience, posts to social media and bathes in a golden tub. \" the play is set to open monday in central park, having been in previews since may 23. The new york times reports that criticism has been building over the last week, and reached a \" fever pitch \" sunday thanks to coverage by fox news. Donald trump jr. Retweeted that fox link sunday morning, appending this: \" i wonder how much of this ' art ' is funded by taxpayers? serious question, when does ' art ' become political speech &amp; does that change things? \" four-year sponsor delta backed out first, saying the \" artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. \" deadline reports its support was worth $ 100,000 to $ 499,000 a year. Eleven-year backer bank of america exited next, saying in part, \" had this intention [ to provoke and offend ] been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it. \" the times cites this online note from director oskar eustis, which it says \" makes clear \" the play is a cautionary tale, not an endorsement of taking out political leaders. Deadline's take in its review: \" it may not be as crude as the assassination of kim jong-un in the interview, but the timing is not so good in the wake of l ' affair kathy griffin. \"",

        "summary": "Here's some bad news for anyone who lives by the credo the only good bedbug is a dead bedbug: the nocturnal bloodsuckers that infest homes, hotel rooms, and even movie theaters are getting harder to kill. In a study in the journal of medical entomology, researchers say that bedbugs collected from cincinnati and michigan — where a man recently lit himself on fire in his quest to vanquish the pests — showed \" dramatic levels of resistance \" to the most commonly used insecticide in the world, the bbc reports. Lead researcher alvaro romero of new mexico state university says the results don't necessarily mean that bedbugs worldwide are resistant to neonicotinoid insecticides, but they suggest that using chemicals to control bedbugs is a losing strategy in the long run. \" it's a very complex problem, \" romero says. \" we need to incorporate other alternatives. \" those include heat and vapor treatments, and enclosing mattresses in bed bug encasements, he says. In the experiment, researchers compared bedbugs that came from homes treated with neonics to bedbugs from a colony with no such exposure. It took just 0.3 nanograms of insecticide to kill half the insects in the latter group, but 10,000 nanograms were required for the other. Simply put: \" people are spending a lot of money on products that aren't working, \" says researcher troy anderson at phys.org. A separate study found that bedbugs that take a \" blood meal \" after an insecticide treatment are more likely to survive at least long enough to reproduce — a factor for which laboratory testing of insecticides fails to account, according to a post at eureka alert. \" many of the insecticides labeled for bedbug control may not be as effective as claimed, because of the inadequate testing method, \" a researcher says. ( at least bedbugs won't give you lyme disease, unlike these ticks that now infest half of us counties. )",

The question came from congresswoman jan schakowsky of illinois on monday during a roundtable discussion on concussions convened by a house panel, and the answer came from jeff miller, the nfl's senior vice president for health and safety. Miller began to elaborate — \" i think the broader point, and the one that your question gets to, is what that necessarily means, and where do we go from here with that information \" — but schakowsky recognized the moment and stopped him. \" is there a link? \" she asked again. \" yes, sure, \" said miller. Schakowsky noted that just days before this year's super bowl, the neurosurgeon in charge of the nfl's own panel on brain injury refused to make the connection. Thus, miller's response is a very big deal, the founder of the concussion legacy foundation tells the washington post. \" this day was a long time coming, and i think it will have huge implications for the future of the game, \" says chris nowinski.

Livescience reports that possible human remains were recovered from a b-24 bomber nicknamed the tulsamerican that crashed off the coast of croatia toward the end of the war, some 73 years ago. Damaged during battle with the german air force, the aircraft lost power and crashed into the adriatic sea. While seven of its passengers were rescued, three airmen were never found. Per ktul, when the wreckage was discovered in 2010, finding those soldiers became a project many were drawn to, including assistant da kevin gray of tulsa ( where the bomber was manufactured ). \" you've got people spending millions of dollars trying to find amelia earhart, \" gray says. \" this is our own amelia earhart. \" coordinated by the us military's defense pow/mia accounting agency, the recovery effort was launched soon after the wreck's discovery to head off looting. Dr. Brendan foley, an underwater archaeologist from lund university, called the recovery \" incredibly emotional \" and \" the most worthwhile thing we've ever done underwater. \" in an interview with livescience, he described the nose portion of the plane \" almost peeled open like a banana \" from the impact of the crash, but said parts like seats were still distinguishable in the two sections found 135 feet below the surface. Along with any materials that resembled bone ( that will undergo dna testing ), the divers brought back soil where artifacts may be buried as well as equipment and clothes that could belong to the servicemen. The us embassy zagreb thanked the croatian government for its assistance on facebook, linking to stunning video footage of the recovery efforts. ( a hiker spotted this wwii crash in india. )",

Trump's former chief strategist gave his first major interview after leaving the administration to 60 minutes. In a clip released ahead of its sunday airing, bannon says trump held a meeting with his advisers following the release of the tape, which showed him bragging to billy bush about groping women. While others advised trump to drop out of the race or face the biggest loss in history, bannon says he told trump, \" you have 100 % probability of winning. \" he says the american people \" knew donald trump was just doing locker room talk \" and didn't care about the tape. Bannon says not everyone was so confident and that \" billy bush saturday \" was a \" litmus test \" that \" showed me who really had donald trump's back. \" one of the people who failed the test, according to bannon, was chris christie, and that's why the new jersey governor was never given a position in the white house. But christie's senior campaign strategist tells the independent journal review that \" is simply not true \" and that christie turned down \" more than a half-dozen \" offers from trump in order to finish out his term as governor.

Rooms will start at $ 60 a night; robots don't generally ask to be paid, and that will help reduce the hotel's costs, slashgear reports. The goal, says a huis ten bosch rep, is a \" smart hotel, \" complete with facial-recognition door locks. \" we will make the most efficient hotel in the world, \" company president hideo sawada says, per the japan times. \"in the future, we'd like to have more than 90 % of hotel services operated by robots. \" ( maybe you ' ll even be able to get a ride there from a robot. )",

The new york times points out the question has been answered before, and those previous estimates have been higher: this 2011 study found the average to be 0.66 grams per joint ( while noting blunts used even more, at 0.97 grams ). A government report went with 0.43 grams, and a press release notes the office of national drug control policy uses 0.5 grams as its baseline. Two interesting sidenotes from the times: first, the estimate isn't perfect — a point that researchers greg ridgeway and beau kilmer concede — because the data was sourced from a single group, those who have been arrested. It also notes that weight is just one part of the equation: how much thc is in the pot used to make the joint matters, too, in terms of understanding the health implications for users — and today's pot is much stronger than 1995's.",

            "New penn research shows average joint contains much less marijuana than thought how much marijuana does the average joint contain? \"it seems like an odd question but major policy questions depend on the answer, \" said greg ridgeway, an associate professor of criminology and statistics at the university of pennsylvania. Until now, there's been no consensus. Previous research suggested a single joint held anywhere from 0.3 to 0.75 grams of cannabis, with some users reporting amounts as high as 1 gram. The united states office of national drug control policy used 0.5 grams as its baseline. Now ridgeway and colleague beau kilmer of the rand corporation have a new answer. According to their analysis, on average, a single joint contains 0.32 grams of marijuana. They obtained this estimate by plugging into a drug-pricing model information from more than 10,000 marijuana transactions during 11 years and from more than 40 communities. \"it turns out to be a critical number in estimating how much marijuana is being consumed [ nationwide ], how much drug-trafficking organizations are putting on the market and how much states might expect in revenue post-legalization, \" ridgeway said. He and kilmer published their finding in the august issue of drug and alcohol dependence. They started their analysis by looking at information from the u.s. Justice department's arrestee drug abuse monitoring program. Through this jail-based initiative, interviewers ask all arrestees, not just those imprisoned on drug-related charges, about substance use and market transactions. \"the data had information on 10,628 transactions related to marijuana, \" ridgeway said, including whether the purchaser bought joints or loose marijuana, where the interactions happened and how much the person paid. \"some will tell you about loose purchases, in grams or ounces, and give you a dollar amount. Other people will say, 'i bought four joints and paid $ 20, ' \" he said. \"if i paid $ 5 for a joint and you paid $ 5 for 0.5 grams, that gives me some information. If they're the same price, they must be roughly the same weight. \" of course, it's not quite that"

But i didn't really mind that, because 50 years later my songs were used for commercials. So that was good, too. \" he threw jimi hendrix into that mix, notes rolling stone, saying, \" he took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and brought them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere, turned them all into classics. I have to thank jimi, too. I wish he was here. \" of his work, he says \" my songs didn't just come out of thin air — i didn't just make them up, \" adding, \" if you sang ' john henry ' as many times as me... You would have written ' how many roads must a man walk down,'too. \" and to his many critics: \" critics have been giving me a hard time since day 1, \" he said. \" critics say i can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't critics say the same thing about tom waits? \" the times notes that the event usually ends with a performance by the honoree, but dylan slipped off into the night leaving neil young to perform \" blowin ' in the wind. \" ( the la times has a transcript of the whole speech. )",

In response, the journal says it maintains \" a clear separation between news and opinion \" and strives to avoid having \" opinion seeping into news coverage. \" the very fact that the emails were leaked suggests discontent in the newsroom, notes the washington post, which rounds up journalists ' critical tweets of baker.

The son of renowned scientist ronald davis, the head of the genome technology center at stanford university, was an award-winning photographer who traveled the world and worked on obama's 2008 campaign. Now 31 and diagnosed with systemic exertion intolerance disease, aka chronic fatigue syndrome, he no longer walks, talks, or eats — instead sustained by a feeding tube, reports the washington post. Davis, who is 74, hopes to tap stanford's technology to study the disease, which some still don't take seriously, in unprecedented detail. Denied funding by the nih, he's recruited three nobel laureates and raised more than $ 1 million for his project, while patients themselves are running crowdfunding campaigns to help this and other studies, reports the atlantic. \" it's probably the last major disease that we don't know anything about, \" says davis, whose plan \" is to collect more data on a group of patients than has ever been collected on a human being before, by orders of magnitude. \" starting with home visits to a few dozen very ill patients to take blood, fecal, sweat, and saliva samples, he ' ll run a litany of tests using mass spectrometry and dna and rna sequencing and then conduct the same tests on those less affected by the disease as well as those with other fatigue illnesses such as lupus to look for anomalies — biomarkers to show that something is \" uniquely wrong, \" davis says. As for what's wrong, dafoe described it a couple of years ago on whitneydafoe.com: \" it's like \" staying up for two nights in a row while fasting, then getting drunk. The state you would be in on the third day — hung over, not having slept or eaten in 3 days — is close, but still better than many cfs patients feel every day. \" ( see why the institute of medicine called for a name change. )",

Given his ever-widening media reach — an mtv show is reportedly in the offing, for instance — savage is arguably \" america's most influential advice columnist, \" writes benjamin j. Dueholm in a profile at washington monthly. What's more, as it odd may sound to his puritan critics, savage also is emerging as one of the nation's most prominent ethicists. ( author dueholm, it's worth noting, is a lutheran minister. ) \" while he built his following by talking without fear or euphemism about the technical aspects of intimate life, savage has moved inexorably over the years toward focusing on the moral ones, \" writes dueholm. In the \" free-fire zone of modern sexuality, he has codified a remarkably systematic — and influential — set of ethics where traditional norms have fallen away. \" one of the pillars, for instance, is \" full disclosure. \" savage won't cast judgment on your fetish or, say, your need for multiple partners, but he insists that you be open about it with your partner. Dueholm, by the way, isn't sold that this brave new world is the best place and makes a case of his own for good-old-fashioned monogamy. Read the full profile.",

Lederer, who was better known by the pen name ann landers, had for almost fifty years written america's foremost newspaper advice column. With an estimated 90 million readers, the self-described \"nice jewish girl from sioux city, iowa, \" was often counted among the most influential women in the united states. What was most remarkable about that influence was its breadth: she advised teenagers about pimples and presidents about missile defense — and the presidents often wrote her back. Before her death, lederer made clear that the ann landers pseudonym, which she had inherited in 1955, would die with her. But that did not prevent would-be successors from seeking to assume her mantle in more symbolic ways. On the auction block that november were lederer's writing desk and typewriter, on which she had composed her responses to correspondents like desperate in denver and nervous in nevada. When the bidding was over, an advice columnist named dan savage happily walked away with them. Today, the desk sits in savage's office"

Although it's reserved for the leader of the senate's minority party, it's still a ­magisterial space, with soaring ceilings and mosaic floors.

            "It is a truth universally acknowledged that olympic gold medalist usain bolt's career has so far been delineated by extremes. Earlier this year, researchers at the national autonomous university of mexico published a formal breakdown of the absolutely ridiculous physics behind his breathtaking 9.58-second world record sprint – – a feat some hold to be one of the greatest athletic performances ever recorded. Now, the jamaican runner is poised to break another set of records with the publication of his new autobiography, in which he reminisces about women, bolting, and the time he ate 1,000 chicken mcnuggets in 10 days. The fast food feat reportedly took place during the 2008 bejing olympics, where the then 22-year-old athlete would eventually shatter the competition by breaking his own world record. When bolt discovered that he was weirded out by chinese food, he decided to keep it simple and base his olympic diet on america '",

The jamaican revealed in his soon-to-be released autobiography, faster than lightning, his passion started with a box of 20, yes 20, of the golden chicken treats, but with his training going into overdrive, he soon needed far more, up to 100 a day, and even turned to an apple pie to take the edge off. \"at first i ate a box of 20 for lunch, then another for dinner, \" he wrote. \"the next day i"

It took the 65-year-old canadian more than a decade to research and write the book, the times of israel reports. After poring over more than 600 books and articles and searching wwii-related archives in israel, the us, and the uk, chalmers has put together a comprehensive account of the brutality suffered by women, including rape, disfigurement, forced abortion even in the ninth month, sterilization through x-rays, and experimentation. As the times notes, it's a topic that often has been \" sanitized. \" \"survivors didn't talk about anything having to do with sex because they didn't want their children and grandchildren to know what had happened to them, \" says chalmers. Birth, sex and abuse is \" a library within a library, \" marcia weiss posner writes in a review for the jewish book council. \" each word, each bit of information is precious and unlikely to be found elsewhere with such clarity and comprehensiveness. \" a review at oxford journals says the book helps show how \" the nazis aimed at the destruction of the jewish race partially through ideologically driven attacks on women's reproduction. \" many non-jewish women also suffered under the nazis ( their babies were taken from them; they were forced into prostitution; and the government encouraged their husbands to divorce them if they couldn't bear children ). However, chalmers tells the times, \" the jewish experience was horrifically unspeakable. \" ( a photo of a woman standing up to neo-nazis is the talk of sweden. )",

In what the wall street journal is calling a \" major milestone, \" some of the fencing will finally come down this year. Joe daniels, president of the national september 11 memorial &amp; museum, says it will \" 100 % \" happen, perhaps as early as may. But the port authority of new york and new jersey, which owns the site, had no comment on the timing, with its chief security officer saying \" ongoing construction needs and other concerns \" must be considered. Still, it would be the first step in integrating the site with the rest of manhattan. Daniels says the first part to come down will grant more access to the memorial; currently, visitors must make use of a narrow path that passes through a fence to get there. A port authority rep was said to have mentioned removing the fencing from the parts of west, liberty, and greenwich streets that skirt the memorial at a community meeting earlier this month. The wire reports that if that does happen, eight of the site's 16 acres will be open. But it's not the only barrier locals are concerned about: earlier this month residents sued the city over a planned \" fortress-like \" barrier system comprised of gates, guard booths, checkpoints, and barriers ( these only three feet tall ), reports the ap.

The girl bought a pair of disposable contact lenses that were supposed to be used for one month and wore them for more than six months, even while she was sleeping. After feeling acute pain in her eyes, she went to hospital and was diagnosed with acanthamoeba keratitis ( 棘阿米巴角膜炎 ), which is caused by a protozoon called an amoeba ( 阿米巴原蟲 ). The infection was brought on by dirty water that she used to clean her face, doctors said. Acanthamoeba keratitis, commonly referred to as amoeba keratitis, usually afflicts contact lens wearers or people whose eyes come into contact with dirty water. Director of ophthalmology at wan fang hospital wu jian-liang ( 吳建良 ) indicated that contact lens wearers are a high-risk group that can easily be exposed to eye diseases. A shortage of oxygen can destroy the surface of the epithelial tissue, creating wounds in the eyes and cultivating an environment suitable for amoebas to survive. Wu said that the college girl did not follow the correct procedure in maintaining the hygiene of her contact lenses and her overuse of the lenses gradually damaged her corneas. After half a year of wearing them, her corneas were devoured",
            "The cardinal rule when using contact lenses is to maintain proper hygiene. That means cleaning them regularly and disposing of them when recommended. Not doing so can leave the wearer susceptible to infections, which are the smallest of problems to be worried about, considering that 23-year-old taiwanese student, lian kao, became infected by a bug that gnaws the eyeballs after keeping her lenses on for six months straight. The microscopic bug that ate up kao's cornea was the single-celled amoeba acanthamoeba, which is notorious for the severe infections it causes in the eye, skin, and central nervous system. The parasite is commonly found in soil, dust, showers, and even swimming pools. When it makes contact with unclean lenses, it starts feeding on the bacteria on them, and if they happen to be on someone's eyes, the parasite burrows down to where it can start feeding on the cornea — a condition called acanthamoebic keratitis. Infections of this type are rare. They are hard to detect until the the person with the amoeba in their eye begins to experience acute pain. Early stages of infection may be cured with prescription drugs, but diagnosis is often complicated, delayed, and generally unsuccessful. The journal of optometry defines acanthamoeba keratitis as a blinding complication that results due to wearing a lens past its time."

This year, scientific authorities will decide whether to formally declare that we are in a new era, the guardian reports. The cbc notes that mass extinctions and climate change, both of which are happening now, are often seen at the beginning of new epochs.

In a nine-year study that one fertility scientist says raises the possibility of \" novel fertility-enhancing drugs, \" researchers analyzed 986 tsimane indigenous women in bolivia, reports the bbc. Their unusual discovery: those who carried a type of roundworm known as ascaris lumbricoides had an extra two children on average. They also gave birth at a younger age compared to women without the worm and experienced a shorter interval between pregnancies, reports the telegraph. Researchers suggest the infection — about 70 % of the tsimane population carry it — may alter a woman's immune system to make it easier for her to become pregnant. \" the effects are unexpectedly large, \" says a study author from the university of santa barbara. However, he adds that while using worms as a fertility treatment is an \" intriguing possibility, \" much more research is needed before that step.

        "summary": "When robert bales returned to base after allegedly killing 17 afghan civilians, he had only a foggy memory of what just happened — a faint smell of gunfire and human bodies, and nothing else. Or at least, that's what he told lawyer john henry browne. Browne, who met bales for the first time last week, says the soldier exhibits symptoms of ptsd, including nightmares, flashbacks, and headaches, the washington post reports. Browne dismissed the idea that alcohol, which bales has a checkered history with, played a part, saying bales had just \" two sips \" of liquor that night. But at some point bales may have remembered what he'd done. He allegedly left the base twice that night to commit the shootings, one in a village to the south and later in a village to the north. After the first shooting he reportedly returned to base and told a fellow soldier that he had killed people, an american official tells the new york times. The soldier never told anyone because he \" did not believe it. \" bales was probably able to slip in and out of the base because afghan, rather than american, guards were on duty.",

Iron chains were locked around the ankles of three of the skeletons, while another had shackles on its neck. The child was apparently shackled on the wrist. The skeletons were among hundreds found at the site, which is near an amphitheater that once hosted gladiator battles. The venue, which held between 12,000 and 18,000 people, had a \" door of the dead \" through which people would be carried to be buried, io9 reports. Experts think the spot, which came to their attention last year, is a necropolis hosting bodies of people who died in the arena, perhaps as long ago as the first and second centuries ad, the independent notes. Archaeologists are hoping to figure out more about those buried there, including whether they came from the same areas and how they died. Not much was found in the way of artifacts, though one child was apparently buried with coins on his or her eyes; roman tradition held that spirits needed money to cross the river into the world of the dead, the daily mail notes.

The store employees, in their signature orange aprons, crowded around the entrance of their salt lake city location -- waiting to give the dilley family, the best christmas they've had in a long time. This year the chain launched its first, ' gift of good ' campaign, a national web-driven campaign to find the most deserving military family to be awarded with the home repair certificate \" this program was inspired by the spirit of giving during the holidays and we thought the most meaningful gift to give is simply helping out a neighbor in need, \" said home depot spokeswoman nicole carriere.

        "summary": "A standard line of advice about marriage these days is not to wed too young — and divorce stats about people getting hitched before age 20 back that up. But a new study out of the university of utah adds a surprising twist: don't wait too long, because the risk of divorce starts rising again in the early 30s, reports the salt lake tribune. In sociologist nicholas wolfinger's stats, divorce rates steadily drop through the 20s and into the 30s — vox sees a \" sweet spot \" in them for those getting married at ages 27 to 29 — but then hit a tipping point at age 32. From then on, the risk of divorce starts ticking upward about 5 % a year. \" those who tie the knot after their early thirties are now more likely to divorce than those who marry in their late twenties, \" is wolfinger's big takeaway, per the washington post. He floats some theories, including one that people who wait until their late 30s or beyond to wed \" face a pool of potential spouses that has been winnowed down to exclude the individuals most predisposed to succeed at matrimony. \" a post at slate sums it up as the \" goldilocks theory \" on marriage: \" getting married too early is risky, but so is getting married too late. Your late 20s and early 30s are just right. \" ( click to read about how much weight marriage packs on. )",

[ tesla model s p90d: a normal person drives the 'best car ' ever made ] for its annual car-reliability survey, consumer reports said it heard from about 1,400 model s owners who complained of an \" array of detailed and complicated maladies, \" both in the car's unique touches, like its sprawling touchscreen dashboard, and in its more commonplace machinery, like windshield wipers and wheel alignment. Though consumer reports reiterated that the model s remained its best-performing car ever tested — its new \" ludicrous mode \" pushes it from 0 to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds — reviewers said the car's reliability seemed to have actually worsened from the previous year, including in its steering and suspension. \" people are saying they love the car, \" said jake fisher, head of auto testing for consumer reports, in an interview, \" but when we ask about how they've been holding up, we're seeing some major issues, in things"

        "summary": "If you're a democrat who found yourself cheering over the news that michele bachmann won't be seeking re-election next year, just stop. Bachmann just pretty much guaranteed the republicans will manage to hold onto her seat, writes sean sullivan in the washington post. The only reason she almost lost to jim graves in 2012 is because, well, she's michele bachmann. But her 6th district is minnesota's most conservative, and it should be easy for almost any other republican to win it. \" had bachmann run, the race would have shaped up as a referendum on her record. Period, \" sullivan writes. \" now, graves does not have the luxury of running against a wounded opponent. \" more reactions: at nbc news, mark murray, domenico montanaro, and brooke brower agree with sullivan — bachmann is \" probably the only republican who's at risk of losing that congressional seat \" — and also note that \" running for president doesn't always help your political career. \" see: dennis kucinich, chris dodd, tommy thompson. Who else is sad about this turn of events? fact checkers, of course. Back in the post, glenn kessler calls her \" a fact checker's dream, \" \" consistently and unapologetically... Fast and loose with the facts. \" he recounts the four \" four-pinocchio ratings \" she earned from that paper. But don't worry, bachmann won't go far. \" unless she faces ongoing legal troubles, bachmann will no doubt remain in public life, joining sarah palin on the ex-politician/grifter gravy train, \" predicts joan walsh on salon. Also on salon, alex seitz-wald notes that bachmann cited a devotion to term limits in her announcement, saying she doesn't think a person should serve in congress more than eight years. Just one problem with that: when previously asked about term limits, she opposed them, seitz-wald points out.",

Trucks full of cash arrived at the central bank last night as rifle-bearing police and a helicopter stood guard. Private security guards will keep watch at branches, the ap reports. With thousands likely to seek funds today, the institutions are installing a range of tough restrictions to avoid a bank run, reuters reports.

All this has worried economists, who say the restrictions could create a \" cyprus euro \" that's less valuable than the normal eurozone currency.

Researchers in the uk dosed 12 severely depressed volunteers with psilocybin — the active ingredient in magic mushrooms — and found it improved their condition for as long as three months, the guardian reports. \" that is pretty remarkable, \" one researcher tells nature. The study — published tuesday in lancet psychiatry — was the first to look specifically at the effects of magic mushrooms on depression. Researchers gave the volunteers, who had been depressed for nearly 18 years on average, two doses of psilocybin a few days apart and allowed them to trip inside a safe room with music playing and two psychiatrists to chat with. Afterward, all 12 reported improvements in their depression for at least three weeks. Five volunteers were still depression-free three months later. It's unclear if the volunteers were helped because the psilocybin changed their brain chemistry or because their trips gave them new perspective. One volunteer who was depressed after the death of his mother reported visiting her in the hospital and seeing his depression as an ulcer during his psychedelic experience. According to a press release, the main goal of the study was to show it could be safe to give magic mushrooms to people with depression, which researchers argue it did. If further more thorough research holds up their results, researchers say psilocybin could be used to treat the 20 % of people with depression for whom antidepressants aren't effective.

            "A small scale study into treating depression using psilocybin, the psychedelic compound of magic mushrooms, has found it can be safely administered. The study team, from imperial college london, say this could pave the way for future randomised-controlled trials to establish the efficacy of the compound in treating this form of depression. Psychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place, such as careful screening and professional therapeutic support. – dr robin carhart-harris study author it is estimated that 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression. The annual cost of depression in england is thought to be around £ 7.5 billion. Most people with depression respond positively to treatment using antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy. But around 20 per cent of those with depression do not respond to treatments and are classified as having treatment-resistant depression. Previous studies have looked into the potential of using psychedelic drugs for conditions such as end of life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and smoking dependence. Psilocybin acts on the serotonin system suggesting it could be developed for use in the treatment of depression. The study, funded by the medical research council, aimed to assess safety and whether a potential treatment dose of psilocybin could be tolerated. Hallucinogenics such as psilocybin can cause unpleasant reactions, including anxiety and paranoia, so it is important to"

        "summary": "\" about four hours before we took her off life-support, \" son ryan roberts says, his mom awoke from a 12-day coma. Teri roberts, 56, went into a coma in december after getting a rare skin bacteria that led to toxic shock syndrome. Her family, devastated at the apparently impending death of the previously healthy and active nebraska woman, planned to tell doctors a few days before christmas to take her off the ventilator. Instead, she suddenly awoke, and her husband explained to her that her hands and feet, black with gangrene, would need to be amputated. \" he held up her hands so she could see them, and she shrugged and said, ' ok, ' \" ryan roberts tells the omaha world-herald. This is just the latest hardship the family has had to endure: teri's only other child, a daughter, was murdered in 2013. The family just took the story public last week. It's not clear how roberts contracted the bacteria that led to her condition, but her prognosis looked grim as she lay in the coma: her limbs started to die, her kidneys and liver started to fail, and she developed blisters all over her body. Ryan and his father made the difficult decision after much discussion of what teri would want — and what her chances were of coming out of the coma. But, hours before their scheduled meeting to inform doctors, she woke up and told her family she didn't want to die. Her kidneys and liver began to recover, and her hands and legs were amputated last month. She was set to leave the hospital this week, start rehab, and be fitted with prosthetics, and ryan says she's determined to walk and drive again, and adds, according to ketv, that the experience has taught him to \" never give up. \" her insurance won't cover all the medical bills, so a gofundme campaign has raised nearly $ 32,000 so far.

Now authorities say they've finally discovered the name of the man who was probably still in his teens when he first arrived at san diego's sharp coronado hospital in 1999, the san diego union-tribune reports. He has been on life support and unresponsive ever since. The mexican consulate in the city says that after the mystery man's case was publicized, dna tests confirmed that he was the long-lost relative of one of the families that came forward. The consulate says the man's relatives have asked for privacy, and medical privacy laws prevent him from being named publicly. \" but his sharp caregivers can now address him by name, and we are all celebrating the dignity afforded a person who has an identity and a history, \" says a consulate spokesman. After the accident near the mexican border, authorities apparently named the man after the garage where the wrecked van he was riding in was taken, inewsource found when it reported on the case last year. The founder of the immigrant rights group border angels tells the union-tribune that he helped find the man's family — and he hopes the case will give hope to other people whose relatives vanished in attempting to cross the us border. \" there are a lot of garage 66s out there, \" enrique morones says. \" maybe it's not a 16-year-old case, maybe it's a six-day-old case.

The alleged bigfoot samples turned out to be from bears, horses, raccoons, and even a porcupine, but not from any rare creatures, let alone mythical ones, livescience reports. But two asian hair samples, including one from the supposed lair of a yeti in bhutan, suggest there may be an unknown hairy creature out there, although not a humanoid one, vox finds. The samples were related to modern bears, but the closest dna match was a 100,000-year-old polar bear bone found in the arctic, meaning there may be some unknown descendant of polar bears roaming the himalayas. One of the lead researchers, a prominent human geneticist, says that despite the failure to find any new primates, he is keeping an open mind and still believes there could be something out there, usa today reports. \" rather than thinking ' i've disproved the yeti and bigfoot and it's all a load of nonsense, ' \" he says, \" i was convinced ( eyewitnesses ) had seen something, more than i was when i started. \" ( in montana, a man who posed as bigfoot ended up getting killed. )",

Interestingly, two hair samples from the himalayas are most closely related to an ancient species of polar bear, suggesting a previously-unknown polar bear descendant or brown bear-polar bear hybrid might remain in the region. Of course, all this doesn't disprove the existence of an unknown species like bigfoot. But it does eliminate the 30 hair samples that were sequenced — collected in russia, the himalayas",

Dna tests of 30 hair samples attributed to bigfoot, yetis and other storied beings showed the hair actually came from bears, horses, even a porcupine – but not from any ape-like animals new to science. The most startling revelation came instead from a pair of supposed yeti samples collected in the himalayas. The dna in both hairs matched genetic material from a polar bear bone discovered in 2004 in the high arctic as part of a separate effort. The bone was dated to more than 100,000 years ago.

Of course, all this doesn't disprove the existence of an unknown species like bigfoot. But it does eliminate the 30 hair samples that were sequenced — collected in russia, the himalayas",
            "This is a 1977 still photo made from a 16mm film made by ivan marx reportedly showing the legendary big foot cavorting in the hills of northern california. ( photo: associated press ) the shy and secretive creature known as bigfoot has eluded us once more. Dna tests of 30 hair samples attributed to bigfoot, yetis and other storied beings showed the hair actually came from bears, horses, even a porcupine – but not from any ape-like animals new to science. The most startling revelation came instead from a pair of supposed yeti samples collected in the himalayas. The dna in both hairs matched genetic material from a polar bear bone discovered in 2004 in the high arctic as part of a separate effort. The bone was dated to more than 100,000 years ago. Perhaps, say the scientists behind the new study, one form of the \" yeti \" is actually a new species",
            "Editor's note: this story was updated at 10: 00 p.m. E.t. A new genetic analysis has found no evidence for a cryptic humanlike primate known as bigfoot or the yeti. Hair samples from creatures claimed to be bigfoot or sasquatch actually come from cows, horses, dogs and even a few extinct bears. But none seem to come from a completely new primate species, according to a study published today ( july 1 ) in the journal proceedings of the royal society b. Throughout the world, stories abound of a mysterious man-beast covered in shaggy hair, who has eyes, nose and ears like a human, and who walks on two legs. Dubbed the yeti in the himalayas, and bigfoot or sasquatch in north america, the creature has been called a hybrid human, an early human — such as a neanderthal or denisovan — or an extinct ape, such"

        "summary": "Conciliatory comments from president-elect donald trump in the aftermath of his stunning victory over hillary clinton helped global stock markets and the dollar trim their hefty losses on wednesday, the ap reports. The dow, for instance, dropped slightly at the open but was up about 40 points in the first half-hour of trading, per marketwatch. Though uncertainty remains over trump's trade, immigration, and geopolitical policies, investors appeared somewhat soothed by his victory speech, in which he praised clinton and urged americans to come together after a deeply divisive campaign. The mexican peso, however, tumbled to a record low over fears about trump's policies on nafta and a border wall, cnbc reports. The dollar also recouped some ground, while assets that many investors search out at times of uncertainty, such as gold and the swiss franc, came off earlier highs. \" we have a great economic plan, we will double our growth and have the strongest economy in the world, \" trump said in his victory speech. But donald selkin, chief market strategist at national securities in new york, warns that there could be plenty of market turmoil to come with the \" temperamentally unstable \" trump in charge. \" his tax cuts could open up a huge increase in the budget deficit and his trade sanctions could interrupt world trade, \" selkin tells reuters. \" this could put us in a recession. \"",
