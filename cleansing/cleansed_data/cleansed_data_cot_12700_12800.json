And he and his colleagues were putting signs in the windows encouraging them. \" pelosi on scott brown's slam on elizabeth warren: \" the response, really, i thought, spoke volumes about how clueless sen. Brown is. It really spoke volumes about disrespect for women that, really, he might not even realize. I bet you he'd like to take it back.... But women know. They hear a comment like that, it tells a lot about somebody. \" rick santorum on the difference between racial integration in the military and the dadt repeal: \" we're talking about people who are simply different because of the color of their skin, not because of their activities that would cause problems from people living in those close quarters. \" further, \" there are people who are gay and lived a gay lifestyle and aren't anymore.

The rapper had promised via twitter to present a plan for cps.

Although mcmillan's criminal record was expunged, he said there is still a stigma with potential employers. On tuesday, mcmillan will ask the state parole board to recommend he be granted a formal exoneration. If allowed, it would allow him to seek more compensation. \" there is not enough money to compensate people going through something like that, \" says mcmillan's lawyer, who's a former state legislator. \"they should increase the compensation and lower the bar \" for exoneration. Mcmillan was convicted in 1980 for the rape and robbery of a 16-year-old girl in memphis and sentenced to 119 years in prison. The innocence project took over his case in 1996 and eventually uncovered dna evidence that cleared him. \" i ' m not angry, \" mcmillan told cnn when he left prison.

Two of the more cumbersome federal programs are for h-2a and i-9 temporary visas, which include identity and minimum-wage requirements that at least some farm owners prefer to avoid. Most americans won't do the jobs, farmers say, and seasonal harvesting jobs won't wait: \" when it's time to harvest, it's time to harvest, \" says a farming rep.

            "What happens when american farmers don't have enough workers to harvest crops? bernie thiel, who operates his family's sunburst farms near lubbock, texas, says in a new ad urging passage of an immigration bill that he had to destroy 10 acres of squash last year because of a shortage of workers. \"american families are demanding locally grown vegetables and i want to provide that to them, \" thiel says in the ad by the partnership for a new american economy and the american farm bureau federation. \"so, please, tell congress we need immigration reform now. \" thiel's story highlights a conundrum in the immigration debate, say the ad sponsors. \"our farmers are struggling to do their jobs because they don't have the workers they need. So while congress does nothing to address agriculture labor shortages, farms fail, food rots, and we import more produce from overseas, \" said john feinblatt, chairman of the partnership for a new american economy. Adds bob stallman, president of the american farm bureau federation, \"ultimately, as a nation, we will decide whether we import our labor or import our food. While our nation's current political climate makes comprehensive reform a challenge, we are determined that ensuring an adequate farm workforce and securing our borders are compatible goals that are worthy of continued pursuit. \" the ad will appear starting thursday in d.c. Taxi cabs, the reagan national and dulles international airports in the washington area and movie theaters in 16 congressional districts. In a nod to the agricultural theme, the ad will also run at state fairs and rodeos in idaho and louisiana. The senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill last year, but the gop-led house has given up on trying to pass its own version. Congress is leaving at the end of the week for a month-long recess, and time will be short before lawmakers end the session for the november elections. The partnership brings together more than 500 republican, democratic and independent mayors and business executives, and its leaders include former new york city mayor michael bloomberg, philadelphia mayor michael nutter and ceos rupert murdoch of news corp, bob iger of disney and jim mcnerney of boeing."

            "What happens when american farmers don't have enough workers to harvest crops? bernie thiel, who operates his family's sunburst farms near lubbock, texas, says in a new ad urging passage of an immigration bill that he had to destroy 10 acres of squash last year because of a shortage of workers. \"american families are demanding locally grown vegetables and i want to provide that to them, \" thiel says in the ad by the partnership for a new american economy and the american farm bureau federation. \"so, please, tell congress we need immigration reform now. \" thiel's story highlights a conundrum in the immigration debate, say the ad sponsors. \"our farmers are struggling to do their jobs because they don't have the workers they need. So while congress does nothing to address agriculture labor shortages, farms fail, food rots, and we import more produce from overseas, \" said john feinblatt, chairman of the partnership for a new american economy. Adds bob stallman, president of the american farm bureau federation, \"ultimately, as a nation, we will decide whether we import our labor or import our food. While our nation's current political climate makes comprehensive reform a challenge, we are determined that ensuring an adequate farm workforce and securing our borders are compatible goals that are worthy of continued pursuit. \" the ad will appear starting thursday in d.c. Taxi cabs, the reagan national and dulles international airports in the washington area and movie theaters in 16 congressional districts. In a nod to the agricultural theme, the ad will also run at state fairs and rodeos in idaho and louisiana. The senate passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill last year, but the gop-led house has given up on trying to pass its own version. Congress is leaving at the end of the week for a month-long recess, and time will be short before lawmakers end the session for the november elections. The partnership brings together more than 500 republican, democratic and independent mayors and business executives, and its leaders include former new york city mayor michael bloomberg, philadelphia mayor michael nutter and ceos rupert murdoch of news corp, bob iger of disney and jim mcnerney of boeing."

        "summary": "A new study has bolstered the case that the key to preventing peanut allergies in kids is to feed kids peanuts. A study conducted last year found that babies who were fed \" peanut butter mush \" were 80 % less likely to develop a peanut allergy by age 5, npr reports. The youngsters in that study, who started eating peanuts between 4 and 11 months, were deemed high-risk due to family history or eczema. In a follow-up study released friday, researchers found that kids'tolerance of peanuts remained even after they stopped eating peanuts for a year. The national institute of allergy and infectious diseases on friday released proposed guidelines based on the finding that recommend kids at high risk of allergies be fed peanuts starting between 4 and 6 months, the new york times reports. That, the times notes, runs counter to the world health organization recommendation that babies consume only breast milk for the first six months of life. The new guidelines do recommend that infants that already have an egg allergy or eczema be evaluated by an allergist before peanuts are introduced. And early introduction of other commonly allergenic foods — such as eggs, yogurt, sesame, whitefish, and wheat — may also prevent allergies, according to a king's college london study that found just 2.4 % of kids who ate those foods on a regular basis developed an allergy. Of kids who were fed only breast milk in their first six months, more than 7 % developed allergies.",

Now an israeli-born filmmaker's documentary about the attack, set to air on bbc4 on sunday and at a new york screening on march 9, reveals the internal workings of the men accused in singh's assault and death, as well as those of other rapists and even the attorneys defending them, the guardian reports. What leslee udwin uncovered for india's daughter — which she had hoped would answer the question \" why do men rape? \" — was shocking, and indicative of an overall \" lack of respect of gender, \" she says. Some of the film's chilling responses, as per the guardian: a 34-year-old man serving time for raping a 5-year-old showed no remorse during udwin's interview, she says. After hearing the agonizing details about his attack on the child, udwin asks, \" how could you do something so terrible that would ruin a child's life? \" his reply: \" she was a beggar girl, her life was of no value. \" a central focus of udwin's film is mukesh singh, the driver of the bus on which jyoti singh was terrorized. \" you can't clap with one hand — it takes two hands, \" he explains to udwin in his jailhouse interview. \" a decent girl won't roam around at night. A girl is more responsible for rape than a boy … about 20 % of girls are good. \" the bus driver also has strong feelings on gender roles. \" boy and girl are not equal, \" he says, per the telegraph. \" housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes. \" singh goes on to mention, per the guardian, that jyoti fought her attackers and says, \" she should just be silent and allow the rape. Then they would have dropped her off after'doing her ' and only hit the boy [ jyoti's companion ]. \" singh warns that putting him and other rapists to death for their crimes would create a backlash against women. \" the death penalty will make things even more dangerous for girls, \" he says, per the telegraph. \" before, they would rape and say, ' leave her, she won't tell anyone.

        "summary": "Scientist already knew that new orleans was sinking. But a new study finds that the big easy and its environs are losing elevation ( a process called subsidence ) at a faster rate than previously thought — some two inches per year near the mississippi river and in industrial areas, and more than an inch-and-a-half in the upper and lower ninth ward, the christian science monitor reports. The weather channel sums up the issue: \" when a city already sits below sea level, any additional sinking is a cause for major concern. \" the new information was collected between 2009 and 2012 using radar images taken from an aircraft flying the same route year after year, per the advocate. Scientists from nasa's jet propulsion laboratory, ucla, and lsu participated. Their findings were published this month in the journal of geophysical research. The new data will help planners more effectively reverse the effects of subsidence, thus \" improving the long-term coastal resiliency and sustainability of new orleans, \" says lead author cathleen jones, per phys.org. \" the more recent land elevation change rates from this study will be used to inform flood modeling and response strategies, improving public safety. \" previous data was collected with lower resolution radar, the csm notes, and didn't provide the full picture of subsidence in the region. The sinking is, in large part, caused by pumping groundwater and surface water. Earth being weighed down by deposited sediments, as well as removal of oil and gas, also play a role. A rise in sea levels ( some three inches since 1992 ) also is a factor. \" people need to understand that the planet is not only changing, it's changed, \" a nasa scientist says.

        "summary": "One of the toughest plants in the world to grow is one that you may have think you've eaten — but probably haven't. That plant is wasabi, and the bbc reports on one man's quest to do what so many others in north america have failed at: effectively farm it on a commercial scale. Japan's rocky riverbeds are the natural habitat of the plant, and farmers looking to cultivate it in the west have faced two significant obstacles: as a washington state horticulture professor explains, wasabi is grown in water beds, a method of farming that's not typically used here. But even planting the seed is a challenge, because they're just so tough to access. In the case of pacific coast wasabi owner brian oates, it took him six years to get his hands on \" viable \" ones. Once he did, in 1993, the challenges didn't end: humidity and finding the right nutrients were issues, and, once he tried to expand the scale of his crop, disease became an issue. He finally arrived at a methodology for growing wasabi on a commercial scale — a trade secret that he's since sold to a handful of farmers who operate in a franchisee-like manner. They pay $ 70,000 to oates, then invest as much as $ 700,000 an acre to bring their crop to life — eventually. As the telegraph reported in a look at wasabi farming, the plant takes two years to grow. But with success comes profit: a pound of wasabi fetches about $ 70; restaurants pay suppliers as much as twice that. But as for your experience with wasabi in a restaurant, well, you probably haven't had one. An estimated 95 % of japanese restaurants serve a paste of mustard, european horseradish, and food coloring in its stead, notes the bbc.",

The agency confirmed the dawn entered ceres ' orbit in the asteroid belt nestled between mars and jupiter, the ap reports. A nasa press release says the spacecraft was about 38,000 miles away from ceres when it was sucked in by the dwarf planet's gravity around 7: 39am; the agency's jet propulsion laboratory received a confirmation ping at 8: 36am that dawn was \" healthy and thrusting with its ion engine \" — a sure sign it achieved orbit. \" we feel exhilarated, \" says christopher russell, the spacecraft's lead investigator, per the release. Ceres wasn't the dawn's only stop on its 7.5-year, 3.1 billion-mile journey: from 2011 to 2012, the spacecraft poked around the vesta asteroid, making it the first spacecraft to orbit two extraterrestrial objects, nasa notes. This feat wouldn't have been possible without the high-powered, star wars-like ion engines that pushed the dawn over that massive distance with relatively little fuel, usa today notes. The ceres mission, which will last until at least mid-2016, will attempt to answer questions — about possible oceans, ice caps, or life — that have lurked since the dwarf planet was discovered in 1801. It's been \" like your secret neighbor. Ceres would tell us nothing, \" russell tells the paper. And vesta and ceres are just the start: the new horizons spacecraft is set to pass pluto over the summer, per the ap.

Obama's re-election and soon afterward, he could hardly stop talking with conservative senators and media power brokers about the chance to pass comprehensive immigration legislation. As early as march 9, 2011, mr. Schumer joined senator lindsey graham, republican of south carolina and another eventual member of the gang of eight, at the palm restaurant in manhattan, where they made their case to mr. Murdoch, mr. Ailes and mr. Limbaugh in a private room. The senators argued how damaging the word \"amnesty \" was to their efforts, and walked mr. Limbaugh through their vision for an immigration overhaul. The senators were especially eager to try to neutralize conservative media, which proved lethal to a big push for immigration changes in 2007. A study by the pew research center's project for excellence in journalism showed that conservative news shows had devoted about a quarter of their time to immigration. In late 2012, after mitt romney, the republican nominee, lost the presidential election in part because of his dismal performance with latino voters, mr. Rubio joined the fight. On one sunday alone in april 2013, he made an appearance on seven talk shows to advocate the immigration overhaul,",

The brothers were last spotted monday driving a 2002 gold acura in california near the mexican border, according to police. Back in 2013, shunn told police that john reed threatened \" to shoot or assault \" the couple after they cut some brush between their properties, an affidavit reads. More recently, reed became incensed when patenaude told a county official that he was squatting on his former property, which he had sold to the county, police say. During a 2014 landslide in oso, however, shunn and patenaude \" risked everything just to run down and see if ( john ) was ok, \" a friend tells q13, adding it's incomprehensible \" to think that he would take their lives. \" police say a shell casing was found near a gate between the two properties, while \" dried blood \" was found around the bathtub of john reed's former residence.",

Such was the case in egypt, where in 2011 a popular uprising forced one of the region's longest-serving and most influential leaders, pres. Ḥosnī mub�?rak, from power. The first demonstrations occurred in tunisia in december 2010, triggered by the self-immolation of a young man frustrated by tunisia's high unemployment rate and rampant police corruption. Rallies calling for pres. Zine al-abidine ben ali to step down spread throughout the country, with police often resorting to violence to control the crowds. As clashes between police and protesters escalated, ben ali announced a series of economic and political reforms in an unsuccessful attempt to end the unrest. Demonstrations continued, forcing ben",

Previous research suggests that deontological judgments are shaped by affective processes, whereas utilitarian judgments are guided by cognitive processes. The current research used process dissociation ( pd ) to independently assess deontological and utilitarian inclinations in women and men. A meta-analytic re-analysis of 40 studies with 6,100 participants indicated that men showed a stronger preference for utilitarian over deontological judgments than women when the two principles implied conflicting decisions ( d = 0.52 ). Pd further revealed that women exhibited stronger deontological inclinations than men"

A bill waiting for the governor's signature would cut the maximum number of weeks people could get benefits from the state from 26 to 23. It would also put into place an unprecedented sliding scale: as the unemployment rate dropped, so, too, would the number of weeks people could draw. If it dipped below 5 %, for example, people could get a maximum of 12 weeks of benefits, notes cnn. The only way people could get the full 23 weeks is if the rate is 10.5 % or higher. Florida has one of the highest jobless rates in the nation at 11.1 %, and critics say lawmakers are piling on with the bill, which also seeks to toughen eligibility and job-search requirements. But one defender sees it as necessary. \" it gives the message that florida is trying to become the most business-friendly state in the country, \" says gop rep. Doug holder.

The most floridians could get is 23 weeks, if the unemployment rate is 10.5 % or higher. The state's unemployment rate stood at 11.1 % in march, the third highest in the nation.

General assembly on thursday overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of a sovereign palestinian state after palestinian president mahmoud abbas called on the world body to issue its long overdue \" birth certificate. \" there were 138 votes in favor, nine against and 41 abstentions. Three countries did not take part in the vote to upgrade the palestinian authority's observer status at the united nations to \" non-member state \" from \" entity. \" the assembly approved the upgrade despite threats by the united states and israel to punish the palestinians by withholding funds for the west bank government. U.n. Envoys said israel might avoid harsh retaliation as long as the palestinians did not seek to join the international criminal court. The much-anticipated vote came after abbas denounced israel for its \" aggressive policies and the perpetration of war crimes \" from the u.n. Podium, remarks that elicited a furious response from the jewish state. \" sixty-five years ago on this day, the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 181, which partitioned the land of historic palestine into two states and became the birth certificate for israel, \" abbas told the 193-nation assembly after receiving a standing ovation. \" the general assembly is called upon today to issue a birth certificate of the reality of the state of palestine, \" he said. Israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu responded quickly",

General assembly on thursday overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of a sovereign palestinian state after palestinian president mahmoud abbas called on the world body to issue its long overdue \" birth certificate. \" there were 138 votes in favor, nine against and 41 abstentions. Three countries did not take part in the vote to upgrade the palestinian authority's observer status at the united nations to \" non-member state \" from \" entity. \" the assembly approved the upgrade despite threats by the united states and israel to punish the palestinians by withholding funds for the west bank government. U.n. Envoys said israel might avoid harsh retaliation as long as the palestinians did not seek to join the international criminal court. The much-anticipated vote came after abbas denounced israel for its \" aggressive policies and the perpetration of war crimes \" from the u.n. Podium, remarks that elicited a furious response from the jewish state. \" sixty-five years ago on this day, the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 181, which partitioned the land of historic palestine into two states and became the birth certificate for israel, \" abbas told the 193-nation assembly after receiving a standing ovation. \" the general assembly is called upon today to issue a birth certificate of the reality of the state of palestine, \" he said. Israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu responded quickly",
            "Washington — after failing to head off a vote in the united nations on thursday that would upgrade the palestinian authority's status, the united states and israel are looking ahead to how they can contain the damage from the approval of a resolution that even some european allies have signaled they will support. The draft resolution calls on the united nations general assembly to upgrade the palestinian authority to a nonmember observer state. It is virtually certain to pass, despite the opposition of the united states and a handful of other nations. On wednesday, two senior american diplomats — william j. Burns, the deputy secretary of state, and david hale, the special envoy to the middle east — met at a hotel in new york with the president of the palestinian authority, mahmoud abbas, to register american concerns. \"no one should be under any illusion that this resolution is going to produce the results that the palestinians claim to seek, namely to have their own state living in peace next to israel, \" victoria nuland, the state department spokeswoman, said wednesday. \"we thought it was important to make our case one more time. \" a major concern for the americans is that the palestinians might use their new status to try to join the international criminal court. That prospect particularly worries the israelis, who fear that the palestinians might"

        "summary": "Mayonnaise has standards, as its many and rabid devotees will tell you, and hellmann's is going to bat for those standards: set in its legal crosshairs is a product called just mayo, which, contends hellmann's parent company unilever, is not mayonnaise at all. Problem? just mayo — in an attempt to use plant-based ingredients instead of, oh, say, ingredients that may or may not come before the chicken — uses yellow peas instead of eggs. That makes it a spread, says hellmann's, but to call it \" mayonnaise \" is false advertising. As the new york times reports, the fda defines mayonnaise as an emulsion of vegetable oil, either vinegar or lemon juice, and eggs. ( see also: kraft miracle whip, which doesn't meet the minimum percentage of vegetable oil outlined by the fda, and has long had to market itself as a spread or salad dressing. ) which is where it all gets a little murky, notes the wall street journal: just mayo's parent company, hampton creek, is branding its product as \" mayo, \" not \" mayonnaise, \" and it's trumpeting the lack of egg rather than trying to pull one over on consumers. But just mayo's label does contain the image of an egg, the times notes; unilever is suing for hampton creek to kill the egg image, cough up three times its profits in damages, and cover unilever's legal fees. The mayo throwdown underlines shifting american tastes, as well as aging or archaic definitions of traditional food categories: the times cites one lawyer/food blogger, who writes that \" it's not hampton creek's fault if its innovation is outpacing federal regulations, \" which in this case date back to 1957.

Their answers regarding sleep habits, mental illness, and medications allowed researchers to pinpoint some risk factors, including sleep disorders, alcoholism, ptsd, antidepressants, and too much or too little sleep. About 30 % reported being \" sleep drunk \" for 15 minutes or longer after waking, which raises concern about workers who nap on the job — or, say, pilots and doctors. \" you can hurt yourself physically, \" and hurt someone else, ohayon tells cnn.

Further, if a president did nothing because \" 80 % of ( the public was ) against it... You'd look like a total wuss, \" said clinton. \" we shouldn't over-learn the lessons of the past. I don't think syria is necessarily iraq or afghanistan, \" clinton said, likening the situation more to ronald reagan's afghan intervention, and stressing that \" nobody is asking for american soldiers in syria. \" as for polling, when the public tells \" you 'no ' in these situations, very often what they're doing is flashing a giant yellow light and saying, 'for god's sakes, be careful...

The guardian reports that furie, the cartoonist who created the amphibian character that was appropriated by the alt-right in internet memes, killed off pepe the frog to coincide with free comic book day on sunday. Furie — who said in an october youtube video that the hijacking of pepe \" melts my spirit \" — decided that, despite his best efforts, he couldn't reclaim pepe after white supremacists and a contingent of president trump supporters ( and even trump himself ) embraced pepe as their own, earning the \" sad frog \" a place on the anti-defamation league's list of hate symbols. And so furie worked up a panel showing his \" chill frog \" in a casket, a smiling memorial photo by the coffin's side. Furie created pepe in 2005 as a character for his boy's club series, and he described the frog as an extension of himself, \" a chilled-out frog who likes to eat snacks and talk on the phone, smoke weed, \" and who had the same \" heavy eyelids \" and \" laid-back nature \" as furie himself. Publisher fantagraphics books had joined furie in his mission to take back pepe from nefarious corners of the internet, noting pepe is a \" peaceful cartoon amphibian who represents love, acceptance, and fun. ( and getting stoned. ) \" but some say the effort was futile from the start, with comic book resources noting it would've been difficult for furie to work up new pepe cartoons knowing some could be viewing the frog through \" tinted lenses. \" \" pepe's soul has returned to his creator.

John, 70, was initially reluctant to enter the cold water, but he jumped in after the flames ignited both the neighbors ' home and a tree next to the pool.

When they emerged, they found that their home and the neighbors ' home had burned to the ground — and a phone jan had left in a sock next to the pool had melted.

        "summary": "New york times columnist ross douthat floats a controversial idea on sunday, one that he sees as a largely unaddressed aspect of the metoo movement — he wants to ban hard-core porn. His launching point is an article in the new york times magazine on how the ubiquitousness of porn is leading to a \"porn literacy \" movement whose advocates try to explain to teens that, no, those porn scenes are not a real-world guide on how the sexes should interact. Porn seemingly produces the kind of man the metoo movement has sprang up against, one \" shaped by unprecedented possibilities for sexual gratification and frustrated that real women are less available and more complicated than the version on their screen, \" writes douthat. Critics will see any kind of a ban as unacceptable censorship, but douthat doesn't buy the argument. Porn, after all, is \" just a product — something made and distributed and sold, and therefore subject to regulation and restriction if we so desire. \" reducing the availability of the hard-core stuff could go a long way in reducing its power over shaping the libidos of the younger generation in all the wrong ways, he argues. We don't have to go along with every aspect of how tech is taking over our lives, and the \" moral stakes \" involved with porn make it an opportunity to prove that point. \" feminists should take it. We should all take it. It is not only decency but eros itself that waits to be regained. \" read the full column.",

        "summary": "The first movie adapted from one of thomas pynchon's novels, inherent vice will feature slapstick humor and starring turns from joaquin phoenix, josh brolin, and reese witherspoon — and, apparently, a top-secret cameo by the reclusive pynchon himself, the new york times reports. And while it may seem that getting confirmation of the hermitlike pynchon's surprise appearance is as elusive as the author himself, at least one of the film's co-stars has something to say about it, even if no one else does: paul thomas anderson, the movie's director, definitely isn't giving anything up: when interrogated by logan hill of the times about the supposed cameo, he replied: \" i ' m staying out of it! … somebody spent a long time deciding not to have themselves out there. There's a reason for that. So i ' m just going to step out of that. \" and a rep for pynchon's publisher curtly responded: \" mr. Pynchon is not giving any interviews at this time. \" but brolin offered a more revealing answer: \" i don't think anybody knew [ pynchon was on the set ]. … he came on as the kind of mercurial iconoclast he is. He stayed in the corner. \" assuming pynchon does actually flash across the screen, that still doesn't answer the astute question posed by vulture: \" if nobody knows what you look like, does it count as a cameo? \" inherent vice is set for mass release dec. 12 and debuts oct. 4 at the new york film festival. ( initial reviews in 2009 of inherent vice called it pynchon's most accessible novel to date. )",

This \" is not an indication of any imminent danger, \" says county executive steve stenger. And the landfill's operator, republic services, says safeguards ( like structures that grab gasses from below the surface ) exist to separate the waste from the blaze. The landfill \" is safe and intensively monitored, \" says a spokesman. Yet the emergency plan notes that flames could reach the nuclear waste and send radioactive smoke over communities near the main st. Louis airport \" with little or no warning. \" and a state lawsuit against republic services claimed that pollutants and radiation are already spreading from the site, the missouri times reported last month. What's more, expert-witness reports released by attorney general koster claim the blaze is moving closer to the waste. The landfill itself is part of a bigger history, city lab reports, harking back to \" the lethal legacy of uranium processing \" around st. Louis as part of the manhattan project during the second world war. As for the fire, its cause is unknown, but it's not alone: nearly 100 such blazes are burning in mines across nine us states, and one has burned in a pennsylvania town dump for over 50 years.

Officials say that after the national geospatial-intelligence agency employee lost control of the quadcopter a few blocks from the president's home, he told friends he worried it had gone down on the white house grounds and contacted his employer and the secret service the next day when he realized it had caused a major security scare. The nga says the employee is \" not involved in work related to drones or unmanned aerial vehicles in any capacity \" at the agency and even though he \" was using a personal item while off duty, the agency takes the incident very seriously and remains committed to promoting public trust and transparency, \" reports nbc. It's not clear what, if any, disciplinary measures the employee will face. In a cnn interview yesterday, president obama said that while drones have \" incredibly useful functions, \" there needs to be some kind of regulation in place. He noted that the one that landed on the white grounds is one \" you buy in radio shack. \"",

        "summary": "Edith fox says she's \" afraid people are forgetting, \" which spurred the 90-year-old to do something she hasn't done in more than 70 years: recount her holocaust story of survival. First appearing in the arizona daily star in november, her account was on saturday shared by the buffalo news — that being the city she ended up in after immigrating from germany. The czechoslovakia native survived for years in auschwitz, but the horrors of her ordeal weren't relegated to its grounds. They started in 1941, when as a 13-year-old she and her family were taken by the nazis to poland, under the false promise of getting a home there. Instead, upon arriving, the nazis told them to run and cut down those who were too slow. \" they killed my mother right in front of me, \" says fox. She implored the nazis to kill her, too. Instead they put her and her friend leah to work in a polish ghetto. The girls ended up hiding in the chimney of a furnace for at least two days after the nazis came for everyone. She was later captured and sent to auschwitz, where she \" saw too many things. Some people couldn't take it anymore and ran into the electrified fence to kill themselves. They just went up in flames. \" in the final months of the war, she was put on a dangerously packed train and ultimately decided she'd rather brave the january snows than get trampled on the train. She jumped and ran, hitting a tree and flattening her nose in the process. She eventually found a czech soldier and was \" so happy. \" but it was simply a nazi in that uniform and she was captured once more. Read her full story, which explains how she ended up in buffalo and later tucson, here.",

She ended up in buffalo, where she met her husband, joseph. They raised three children here. Fox now lives in tucson, ariz.

        "summary": "It wasn't the best of news cycles on monday for president trump, who will presumably be displeased with negative headlines on multiple fronts. The biggest: fbi chief james comey told congress that he sees no evidence to support trump's claims that president obama wiretapped him. Plus, comey confirmed that the fbi is investigating possible links between russia and the trump campaign during the election. Also making news: low numbers: the daily tracking poll at gallup has trump's job-approval rating at 37 %, his lowest mark so far, and his disapproval rating rose to 58 %. It's being chalked up to controversy over his wiretapping comments and opposition to the gop health care plan, reports cnn. Net worth: forbes says trump's net worth has fallen $ 200 million since he took office to $ 3.5 billion. That drops him 220 spots to 544 in its ranking of the world's richest people. Trump's decline, however, isn't about politics but about the new york real estate market. Stephen hawking: the famed physicist said in an interview that he's not sure he'd be welcome in america under trump because of his opposing views on the environment. See story. Billboard: an anti-trump billboard in phoenix is making headlines thanks in part to its dollar-shaped swastikas, per fox news. Loyalty: the washington post has an unflattering front-page story about the white house that says it has installed senior aides in cabinet departments whose main job is to monitor the loyalty of trump's secretaries. Propublica also reported elements of the story here. Presidents obama, george w. Bush, and clinton did not use such a system. Happier news: not all the news was negative, however. The president is going to be a grandfather again — son eric and his wife, lara, are expecting their first child. Trump already is a grandfather of eight, per us weekly.",

While ckd affects more than 20 million in the us, here it's most prevalent in those over 70. But in central america, \" it seems to be disproportionately affecting young, healthy males, \" says an expert. \" and that's one of the tip-offs that something odd is going on. \" exact, reliable death rates aren't available, the verge notes, but it's so bad that one community, la isla, is now called la isla de las viudas — \" the island of widows. \" in nicaragua and el salvador, the ckd death rate among men is five times what it was 20 years ago. A number of theories have been put forward to explain the situation: it may be caused by dehydration among field workers, particularly when combined with their habit of chewing sugar cane while working. There are also concerns about chemicals used in the fields. Last month saw a protest calling for employers to pay workers ' medical bills.

A new dna analysis of remains from several people, dating back thousands of years, may settle the question — as well as provide a better sense of where the irish came from. Reporting this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, geneticists from trinity college dublin and archaeologists from queen's university belfast sequenced the genomes of a 5,200-year-old female farmer buried near belfast and three men found on rathlin island who hail from the bronze age between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago, after metalworking was introduced. The analysis reveals that the irish have distinct genetic variants from the middle east and what would become parts of russia and eastern europe, per a press release. Specifically, the early farmer was mainly of near eastern origin, while the men's ancestry came in part from ancient sources in the pontic steppe of southern russia. As the guardian puts it, \" the emergence of agriculture and the advance of metallurgy were not just culture shifts: they came with new blood. An earlier population of hunter gatherers was successively overwhelmed by new arrivals. And in ireland, these new settlers began to define a nation. \" geneticist dan bradley frames it in a similarly poetic manner: \" there was a great wave of genome change that swept into europe from above the black sea into bronze age europe and we now know it washed all the way to the shores of its most westerly island. \" ( the lowly snail has also revealed secrets of ireland's origins. )",

        "summary": "Once or twice a year recently, the federal government threatens to shut down. But the washington post reports this year's version of the crisis — the deadline to pass a spending bill is midnight april 28 — has a brand-new wrinkle: president trump. According to the new yorker, things had been going pretty well to avoid a government shutdown, with republicans and democrats negotiating toward a compromise bill. Then on friday, white house budget director mick mulvaney said either the bill includes trump's border wall and defense spending increase or it must defund a major part of the affordable care act. ( interestingly, mulvaney was also involved in the last government shutdown in october 2013, which also hinged on defunding the aca. ) the problem now is that even if democrats and republicans in congress reach a compromise that allows them to pass a spending bill, there's no guarantee trump will sign it. For example, democrats don't want the border wall built, and conservative republicans aren't too keen on paying for it either. Adding to the uncertainty, the deadline to avoid the shutdown falls on trump's 100th day in office, and he could be desperate for a big win by the deadline. The new yorker reports one top white house official actually \" sounded excited \" by the prospect of a shutdown. For his part, trump says he thinks \" we're in good shape \" to avoid a shutdown, according to forbes. And here's the kicker: even if a spending bill somehow gets passed, it only funds the government through september.",

Some of the cars, including a 2009 zr1 \" blue devil \" that landed on its wheels, seem to be in remarkably good shape, chevrolet spokesman monte doran said in a telephone interview. Other cars are covered with rubble, making it tough to assess the damage or estimate the cost of repairs, doran said. The cars are significant in automotive history and gm wants to restore as many as possible, mark reuss, executive vice president of gm global product development, said in a statement. Before that can happen, the cars must be pulled from the sinkhole that opened in the \" skydome \" area of the museum. The museum reopened on thursday, but the skydome"

The dallas news last week reported that more than 6,600 texas inmates donated $ 53,863 to harvey relief efforts between aug. 31 and sept. 30. That averages to $ 8 per inmate, with each pulling the money from his or her commissary fund, which is the account used to buy everything from personal hygiene items to snacks. The new york times calls it \" an astonishing sum, \" as balances on many accounts sit below $ 5. Mashable reports the accounts can be funded through relatives or friends, or through the wages an inmate's prison job pays. The donation wasn't an unprecedented move: the times reports texas inmates wanted to do something in the wake of hurricane katrina, and the state department of criminal justice came up with the commissary-donation route.

As the wall street journal points out, the competition for fastest computer is a point of pride among computer scientists, and the us has not held the top spot since november 2012. China has been the frontrunner for the last two years. The summit supercomputer, which cost about $ 200 million, takes up the floor space of about two tennis courts and can deliver up to 200 quadrillion calculations per second — or 200 petaflops, reports wired. To put it in perspective, that's about as fast as \" 7.6 billion people doing 26 million calculations per second on a hand calculator, \" per cnet. Built by ibm, it will be used by the government, academics, and industry researchers to solve problems in myriad scientific areas. One of summit's first projects will involve developing treatments for heart disease, alzheimer's disease, and opioid addiction. It will also be used to study exploding stars, known as supernovas. It could be used for oil exploration, weapons development, climate research, and for cracking encryption codes. But it may not be in the top spot for long. By 2020, analysts believe that china will have a supercomputer capable of performing more than 1 million trillion calculations ( or exaflops ) per second, which is considered a holy grail in supercomputing, reports the journal. \" that will cause a certain amount of political gnashing of teeth, \" says a computer analyst.",

The alert is in response to messages found spray painted on a rock that is well-known campus landmark. In addition to the messages; \"france deserves destruction \" \"ysu supports isis, \" and \"we are coming for you \" there was also writing that appeared to be arabic text painted on the rock. Campus maintenance crews were quick to cover the messages with paint, but not before some images of the messages could be distributed over social media.

        "summary": "In 1991, steve feltham said sayonara to his girlfriend, home, and job in england to hunt for the loch ness monster in scotland. His big revelation after 24 years of searching: the beast is probably a catfish — though a big one, obviously. Feltman, 52, has spent much of the last quarter century living in a converted \" mobile library \" in a carpark near loch ness in the hope of catching a glimpse of the alleged creature, report reuters and the scotsman. His efforts have now led him to conclude that various sightings of said monster were probably of a wels catfish. The fish were introduced into the loch in the victorian era and can grow up to 13 feet long. \" i just don't think that nessie is a prehistoric monster, \" says feltham, who holds a guinness world record for the longest continuous monster watch on the loch. \" what a lot of people have reported seeing would fit in with the description of the catfish with its long curved back. \" feltman says his theory explains why nessie sightings picked up in the 1930s. Of course, the mystery began well before then. In the 6th century, irish monk st. Columba was said to have exiled a \" water beast \" to the river ness. What of the famous 1934 surgeon's photo apparently showing a beast's head sticking out of the water? it actually shows a fake monster head fixed to a toy submarine, as disappointed hunters discovered 60 years later. So does feltham feel like the last 24 years of his life were wasted? \" never, not for one second, \" he says. \" i ' m in my utopia living here on the shores of the loch, \" he tells sky news. And he may spend another 10 years probing the case. \" i ' m not saying the mystery's solved... I ' m still looking for a better explanation. \" ( read about another secret of loch ness. )",

From june to november, some 1,300 members of afghan security forces were killed in helmand province alone, and a local hospital remained nearly full even after the customary fighting season ended. Many civilians have also been treated at the hospital, including 940 women and children through october. \" this year is much worse than previous years, \" says a medical official. Indeed, over the course of the year, the country has seen some 5,000 security-force deaths, a record, the times reports. Civilian deaths have also hit a record high, and total civilian casualties are poised to pass 10,000 for the year, reuters reports. The un says three-quarters of the 3,188 civilians killed through november were killed by insurgents, a figure the taliban calls \" biased and unfounded, \" reuters notes. Meanwhile, the country has seen increased corruption and declines in government services since the us departed. \" our own commanders sell our bullets to the taliban instead of giving them to us, and then they buy a nice house in lashkar gah and stay there, leaving the little guys out there to do the fighting, \" says a wounded police officer. But the afghan forces are still \" holding on, \" the times notes, and an afghan official says 151 taliban members have been killed in 12 days of fighting near the pakistani border, the ap reports.",

The idea is that by staying up to cram or write relentlessly, you ' ll get a better grade. Better grades mean you're smart, right? maybe so, but according to a new study by swedish researchers, staying up all night can have serious, negative effects on the health of the brain. The research comes from uppsala university, who conducted the small study. \"we observed that a night of total sleep loss was followed by increased blood concentrations of nse and s-100b. These brain molecules typically rise in blood under conditions of brain damage. Thus, our results indicate that a lack of sleep may promote neurodegenerative processes, \" said christian benedict, a sleep researcher at uppsala's department of neuroscience. 15 normal weight, otherwise healthy young men were recruited for the study. They spent two nights in the lab, during one of which they were deprived of sleep. They slept a normal eight hours the other night. Before and after each night, the men volunteered blood samples, from which scientists measured levels of the brain molecules neuron-specific enolase ( nse ) and s100 calcium binding protein b ( s-100b ).

        "summary": "It's a safe bet this will end up being monday's strangest twist in the robert mueller investigation: politico explains how the unrelated case of a professor who disappeared in 1956 could prevent mueller from making his report public. It takes some unpacking: more than six decades ago, a columbia university professor and political activist named jesus galindez went missing, and a leading theory is that he was kidnapped, brought to the dominican republic, and murdered. ( sound hollywood-esque? see the 2003 film the galindez file. ) attorney and author stuart mckeever has been digging into the case, and he wants a judge to release testimony given to a grand jury that investigated the professor's disappearance. And that brings us to the mueller connection. Such testimony is usually kept secret, and an appeals court is expected to rule next month whether judges have a right to release it to the public. If the court sides with the justice department and says the testimony must remain under wraps, the same principle could apply to mueller: he might not be legally able to publish his report, which draws from grand jury testimony. The story notes that if democrats win control of the house in november, it's largely a moot point, because the house judiciary panel could subpoena the report as part of an impeachment inquiry. But if the gop retains control, the precedent becomes an issue. \"it is a sleeper case, \" says harvard professor alex whiting, and it could \" have potentially enormous implications for the future of the information from the mueller investigation. \" read the full story by josh gerstein at politico.",

More on the rationale and reaction, from the guardian and ap: \" the stabilizing part played by the european union has helped to transform a once-torn europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace, \" says nobel committee chairman thorbjoern jagland. \" this goes to show the norwegians really do have a sense of humor, \" says the leader of the uk independence party. \"the nobel committee is a little late for an april fool's joke, \" says european parliament member martin callanan. \"the eu's policies have exacerbated the fallout of the financial crisis and led to social unrest that we haven't seen for a generation. \" the nobel's jagland defended the latter point: \"there are many things to say about the economic crisis — where it originated for instance.

        "summary": "There are far more questions than answers in the disappearance of journalist kim wall, who hasn't been heard from since she boarded peter madsen's now-sunken submarine thursday night on denmark's refshaleoen island. The sub has since been raised, and wall's body wasn't in it. Madsen isn't contesting a court decision to keep him in custody for up to 24 days as danish police investigate, and while he has been charged with killing wall by unknown means, his lawyer has denied he had anything to do with her vanishing. The local quotes a sunday press conference with the copenhagen police deputy chief inspector, who said madsen's story has changed, from initially telling officials he dropped wall off at 10: 30pm thursday night on the island to another unspecified explanation since. The guardian reports madsen says they spent about three hours on his nautilus sub, the largest privately made one in the world at the time of its 2008 launch; the swedish journalist, who divides her time between new york and beijing, was doing a profile on madsen. The local also picks up a report from a swedish tabloid that cites a witness who said madsen's sub was seen sailing without its lights on some two hours before wall's partner reported the vessel as missing around 2: 30am friday. \" there was very nearly a collision \" between the sub and a freighter, per the witness. The washington post describes wall as accomplished — the london school of economics and columbia university grad wrote for the new york times, guardian, and atlantic, among others — and recounts her travels to pyongyang, sri lanka, and the marshall islands for stories.",

        "summary": "An asian-american rock band called the slants found itself on the winning side of a supreme court case monday. The justices ruled that a 71-year-old trademark law barring disparaging terms infringes free speech rights. The ruling is a victory for the slants, but the case was closely watched for the impact it would have on the separate dispute involving the washington redskins in their legal fight over the team name. Slants founder simon tam tried to trademark the band name in 2011, insisting he wanted to transform a derisive term into a statement of pride, but the us patent and trademark office denied the request on the ground that it disparages asians. A federal appeals court in washington later said the law barring offensive trademarks is unconstitutional; the prior administration then appealed, reports usa today. The redskins made similar arguments after the trademark office ruled in 2014 that the name offends american indians and canceled the team's trademark. A federal appeals court in richmond put the team's case on hold while waiting for the supreme court to rule in the slants case, reports the ap. Forbes calls the ruling \" great \" for the team.
