Researchers looked at more than 16,000 british adults over a 13-year period, and found that those who slept for an hour or more during the day were almost a third more likely to die prematurely, the daily mail reports. Specifically, they were more likely to die from lung diseases, and researchers say napping could contribute to respiratory ailments by triggering inflammation in the body. However, the researchers note that napping may simply be an early sign that your health is in danger, rather than the cause of the problem, the independent notes. In fact, one expert who did not take part in the study suggests, in people with serious lung problems, the naps \" may not have hastened death but delayed it. \" and he notes that the findings show that 85 % of people who napped less than one hour a day were at no higher risk of a premature death than non-nappers.

            "Updated: jun 24, 2016 - 9: 45 am st. Petersburg, fla. - a second body has been recovered as crews continue to search the gulf of mexico for a family missing off the coast of southwest florida, the u.s. Coast guard said. A coast guard news release said cape coral fire and rescue found the body thursday morning, about four miles from where the first body was found wednesday. Authorities have not released the identity of either. The coast guard has also found debris from the boat, and thursday received a report of a sailboat mast seen in the search area. The mast sighting was investigated but turned out to be crab and fishing equipment, not the missing sailboat, the coast guard said. Picture of kimberly family missing off florida coast near sanibel island. © 2016 cox media group. Crews have been searching for 45-year-old ace kimberly and his three children, roger kimberly, 13, donny kimberly, 15, and rebecca kimberly, 17, since the family left sarasota on sunday, heading to fort myers in a 29-foot sailboat. They were last heard from sunday evening when kimberly contacted his brother and said they were experiencing \" 6-foot waves and thunderstorms. \" crews of a rescue boat and helicopter reported seeing a flare rise from the ocean for about three seconds at about 2: 30 a.m. Thursday, u.s. Coast guard spokesman captain gregory case said. \" one of our response boats from station cortes and a helicopter saw what they believed to be a flare rise for three seconds within the search area, \" case said. \" at 8: 15 a.m. This morning, one of our response boats from fort myers recovered a bucket in the debris area that contained birth certificates, gps, wallet, cellphone, cigarettes, a pool noodle and a tool box, \" said case. The bucket was located about 5.5 miles from the area where searchers found a body the day before, he said. Debris was found floating about 33 miles off the coast of sanibel island wednesday before the coast guard found the first body in a life jacket floating in the area of the search. Case would not confirm the identity of the body found during the search, but family member sadie ditts told a national news outlet that it was her niece, rebecca kimberly. Dilts said in the telephone interview that rebecca kimberly's body was found about 44",

        "summary": "Archaeologists have found one of the biggest raptors ever, one that used to roam what is now hell creek in south dakota. Hence, the name: dakotaraptor. Discover reports that this beast was about 16 feet long with sickle-like claws of nearly 10 inches, making it one of the largest raptors known to exist. More formally, it's a dromaeosaurid, but the lawrence journal-world out of kansas provides a more down-to-earth description of these bird relatives: a \" massive, freaky-looking carnivorous dinosaur-bird. \" researchers found the partial skeleton in what's known as the hell creek formation, rocks rich in fossil specimens, and date it to about 66 million years ago. \" this cretaceous period raptor would have been lightly built and probably just as agile as the vicious smaller theropods, such as the velociraptor, \" says the lead author of the paper in a release from kansas university. Dakotaraptor would have been too big to fly, but it seems to have had feathers — its forearms had what researchers call \" quill knobs \" where feathers would be attached. That would make it the largest dinosaur found to date with wings, notes discover. Another researcher speculates on the wings-but-no-flight quirk: \" either it evolved from an ancestor that could fly but had lost the ability to fly, like an ostrich, or dinosaurs evolved big quill-pen feathers for another reason, such as display or egg brooding. \" ( scientists had to use unusual means to salvage the skull of a rare baby dinosaur. )",

In his first tv interview since killing the model in his pretoria apartment on valentine's day 2013, the 29-year-old former olympian says he deserves a prison sentence but doesn't want to \" waste my life \" in jail. \" if i was afforded the opportunity of redemption i would like to help the less fortunate like i had in my past, \" he tells itv, per the guardian. \" i would like to believe that if reeva could look down upon me that she would want me to live that life. \" pistorius — who now faces a minimum sentence of 15 years for murder after his manslaughter conviction was upgraded — maintains that he was trying to protect steenkamp when he fired four shots into his bathroom door, fearing an intruder was on the other side. Prosecutors say he killed her in a jealous rage. Pistorius says he awoke to a noise in the bathroom and whispered for reeva to get on the ground and call police. \" before i knew it i'd fired four shots, \" he says. When he couldn't find steenkamp, pistorius says he broke down the door and found her dead. \" i ' m trying to pick her up but there's so much blood i can't stand up, \" he says. \" i can smell the blood. I can feel the warmness of it on my hands. \" the telegraph reports pistorius ' legal team was apparently against the interview, which contains \" moments of prolonged sobbing and even howling, \" per the guardian.

Its authors suggest that an epidemic that killed as many as 17 million people over the course of two outbreaks in the 16th century and had a hand in the elimination of the aztec empire may be due to salmonella. This after molecular paleopathologist kirsten bos with the max planck institute and her colleagues analyzed dna from the aforementioned teeth, which came from people buried in a cemetery in oaxaca, mexico. The researchers say the cemetery is tied to the initial 1545-1550 outbreak through \" historical and archaeological evidence. \" phys.org says it's actually the only cemetery to be associated with the outbreak. But it wasn't just the teeth that were key. As npr explains, it was a new algorithm that bos explains \" offers a method of analyzing many, many, many small dna fragments that we get, and actually identifying, by species name, the bacteria that are represented. \" so running the teeth's dna fragments through the computer program enabled them to eventually land on the salmonella enterica paratyphi c bacteria, \" a bacterial cause of enteric fever \" that also spurs dehydration and gastro-intestinal issues, per the study. What the study doesn't do is shed light on where the bacteria may have come from. One unaffiliated researcher called it a \" super-cool study \" in comments to nature upon the preprint release of some findings in february, but one evolutionary geneticist expressed skepticism, noting that if the culprit was a virus, rather than bacteria, the algorithm wouldn't have been able to spot it.

        "summary": "\" who ever loved, that loved not at first sight? \" so asked poet christopher marlowe some 500 years ago, and now social scientists say they've got a scientific answer to the romantic notion that attraction is instant. It turns out that people who started dating within a month of meeting tend to be similarly attractive, while those who knew each other longer or were friends first tended to be less similar in their level of attraction, the researchers report this month in the journal psychological science. The 167 couples ( 100 of them married ) had been together as little as three months and as long as 53 years, and attraction was assessed by a panel of judges watching video of participants being interviewed. The conclusion is that the better we get to know someone, the better equipped we are to assess that person's desirability based on a range of features, not just physical ones, they report in a press release. This is called \" mate value, \" and not surprisingly, it evolves over time and can lead to \" slow love, \" as one researcher puts it. In fact, in a 2012 match.com survey, a third of men and nearly half of women say they've fallen in love with someone they didn't first find attractive. \" everyone is terrified that online dating is reducing mate value to just a few superficial things like beauty — whether you swipe left or right on tinder, \" an anthropologist tells the new york times. \" but that's just the start of the process. Once you meet someone and get to know them, their mate value keeps changing. \" ( one dating site attempts to take attraction to a genetic level. )",

The government says 250 children from elementary to high-school levels killed themselves in 2017, a slight uptick from the year before in a nation already grappling with high suicide rates. Most of the children left no notes, but those who did often worried about life after graduation, while others cited bullying and family issues. Japanese officials have already noted a rise in suicides after sept. 1, when children return to school. \" the long break from school enables you to stay at home, so it's heaven for those who are bullied, \" a former bullying victim in japan told cnn a few years ago. \" when summer ends, you have to go back. \" experts say the nation's stigma about mental health issues doesn't help. There are also changes in family life, which used to include several generations under one roof — an arrangement less common today. \" we can't expect parents or grandparents to provide the support they used to, \" a professor says. \" and in this situation, children remain alone. \" japan pledged in 2016 to cut suicides by 30 %, particularly among young people, but officials say it can be hard to reach students in time, the japan times reports.

The opioid's rising popularity has caused roughly 160 deaths in the uk and many more in america, where nearly 29,000 people died in 2017 from synthetic-opioid-linked overdoses. Police say labs in china are producing fentanyl, which is often processed by mexican cartels and sold domestically as pills or mixed into heroin and other substances. Some users procure it directly online, where sellers may be getting nervous. Even drug users \" on the dark web say on forums that they don't think it's right that people are selling fentanyl because it is dangerous and kills a lot of people, \" says o ' brien.

        "summary": "Two months after beginning a 21,700-mile, round-the-world journey, the solar impulse 2 is about to embark on its toughest challenge yet: a pacific ocean crossing. While a typical aircraft can make the trip in 12 hours, the impulse 2, which runs entirely on solar power and travels between 20mph and 90mph, will take five days and five nights to fly from nanjing, china, to honolulu, wired reports. Amazingly, there will be a single pilot at the controls during the leg. Andre borschberg and fellow swiss pilot bertrand piccard will nap in the plane's 35-cubic-foot insulated cockpit — which will range in temperature from 95 degrees to minus 4 degrees, the ap reports — in 20-minute intervals, six to eight times a day, as borschberg maneuvers the aircraft with help from the autopilot. Piccard will take over during the next 3,000-mile leap from honolulu to phoenix, which should take four days. \" it's very interesting how the human mind can adapt to this type of new situation, \" piccard says. In a tweet, borschberg says the journey \" will be the flight of my life. \" the pair have practiced meditation, breathing exercises, and yoga during long stretches in a flight simulator to help with the journey from nanjing, which could begin as soon as thursday, though specific weather conditions are required for takeoff. Mashable reports liftoff is scheduled for monday. So far, the pair have flown about 5,000 miles over six of 12 legs, the longest of which took just 20 hours. This time around, the impulse 2 team can only accurately predict the weather up to three days into the trip, though small changes to the flight route can be made to avoid bad weather. Other than the monotony, the food sounds pretty good: specially made nestle meals include mushroom risotto and chicken with rice.",

Instead of going to school, she spends her days sorting bottles at a recycling factory. Officially child labour is illegal in bangladesh. Unofficially a bribe paid to the right official can mean exceptions are made. Like all exploitation, child labour remains a sad reality in environments where citizens are trapped in poverty and corrupt officials can be paid off. It's just one example of the devastation fuelled by corruption. Others include human trafficking, child mortality, poor education standards, environmental destruction and terrorism. Put simply – public sector corruption is about so much more than missing money. It's about people's lives, and it's a global problem."

Trump, asked whether he would continue america's cherished tradition of peaceful transfers of power, refused to say whether he will accept the results of the election if he loses. \" i ' ll keep you in suspense, \" he told moderator chris wallace. Hillary clinton called the remarks \" horrifying. \" a roundup of coverage: reuters — which describes the remarks as \" challenging a cornerstone of american democracy \" — reports that many republicans were among those condemning trump, though ben carson defended him, saying the message was that trump would say something about \" obvious fraud. \" \" he didn't say he wouldn't accept it, \" carson added. \" he said he would evaluate it at the time. \" this debate was \" far and away his best performance \" — but it is \" unfortunate that he chose to challenge the veracity of the democratic process in america \" because that could be all people remember, writes doug schoen at fox. Trump \" made history as the first major party candidate to say something like this before an election, \" he writes. \" and history will always look back on this with horror. \" according to john cassidy at the new yorker, trump's real message was \" i ' m going to lose \" — and he is trying to find somebody to blame for the \" impending defeat. \" trump \" entered the race as can-do businessman intent on restoring the country to greatness, \" cassidy writes. \" he's going out as a sore loser, raving at the world, threatening to unleash chaos. \" ben mathis-lilley at slate wonders: who cares whether donald trump accepts the result? the latest polls suggest the margins of victory will be big enough to render any challenge in the courts \" implausible, \" he writes.

        "summary": "The justice department is cracking down hard on makers of dietary supplements who lie about what their product can do — and what it really contains. The department says it has brought more than 100 civil and criminal cases against makers and marketers of the supplements in a yearlong sweep, including a case announced tuesday against usplabs, a maker of what the doj terms \" widely popular \" workout and weight loss supplements including jack3d and oxyelite pro, npr reports. The indictment accuses the company and six execs of claiming its supplements contained natural plant extracts, when the key ingredient was really a \" synthetic stimulant manufactured in a chinese chemical factory, \" the department said in a statement. When the usplabs supplements were linked to liver damage in 2013, the company told the fda it would take oxyelite pro off the market, but instead hustled to sell off inventory as fast as possible, according to the indictment. The justice department says it has worked with other agencies, including the fda and the us anti-doping agency, to bring cases against other firms, including sunrise nutraceuticals, which is accused of falsely claiming that its elimidrol supplement was \" guaranteed to work \" for people in withdrawal from opiates, the washington post reports. The new york times reports that news of the crackdown caused share prices to drop for major supplement retailers, including gnc holdings and vitamin shoppe.

        "summary": "Ah, the mysterious third nipple. Why do some people have one, and how do they form? at the bbc, jason goldman reports that while some have considered the \" supernumerary nipple \" a fault of the evolutionary process, similar to wisdom teeth or the tailbone, recent research shows that extra-nipple formation may be far more involved. Here are key takeaways: researchers are finding a correlation between gender, ethnicity, geographic region, and nipples. For instance, one study found 0.6 % of white american infants have a third nipple, while their black american counterparts clock in at 1.63 %; israeli infants had an even higher rate of 2.5 %. The supernumerary nipple is very unusual: only an estimated 200,000 people are born in the us with what the national institute of health calls a \" rare disease. \" humans can and have had up to six additional nipples, though more than three is considered exceedingly rare. The nipples ( both normal and supernumerary ) form during the fourth week of embryo fertilization. Two strips of tissue across the chest ( called \" mammary ridges \" ) regress in-utero, creating two nipples, but sometimes they don't regress completely, leaving an extra nipple. Some supernumerary nipples can contain breast tissue, and undergo the same hormonal changes as normal nipples. Though rare, supernumerary nipples exist in places other than the chest. One such \" ectopic supernumerary nipple \" was reportedly found on a french woman's thigh in 1827. It produced milk and \" her infant... Took it willingly, \" writes norman grossl in the southern medical journal. Click for goldman's full story.",

Eight nipples! the mind boggles. The first formal description of the condition was made in a german scientific journal in 1878 by a researcher called leichtenstern. He estimated that around one in 500 humans, or 0.2 %, have \" supernumerary nipples \" – that is, a number of nipples greater than two. There are almost as many guesses as to the prevalence of extra nipples as there are studies on the matter. One study found a prevalence of 0.22 % in a hungarian population; another estimated 0.6 % of white american infants; another claimed that 1.63 % of black american infants have them. For israeli infants, the rate was estimated to be 2.5 %; for israeli-arabic children, 4.7 %; and 5.6 % among german children. Another study reported that 5 % of japanese women but only 1.6 % of japanese men have additional nipples, though most other studies find them to be more common in men than in women. Some evidence has suggested that they more commonly erupt on the left side than the right. In other words, while the estimated prevalence varies wildly according to ethnicity, sex, geographic region, or ( most likely ) detection methods, extra nipples probably occur fairly rarely. Indeed, the national insitute of health's office of rare diseases considers supernumerary nipples a \" rare disease \", by which it means fewer than 200,000 people within the united states have them. One early voice in the drive to scientifically understand \" supernumerary nipples \" was a researcher named kajava. In 1915, based on a study of finnish people, he classified supernumerary nipples into eight discrete categories"

For israeli infants, the rate was estimated to be 2.5 %; for israeli-arabic children, 4.7 %; and 5.6 % among german children. Another study reported that 5 % of japanese women but only 1.6 % of japanese men have additional nipples, though most other studies find them to be more common in men than in women. Some evidence has suggested that they more commonly erupt on the left side than the right. In other words, while the estimated prevalence varies wildly according to ethnicity, sex, geographic region, or ( most likely ) detection methods, extra nipples probably occur fairly rarely. Indeed, the national insitute of health's office of rare diseases considers supernumerary nipples a \" rare disease \", by which it means fewer than 200,000 people within the united states have them. One early voice in the drive to scientifically understand \" supernumerary nipples \" was a researcher named kajava. In 1915, based on a study of finnish people, he classified supernumerary nipples into eight discrete categories"

Nina totenberg, the npr reporter who first broke the story of accuser anita hill, now reveals in a podcast that although she'd heard rumors about thomas ' harassment earlier that year, she couldn't prove it — until she caught a statement by then-judiciary committee chair joe biden at a meeting. \" biden starts talking about how the confirmation process should not be about rank gossip, \" she says. \" and i go … what are you talking about? i go out and i start kicking tires. \" that tire-kicking led her to hill, and to a story that \" every network on the face of the earth \" showed live when the hearings took place. Totenberg says sexual harassment was a \" dirty little secret \" at the time and thomas was \" so furious and so hurt and so indignant \" about the accusations. Totenberg also found herself ensconced in controversy. \" the cost was enormous in terms of negative publicity and people trashing me a lot and senators yelling at me, \" she says. \" at one point i had a driver at nightline who... Said to me … ' lady, you better get a gun.

As for the source who first gave her hill's name, her lips are forever sealed. \" i didn't even tell my lawyer when they subpoenaed me, \" she says. \" i've never told my husband.

But over the years dunham had publicly discussed issues the dog had, claiming he didn't get along with her longtime boyfriend and that ( in a post that has since been deleted ) he once bit her. She claimed he had lived in three homes before hers, had been abused, and thus had \" special needs \" that required medication and work with a trainer. Then, in june, she revealed that she had sent lamby to the zen dog, a los angeles facility that works with troubled dogs. But now barc is hitting back, refuting dunham's claims about lamby's history and behavior and also pointing out that under her adoption contract, she was required to return lamby to the shelter if she needed to rehome him. \" when she adopted the dog from us, it wasn't crazy. I have pictures of the dog loving on lena and her mom, which is weird if the dog was abused. It wouldn't be cuddling with her or be in the bed with her ' boyfriend ' in the pages of vogue, \" a barc rep tells yahoo celebrity. And the founder and director of barc tells page six that lamby was \" mild mannered and very well behaved \" with no signs of aggression when he lived at barc. He also claims dunham ignored the shelter's attempts to follow up with her post-adoption. Dunham responded to the uproar on instagram thursday, insisting that lamby's issues were \" myriad \" and she had no choice but to put him in a new home, where he is \" notably happier. \"",

The 5-4 decision in wayfair vs. South dakota overturns a 1992 ruling — written in the age of mail-order catalogs — essentially declaring that states could only collect taxes on businesses that had a physical presence within their borders. The new ruling is seen as a win not just for states, who say they have missed out on billions in revenue, but also for brick-and-mortar stores that have long complained of being at a disadvantage, reports the wall street journal. Amazon, others: online retailers such as wayfair, overstock, etsy, ebay, and newegg were taking a hit on share prices. Amazon, too, though to a lesser extent because it already collects state sales taxes on direct purchases. It doesn't require independent merchants on its site to do so, however. Generally, shares of online retailers were down and those of brick-and-mortar chains such as target were up, reports marketwatch.",

        "summary": "A new study finds that more than 50 million \" quite healthy \" americans have been mislabeled as obese or overweight thanks to an over-reliance on bmi as a measurement of health, the los angeles times reports. \"this should be a final nail in the coffin for bmi, \" says a. Janet tomiyama, lead author of a study published thursday in the journal of obesity. Tomiyama and her team looked at the blood pressure, glucose levels, cholesterol, and more of 40,420 people. They found 47.4 % of people with an \" overweight \" bmi and 29 % of \" obese \" people were actually healthy. Conversely, more than 30 % of people with a healthy bmi were surprisingly unhealthy. \" obesity is just a number based on bmi, and we think bmi is just a really crude and terrible indicator of someone's health, \" tomiyama says. A recent proposal from the federal government would allow employers to charge employees who don't meet health criteria — including bmi — more for health insurance. Tomiyama says this would unfairly punish \" overweight \" individuals who are actually healthy, according to a press release. For example, npr reports that not a single member of the denver broncos, who are obviously fit enough to play in the super bowl, has a \" healthy \" bmi. A coauthor of the study recommends people focus more on eating well and exercising regularly than strictly on weight. One expert argues bmi is still useful as a quick test to indicate health but should be followed with additional tests to determine a person's true health.

Eight members of the \" eighth and h street crew \" were eventually convicted of the oct. 1, 1984, killing. But lawyers say they might not have been if prosecutors had disclosed a key piece of evidence: witnesses near the crime scene had reported seeing another man, james mcmillan, reports the new york times.

Lower courts have backed up the lead prosecutor's assertion that the mcmillan sighting was irrelevant. The eight crew members — one died in prison, one was released, and six remain incarcerated — went on to be convicted based on testimony of witnesses characterized by justice elena kagan as \" a couple of really drug-addled people and a 14-year-old boy, \" per the guardian. Lawyers for the federal government say the outcome would have been the same even if prosecutors had disclosed the mcmillan sighting, because police got crew members to confess.

            "Photo washington — at an unusual supreme court argument on wednesday, the justices tried to sort out who was responsible for a notorious 1984 murder in washington. The legal question in the case was whether the convictions of seven defendants should be set aside because prosecutors had withheld evidence about another suspect. But the argument barely touched on legal principles. It was instead dominated by an intense effort to reconstruct what happened more than three decades ago. Prosecutors had presented no physical evidence, relying on eyewitness testimony. It was enough to convict eight defendants, including one who has since died, of brutally assaulting and killing catherine fuller. Twenty-five years after the trial, in 2010, lawyers for the defendants sought to reopen the case, saying their convictions had been tainted by violations of brady v. Maryland, a 1963 supreme court decision that required prosecutors to turn over favorable evidence to the defense. They said prosecutors had withheld several kinds of evidence, most notably about another suspect, james mcmillan. Mr. Mcmillan had been seen near the scene of the crime. After ms. Fuller's murder but before the trial, mr. Mcmillan was arrested and later convicted on charges of robbing and assaulting two other middle-age women in the neighborhood. ( later, mr.

The justices could set aside the convictions if they determine there is a reasonable probability that jurors in fuller's murder trial would have come to a different decision had defense lawyers been given the evidence about the other man. \"we don't",
            "Photo washington — at an unusual supreme court argument on wednesday, the justices tried to sort out who was responsible for a notorious 1984 murder in washington. The legal question in the case was whether the convictions of seven defendants should be set aside because prosecutors had withheld evidence about another suspect. But the argument barely touched on legal principles. It was instead dominated by an intense effort to reconstruct what happened more than three decades ago. Prosecutors had presented no physical evidence, relying on eyewitness testimony. It was enough to convict eight defendants, including one who has since died, of brutally assaulting and killing catherine fuller. Twenty-five years after the trial, in 2010, lawyers for the defendants sought to reopen the case, saying their convictions had been tainted by violations of brady v. Maryland, a 1963 supreme court decision that required prosecutors to turn over favorable evidence to the defense. They said prosecutors had withheld several kinds of evidence, most notably about another suspect, james mcmillan. Mr. Mcmillan had been seen near the scene of the crime. After ms. Fuller's murder but before the trial, mr. Mcmillan was arrested and later convicted on charges of robbing and assaulting two other middle-age women in the neighborhood. ( later, mr. Mcmillan was convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering a woman in 1992, a few blocks from"

But her efforts to get approval for the woolly mammoth have met with some obstacles in the state capital, usa today reports. Republican state sen. Kevin bryant tried last week to get bible verses from genesis inserted into the bill that would make the fossil official. His initial amendment was rejected by colleagues, but he believes \" it's an appropriate time to acknowledge the creator. \" that's why he has introduced a new amendment to the bill, one that paraphrases the bible; it reads the mammoth was \" created on the sixth day with the beasts of the field. \" courts have backed the use of old testament scripture \" because it doesn't point to a single religion, \" he notes. But he ' ll support the bill even if the scripture isn't included, he says. Olivia was inspired to write to lawmakers after she noticed that her state had everything from an official folk dance to a state opera, but no fossil — even though one of the first fossils discovered in the us was found in the state. Slaves discovered woolly mammoth teeth on a plantation in 1725, the daily beast notes. ( one theory as to what wiped out the creatures: a flower shortage. )",

She just wanted the publicity. \" yates was just days away from stepping down from the justice department after a 27-year career.",

Plumer writes that the housing and care of our more than 218,000 federal inmates led to a $ 6.9 billion request for the bureau of prisons for fiscal 2013. At the current pace of growth, prisons will eat up 30 % of the doj's budget by just 2020, per an urban institute report. This will suck money away from \" other key justice department priorities \" ( think federal investigators ), programs that the urban institute thinks \" do far more for public safety than prisons. \" and the drug change makes sense, writes plumer, because the report attributes 32 % of federal prison population growth to longer drug-related sentences. But there's a caveat in all this, notes plumber: 86.1 % of all prisoners are state-level, not federal, inmates. \" really large-scale reform would require new policies from state legislatures around the country. \" click for his full piece.",

But this week, another comic, pearls before swine, took on a new style — and fans speculated that something unusual might be going on. They were right: much of the strip over the past few days has been drawn by watterson himself, the washington post reports. Pearls writer stephan pastis tells the story on his blog: he didn't expect a reply from the reclusive watterson when he sent his hero a recent email. But not only did watterson reply, he suggested a storyline involving a character within pearls taking over the strip. The work of this character — in the end, a second-grader named libby — would really be drawn by watterson himself. The resulting strips, viewable here, will be auctioned off to benefit parkinson's research. \" i think we both got some surprises, \" watterson tells the post. \" i didn't know what ( pastis ) was going to write, and he didn't know how i was going to draw it. \" watterson's work made another rare appearance a few months ago.",

Because pastis and \"calvin and hobbes \" creator bill watterson have confirmed this exclusive report ( below ), i can now say: pastis has just executed a gift at \"drawing \" that few cartoonists can top: 1. Amazingly, he drew the long-retired, once-reclusive watterson … out of retirement — and got him to create fresh art for this week's \"pearls \"; and 2. Pastis managed to draw out his watterson-week storyline brilliantly, layering humor upon meta-humor in a hilarious house-of-mirrors reflection on the comic-strip industry past and present. Has anyone in recent memory drawn such feats as that? it is special to have watterson back into the comic-page spotlight, even if only for a few wonderful days. – m.c. At the end of 1995, the beloved \"calvin and hobbes \" sledded off the comics page for the final time, and its long-reclusive legendary creator, bill watterson, retired from the business, never to draw another syndicated newspaper strip.

Few in the cartooning world have ever spoken to him. Even fewer have ever met him. In fact, legend has it that when steven spielberg called to see if he wanted to make a movie, bill wouldn't even take the call. So it was with little hope of success that i set out to try and meet him last april. I was traveling through cleveland on a book tour, and i knew that he lived somewhere in the area. I also knew that he was working with washington post cartoonist nick galifianakis on a book about cul de sac cartoonist richard thompson's art. So i took a shot and wrote to nick. And nick in turn wrote to watterson. And the meeting didn't happen. Bill apparently had something to do. Or more likely, wanted nothing to do with me. Which is smart. But nick encouraged me to send an email to bill anyways. I said i didn't want to bother him.

            "Courtesy of stephan pastis / distributed by universal uclick writer's note: on monday night, after he and i did a public q&a for nearly 500 people at the washington post building, stephan pastis — acclaimed author of \"pearls before swine \" and bestselling author of the \"timmy failure \" books — made a few self-deprecating jokes about his own drawing ability. Because pastis and \"calvin and hobbes \" creator bill watterson have confirmed this exclusive report ( below ), i can now say: pastis has just executed a gift at \"drawing \" that few cartoonists can top: 1. Amazingly, he drew the long-retired, once-reclusive watterson … out of retirement — and got him to create fresh art for this week's \"pearls \"; and 2. Pastis managed to draw out his watterson-week storyline brilliantly, layering humor upon meta-humor in a hilarious house-of-mirrors reflection on the comic-strip industry past and present. Has anyone in recent memory drawn such feats as that? it is special to have watterson back into the comic-page spotlight, even if only for a few wonderful days. – m.c. At the end of 1995, the beloved \"calvin and hobbes \" sledded off the comics page for the final time, and its long-reclusive legendary creator, bill watterson, retired from the business, never to draw another syndicated newspaper strip. Until now. This week,",
            "Bill watterson is the bigfoot of cartooning. He is legendary. He is reclusive. And like bigfoot, there is really only one photo of him in existence. Few in the cartooning world have ever spoken to him. Even fewer have ever met him. In fact, legend has it that when steven spielberg called to see if he wanted to make a movie, bill wouldn't even take the call. So it was with little hope of success that i set out to try and meet him last april. I was traveling through cleveland on a book tour, and i knew that he lived somewhere in the area. I also knew that he was working with washington post cartoonist nick galifianakis on a book about cul de sac cartoonist richard thompson's art. So i took a shot and wrote to nick. And nick in turn wrote to watterson. And the meeting didn't happen. Bill apparently had something to do. Or more likely, wanted nothing to do with me. Which is smart. But nick encouraged me to send an email to bill anyways. I said i didn't want to bother him. But a week or so later, this pearls strip ran in the newspaper: and i figured this was as good of a time to write to him as any."

The ban will go into effect 30 days after mayor antonio villaraigosa signs the law, which he intends to do. As many as 900 medical marijuana dispensaries will be sent a letter ordering them to shut down, reports ap. Medical marijuana patients and their pot suppliers will be able to grow and share pot in groups of three people or fewer — a compromise that will be far too costly for patients, say pot advocates. The council may fashion a future law that would allow some 170 of the oldest dispensaries to operate, reports the los angeles times. The vote drew furious jeers from medical marijuana advocates packing the council's chambers. It's an extraordinary development in a state known for its marijuana tolerance, where voters approved medical marijuana in 1996, and a victory for the justice department's crackdown on the dispensaries. Public condemnation of the dispensaries has grown as the shops have proliferated. Past los angeles attempts to crack down on the shops have triggered legal action, but a recent appellate court decision will likely protect the city this time around. \" a judge could file an injunction but we think that is unlikely, \" said a city attorney.",

He then complimented hers. Less than two years later, the atlanta couple were engaged. And on dec. 3, just two months before their planned nuptials, disaster struck while swimming. People reports that while at their joint bachelor/bachelorette party in naples, fla., greenhill dove into the gulf of mexico surf. A party guest, who happens to be a registered nurse, noticed he was floating in an odd way and went in after him. Doctors believe the 39-year-old hit a sandbar in an accident that has left him paralyzed from the neck down — but not alone. Wxia reports there's just a 1 % chance greenhill — a marathoner who popped the question on a run — will ever walk again. \" if anyone will do it, it's brett, \" says alexander, who has remained with her fiance at lee memorial hospital in fort myers in anticipation of an eventual transfer to atlanta for rehab. A gofundme page that has raised $ 85,000 for his treatment explains that surgery did \" remove fragments of [ greenhill's ] shattered vertebrae which had lodged into his spinal cord. The injury has by definition caused paralysis, but the results are not definitive. \" an update states he has been able to feel, but not move, his hands. While the feb. 11 wedding is on hold, \" i am and we are going to get married someday, and it's going to be amazing, \" says alexander. ( this bride-to-be was paralyzed at her bachelorette party. )",

Now that dam — the country's biggest, holding back 11 billion cubic meters of water and producing over 1,000 megawatts of electricity — is at the center of a military struggle between iraqi and kurdish forces backed by the u.s. And the islamic state of iraq and greater syria ( isis ), which took control of the structure on aug. 7. Kurdish forces retook part of the dam early sunday, the associated press reported, aided by u.s. And iraqi air strikes. The americans brought along some",

Ground forces supported by us air strikes launched the operation to take mosul dam on sunday morning. Kurdish sources said they were still trying to clear mines and booby traps from the area round the dam, a process which could take several hours. The strategically important facility was seized by is militants on 7 august. It supplies water and electricity to northern iraq and there had been fears the is militants could use it to flood areas downstream.

Speaking at a presser for the hunger games: mockingjay — part 2, jennifer lawrence addressed a website's response to her essay about being paid less than her male co-stars on american hustle: \" even after i wrote it, i don't remember the website, but they called it ' jennifer lawrence's bratty display, ' \" she says. \" and i was like,'thank you for completely making my point. ' if a woman speaks up, is assertive and has a voice, she's going to be called ' a brat. ' i don't see a man being called ' a brat. ' \" nina jacobson, co-producer of the hunger games sequel, had her back: \" what jen spoke to, i found really powerful, \" she says. \" you don't want or feel entitled to be a spokesperson as a woman. \" the criticism came from redstate.com, where kimberly ross wrote: \" not only is jennifer lawrence's complaint a bratty display from a wealthy youngster, but it highlights that claims of pay inequality are oftentimes not the complete story, and hollywood is the least appropriate voice on the subject. \" calling lawrence \" a privileged 1-percenter, \" ross argued that the equal pay act of 1963 already makes it illegal \" to pay a woman less than a man solely based on gender \" — so when women get paid less it's often because their work experience is limited by family duties. She adds that lawrence \" is most definitely in fewer scenes than the male actors \" in american hustle. But in her essay, lawrence says women just need to negotiate more aggressively: \" i ' m over trying to find the ' adorable ' way to state my opinion and still be likable! \" she writes. \" f --- that. \"",

        "summary": "The first day of supreme court hearings on president obama's controversial health care law is over, and it appears the justices will not be putting off a decision until 2015. If the justices deemed the penalty for not purchasing insurance to be a tax, then an obscure 1867 law would prevent them from hearing arguments on the matter until after that tax had been paid, and the individual mandate does not take effect until 2014. Though neither the obama administration nor those challenging the patient protection and affordable care act thought the 1867 law applied, one appeals court disagreed, so arguments on the matter were ordered. During 90 minutes of active questioning today, none of the justices appeared to subscribe to the idea that the issue should be delayed, the ap notes; some skeptical justices actively pushed back against the idea that the penalty would be considered a tax. As arguments were heard inside, hundreds of supporters and opponents marched outside, the washington post reports. As promised, rick santorum was there, once again arguing that only he, not mitt romney, can repeal obamacare. Arguments on the individual mandate will be heard tomorrow.",

But the justices ' questions indicated skepticism that the penalties prescribed for those who do not buy health insurance by 2014 amount to taxes under the 1867 law forbidding tax challenges. The court on tuesday will hear arguments about the so-called \"individual mandate \" that is at the heart of the health-care law. The court had asked washington lawyer robert a.

What gives? thank that ingenious snout. Researchers discovered that it's shaped in such a way that it allows the seahorse to ever-so-slowly creep up on its prey without creating a telltale wake. Once it gets within a millimeter, it's game over, thanks to a quick-strike movement known as \" pivot \" feeding, explains i09. The shape of the head \" creates this zone with very little disturbance, which allows them to get really close to these very sensitive, highly evasive copepods, \" one of the texas researchers tells national geographic. As for those copepods, they are tiny crustaceans that can pick up on the wave movements of predators and zip away at speeds that aquaman would envy — 500 body lengths per second, or the equivalent of a human swimming 2,000mph. All the more incredible that the poky seahorse \" can overcome one of the most talented escape artists in the aquatic world, \" says the researcher.",

        "summary": "The senate confirmation hearings for elena kagan will likely include some minor dust-ups but no major battles, observers say. Liberals are worried she's more conservative than stevens and will thus push the court to the right, but are unlikely to seriously oppose her. Conservatives respect her overall, though her move at harvard to kick military recruiters off campus because of the ban on gays will probably catch her some flak from the right, politico reports. Kagan's lack of courtroom experience and thin publication record should both help and hurt: the lack of evidence about where she stands will feed into progressives ' fears that she isn't liberal enough, but will also leave critics short on ammo for attacks. With kagan, president obama chose the middle road among his shortlist options: not as liberal as diane wood, but not as conservative as merrick garland, whom obama is saving in case he has to make a third supreme court nomination, when facing a more hostile senate, the new york times reports.",

Obama said the court with kagan on it will be more representative of the country – and it would have for the first time three female justices, if kagan is confirmed. \" i hope that the senate will act in a bipartisan fashion, \" obama said, \" and that they will do so as quickly as possible so she can get busy. \" kagan, 50, who was the first female dean of harvard law school, called the court an \"extraordinary institution \" that can help people in their everyday lives, \"because law matters, because it keeps us safe, because it protects our most fundamental rights and freedoms and because it is the foundation of our democracy. \" kagan's choice is a by-the-books pick straight from the top of obama's short list that seems designed to avoid a major confirmation battle with republicans. And in his first comment on the selection, senate republican leader mitch mcconnell steered clear of any hint that republicans would seek to block kagan's nomination but suggested they will focus their questions on whether she has the \"requisite experience \"",
            "Replacing justice stevens with ms. Kagan presumably would not alter the broad ideological balance on the court, but her relative youth means that she could have an influence on the court for decades to come, underscoring the stakes involved.

            "The earth has a roughly 12 percent chance of experiencing an enormous megaflare erupting from the sun in the next decade. This event could potentially cause trillions of dollars ' worth of damage and take up to a decade to recover from. Such an extreme event is considered to be relatively rare. The last gigantic solar storm, known as the carrington event, occurred more than 150 years ago and was the most powerful such event in recorded history. That a rival to this event might have a greater than 10 percent chance of happening in the next 10 years was surprising to space physicist pete riley, senior scientist at predictive science in san diego, california, who published the estimate in space weather on feb. 23. \"even if it's off by a factor of two, that's a much larger number than i thought, \" he said. Earth's sun goes through an 11-year cycle of increased and decreased activity. During solar maximum, it's dotted with many sunspots and enormous magnetic whirlwinds erupt from its surface. Occasionally, these flares burst outward from the sun, spewing a mass of charged particles out into space. Small solar flares happen quite often whereas very large ones are infrequent, a mathematical distribution known as a power law. Riley was able to estimate the chance of an enormous solar flare",

        "summary": "Though upward of 12 million africans were enslaved and shipped to the americas between 1500 and 1850, tracing their roots back home has been famously difficult — with poor record-keeping and poorly-preserved dna samples partly to blame. Now researchers from stanford university and the university of copenhagen report in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences that for the first time they've been able to use very old and very poor dna samples, in this case extracted from the teeth roots of three skeletons on saint martin island in the caribbean, to identify with extreme precision where in africa these slaves came from. \" we have long sought to use dna to understand who they were, where they came from, \" says a researcher. The team learned \" we cannot only get ancient dna from tropical samples, we can reliably identify their ancestry. \" the remains were initially dated back to the late 1600s thanks to artifacts like pottery shards found at the site, reports cbs news. And while the head researcher at first thought it \" wasn't possible \" to recover dna from bones that had \" essentially been lying on a caribbean beach for 400 years or so, \" he and colleagues devised a \" whole-genome capture \" technique that allowed them to isolate and sequence the trace dna of interest. What they learned, reports stanford university in a press release, is that one of the three skeletons belonged to a man from a bantu-speaking group in northern cameroon, while the other two share similarities with groups in what is today nigeria and ghana. \" this approach, along with identification of african names, are ways of getting around the thin documentary record, \" notes an outside researcher. ( researchers also sequenced the genome of the ice mummy ötzi in 2013. )",

        "summary": "The united airlines passenger dragged off a louisville-bound flight in a disturbing scene at chicago's o ' hare airport on sunday still hasn't made it back to kentucky. David dao, a 69-year-old doctor who appeared bloody and disoriented after the incident, told wlky tuesday that he is recovering in a chicago hospital. When the station asked him what was injured, he said \" everything \" and added that he is not doing well. A lawyer from a chicago firm released a statement from dao's family tuesday thanking the public for the \" outpouring of prayers, concern, and support they have received. \" the statement says the family is focusing on dao's treatment and he will not be saying more until he is out of the hospital. In other developments: one of the attorneys dao has retained is thomas demetrio, described by the chicago tribune as a \" high-powered personal injury lawyer. \" according to his company's website, his specialities include plane crashes, and he has won more than $ 1 billion in settlements. Cnn reports that the louisville courier-journal is facing a backlash for a story on what it calls dao's \" troubled past, \" which includes accusations of misconduct and convictions for drug-related felonies. Critics say the doctor's past is irrelevant and accuse the kentucky paper of trying to help united escape its pr and financial nightmare. The incident, and the social media firestorm it started, caught the attention of lawmakers, the new york times reports. \" the last thing a paying airline passenger should expect is a physical altercation with law enforcement personnel after boarding, especially one that could likely have been avoided, \" the leaders of the senate commerce committee wrote in a letter to united ceo oscar munoz. They have asked the airline to explain what led up to the incident, and the department of transportation says it is looking into whether rules on overselling flights were violated. White house press secretary sean spicer told reporters tuesday that he is sure president trump has seen video of the incident, reports the chicago sun-times. Asked how trump felt, spicer said it would be hard for anybody to see the video and not think it \" could have been handled a little bit better. \" the ap reports that chicago mayor rahm emanuel said tuesday that the city has launched its own investigation and will make sure nothing like this happens again. He praised the commissioner of the city's aviation department, which suspended one of the officers seen removing dao from his seat, for taking swift action.

It has since determined that at least four of those films were ones thought to have been lost. One of those, their first misunderstanding, is the 1911 silent short film that features silent movie star mary pickford appearing in her first credited role. Prior to that, pickford, then 18, had been known only as \" little mary \" in films. The library of congress is funding the film's restoration ( it hadn't even been stored in a can ), and it will be screened at the new hampshire college on oct. 11. \" it's a big deal, \" says a pickford scholar of the film's discovery seven years ago. Another expert says the movie \" fills an important gap, \" because pickford had a \" short-lived association \" with carl laemmle's independent moving picture co. Their first misunderstanding was the first movie she made for imp. It's about a newlywed couple's first fight, and also stars pickford's then-husband owen moore, the los angeles times reports.

That's what happened in the case of truett thomas, an albuquerque man accused of murdering guadalupe ashford and leaving her body behind a parking lot trash can in 2010, ars technica reports. Police found blood on a paver stone at the scene that was believed to be the murder weapon, the albuquerque journal reports; it matched thomas ' blood, but in the two years between thomas ' arrest and the start of his trial, the state's forensic analyst — the person who originally tested the crime scene blood — moved out of new mexico. Thomas'defense lawyer originally didn't argue with allowing the expert to testify via a two-way skype call, though he said he found it \" weird, \" so prosecutors didn't subpoena him to appear in person. As the trial approached, thomas ' attorney decided he didn't like the skype idea after all, but because he hadn't initially fought the decision, the judge allowed it to proceed. Thomas was convicted of murder and kidnapping, but in a june 20 ruling the new mexico supreme court tossed the kidnapping charge ( the court says the evidence doesn't support it ) and reversed the murder conviction, ordering a new trial. The expert witness's \" involvement in the case was significant, \" the court ruled, and \" the dna profiles were offered as the sole evidence that implicated defendant in this crime, \" clearly influencing the verdict. Therefore, \" face-to-face confrontation \" should have happened, per thomas ' constitutional rights. ( a talkative parrot may factor into this murder trial. )",

The foundation may suggest renaming the day italian american day to take the focus off columbus.

Also, polls show most americans don't care much about the holiday itself.

        "summary": "Scientists are testing new ways to prevent the spread of insect-borne diseases like zika and malaria, one of which involves sharing medication with your dog. New research funded by the bill &amp; melinda gates foundation suggests drugs included in anti-flea and tick medications for pets could prevent 97 % of zika infections and more than 70 % of malaria cases if given to 30 % of residents in areas likely to see outbreaks, reports the telegraph. Though a person given isoxazolines could still contract disease from an insect bite, the mosquito or sand fly would be killed by the drug before they could carry the disease to others, say scientists at the california institute for biomedical research. Based on studies of animals rather than humans, the theory could have big implications if proven, especially \" in regions with limited medical infrastructure, \" says researcher peter schultz. Per the telegraph, 445,000 people died from malaria in 2016 alone, mostly african children under the age of 5. \" the drug is a long-term approach to malaria, as it prevents mosquito bites by killing the mosquito population, \" says researcher hannah slater. \" there's no parallel. \" but there are alternatives: gene editing to produce sterile mosquitoes, and introducing predators into ecosystems, per cnn. Intellectual ventures has also developed a solar-powered laser fence that can differentiate between different insects and kill biting female mosquitoes within 100 feet. Updated dams might be needed, too. Per the telegraph, a new study blaming dams'standing water for an additional 1.1 million malaria cases in africa in 2015 found cases around dams with shallow slopes were more than double those around dams with steep slopes.",

Here we describe a treatment concept based on single-dose administration of an insecticidal isoxazoline drug to a human population, which leads to killing of blood-fed insect vectors and a predicted sharp decline in disease transmission. Based on the long half-life observed in preclinical species, a single human dose of <500 mg is predicted to provide plasma exposure above the insecticidal threshold for longer than 2 months. Importantly, we show that isoxazolines are active against a range of vector species, which holds promise for expanding the concept of drug-based vector control from malaria to leishmaniasis and arboviral diseases.

            "Engineers need to rethink how to design and operate dams after research found that they create an additional 1.1 million cases of malaria every year. Dams provide vital water security as well as power to countries in africa but they also create small standing pools of water - ideal breeding grounds for malaria-transmitting mosquitos. A study of the impact of 956 large dams on malaria transmission in africa found that, despite conventional mosquito control efforts, such as the use of insecticide treated bed nets and indoor spraying, there were an extra 1.1 million cases of malaria around the dams in 2015. With population growth and climate change that number is expected to increase to more than 2.2 million by 2050.",
