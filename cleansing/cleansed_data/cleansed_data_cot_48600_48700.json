        "summary": "Robert the bruce, king of scots from 1306 until his death in 1329 and perhaps most famous for defeating the english army at the battle of bannockburn, has been dead some 700 years, but we're just now getting a good idea of what he might have looked like. Without any renderings of the man from his own lifetime, any likenesses in statues and portraits were dreamed up by artists, reports the bbc. But thanks to two years of work by historians at the university of glasgow, with help from the liverpool john moores university's face lab ( best known for recreating the face of richard the third ), experts have captured the man. They were able to do so thanks to a 200-year-old plaster cast of a skull found in a coffin buried under dunfermline abbey. Whether the skull actually belongs to robert the bruce hasn't been confirmed, because he wasn't the only leader buried at dunfermline and the skull was long ago reinterred. A press release explains a toe bone taken from the coffin wasn't returned to it, but extracting dna from the bone would mean its destruction. That means no verification, and no genetic information about robert the bruce's physical characteristics. For now, the researchers say they relied on \" statistical evaluation \" in giving him brown hair and light brown eyes, reports the telegraph. He is thought to possibly have had leprosy, so one version shows him with a thick neck and build — a \" match for super-athletes today, \" per the release, and another with \" a mild representation of leprosy, \" which would have affected his nose and jaw.

Lead dust discharged by firearms is the leading cause of lead poisoning outside the workplace, the seattle times reported in a lengthy 2014 investigation. Each time a gun filled with lead-based ammunition is fired, a cloud of lead particles trails in the bullet's wake. The dust hangs in the air and collects on clothing, creating a hazard to anyone who comes in contact with it. The times ' conclusion: \" thousands of... Workers, shooters, and their family members have been contaminated at shooting ranges due to poor ventilation and contact with lead-coated surfaces. \" a 2016 oregonian investigation backs that up, noting the ventilation system at a former national guard armory in montana was clogged with \" lead-laced bunnies the size of tangerines \"; 20 workers fell ill. Npr takes a look at one move that has since been made: the department of defense in april tightened its limit for acceptable levels of lead in blood to 20 micrograms per deciliter. Bloomberg earlier this year cited a dod rep who said roughly 1,200 dod employees have their blood monitored for lead due to workplace exposure. The cdc adds these stats: 1.2 million law enforcement officials risk exposure as part of their weapons-training requirements; as many as 60,000 americans work in shooting ranges, and 34 million americans target shoot. But firearms advocates say fears of lead poisoning are \" unsupported by evidence. \" a rep for the national shooting sports foundation tells npr he sees an effort afoot to \" diminish people's participation in shooting sports or exercise their second amendment rights. \"",

        "summary": "The hackers who bombarded the internet with naked photos of hundreds of celebrities ranging from jennifer lawrence to kim kardashian have released their fourth round and it is notable for a couple of reasons. First, as tmz reports, they've at last targeted their first male victim in nick hogan, son of hulk hogan. The younger hogan's photos are \" voluminous and graphic, \" says the website; they also portray his various then-underage girlfriends, which hogan contends constitutes child porn. Other names on the list include winona ryder, ingrid michaelson, erin heatherington, nina dobrev, and others. Over at the daily beast, marlow stern brings us to the second point: the relative lack of a-listers would \" seem to indicate that the pervy legion of hackers behind this sordid episode seem to be running out of ammo, \" and that this whole mess is dying down. The latest release is the first since a lawyer representing a dozen hacked celebs filed suit against google last week, alleging that \" google has taken little or no action to stop these outrageous violations, or to limit the images from appearing in google search results. \"",

The bodies of the children — who were killed with a \" combination of medication, drowning, and suffocation, \" according to the district attorney's office — were found after edge tried to kill herself by driving into an electrical box in a parking lot. The children's father and other relatives spoke at friday's sentencing hearing, the los angeles times reports. They \" shared stories about the joys and interests \" of the children and \" talked about the pain and loss their family has experienced due to the actions of the defendant, \" the da's office said in a statement.",

However, the organization says it will cut back on events such as the employee conference and is putting limits on employee travel and expenses; financial statements will be independently audited and posted on the group's website, the board said.

But in its swift rise, it has also embraced aggressive styles of fund-raising, marketing and personnel management that have many current and former employees questioning whether it has drifted from its mission. It has spent millions a year on travel, dinners, hotels and conferences that often seemed more lavish than appropriate, more than four dozen current and former employees said in interviews. Former workers recounted buying business-class seats and regularly jetting around the country for minor meetings, or staying in $ 500-per-night hotel rooms.

            "Mark zuckerberg, the 26-year-old founder and chief executive of facebook inc., plans to announce a donation of up to $ 100 million to the newark schools this week, in a bold bid to improve one of the country's worst performing public school systems. Bloomberg news mark zuckerberg, founder and chief executive officer of facebook, at a news conference last month. Newark spends about $ 22,000 a year on each of its 40,000 pupils, but only about half of its students graduate. Of those who do, only one-fifth go on to four-year colleges. More than 85 % of the newark students at community colleges need remedial help in math and english. The state took control of the troubled newark system in the 1990s, and this month gov. Chris christie informed the city's superintendent that his contract wouldn't be renewed after june 2011. Mr. Christie has vowed to implement forceful changes, portending an agenda that includes stronger teacher evaluations and merit pay.

Here's a look at what editorials are saying: wall street journal: it implores republicans to get this passed and not wilt under pressure from the media and democrats. The measure is an \" imperfect compromise \" but also a \" major improvement over the us health-care status quo that will worsen if the bill fails, \" write the editors. \" it's not too much to say this is a defining moment for whether the gop can ever reform runaway entitlements. \" new york times: this isn't a health care bill, say the editors. \" it is, plain and simple, a plan to cut taxes for the wealthy by destroying critical federal programs that help provide health care to tens of millions of people. \" the bill's creators now have to bargain with holdouts to get it into final form, but \" no amount of tinkering around the edges \" can save it. If passed, it will take a \" devastating toll on millions of americans. \" washington post: the bill \" includes a range of mostly unwise and ungenerous changes to the nation's health-care system, but it might, if enacted, end up as mostly a massive, unpaid-for tax cut for wealthy people and industries with pull on capitol hill, \" says the editorial. Ditching the individual mandate in particular would inject chaos into health insurance markets.

This is a bill to notionally repeal obamacare while propping the insurance market up through the next election. It's an exercise in political box-checking and ass-covering. \" forbes: this isn't an editorial, but an op-ed by avik roy that argues the senate bill will \" transform \" us health care for the better. For conservatives tempted to vote no, he asks: \" how many times in your life will you have the opportunity to vote for a bill that fundamentally transforms two entitlement programs? how often will you get to vote for a bill that cuts spending by hundreds of billions of dollars? how often will you get a chance to make a difference for millions of your constituents who are struggling under the weight of rising premiums and exploding deductibles? \"",

The reason? kids stall at bedtime, and netflix is marketing these short videos as win-win for parents and kids alike, reports kfor 4. \" netflix and dreamworks animation engineered the new shows knowing exactly what kids love most: rewatching their favorite scenes, \" netflix says in a press release. Its bedtime routine survey — of more than 7,200 parents in the us, uk, brazil, mexico, france, canada, and australia — found that american kids are especially good at employing \" creative stall tactics, \" and that it takes parents in the us 19 minutes to put kids to bed, compared to the 17-minute average across all countries polled. Parents in france are fastest, at 12 minutes. Netflix says parents will look like the good guys when they let their kids watch a five-minute episode of dinotrux before bed, but it remains to be seen whether it speeds or slows the typical bedtime routine or impacts a child's ability to fall asleep. And while mashable calls it a truce, it also notes a disturbing trend found by a recent nielson report that finds tv viewing among kids at an eight-year high, with children ages 2 to 5 spending 32 hours a week in front of a tv.

        "summary": "Arthritis causes pain and suffering for millions of people around the world, but it's also the byproduct of an evolutionary mutation that allowed early humans to make the move from africa to colder climates tens of thousands of years ago. Researchers at stanford university have discovered that a genetic variation made humans shorter and more compact as a means of protecting them against frostbite in the colder temperatures of northern climates, newsweek reports. In addition, their limbs got shorter, making them less vulnerable to breaking if people should, say, slip on ice. The downside of this evolutionary adaptation was an increase in the likelihood of osteoarthritis. The stanford study, published monday in nature genetics, shows how a variation in the gdf5 gene became more prevalent in humans moving out of africa into colder climates 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. This variation doubles the chances of developing painful joint problems while also reducing height by about 0.4 inches on average, the telegraph reports. And since arthritis generally doesn't develop until after the age of reproduction, the gene mutation was passed on from generation to generation. The stanford researchers discovered that the genetic variation causing this increase in arthritis is common among europeans but rare in african populations.

The evolutionary shift helped them cope with the colder conditions — a more compact body size helped protect them from frostbite, while and shorter limbs would be less breakable when they fell — but it also appears to have come with a downside: arthritis. In a study published in nature genetics on monday, scientists at stanford university, california, have shown how variants within the gdf5 gene, which are related to reduced growth, was repeatedly favored by our ancestors as they migrated out of africa and across the continents. But gdf5 has also been linked with osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that affects an estimated 27 million americans. Risk increases with age — it is sometimes referred to as wear and tear arthritis — but it also has a strong genetic component. Previous research has shown how mutations in part of the gdf5 gene cause malformation in bone structure in mice. In humans, it has been associated with a shortness and joint problems, and two changes in particular are linked with a heightened risk of osteoarthritis. In the latest research, the scientists find gdf5 provided an evolutionary boost for our ancestors, with arthritis apparently a byproduct of it. \" the gene we are studying shows strong signatures of positive selection in many human populations, \" senior author david kingsley said in a statement \" it's possible that climbing around in cold environments was enough of a risk factor to select for a protective variant even if it brought along an increase likelihood of an age-related disease like arthritis, which typically doesn't develop until late in life. \" to better understand gdf5, the team studied the dna sequences that might affect how the gene is expressed — specifically those that are known as promoters and enhancers.

Researchers in the us have discovered that a gene mutation which increases the risk of arthritis evolved in the ice age to help protect our ancestors from frostbite. Around half of europeans carry a variant of the gdf5 gene which nearly doubles the chance of developing painful joints, and also knocks around 1cm off height. Although it may seem like an evolutionary disadvantage to be shorter and less mobile, in fact, it helped early humans to ward off the freezing temperatures of the north as they ventured out of africa for the first time around 50,000 years ago."

        "summary": "If you want to get people to stop boozing it up, don't show them images of glasses of healthy, sparkling water instead of beer — show them an ad that illustrates how too many cocktails can cause cancer to course through their bodies, the guardian reports. That's the finding of a new study published in the bmj open journal that examined english-language alcohol ads to identify which ones proved best at inspiring drinkers to cut down. Researchers tapped a pool of 2,174 australian adults ages 18 to 64 who drink alcohol at least one or two days a week. A total of 83 ads were shown, and the subjects were instructed to note after viewing each one how motivated they were to reduce their drinking on a scale from one to five, with \" one \" counting as an unmotivated \" nah, i ' m good, \" and \" five \" as \" take the key to my liquor cabinet and bury it, please. \" the most effective ad: \" spread, \" a 30-second video created by the western australian government a few years ago that shows the cancerous mutations wrought after alcohol gets into one's bloodstream. The dud: that ad pushing water over beer. Cancer council victoria ceo todd harper tells the guardian that \" spread \" may have made an impact because folks simply don't know alcohol is a group 1 carcinogen, the most dangerous category. Even though fergus taylor, the director of alcohol beverages australia, calls the \" spread \" ad \" scaremongering, \" harper notes \" every drink \" ups one's chance of getting cancer, including that of the mouth, liver, and bowel. What these findings should do is spur campaigns that maximize the public's awareness of alcohol so they can cut their cancer risk, harper says, per mumbrella.

In one, the 17-year-old envisions arriving at the school with loud music blasting from his car. As he threw a napalm firebomb and then started shooting, he planned to announce, \" the russian grim reaper is here, \" according to the document. In another, acord wrote that he would \" kill myself before swat engages me. \" there's also a list of \" items i ' ll take, \" which includes not just weapons but things like a hammer and sickle baseball cap and a skull and crossbones belt buckle. The journals also reportedly compare acord to the columbine high school shooters, the oregonian reports; authorities say acord printed out pages of information about the weapons they used. Acord's mom, marianne fox, says he suffers from pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections or pandas, a mental illness. According to an author who had written about pandas and had spoken with fox, she was attempting to find a way to get more expensive treatment for acord. The teen's former stepdad says acord was also getting therapy and treatment for ocd. ( in a statement, fox called pandas \" a rare form of ocd, \" and the oregonian notes that quite a bit of controversy surrounds the condition. )",

Fertilizer from farms and cattle feedlots are partly to blame for the thick layer of algae choking lake erie, the most developed of the great lakes, reports the new york times, which calls summertime swimming bans \" so routine \" in the state. But it's not just nitrogen and phosphorus feeding the algae, which is made up of bacteria called micosystis — it's also the introduction of invasive zebra and quagga mussels that eat the algae and then eject the micosystis, which builds over time, according to the christian science monitor. And as the climate changes, leading to fewer but stronger spring storms, those toxins have longer periods of calm in which they grow, only to be stirred to the surface by the storms. Because the algae are found in bodies of freshwater through the us, it's unlikely that the 11 million people who live along the lake are the only ones in the country afflicted by safe water concerns. Still, experts seem to think the problem is solvable: \" we have the means, \" one biologist tells the monitor. \" but these things cost money. Until people decide it's a high-enough priority, it's not going to get done. \" meanwhile, poisonous algae have been found in lakes from california to minnesota and even cape cod in massachusetts.

Nasa and russia's roscosmos signed an agreement to cooperate on the station — which will be \" an invaluable pit stop for human and robotic exploration of the lunar surface \" and \" a staging point for deep space missions \" to mars and venus — on wednesday at the 68th international astronautical congress in australia, according to motherboard. While the deep space gateway program is being led by nasa, roscosmos will contribute docking ports and life support systems, and russian rockets will be used to help with construction, engadget reports. Nasa wants to start work on the deep space gateway, which will be crewed by four astronauts, in the mid-2020s. It's one step toward its goal of sending humans to mars by the 2030s. In statements, roscosmos and nasa say they share a \" common vision for human exploration. \" the deep space gateway agreement is important for a number of reasons. It clarifies nasa's goals and how it will achieve them after years of funding issues. It also makes it less likely congress will put the kibosh on the deep space gateway at some point. Finally, the agreement will be one more thing keeping the us and russia from — as engadget puts it — descending \" into outright hostilities. \" space is so far one of the few places where tensions between the two countries haven't risen recently.

A nurse visited him to find out why the insulin wasn't working, only to watch the nearly blind man inadvertently inject himself with a syringe filled with nothing but air. It sounds simple to track a patient outside of office visits. But the chicago-based john d. And catherine t. Macarthur foundation found the idea genius. Jeffrey brenner, a doctor and founder of the organization that dispatches medical professionals to the doors of the desperately poor residents of camden, n.j., was named wednesday as one of 24 to receive a $ 625,000 \" genius grant \" from the foundation. \" this is an acknowledgment that we are headed in the right direction, \" brenner said. The 44-year-old created the camden coalition of healthcare providers as a means to find and track the poorest patients with the most complex medical issues. Those patients are visited wherever they are _ at home, in shelters _ and escorted to doctor's appointments. \" we cut, scan, zap and hospitalize ( patients ), \" said brenner, whose group is now working with 10 communities to develop similar systems. \" but we forget we need to take care of them. \" the eclectic group of grant recipients includes scientists, artists,"

The beta version of the app, which bills itself as \" tinder for fighting, \" is set to launch monday at 5pm est, the app's team told the new york daily news in an email and via a tweet. The app will supposedly allow users to \" get matched with others who want to throw down, \" scheduling fights between like-minded competitors. It will also post fights on an interactive map by location and type ( e.g., girl fights or gang fights, as venturebeat helpfully notes ). Users can set up detailed profiles with their stats — height, weight, wins, losses — and even trash-talk each other using the app's \" chat \" feature, per the daily news. Which sounds intriguing, except that everything about this app screams hoax. The washington post lays out the most convincing argument why it's probably just \" a marketing stunt, a prank or ( best case! ) an unsubtle parody, \" mainly due to the app's \" questionable legality \" ( an assertion backed up by sportingnews.com ) and the fact that the app's founders appear to be a \" skinny \" college junior and recent high school grad who don't seem likely to be the \" lifelong recreational fighters \" they claim to be. But they insist they're ready to rumble. \" we have raised relatively substantial funding from private american investors and the app is fully developed, \" reads rumblr's email to the daily news. The team says the app will be on the app store after it works out \" legal issues, \" as the paper puts it. Fightstate.com, going on the premise the app is legit, asked the app's owners what will happen if someone gets killed. The response: \" we're hands off after the initial matchup. Hopefully, a funeral. \" ( the app store took a conservative approach in recently allowing a pot app. )",

        "summary": "Many traditional fairy tales, long thought to be a somewhat recent invention, have actually been around for thousands of years, according to a new study. \" versions of beauty and the beast, rumplestiltskin, and jack and the beanstalk have probably been around since before the existence of many modern european languages, like english, german, russian, and french, and would have originally been told in a now extinct ancestral language from which those tongues evolved, \" co-author jamshid tehrani of durham university tells discovery news. He estimates that some such tales pre-date the bible and greek and roman mythology, having been in existence as many as 4,000 to 6,000 years, and may have actually influenced the bible and other religious texts. Generally, fairy tales have been believed to date back to just the 16th or 17th centuries, though the brothers grimm long believed the stories they transcribed and popularized were actually much older, the bbc reports. \" we can come firmly down on the side of wilhelm grimm, \" tehrani tells the bbc. \" some of these stories go back much further than the earliest literary record. \" tehrani, an anthropologist, and fellow researcher sara graça da silva, a folklorist, used phylogenetic methods more commonly used by biologists to come to their conclusions. Discovery reports they looked at 275 indo-european fairy tales, narrowing those down to 76 that had likely been passed down through a closely-related group and mapping those onto a \" family tree \" of indo-european languages in order to trace them back to a common ancestor. By analyzing common languages and geographical proximity, the guardian reports, the researchers determined how far back they could trace the tales. The stories we know today evolved, much like humans, the washington post explains, and the tree showed that evolution. Jack and the beanstalk, for example, is part of a group of stories the researchers called \" the boy who stole ogre's treasure, \" which can be traced back 5,000 years to when there was a language split, according to the guardian.

        "summary": "Attention, amelia earhart buffs. The miami herald has an intriguing report about how a long-forgotten photo snapped before takeoff could prove that she crash-landed on a pacific island. The photo, taken on a runway in miami in 1937, shows a shiny rectangular patch on the side of the plane that suggests a recent repair — a potential clue not visible in any other photos taken of her plane that day. Earhart investigator and tighar director ric gillespie hopes that computer analysis of the image will reveal a rivet pattern that matches up with a piece of aluminum found on the island of nikumaroro in 1991. In fact, it was gillespie's search team that found the 23-inch-long piece, which it dubbed artifact 2-2-v-1, years ago, and he viewed it as a major breakthrough in solving the mystery of where the plane went down. ( tighar released a research bulletin on the artifact in may. ) but critics soon pounced, pointing out that its rivet patterns didn't match those on earhart's lockheed plane. If, however, the scrap had been added in a last-minute, unrecorded repair, that could explain it. The herald report also notes that earhart had a rough landing in miami, and she apparently had to patch a broken rear window as a result. The window can be seen in photos from an earlier leg of the trip, but in its place in the newly surfaced photo is that shiny aluminum patch.

        "summary": "The ceo who spent $ 1.2 million renovating his office and arranged $ 3.6 billion in executive bonuses while his company, merrill lynch, was circling the toilet bowl, has just been named ceo of cit group. John thain rises to the top of a public company again a year after he was jettisoned by bank of america after it acquired merrill lynch. Thain inherits a firm struggling since former merrill colleague and ex-ceo jeffrey peek immersed the company in subprime mortage lending before its bankruptcy. If thain \" can pull this off, he's going to be the king, \" an analyst tells bloomberg. Cit is still operating under conditions tied to its 2008 federal bailout, and is barred from the commercial paper market, which has traditionally been a key source of income for the firm. Cit provides business loans to more than 3,000 companies and employs some 4,500 workers. Thain will reportedly be paid a $ 500,000 salary and receive $ 5 million in shares.",

After this story was originally posted last january, he announced plans to repay merrill for the renovations.

According to documents reviewed by the daily beast, thain spent $ 1.22 million of company money to refurbish his office at merrill lynch headquarters in lower manhattan. The biggest piece of the spending spree: $ 800,000 to hire famed celebrity designer michael smith, who is currently redesigning the white house for the obama family for just $ 100,000. Big ticket items included $ 87,000 for an area rug, four pairs of curtains for $ 28,000, a pair of guest chairs for $ 87,000 and fabric for a \" roman shade \" for $ 11,000.

        "summary": "After months of protests by the standing rock sioux tribe and their supporters, the us army corps of engineers on sunday said it would consider alternate routes for the dakota access pipeline that didn't travel under north dakota's lake oahe, effectively putting the brakes on the nearly finished pipeline's construction. What that means, how the news was received, and where we go from here: the huffington post had a photographer on the scene, and shares images of \" what victory... Looks like. \" mic similarly shares a dozen photos that show how the win was received. So what's next? the argus leader focuses on some protesters ' cry to get the 92 % -complete pipeline shut down for good, and looks at the challenging ways that could come to pass: via the tribe's court effort, due to the financial impact of a delay, or via a court battle somewhere else entirely — iowa. The protesters could be dealt a blow in short order, though, reports bustle, which looks at what's next through the lens of the environmental impact study the army has ordered. There's a court hearing this friday related to a claim brought by the company constructing the pipeline, and one possible outcome is that the court could override the army's decision. At the bbc, james cook points out that the army corps ' memorandum \" might strongly suggest that the pipeline will be re-routed but it does not actually say that will happen. \" he briefly digs into the language, and is pretty unequivocal in his expectation that a president trump will try to reverse the corps ' move. The bbc also has reaction from energy transfer partners and sunoco logistics, two companies involved, who accuse the white house of attempting to \" curry favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency. \" for deep reading, head to mother jones and dig into \" how a movement was born at standing rock. \" there, wes enzinna writes for the jan/feb issue, \" many at standing rock saw the threat of environmental catastrophe as inextricable from racial injustice, \" noting that a preliminary plan to take the pipeline through bismark was turned down by the army corps over worries about that city's water supply. \" bismark's population is 92 % white, \" notes enzinna. More deep reading: the minneapolis star tribune looks at the \" long complicated road \" and goes back to the start: \" the dispute is rooted in the fracking revolution that transformed north dakota. \"",

A playful fight with a friend nearly six decades ago in western palm beach county escalated into a more serious confrontation — and gunfire. At age 19, barrett was left partially paralyzed for the remainder of his life when he was shot in the neck in 1958 and a bullet damaged his spinal cord. The lifelong pahokee resident died in may at the age of 77. He is counted as one of palm beach county's 63 homicide victims for 2017 after the medical examiner determined last month that he died from an infection and complications related to the gunshot wound from all those years ago. Get the latest breaking news from the post according to the medical examiner's report, the person responsible for the shooting was convicted and served time in prison. The report does not identify the shooter, or say how long a sentence that person served. Court and law enforcement officials said they were unable to find information about the suspect or the shooting in their records. However, for those who knew him, barrett's life was defined not by that fateful day, but in his many accomplishments in the years that followed. \"he always told"

        "summary": "French researchers have been testing a diuretic on kids with autism, and in a study released yesterday in science, they explain why they think the drug, a version of bumetanide they have patented, has so much promise: because of their experiments with mice. As usa today explains, a chemical switch needs to be flipped in the brain at or near birth in order for the brain to develop normally; the \" flip \" changes \" the chemical gaba from stimulating electrical activity in the brain to tamping it down. \" as livescience explains, the hormone oxytocin would normally cause a switch, but it seems that in some cases, a buildup of chloride prevents the flip. Bumetanide removes salt from the body, and when the researchers administered the drug to pregnant mice and rats \" modeled for autism \" just before delivery, the flip, which seemingly wouldn't have occurred, seemingly did. The lat notes a pretty important facet of the study: the drug was tested on just two types of autism that amount to a minority of overall autism instances. Still, an autism expert calls it a \" pretty incredible finding. \" the researchers caution against administering bumetanide to all pregnant mothers, as that could be dangerous, and it's not possible to prenatally know which children will eventually develop autism. But early diagnosis is key, and they're testing their drug in kids as young as 2 ( diagnosis typically comes two years later, notes usa today ). At forbes, emily willingham pokes holes at the study, noting that, for one, \" this ' brain-protective ' action of oxytocin has been established in rodents. It has not been established in humans. If it were relevant, one would expect a strong autism signal among children born via planned cesarean section, as that generally doesn't involve oxytocin influence. \"",

An anonymous whistle-blower led government investigators to uncover the latest problem, in which control cables that had failed to pass a safety test were given fake certificates and supplied to four reactors, the country's nuclear safety and security commission said tuesday. The control cable is used to send electronic signals to a reactor's control system in the event of an accident. The commission halted operations at two reactors on tuesday so the problematic cables could be replaced.

The unified fire crew just happened to be driving underneath the 1-80 eastbound overpass, at exit 131, returning from a grass fire, when they saw a car sitting in the middle of the tunnel.

        "summary": "A new study published in science advances is being described as \" horribly bleak, \" at least as far as rhinos, camels, and elephants are concerned: it finds that the majority of the planet's giant herbivores face the risk of extinction. The wildlife ecologists write that while about 4,000 species qualify as a \" terrestrial mammalian herbivore, \" they zeroed in on just 74 such species whose mean adult body mass is 220 pounds. It's the \" first time \" just those large species have been viewed collectively, says study leader william ripple of oregon state university; per the international union for the conservation of nature, 44 of them, or about 60 %, are threatened with extinction. The researchers identified \" twin threats \": habitat change — 25 of the 74 have lost 81 % of their historical range — and hunting, with an estimated 1 billion people consuming wild meat. Their loss could have a dire ripple effect, the scientists explain: \" large herbivores are irreplaceable as seed dispersers, \" they write, \" able to... Deliver many more seeds per defecation event over longer distances \" as compared to other animals. It's one of many things they impact, from the frequency of wildfires to the creation of new channel systems in swamps. Ripple previously looked at large carnivores through the same lens and found similar issues, and he tells the bbc his latest study \" adds another nail to [ the carnivores ' ] coffin. It's no use having habitat if there's nothing left to eat in it. \" a press release notes that of the species reviewed, just one — the european bison — is found on the continent of the same name, and none in north america, thanks in part to \" prehistoric hunting. \" southeast asia, india, and africa are home to the bulk of the threatened giant herbivores.

Hundreds of teens at norman high school participated in the protests, which accused school officials of failing the three girls, reuters reports. Protesters chanted slogans like \" no justice, no class \" and \" no more bullying, \" the oklahoman reports. All three of the alleged victims have stopped attending school, classmates say. \" they don't want to come back because they don't feel safe to come back, \" says one protest organizer. She says the school suggested the girls switch high schools. A 16-year-old girl first reported the alleged attacker; afterward, two other girls said the same student had raped them. Police are investigating, they say, though the oklahoman notes that officers weren't immediately told about the allegations. Still, a police captain says that school officials have been clear and open about the case. \" the idea that we would punish a victim for being a victim is reprehensible, \" says one administrator. The alleged perpetrator, 18, has been suspended from school for the year, while a student said to have led the bullying has also been barred from school. Students are calling on the school's principal to implement new training programs and to install an advocate for victims.",

        "summary": "The second of two landmark gay rights cases is before the supreme court today, but supporters of marriage equality can take heart even if the decisions don't go their way, says new york times stats whiz nate silver. Support for gay marriage hasn't surged recently, he finds, but it has been steadily increasing since around 2004 and supporters are almost certain to be in the majority nationwide soon. Gay marriage would probably have lost in a national referendum last year, but would narrowly win in 2016, according to silver's projections. The steady rise in support means ballot initiatives to legalize gay marriage would succeed in 32 states by 2016 and in 44 states by 2020, with support above 48 % in every state except alabama and mississippi, silver projects. It is \" the steadiness of the trend that makes same-sex marriage virtually unique among all major public policy issues, and which might give its supporters more confidence that the numbers will continue to break their way regardless of what the supreme court decides, \" he writes. ( click for silver's full column. ) bill o'reilly is also surveying the landscape, and politico reports that he agrees that the wind is at the back of gay marriage advocates: \" the compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals, \" he said on his show last night; they \" just want to be treated like everybody else.

        "summary": "Scientists from the marine mammal center in northern california believe they've discovered the cause of death of a female blue whale that washed up on a marin county beach thursday, and it's a human one. Injuries found on the 79-foot whale during a necropsy conducted saturday — including 10 broken ribs, a fractured spine, and a damaged skull — indicate that the mammal was struck by a ship, reports sfgate. A local scientist posted a graphic photo of the researchers examining what he called \" blue whale road kill, \" writing, \" only through teamwork can researchers @calacademy find the cause of death, but looks like it was a ship. \" barbie halaska tells the mercury news some cargo ships wouldn't even notice a collision with a 300,000-pound blue whale because \" these are huge boats. \" \" people who have come into port with whales on the bow of their ships have told us they had no idea, \" she says. Sfgate calls whale-ship collisions a \" leading cause \" of death for the creatures; the mercury news notes another blue whale that was struck washed ashore in the area just this october, though scientists say they more often sink to the ocean floor following a ship strike. This latest blue whale was well-known to researchers, having been first identified in 1999 and seen on 11 more occasions by the scientific community. Halaska says the research being conducted around its death can help change conditions for the future when it comes to things like shipping routes and speeds. ( it turns out there's a simple reason why blue whales got so huge. )",

A lucrative practice has sprung up in washington, in which hedge funds and other investors pay handsomely for private meetings with top lawmakers or their aides, who give them an early scoop on market-moving news, the wall street journal reports. On dec. 8, 2009, for example, several hedge funds learned of a health care reform deal that would kill the public option — and hence boost shares of private insurers — hours before the public did. That meeting was set up by jnk securities, which until recently charged clients $ 10,000 each for such meetings. That ended when insider higher ed confronted sen. Tom harkin about one sit-down last year, causing him to cancel; since then, jnk has simply insisted clients trade through it, paying it commissions, if they use info obtained in the meeting. The practice is totally legal, though rep. Louise slaughter has sponsored a bill to outlaw it. Some lawmakers back the bill, but others defend the practice, saying they use the meetings to gather insight from investors. Click to read the entire piece.",

When men strongly conform to social masculine norms, they're more likely to suffer from ailments such as depression — and the more they cling to these norms, the less likely they are to seek help for those mental health problems. So find researchers with the american psychological association, who've published a meta analysis in the journal of counseling psychology. Reviewing nearly 20,000 participants involved in more than 78 research samples, the researchers found a link between mental health and conformity to 11 norms, including the desire to win, violence, the need for emotional control, and risk-taking. Three norms in particular — self reliance, sexual promiscuity, and power over women — had a significantly strong link to negative mental health in men, reports new york magazine. \" sexism is not merely a social injustice, but may also have a detrimental effect on the mental health of those who embrace such attitudes, \" the lead researcher says in a eureka alert news release. A post at popular science notes the gray area involved in some of the norms: \" it's not hard to see the appeal of being self-reliant, for example, \" but the problem is that if men put too much emphasis on this for fear of looking weak then they won't seek help in times of genuine trouble. ( boys who shun hyper-masculinity appear happier, too. )",

Along those lines: the main coalition of protest groups says it will leave tahrir square after three weeks but called for weekly demonstrations to maintain pressure on the military for promised reform, reports ap. In a televised statement, the military pledged to hand over power to a democratically elected civilian government and to abide by all international treaties. It asked the current government, recently appointed by hosni mubarak, to stay in place until a transitional one can be formed. Not all the protesters are leaving, apparently. One tells the washington post: \" this is a revolution, not a half-revolution. We need a timetable for elections. We need an interim government. We need a committee for a new constitution.

For starters, old-fashioned iodized salt has increasingly been replaced by exotic seasonings, a trend that makes the simple salt shaker a thing of the past. \" the days of those nasty little salt shakers with the ancient grains of rice are long gone, \" josh capon of bowery meat co. Tells bloomberg. The rise of the celebrity chef has also hurt, with chefs feeling protective of their carefully crafted dishes made with the best ingredients. For some restaurants, it's just a matter of simplifying the table. Salt shakers clutter things up, particularly if there are many shared dishes and small plates. Plain table salt has also been muscled aside by sexy designer rivals, such as pink himalayan salt. The exotic pink crystals, often mined in pakistan, get their color from trace minerals, like magnesium, potassium, and calcium, which look nice in a grinder but aren't any healthier, reports time. Some upscale restaurants are offering exotic salts in grinders, or better still, little bowls, but the little bowls are problematic because they have to be replaced after each customer to avoid transmitting germs. \" you're not going to keep salt on the table that someone you don't know touched, \" says one restaurant owner. \" that's gross. \" another problem with the little bowls is that they tend to mysteriously vanish when the customer leaves. \" people like small things, \" observes capon.",

The thing: pink himalayan salt is made from rock crystals of salt that have been mined from areas close to the himalayas, often in pakistan. It gets its rosy hue from trace minerals in the salt, like magnesium, potassium and calcium. Pink salt is often found as smaller crystals in salt grinders, as large, glowing pink or orange chunks in pink himalayan salt lamps and in the walls of \"salt chambers \" at spas that promise an instant detox. The hype: people claim the salt does all kinds of things. It's rumored to be healthier for its greater concentration of trace elements.

They stretch from nihoa island, northwest of the main hawaiian islands, to kure atoll, northwest of midway. These islands, atolls and banks are remnants of volcanic islands, originally similar to the volcanoes of the main hawaiian islands, which have eroded and subsided beneath the ocean surface. Geologically, the main hawaiian islands and the northwest hawaiian islands make up the hawaiian archipelago, which was formed by active volcanism that continues today on the island of hawai'i. The main hawaiian islands lie at the southeastern end of the hawaiian archipelago, with the uninhabited northwest hawaiian islands extending toward asia. The nwhi are uninhabited except for seasonal field camps on a few islands and a small year-round population on midway. The coral reef ecosystems of the nwhi are unique in that they are some of the healthiest, most undisturbed coral reefs remaining in the world. The nwhi may be the last large-scale predator-dominated coral reef ecosystem on the planet. In 2000 executive order 13178 created the nwhi coral reef ecosystem reserve ( crer ) and included conservation measures to restrict some activities throughout the crer. The region's protected status was permanently signed into law in 2006 through presidential proclamation 8031, which established",

It's a recessive trait and rare, so it's unlikely to occur often — unless there's inbreeding involved, as was the case with the fugates.

Police say she had done online research on children dying in hot cars and on the day her son, cooper, died, she calmly said, \" ross must have left him in the car. There's no other explanation, \" after being told he had never arrived at day care, the atlanta journal-constitution finds. When she was briefly reunited with her husband at the police station, police say she asked him \" did you say too much? \" some of her remarks at her son's funeral also raised eyebrows. As her husband listened in from jail, she said she wouldn't bring cooper back even if she could. \" he's in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is, \" she said. The 30-year-old has shown little emotion at court hearings and legal experts aren't sure whether she will end up being charged as a co-conspirator or used as a witness against her husband, which georgia law permits in cases involving the death of a child. In other developments: horrifying details of the boy's death emerged at a bond hearing a few days ago, reports the new york daily news. A police officer testified that the little boy had desperately struggled to free himself from the car seat inside the hot suv. Scratch marks on the boy's face and abrasions on the back of his head are signs of a frantic effort to get out of the seat. Search warrants released the next day stated that the belts were at the tightest setting. At the same hearing, it emerged that justin ross harris had exchanged explicit messages and photos with six women as his son baked to death. Investigators say harris appeared to be trying to cover his tracks on all three computers he used, and they have only \" scratched the surface \" in their search for deleted files. \" people think ' well, this is a cell phone. Once i delete a picture or text message or my contacts, it's gone, ' \" a computer forensics expert tells nbc 11. \" no.

With a contested convention now appearing to be a real possibility, the trump and cruz campaigns are moving to shut out the ohio governor, who won his home state on tuesday and who has pinned his hopes on the convention, politico reports. Campaign aides say the combined trump and cruz delegates will be able to set the rules at a contested convention — and kasich is unlikely to meet the threshold of having won eight states or territories, a rule that was introduced at the 2012 convention. But kasich may have an ace in the hole: bloomberg reports that his campaign has hired veteran gop operatives stu spencer and charlie black, who helped gerald ford defeat ronald reagan in 1976 at the last contested gop convention. Trump, meanwhile — who won three out of five states on tuesday and appears poised for victory in a close race in missouri as well — might be able to amass an outright majority of delegates and avoid a contested convention if the race remains split three ways, according to the new york times. He has split the delegates with cruz in some close races, but in many of the \" blue states \" still to vote, trump has a solid lead, with the opposition split evenly between cruz and kasich.

            "Orlando, fla. -- by the time herman cain took the stage, jesus had already been crucified, resurrected and returned to earth to collect the faithful once that day. Cain made a campaign stop friday at the holy land experience, a christian-theme amusement park in central florida where visitors pay $ 35 to watch a reenactment of the crucifixion and resurrection of christ just minutes from disney world. In the park, which is run by the religious television station trinity broadcasting network, employees dressed as shepherd boys, pharisees, roman soldiers and merchants from first-century israel lead the faithful on tours through the re-created streets of old jerusalem, perform re-enactment shows and serve as baristas in the coffee shop. Over the course of a day at holy land, you can take communion -- fed to you from the hand of a bearded actor playing christ with flowing brown hair -- browse an impressive collection of early bibles, rock out to praise-song karaoke, get baptized and even have your picture taken with jesus on a harley. And on this day, you can meet herman cain. Entering the park, i ' m greeted by a girl in her 20s wearing a traditional jewish headdress tapping away on a computer keyboard with freshly painted nails. A poster with cain's face is taped to the front window. She rings up my ticket and i stumble upon a first-century city street swarming with actors dressed in ancient garb. \" crucifixion's at 2: 30, \" a robed disciple/greeter says as i walk in, pointing toward an amphitheater. \" you ' ll want to get there early to get good seats. \" \" will we have time to see herman cain? \" i ask"

According to gizmodo, 195 countries signed a climate pact on saturday to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. In two decades of climate conferences, this is the first to end in a successful agreement. \"our text is the best possible balance, a balance which is powerful yet delicate, which will enable each delegation, each group of countries, with his head held high, having achieved something important, \" french foreign minister laurent fabius says. After the pact — the first to legally commit all countries to reducing carbon emissions — was signed, delegates from the 195 countries rose for a standing ovation, the bbc reports. The final agreement represents a compromise between developed and developing countries. Gizmodo reports it calls for nations to keep global warming \" well below \" 2 degrees celsius, with 1.5 degrees as a target. Countries \" already feeling the impacts of climate change \" had pushed for the lower limit. Developed countries will commit $ 100 billion per year to help developing countries, though that commitment isn't legally binding. According to the bbc, nations will have to report on their progress every five years. Gizmodo notes the most optimistic portion of the final agreement is a section calling for net zero carbon emissions sometime in the second half of the 21st century. Wired reports two items not included in the pact are a reduction of air travel and shipping — which account for more than 5 % of greenhouse gasses — and reparations for poor countries hurt by climate change.",

But can cancer ever be completely defeated? researchers at kiel univ.

Thomas bosch in his latest research results. The study by an international team led by bosch was published in nature communications. The so-called cancer genes are ancient the causes of tumors are the so-called cancer genes. The question of when evolution started producing tumors is an issue that the scientists tomislav domazet-lošo and diethard tautz from the max planck institute for evolutionary biology in plön have been investigating for several years, using bio-informational methods and databases that they have developed in-house. \"during the search for the origin of the cancer gene,"

The first discovery of its kind comes from the grave of a man aged about 35 — possibly a shaman, reports discover — buried 2,400 to 2,800 years ago in turpan, china, then a desert oasis along the silk road. Said to have caucasian features, the body was found on a wooden bed with a reed pillow and an \" extraordinary cache \" of 13 cannabis plants placed diagonally across the chest, each almost 3 feet long, reports national geographic. Archaeologists have found cannabis leaves and seeds in other ancient burials, but never whole plants. This is also the first time archaeologists have seen cannabis used as a burial shroud, study author hongen jiang explains in economic botany. A few flowering heads on the plants — all others had been cut off — held unripe fruit, suggesting the man was buried in late summer. Researchers believe the cannabis was also fresh, meaning it was grown locally. Why exactly was the subeixi culture of turpan growing cannabis? researchers say they could have made hemp cloth or used the seeds for food. More likely, though, they extracted resin containing cannabinoids like thc from the plant's tiny \" hairs \" to use in medicine or in ritual, \" possibly to facilitate communication between the human and spirit worlds, \" per npr.

When the last such atlas was created 15 years ago, the number of humans who couldn't see the milky way was one in five. \" and it's a shame that they can't, \" elvidge tells usa today. Researchers found 83 % of all people live in area with light light pollution, the los angeles times reports. In the us, 99 % of people live under light-polluted night skies, and 80 % of north americans can't see the milky way. \"humanity has enveloped our planet in a luminous fog that prevents most of the earth's population from having the opportunity to observe our galaxy, \" the paper states. Researchers found the worst light pollution in the world was in singapore, where the sky never gets truly dark, resembling twilight even in the middle of the night. \" the entire population lives under skies so bright that the eye cannot fully dark-adapt to night vision, \" npr quotes the paper as saying. To really get away from light pollution, try traveling to chad, central african republic, or madagascar. Light pollution can have negative environmental effects like any other pollution, from affecting bird migration to changing the circadian rhythms of humans, contributing to obesity, depression, and more.
