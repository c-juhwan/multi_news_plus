They invented anelloni, whose name is based on the italian word for ring, as a way of studying ring-shaped polymers, phys.org reports. Polymers, the site notes, are the \" building blocks of plastics. \" ring-shaped polymers can get very tangled, just like the new pasta does — unlike spaghetti, for instance, whose individual strands can usually be pulled out of a plate of the stuff, davide michieletto explains in a video. \" make yourself a bowl of anelloni and it's likely to have gone cold by the time you've pulled all the rings apart and struggled your way to the messy end, \" michieletto and matthew turner write. Ring-shaped polymers are \" one of the last big mysteries in polymer physics, \" the experts note. They believe that further investigation of these polymers could lead to \" a new state of matter, which we have called a'topological glass. ' \" it's based on the idea that ring-shaped polymers move so slowly together that they could seem to be \" frozen in place. \" topological glass could spur the development of new kinds of building materials, they suggest. The two made the new pasta using linguine, and you can try making it using their recipe, they note at physics world. ( jackson pollock's work offers another way to show how physics works. )",

It paid only an annual fee of $ 524 for the privilege. Oh, and its permit to do so expired 27 years ago. The desert sun reports three environmental groups sued the us forest service tuesday for allowing nestle to continue drawing water without a valid permit. \" it's this whole privatization of public resources and profiteering off the stuff that all of us are supposed to own collectively, \" says the executive director of the courage campaign institute, one of the groups suing the forest service. The environmental groups don't believe nestle's activities would be allowed if the permit — issued in 1978 — had been forced to go through a modern environmental review process, according to the los angeles times. The forest service claims it hasn't reviewed nestle's old permit because it's been busy with other things and lacks the funding, the sun reports. But it did let nestle rebuild a damaged pipeline in 2003. The official who allowed that has since retired from the forest service to join nestle as a paid consultant. The forest service announced in august that it would be starting the renewal process for nestle's permit, but it's letting nestle use the old permit in the meantime and has given no firm date for when the renewal process will actually take place. According to the times, environmentalists claim nestle's removal of water from the san bernardino national forest is threatening the habitats of birds, fish, snakes, and frogs. Nestle has five bottling plants in california and uses about 705 million gallons of the state's water per year.",

        "summary": "President trump hailed the supreme court's decision to partially reinstate his travel ban as a \" clear victory \" on monday, but the practical applications are a little murkier. That's largely because of the limitation the court applied: the ban, it said, can't affect anyone with \" a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united states. \" the reinstated ban could be back in effect as soon as thursday morning, but just how big of an impact will it have? here's a look at coverage: six nations: the president's ban singles out visitors from iran, sudan, syria, libya, somalia, and yemen, but they may not be greatly affected because of the court's limitation, reports the guardian. That's because the vast majority of these visitors have family members in the us, which would seemingly qualify as a \" bona fide relationship. \" for example: nbc news reports that of the 12,998 immigrants who came from yemen last year, 12,563 had family in the us, per the state department. Refugees: their fate is much more unclear. Specifically, does a relationship with a us resettlement agency qualify as \" bona fide \"? it might depend on how strictly government lawyers interpret the decision, notes nbc. Tourists: if they're from the six nations listed above, they're almost certainly out of luck. Key definition: the new york times reiterates that much of the gray area revolves around the definition of \" bona fide relationship. \" for example, \" if a vacationer has a reservation at a hotel in the united states, does that qualify as a ' bona fide relationship? ' \" the answer might not be clear until the us bans somebody from coming and the case winds up in court. Court examples: in their decision, the justices said that in addition to those with a \" close familial relationship, \" others exempted could be workers who've accepted a job in the us, students accepted to an american university, and lecturers invited to address a us audience. The ap, however, thinks administration lawyers may take a hard line and seek to block academics and lecturers. Scientists: international researchers hoping to work in the us are essentially in limbo right now given the vagueness of the language, reports scientific american. \" we're back into a wait-and-see pattern, \" says one immigration lawyer.'stigma ': all in all, the practical impact should be limited, becca heller, director of the international refugee assistance project, tells the new yorker",

Al mana, 41, is worth significantly more than jackson, 50, and prenups typically allot more money to the spouse the longer the marriage goes on; they usually include 5- and 10-year marks at which more money is doled out.

She believes jean kasem took casey from his santa monica nursing home to an indian reservation in washington state, or perhaps even into canada. A judge on monday appointed kerri kasem her father's temporary caretaker, and ordered an investigation into casey kasem's whereabouts. Meanwhile, more details of casey kasem's medical condition are coming out: he has not just parkinson's but lewy body dementia, which can cause visual hallucinations, the washington post reports. Kerri kasem says she's worried he's not getting adequate medical care, because he can barely speak and requires a feeding tube and 24-hour care. Other family members and friends expressed similar fears to the hollywood reporter, and kasem's first wife calls jean kasem a \" horrible woman \" and says casey kasem is \" literally afraid of her. \"",

        "summary": "Cats are fluffy little creatures that like playing with string and lying on their backs for a tummy rub. They're also neurotic predators that might suddenly kill you if only they were bigger, according to one interpretation of a study on cats. The study, by university of edinburgh researchers working with a number of zoos ( including the bronx zoo ), analyzed the personalities of domestic cats and various wildcats using the so-called \" big five \" personality traits found in people — openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion/introversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, 9news reports. In the end, researchers concluded that 100 domesticated cats in two scottish shelters shared the same three personality traits as african lions. Those traits are neuroticism, impulsiveness, and dominance, cnet reports. In other words, your unpredictable, neurotic, dominance-minded cat \" would probably consider killing you \" if only it were more lion-sized, as 9news puts it. \" if you're standing among a pride of lions, sometimes you ' ll be fine and other times they will pounce and attack for no reason, \" psychologist max wachtel tells the bbc. \" and it's the same for little domestic house cats, \" though they're \" harmless, basically, \" he says. Study author marieke gartner agrees with the harmless part. She tells cnet it's \" a pretty far stretch \" to suggest your cat wants to kill you. In her view, \" cats don't want to bump you off, but people often don't know how to treat them and then are surprised by their behavior. \" ( scientists have determined how you should pet your cat. )",

In what the san diego union-tribune calls \" a jaw-dropping blunder, \" city work crews were clearing a homeless encampment with police approval on dec. 22 when a tent with a person inside was hurled into a garbage truck. The individual \" avoided being crushed to death by mere seconds \" as crews took notice of flailing arms and screams, per the union-tribune. The person then got out of the truck and walked away before crews could offer help or learn the person's identity. Following an investigation, environmental services deputy director angela colton, a 17-year city employee, was terminated friday, per the union-tribune, which notes the city only acknowledged the incident a month later. Director mario sierra says new rules will also require a supervisor be present for clearings, police activation of body cameras on the scene, and photographs of waste, including emptied tents, to \" ensure no individuals are present, \" per the guardian. Crews will also be given quarterly training and \" appropriate tools \" to sort through bulky items, sierra says. While san diego is in the midst of a housing crisis, the guardian reports it \" found numerous examples of homeless people being compacted inside trash-collection trucks \" during a us investigation in december. Just this week, a homeless man sleeping in a dumpster in brockton, mass., was thrown into a garbage truck when it lifted the container, reports enterprise news.

According to city officials, who confirmed the events from last month after being questioned by the san diego union-tribune, the individual walked away before work crews could offer assistance — or even collect a name and other information. \"this was a terrible incident and all involved were shaken by what occurred, \" paz gomez, deputy chief operating officer, said in an emailed statement. \"based on initial accounts, city staff and the city's abatement contractor tried to follow up with the individual but the person immediately left the scene and couldn"

Fox news reports on marc rubin's lawsuit, which the 57-year-old filed sept. 27 in florida's orange county circuit court, and which outlines how he claims a disney employee marred his marriage proposal plans. Per his suit, rubin was planning to ask for his girlfriend's hand in marriage in front of cinderella castle on that summer day, but as he was looking for just the right spot to do it, he says he was approached by park worker nicole guzman-ortiz, 24. Per an arrest report, guzman-ortiz says she asked rubin to move three feet to make way for a soon-to-start parade and he refused; in his suit, rubin says he was waiting for minors he was with to come back from the concession stand and needed to stay in place for \" legitimate safety concerns. \" per the arrest report on the ensuing argument, guzman-ortiz says rubin then threatened to make sure she was fired and yanked on her shirt collar when she tried to leave, newsday notes. A manager who arrived on the scene told police he didn't see rubin grab guzman-ortiz's collar, but he did witness rubin's \" arrogance \"; he says rubin grabbed his shirt as well. Rubin was arrested for misdemeanor battery, pleaded no contest to a disorderly conduct charge, and paid a $ 100 fine, plus court costs. His claim, which asks for at least $ 15,000 in damages and other costs, notes he's also suing for negligence, claiming the park didn't release surveillance footage that would've shown he never touched anyone. \" the safety of the people who work in and visit our parks is very important to us, \" a disney rep says in a statement. \" we will respond to the allegations as appropriate in court. \"",

The baltimore sun reports that an all-woman jury, after less than three hours of deliberation, awarded korryn gaines'son, kodi, who was 5 at the time of the incident and injured during it, with more than $ 32 million in damages, while his younger sister, karsyn, received $ 4.5 million. Gaines ' mother and father received about $ 600,000 in total, while her estate was awarded $ 300,000. Punitive damages weren't given, and the sun notes that due to caps on local government liability in maryland, the family may not receive the full amounts of their awards, said to be among the biggest ever awarded against the baltimore police. What helped decide the case: the first shot fired by one of the officers, royce ruby, which the jury decided was not reasonable. The jury said the gaineses ' civil rights were violated during the incident and that police had committed battery against her and kodi, per the new york times; karsyn wasn't in the apartment at the time. A baltimore county attorney said in a statement that the county was \" disappointed \" in the decision and mulling an appeal. \" a mother died, a child was unintentionally injured, and police officers were placed in mortal danger. By any account, this was a tragic situation, \" he notes. Gaines ' mother, rhanda dormeus, also reacted. \" this win is for all of my sisters in the movement who have lost their children to police violence, \" she told reporters after the verdict, per the sun.",

Centered over iceland, the storm that's responsible — the same system that brought december tornadoes to texas — could end up being one of the top five storms ever recorded in that north atlantic region, writes andrew freedman at mashable. It will be a \" meteorological marvel, \" he writes. \" in a region famous for ship-sinking waves and relentless blizzards, this storm may stand out for its sheer intensity. \" expect 230mph winds \" roaring across the north atlantic at aircraft cruising altitudes, \" and lots more rain for an already soaked uk. And though this is a strong el nino year, that's probably not the cause here, writes holthaus, noting that el nino generally has little influence on europe. \" this, more than any other extreme weather event in a remarkable year for the climate, feels like something new. \" climate blogger robert scribbler gets into the specifics of the \" daisy chain \" that's at play involving two other low-pressure systems in the north atlantic, and he adds that it \" reeks of a human-forced warming of the earth's climate. \" holthaus, too, is worried about the same, writing that storms like this one will go a long way toward making dire predictions of an ice-free arctic within decades come true.

Well, that was considered entertainment in ancient rome — and now experts have reconstructed a wooden machine like ones that once raised leopards, bears, lions, and elephants into rome's colosseum, the telegraph reports. Designers unveiled it at the colosseum friday, raising a modern dancer \" who twisted and turned in animal-like fashion, \" says the new york times. Makers of a pbs documentary on the project, colosseum: roman death trap, also had an adult male wolf pulled up, but the animal got a biscuit to snack on, not a person. \" it was the first time that a wild animal had been released into the colosseum in 1,500 years, \" says gary glassman, who directed the film. \" i would love to have used a lion, but there were obvious safety issues involved, \" he adds. The impressive wooden elevator took 18 months to build, rises 23 feet from the bowels of the colosseum's remains, and can easily lift about 660 pounds. Builders based their design on ancient texts as well as rope marks, carved holes for posts, and bronze fittings found in the tunnel network. The pulley will remain as a piece of cultural heritage and a money-maker for tourism. Ancient romans built 28 such structures and mounted incredible displays, including games in 81ad that featured the slaughter of some 9,000 animals. About a million were killed before the last such recorded event in 523ad, the independent reports. \" the question it poses is, how could such an advanced culture have staged such bloody spectacles? \" says glassman.

The host of the dinner, who was paying the bill, told lentini to choose. Lentini told the waitress he didn't know much about wine and asked her to recommend \" something decent \"; she pointed to a bottle and lentini, who wasn't wearing his glasses, asked how much. Her reponse: \" thirty-seven fifty. \" imagine the group's surprise, then, when their bill totaled more than $ 4,700 — because the wine, screaming eagle's oakville 2011, actually cost $ 3,750.

After a rep confirmed that swift wrote the song, harris went on a twitter rant wednesday: first he was nice: \" and she sings on a little bit of it too. Amazing lyric writer and she smashed it as usual \" then he was a little defensive: \" i wrote the music, produced the song, arranged it and cut the vocals though. And initially she wanted it kept secret, hence the pseudonym \" then the unhappiness started creeping in: \" hurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make me look bad at this stage though \" then things started getting real: \" i figure if you're happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do \" then he addressed swift directly: \" i know you're off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like katy etc but i ' m not that guy, sorry. I won't allow it. \" and: \" please focus on the positive aspects of your life because you've earned a great one \" then he dropped the mic: \" god bless everyone have a beautiful day \" that \" katy \" line is, of course, a reference to this.",

            "There are always going to be feuds in the world of rock and roll. Metallica and megadeth. Creed versus everyone ever. Jack white verses the black keys. And now we have taylor swift versus katy perry. Of course, the definition of rock and roll has swayed quite a bit there, but like taylor sings, \" haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. \" and it seems that taylor is one of the haters. Let's dissect this rivalry. Even though tay and katy seem like night and day, they both shared a love for the one and only john mayer. Which seems completely out there. Mayer clearly doesn't have a type. To be able to dance around in that guy's head for a day would be a delight. But what's fueling the feud between swift and perry even more is some thievery. Yes, thievery! we could surmise the thievery first began when katy began dating mayer after taylor did. Because of course it did -- you can't be just out of your teens and that well adjusted that you take breakups in stride and not hate on the new girlfriend. Unless you are one of those kinds of teens without the emotion thing. Clearly, tay is not. Maybe tay expected john to write a song about her and beg for her back. Just like jake gyllenhaal did minus the song until she finally had to sing \" we are never getting back together like ever \" for the umpteenth time. When that didn't happen, and john took up with katy, it was katy hating time. Apparently katy was super smiley and nice to taylor whenever they would run into each other at the places megastars run into each other -- award shows and such. But that just made taylor suspicious and wonder if katy was being real or a fake. Because as we all know she also sings in \" shake it off, \" \" fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake. \" which gets me thinking about this line in the same song: my ex-man brought his new girlfriend / she's like \" oh, my god! \" but i ' m just gonna shake. Is that ex man mayer and the new girlfriend katy?!?!?! i think so! pass the popcorn! this is an after-school special of the finest variety! taylor is being a bit hypocritical though. She's not shaking",

        "summary": "President trump's public comments this week have made one thing crystal clear: september is going to be a very big month for the us. Congress faces a sept. 30 deadline to pass a funding deal to avoid a shutdown, and trump has thrown a wrench into things by demanding serious money for a border wall. But in a deadline with more serious consequences, congress also must raise the debt ceiling around the end of september or the us could default on its debt, reports the wall street journal. The issues are separate, but they're likely to get lumped together, and not much goodwill is circulating at the moment. In addition to his shutdown threat, trump on thursday blamed paul ryan and mitch mcconnell for the debt ceiling \" mess. \" related coverage: chances of a shutdown: flip a coin. A goldman sachs advisory to investors puts the odds at 50-50, but axios has a gop source who thinks there's a 75 % chance of a shutdown: \" the peculiar part is that almost everyone i talk to on the hill agrees that it is more likely than not. \" better odds on debt ceiling: \" we're going to get the debt ceiling passed, \" said treasury chief steven mnuchin this week, per bloomberg. ( he wants a \" clean \" increase with no strings attached. ) at the same event in kentucky, mcconnell said there is \" zero chance — no chance — we won't raise the debt ceiling. No chance. \" unless: yes, the budget and the debt ceiling are separate, but because the deadlines are so close together, they could become \" entangled \" in negotiations, per the new york times. For example, bloomberg notes that house conservatives are demanding big spending cuts in return for lifting the ceiling. Consequences: if the ceiling isn't raised and the us defaults on its debt, it would rock financial markets around the world, explains nbc news. Also, ratings agencies could downgrade the us. At the wall street journal, james mackintosh writes that he finds \" it hard to believe that the us will default, \" but he explains that the mere possibility is already making investors nervous. How we got here: the washington post notes that, in 2015, president obama and congress agreed to suspend the debt ceiling decision until march of this year, and emergency measures have extended it since then. But mnuchin runs out of tricks next month. The story also points out the contrast in trump's tweet about the \" mess \" and mnuchin's public attempt to ease fears and notes that trump has",

Mark meadows and jim jordan are among 11 republican lawmakers who filed a resolution wednesday calling for rosenstein to be impeached, the washington post reports. The men, allies of president trump, are accusing rosenstein of withholding information about the special counsel's russia investigation from congress, amid other misconduct. Politico reports that they filed the articles of impeachment hours after meeting with justice department officials to discuss demands for documents. \" we're tired of the justice department giving us the finger and not giving us the information we're entitled to to do our constitutional duty, \" jordan said on fox news wednesday night. But with house speaker paul ryan among those opposed, the resolution is unlikely to go as far as a vote. \" even if it does get a vote, and even if mr. Rosenstein is impeached, two-thirds of the senate would have to support removing him after a trial in the chamber, \" says the bbc's anthony zurcher. \" the chances of that — which would require a significant number of democrats in favor — are less than zero. \" rep.

The articles, filed late wednesday by reps. Mark meadows ( r-n.c. ) and jim jordan ( r-ohio ) — two top allies of president donald trump — blast rosenstein for what they allege was a failure to respond to congressional document demands. Senior justice department officials have rejected the criticism and described historic levels of cooperation with congress to share files connected to the fbi investigations of hillary clinton's email server and trump campaign contacts with russia. Story continued below though the move marks an escalation by trump allies against rosenstein, who has drawn trump's ire for appointing mueller last year, meadows sidestepped a procedural move that could have forced the issue to a vote this week and laid bare divisions among republicans. Instead, the house is leaving thursday for a five-week recess and it's unclear whether conservatives will attempt to force the issue when lawmakers return in september. Meadows and jordan's decision to file the articles of impeachment came hours after they huddled with top justice department officials at the capitol to discuss lingering demands for documents. Other lawmakers in the meeting had described progress and rejected the notion of impeaching rosenstein, but meadows and jordan said they remained dissatisfied. \"the doj is keeping information from congress. Enough is enough, \" jordan said in a statement. \" it's time to hold mr. Rosenstein accountable for blocking congress's constitutional oversight role. \" the justice department had no immediate comment on the effort. Speaker paul ryan ( r-wis. ) has previously rejected calls to impeach rosenstein. He recently described to dispute over justice department documents as a \"compliance \" matter that was well on the way to being resolved.

Mark meadows ( r-n.c. ) and jim jordan ( r-ohio ) — two top allies of president donald trump — blast rosenstein for what they allege was a failure to respond to congressional document demands. Senior justice department officials have rejected the criticism and described historic levels of cooperation with congress to share files connected to the fbi investigations of hillary clinton's email server and trump campaign contacts with russia. Story continued below though the move marks an escalation by trump allies against rosenstein, who has drawn trump's ire for appointing mueller last year, meadows sidestepped a procedural move that could have forced the issue to a vote this week and laid bare divisions among republicans. Instead, the house is leaving thursday for a five-week recess and it's unclear whether conservatives will attempt to force the issue when lawmakers return in september. Meadows and jordan's decision to file the articles of impeachment came hours after they huddled with top justice department officials at the capitol to discuss lingering demands for documents. Other lawmakers in the meeting had described progress and rejected the notion of impeaching rosenstein, but meadows and jordan said they remained dissatisfied. \"the doj is keeping information from congress. Enough is enough, \" jordan said in a statement. \" it's time to hold mr. Rosenstein accountable for blocking congress's constitutional oversight role. \" the justice department had no immediate comment on the effort. Speaker paul ryan ( r-wis. ) has previously rejected calls to impeach rosenstein. He recently described to dispute over justice department documents as a \"compliance \" matter that was well on the way to being resolved. Without gop leaders'support, it's unlikely an impeachment bid could pass the house — and even if it did, it would be doomed in the senate, where a two-thirds vote"

She'd even joked on twitter about the dire warnings she'd received. Police don't think the bandits set out to rob her specifically. \" the gang operates like pirates and go out in a canoe looking and hunting for the chance to steal, \" says a police official, per metro.

Scientists used lidar data from the australian navy to create the \" most complete, high-resolution spatial mapping \" of the area. It revealed a field of massive rings three times larger than what was previously believed to be there, the christian science monitor reports. The rings are known as bioherms. They're made when algae called halimeda die and turn into limestone flakes. According to a press release, the bioherms — formed over 10,000 years — can be nearly 1,000 feet across with holes up to 32 feet deep. So how did a giant field of huge calcified doughnuts go undiscovered for so long? they're located deeper underwater than the structures of the great barrier reef, with the tops of the bioherms not starting until 65 to 164 feet below the surface, abc reports. \" it's not a typical, easily accessible place where scuba divers would be diving, \" researcher mardi mcneil says. Another researcher, dr. Robin beaman, says they were \" amazed \" by the find.

That's what the maori of new zealand accuse a playboy model of doing atop mount taranaki, a volcano that the maori consider an ancestor. New zealand native jaylene cook, 25 — who appeared in playboy mexico in january — climbed the mountain on april 26, stripped off her clothes, then posed for a photo showing her looking out over the clouds, reports the bbc. Cook says she and her photographer boyfriend were aware of the significance of taranaki and \" wanted to embrace the mountain in the purest form we could, \" per maori television. She believes the photo, shared with her 300,000 instagram followers, was empowering. The maori not so much. \" it's like someone went into st. Peter's basilica in the vatican and took a nude photo, \" says a rep for the local tribe, calling the whole incident \" just very inappropriate. \" a local mayor agrees, noting it's the location of the photo that's offensive. As a government website explains, \" the crater and summit is the sacred head of taranaki... Respect the mountain. Do not stand directly on the summit stone. \" but cook tells stuff.co.nz she and her boyfriend \" were quite respectful \" and specifically avoided that summit. \" being nude is not something that is offensive in any way, \" she adds.

The best time of year to attempt the summit without alpine equipment is february to mid april. Always check with the egmont national park visitor centre for up to date information as conditions can change suddenly. Warning thick cloud can descend suddenly on the mountain anytime, making navigation very difficult - turn back.

        "summary": "At a lake in venezuela, a nine-hour display of thousands of flashes of lightning — averaging 28 strokes a minute — is the norm, with the concentration hitting its peak in the october rainy season, reports the bbc. And though the mountain village of kifuka in dr congo has long been hailed the most electric place on earth, lake maracaibo in venezuela is living up to its nicknames ( including \" everlasting storm \" ) and folklore ( colonial sailors are said to have used the light displays, visible for as many as 250 miles, for navigation ). In fact it's recently earned a spot in the guinness book of world records for being home to the \" highest concentration of lightning \" on the planet, with lightning striking up to 300 days a year and often thousands of times each of those days. In other places a high frequency of lightning is more seasonal, reports earth sky. So why do some places — especially along the equator — get so much lightning and others — like the north and south poles — hardly any? scientists have been using satellite imaging to compile this nasa map of the world's lightning hot spots, and a prevailing theory is that places like kifuka and lake maracaibo tout a unique topography that generates wind as well as heating and cooling patterns conducive to thunderstorms. And when water droplets in rising humid air collide with ice crystals in cold air, static electricity flashes its way to the ground or inside clouds. In the coming years, a network of geostationary satellites could provide continuous measurements of lightning around the world. For now, the world wide lightning location network uses ground sensors to track lightning's high-frequency signals and showcases a real-time display.

        "summary": "Stonehenge may reside in england, but it \" was a welsh monument from its very beginning. \" so says professor mike parker pearson in reference to what is a big step forward in our understanding of stonehenge, reports the bbc. His team's research, published monday in the journal antiquity, establishes the source of the monument's \" bluestones, \" the smaller of its stones, which for nine decades were known to generally hail from the preseli hills in wales. Now, scientists say they know exactly where in wales they came from: the \" spotted dolerite \" bluestones hail from carn goedog, while the \" rhyolite \" were extracted from craig rhos-y-felin, reports phys.org. The burnt hazelnuts and charcoal that persist as remnants of millennia-old campfires at the quarries further flesh out the tale of the rocks. \" we have dates of around 3400 bc for craig rhos-y-felin and 3200 bc for carn goedog, which is intriguing because the bluestones didn't get put up at stonehenge until around 2900 bc, \" says parker pearson per phys.org. \" it could have taken those neolithic stone-draggers nearly 500 years to get them to stonehenge, but that's pretty improbable. \" his theory: the stones were put to use in a local monument, which was latter disassembled. His team suspects the remnants of that monument could sit between the two quarries; \" we may find something big in 2016, \" says one scientist. If they do, parker pearson believes it could reveal \" the mystery of why stonehenge was built and why some of its stones were brought so far. \" one theory he shares with the guardian: that it's a \" monument of unification, bringing together people from across the many parts of britain. \" ( this massive site might put stonehenge to shame. )",

The republican lawmaker and his wife, margaret, are charged with using more than $ 250,000 in campaign funds for personal expenses and trying to conceal the spending with falsified campaign finance records, the new york times reports. House speaker paul ryan has now removed hunter from his committee assignments. The indictment states the alleged offenses happened between 2009 and 2016, a time when the free-spending hunters overdrew their bank account more than 1,100 times, racking up over $ 37,000 in charges. They misrepresented their spending in various ways, with margaret hunter once telling her husband to claim new golf shorts as golf balls for \" wounded warriors. \" family dental bills were claimed as a donation to the \" smiles for life \" charity.

In fact, he's planning to sell his new house — likely at a loss — and blames comcast and centurylink for misleading him about getting his home online, consumerist reports. The man, identified by gawker as seth morabito, says he checked with comcast before buying the kitsap county, wash., residence. According to morabito's timeline of events ( called \" it's comcastic, or: i accidentally bought a house without cable \" ), a rep said the last homeowner there used comcast; morabito tried to get proof of serviceability in writing, but was told comcast doesn't do that. So he made the purchase in december and readied for his stay-at-home work as a software engineer. But when a comcast tech came over, it turned out that no cable infrastructure led to the property. And so it began. Morabito also tried centurylink, which lists his address as serviceable but later said it wouldn't work. And so morabito worked off a \" frightfully expensive \" verizon mobile hotspot during weeks of appointments, phone calls, and miscommunication with comcast, which finally offered to hook up the property to the nearest connection point 2,500 feet away for $ 50,000 to $ 60,000. Comcast was \" to pick up part of the cost, \" though how much wasn't defined. Morabito shared that update march 12; six days later, comcast rescinded the offer, notes morabito in \" a hard update to write. \" he puts it plainly: \" comcast has lied. This whole thing would have been avoided if only comcast had said, right at the start, that they didn't serve this address. \" if it had, the home never would have made his list. Instead, it's \" goodbye dream house. You were the first house i ever owned, i ' ll miss you. \" consumerist reports comcast has yet to comment. ( it's far from the first comcast tale of woe. )",

        "summary": "The hunt for the wreckage of airasia flight qz8501 is now a broader one, reports the bbc, with the head of indonesia's search-and-rescue agency today announcing that due to strong currents, teams are \" adding to and expanding the priority search area. \" there are dozens of ships and aircraft pitching in ( including, as of today, a us navy vessel ) and searching a part of the java sea that's flat-bottomed and just 130 feet deep. So why has the plane proved so elusive? blame mother nature and the season, mostly: had the crash occurred in summer, the wreckage could have potentially been visible with the naked eye. But the asian winter monsoon \" turns the java sea into a tempestuous, murky soup, \" reports time. Part of why it's so murky is due to the fact that, many millennia ago, the java sea was a forested area. It's now more a \" part of the continental landmass \" than an ocean, geologically speaking, per time, and the organic layer that blankets its bottom is easily churned up. Sonar has identified four large objects that are believed to be pieces of the fuselage on the ocean floor, but the bbc reports that divers have struggled with \" zero visibility. \" the weather was better this morning, though, allowing divers to head deeper, but that was expected to be short-lived. Remotely operated cameras haven't had much more luck, the ap reports: though teams have attempted to use them to photograph the objects, waves measuring as high as 16 feet have made the cameras tricky to effectively deploy. No pings have been detected from the all-important cockpit voice and flight data recorders, again because high waves have prevented the deployment of ships that drag ping locators. The batteries in the black boxes are likely to go dead in about 20 more days. Officials remain optimistic that they ' ll get to them in time. One more problem: trash. The java sea is heavily trafficked by ships, many of which toss their debris overboard; waste also streams in from the nearby islands of java, borneo, and sumatra. And, as an oceanographer explains, \" there's not really a current flushing things out. \"",

        "summary": "It's possible to know when a cancer patient's death is imminent, according to a new study that has identified eight \" tell-tale \" signs that indicate that the end is nigh. A researcher involved in the study, published in cancer, explains why the findings are so novel: previous studies focused on \" people who were recognized as dying, so there's a potential bias built into this model. \" in this instance, researchers at the university of texas md anderson cancer center instead observed their subjects twice daily — noting 52 physical and cognitive signs — from the moment they were admitted to one of two acute palliative care units, \" without knowing if the patient would die or be discharged, \" explains dr. David hui. Of the 357 patients they studied, 57 % died, and eight of the 52 signs were deemed most associated with death coming within three days. Write the authors, \" these signs were commonly observed in the last three days of life with a frequency in patients between 38 % and 78 %. \" they are: nonreactive pupils decreased response to verbal stimuli decreased response to visual stimuli inability to close eyelids drooping of the nasolabial fold ( the skin fold that runs from the corner of the nose to the mouth, ie, \" smile lines \" ) neck hyperextension grunting of vocal cords upper gastrointestinal bleeding \" knowing when death is imminent would provide more information so caregivers can plan appropriately, \" explains hui — for instance, remaining in the hospital overnight so as not to miss a loved one's passing. From a clinical standpoint, \" time and resources \" can be conserved by, for instance, ending daily blood tests, reports medical news today. The researchers next plan to review whether the results hold in settings other than cancer centers, such as home hospice, notes ecancernews.

        "summary": "A texas man who used a shovel to decapitate a rattlesnake he found in his backyard failed to realize that a severed snake head can be just as dangerous as one that has a body attached. When the man picked up the head to dispose of it, it attacked, sinking all its venom into him in a bite that was almost fatal, the bbc reports. He was airlifted from his home near corpus christi to a hospital where he received 26 doses of antivenom. A normal bite requires just two to four doses, his wife tells kiii-tv. The man, who encountered the four-foot snake when he was doing yard work on memorial day, is recovering, though he remains hospitalized in stable condition and his kidney function is still below normal. Picking up the head was \" kind of a classic mistake. People don't realize that reptiles and mammals are wired differently, \" antivenom doctor leslie boyer tells gizmodo. \" the head end of a cut-up rattlesnake can continue to function, including the venom glands, for a long time afterward and, in fact, the other half continues to work. It ' ll rise and rattle. \" boyer, who says cutting up a snake is cruel as well as ineffective, says people should just step away from snakes and call experts if they want them removed. Trauma surgeon michael halpert says sucking the venom out of snake bite is also a bad idea. \" you don't want to do any of that, \" he says. \" you just want to keep the victim calm, keep the bitten area above the level of the heart slightly, and get the patient to the nearest emergency room. \" ( this arizona man no longer performs his party trick of playing with rattlesnakes. )",

The shooter is believed to be aziz \" bob \" yazdanpanah, whose wife, fatemeh rahmati, left him and moved to grapevine with their two children earlier this year, according to media reports. After rahmati, daughter nona, 19, and son ali, 15, finished opening presents, yazdanpanah is believed to have shown up dressed as santa; police found no signs of forced entry. The other three victims are believed to be rahmati's sister, her husband, and their 22-year-old daughter. Three of the victims were already inside the apartment, while the other three apparently showed up at the apartment just moments after the shooter did, say police. More of the troubling details emerging: at 11: 16am sunday, one of the victims texted a friend saying that they had just finished opening presents and someone dressed as santa had arrived. Around 11: 30, a man in a santa suit was seen outside the apartment at a car. \" was he going out to get the weapons or had the shooting already occurred, we're not sure, \" says a police sergeant. At 11: 34, the 911 call from the apartment came in. Police initially said it was a silent call, but now say that a faint, breathless voice can be heard saying, \"help, help. \" police believe yazdanpanah himself made the call, although they won't say why, the dallas morning news reports. Yazdanpanah and rahmati had been separated since march, and the nearby family home — where yazdanpanah continued to live — was foreclosed on last year. Yazdanpanah had reportedly filed for bankruptcy. A woman who sometimes went to happy hours with yazdanpanah and other friends tells the fort worth star-telegram he often joked around, but says she was disturbed when he sent her the following text message on dec. 4: \"what do u call a guy who's born in austin and grows up in dallas and then dies in grapevine?.........

Although the youtube star, owned by charles schmidt, wasn't the original keyboard cat — that honor goes to schmidt's previous orange tabby, fatso, who died in 1987, per mashable — bento took over the ivories in 2010, posting videos on the keyboard cat youtube channel and even landing a wonderful pistachios commercial.

The clip eventually went viral.

After consulting with dentists, the doctors decided he had a tooth in his nasal cavity and extracted it under general anesthesia. No muss, no fuss: a published report found that the patient recovered and the nosebleeds were gone after three months. \" it's an unusual case of an extra tooth — certainly, the most impressive intranasal photo i think i've ever seen of one, \" says john hellstein, a dentist. Studies show that extra teeth aren't so uncommon — 0.15 % to 3.9 % of people have them — but hellstein says it's unusual to see one growing through the nasal floor. The man probably had a mesiodens, a typical extra tooth that grows around the incisors, says hellstein. It's not clear what causes extra teeth, but the report points to causes like trauma, infection, and genetic factors, the daily mail reports. Rare as it is, an extra tooth in the nose can lead to symptoms like nasal deformities, smelly mucus, nosebleeds, and headaches. But don't expect to find one: \" i've never seen the tooth actually in there, \" hellstein says. ( read about a teenager who had 232 extra teeth removed from his head. )",

Relatives of the men say that as the boat headed toward a utility pole, all seven leaped out of the vessel; three of the men were reportedly found tuesday morning clinging to trees, suffering from electrocution burns, with no sign of the other four.

        "summary": "When 401( k ) plans emerged in the ' 80s, they were supposed to complement pensions, not replace them. But as the wall street journal reports, only 13 % of workers in the private sector today hold pensions thanks to the 401( k ) revolution — and original proponents of the tax-deferred savings plans are now saying they may not be the best way for people to shore up for their golden years. \" we weren't social visionaries, \" says herbert whitehouse, an ex-j&j exec who was also an early 401( k ) promoter. Not only are the plans — which let workers sock away pretax money — vulnerable to stock market declines ( defined-benefit pensions are guaranteed payouts for life ), they're also subject to costly manager fees. And forbes notes that longer-lived retirees may need enough funds to last 30 years or more, making it even more critical that retirement cash can be stretched for the long haul. One economist says at first she'd tell workers they'd be set if they saved just 3 % of their salary — but that was based on projected 7 % annual investment returns, an overly optimistic calculation. Plus, per an employee benefit research institute researcher, only 61 % of workers who could be saving for retirement are currently doing so. Based on boston college calculations, 52 % of us households are \" at risk \" of not being able to live comfortably during retirement. Not that 401( k ) plans are complete failures: advocates say if people start using an employer-offered 401( k ) early enough, it can lead to substantial savings. Still, fixes are being proposed, such as mandated savings plans run by either employers or the government. \" there was a complete overreaction of excitement and wow \" in the early days of the 401( k ), laments a retirement services exec.

School counselors are usually better trained in depression and anxiety than psychosis, and steep hospitalization costs means that that many schizophrenics get hustled out the door without sufficient treatment. The results are tragic, because, while most people with schizophrenia are not violent, those who are untreated are more likely to commit violent crimes. \" it takes a village to stop a rampage, \" writes steinberg. \" enough already. \" making matters worse, 1970s-era ethics rules forbid psychiatrists from commenting on the mental state of someone they have not examined examined directly — well intentioned, but in the cable news age those rules create a void that gets filled by loud, ignorant voices. But the bottom line is that \" medication and treatment work. Too many people with acute schizophrenia have gone untreated.

The lime was hydrated — incorporating water molecules into its structure — and reacted with the ash to cement the whole mixture together. \" what's more, the romans used less lime and baked it at lower temperatures, meaning the process was greener because it released less carbon into the atmosphere, says history.com.

The hong kong-zhuhai-macau bridge is right in the sights of super typhoon mangkhut, a powerful storm system that's headed right for that part of asia, and though quartz notes the structure was built to handle winds up to 125mph and stay standing even after a magnitude-8.1 quake, nerves are on edge. That's because, as of friday, wind gusts were clocking in at up to 150mph at the storm's center, though they're expected to drop by the time mangkhut arrives near hong kong on sunday. Structural engineer ngai hok-yan tells the south china morning post that how well the bridge fares will come down to wind direction and how high waves get near the artificial islands that are closest to macau and in mainland waters. \" if the waves are higher than [ 13 feet ], then there is a chance [ the ] protective blocks will be washed away, and very quickly, \" ngai notes. Some forecasts say the waves are anticipated to be as high as 20 feet. And if those barrier blocks disappear, the worst-case scenario? the island connecting the hong kong bridge portion to an undersea tunnel could itself be in trouble: ngai says that tunnel could break loose, and the entire island could potentially collapse. Asia times notes drone photos recently posted showed seawalls and tetrapods meant to protect the islands were \" collapsing and drifting away, \" though officials claimed that was all part of the design.",

Predicted to be the most powerful storm since records began, with maximum sustained winds of up to 205km/h ( 127mph ), the tropical cyclone is forecast to pass within 100km ( 62mph ) of the city on sunday morning. Concerns had previously been raised over the structural safety of the city's mega projects especially the bridge linking hong kong to zhuhai and macau as the main stretch was situated in the pearl river estuary's lingdingyang waters and prone to strong winds.

        "summary": "The rate of nearsightedness nearly doubled between the 1970s and early aughts, and jumped five-fold since 2000. At this rate, one in two humans is likely to have myopia by 2050, amounting to a seven-fold increase, researchers from the brien holden vision institute report in the journal opthalmology. Chief among the problems behind the major public health issue is that, while a few prevailing theories are floating around, we don't really know why the human eyeball is, essentially, not growing how it should, reports wired. Babies, it turns out, are actually born farsighted, with slightly squashed eyeballs that gradually elongate through childhood and stop once the image on the retina has come into ideal focus. \" to become normal sighted is an incredible feat of controlled eye growth, \" one ophthalmologist tells wired. It's possible that spending less time outdoors is confusing this normal growth pattern, but whether that's due to light interfering with our circadian rhythms, or a lack of focus on objects that are far away, or something else altogether remains, ahem, unclear. Plus, as another vision scientist puts it, \" you don't want to trade myopia for skin cancer. \" some researchers purport that a cure to at least slow the progression of myopia already exists in the form of eyedrops, optometry today reports, but either way the new study's researchers report in science daily that it's high time we research the condition further. ( here's why not to blame computers entirely. )",

The number with vision loss from high myopia is expected to increase seven-fold from 2000 to 2050, with myopia to become a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. The rapid increase in the prevalence of myopia globally is attributed to, \" environmental factors ( nurture ), principally lifestyle changes resulting from a combination of decreased time outdoors and increased near work activities, among other factors, \" say the authors from brien holden vision institute, university of new south wales australia and singapore eye research institute. The findings point to a major public health problem, with the authors suggesting that planning for comprehensive eye care services are needed to manage the rapid increase in high myopes ( a five-fold increase from 2000 ), along with the development of treatments to control the progression of myopia and prevent people from becoming highly myopic. \" we also need to ensure our children receive a regular eye examination from an optometrist or ophthalmologist, preferably each year, so that preventative strategies can be employed if they are at risk, \" said co-author professor kovin naidoo, ceo of brien holden",

A newly released court transcript sheds the most light yet on the thinking of judge aaron persky in handing down the controversial sentence, reports the guardian. For example, persky mentioned a letter written by a childhood friend of turner's who called the crime out of character for turner. \" to me, that just rings true as to — it sort of corroborates the evidence of his character up until the night of this incident, which has been positive, \" said persky. ( the letter writer, a female, has since apologized after critics accused her of blaming the victim. ) persky also addressed the victim's concern that if turner had been a minority from an underprivileged home, he surely would have gotten a longer sentence than six months. The judge flipped the logic on that one, saying that turner's upbringing shouldn't count against him because he faced \" a huge collateral consequence \" over the arrest. \" i think you have to take the whole picture in terms of what impact imprisonment has on a specific individual's life, \" he said. Or as the guardian sums up, persky felt \" turner had more to lose. \" persky also said the intense media attention to the case factored into sentencing because turner was already suffering \" significant collateral consequences. \" he acknowledged that turner, like the victim, was drunk, but added, \" i don't attach very much weight to that \" in terms of leniency. In the end, persky largely sided with turner's family, including his mother, who wrote, \"i beg of you, please don't send him to jail/prison. Look at him. He won't survive it, \" per the los angeles times. About 1 million people have signed online petitions calling for persky's ouster, but so far no formal paperwork has been filed toward a recall.",

Experts had to find a relatively smooth area on the \" ice mountain \" ( which also happens to be rubber-duck shaped ) that would be hospitable to philae, the bbc reports.

If the landing, set for nov. 11, is successful, philae will lock onto the 2.5-mile-wide comet with help from harpoons and screws, the bbc notes. But it won't be easy: \" none of the candidate landing sites met all of the operational criteria at the 100 % level, \" says the landing manager, who notes the \" relatively flat \" site that was chosen does have some cliffs and boulders. Further, the comet is currently about 273 million miles away from earth, and due to that distance, the lander can't be controlled in real time. Rather, the landing commands will be uploaded to philae days in advance. Should the landing be successful, philae will study the comet, checking temperatures, collecting samples, and sending radio waves through 67p to investigate its insides, the daily mail reports.",

With lines like, \" as the citizens of this great nation, it is kindness, love, and compassion for each other that will bring us together — and keep us together, \" melania at times sounded more like hillary clinton than donald trump, according to doyle mcmanus at the los angeles times. \" maybe the wrong trump is heading the ticket? \" he wonders. Chris cillizza at the washington post found melania to be \" warm, likable, and genuine \" and he declares her one of the day's winners, though \" the bar was not terribly high. \" \" it was hard for me to imagine that anyone would leave her address feeling anything but more favorably inclined toward her husband, \" he writes. \" that's a big win for team trump. \" melania added a much-needed softer tone to trump, but her 15-minute speech \" lacked [ a ] personal anecdote or insightful story that voters could latch on to as they formulate a fuller opinion of the presumptive gop nominee, \" writes ali vitali at nbc news.

In first grade i avoided boys like the plague. Boys called me \" sissy \" and \" cry baby \" and beat me up. My teacher didn't like me separating from the herd, though, and one day, when she caught me playing with a girl, she hauled me in front of the class and spanked me.

The 34-year-old german hiker was soon after saved by a woman she'd met only briefly a week before. Aiming to reach the canadian border, groene had refused to turn around in washington state's cascade range on oct. 24 though local backpacker nancy abell advised her to do so.

Groene, who started at the mexican border in may but was delayed by visa issues, thought she was prepared enough for the weather, per komo news. But back home in sultan, abell grew concerned amid heavy snowfall, to the point where she couldn't sleep. Abell called 911 on monday, giving a location of where she had calculated the hiker might be found. It was \" right on, \" says sgt. John adams of the snohomish county sheriff's office. A helicopter search located footprints and eventually groene, whose phone had no service. \" i was crying. I was screaming for help, \" she said per tribune media. And \" i knew who called [ 911 ]. But who does call for a stranger? \" abell, however, says groene didn't feel like a stranger after the two hours they had hiked together.

        "summary": "Forget the latest pour-over trend. A much simpler method could improve the taste of your coffee: to make it less bitter, it may be that all you need to do is change the color of your mug, researchers say. Psychology researcher george van doorn got the idea for his experiment after a barista told him that people think their coffee is more bitter when it's in a white cup, he writes at the conversation. He decided to test the notion, theorizing that brownness might be associated with bitterness in people's minds — and the contrast between white cup and brown coffee might reinforce this association, researchers explain in flavour. Van doorn's team gathered 18 volunteers and had them drink from three mugs: a white one, a blue one, and a transparent one, fast company reports. The subjects reported that the coffee in the white mug tasted more \" intense \" than that in the other mugs, though it was all the same coffee. ( \" bitterness \" ratings and \" intensity \" ratings mirrored each other, van doorn notes. ) an additional experiment, with 36 volunteers, used cups that all had the same shape but different colors; the results again suggested that color affected the perception of taste. Baristas, thus, \" should carefully consider the colour of their mugs, \" van doorn writes. \" the potential effects may spell the difference between a one-time purchase and a return customer. \" ( another way to get a different taste from your coffee: order a beer latte. )",

Officials say the report also identifies russians who passed information from hacked democratic party officials to wikileaks, using a \" circuitous route \" to make their involvement harder to trace. Trump will be briefed on the report friday and an unclassified version will later be made available to the public. In a series of tweets thursday, trump wondered who gave nbc an \" exclusive report \" on the report's contents and asked why the democratic national committee \" would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russia. \" he concludes: \" so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? what is going on? \"",
