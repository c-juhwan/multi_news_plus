In a 2017 interview with megyn kelly, heslin spoke of holding his dead son \" with a bullet hole through his head. \" shroyer said heslin must be lying, because the children were id'd through photos, not in person. Heslin counters that he absolutely did hold his son when the body was released to him for burial. As for the death threats, the huffpost reports there's an infowars element: lucy richards was last summer sentenced to five months in prison for leaving parent leonard pozner voicemails threatening death; his suit notes that her sentence barred her from visiting infowars. The new york times reports the suits were filed in travis county district court in austin, where jones resides, by houston lawyer mark bankston.

        "summary": "Scientists at the national institutes of health may have just discovered a powerful new tool in the fight against hiv. According to a press release, a newly identified antibody called n6 found in an hiv-infected person could successfully neutralize 98 % of hiv isolates, including 16 of 20 hiv strains that are resistant to similar antibodies. Researchers published their findings tuesday in immunity. N6 could be more effective than another antibody, vrc01, that was discovered in 2010 and is currently in clinical trials. Out magazine reports vrc01 could stop up to 90 % of hiv strains. N6 works by binding to the hiv envelope and preventing it from attaching to the body's immune cells. It's hard to find antibodies that are as effective as n6 appears to be at attaching themselves to hiv because hiv quickly changes its surface proteins. N6 gets around that problem by focusing on parts of the hiv envelope that don't change very much. Scientists say n6 may be able to be developed to treat or prevent hiv infection. In 2015, more than 36 million people worldwide — nearly 2 million of them children — had hiv/aids, rt reports. It's estimated only 54 % of people know whether or not they have hiv. ( \" patient zero, \" who brought aids to the us, actually didn't. )",

The documentary, blackfish, looks at the 2010 death of a seaworld trainer in an attack by one of its killer whales and suggests such actions are the result of distress caused by years in captivity. The filmmakers have been engaged in a very public battle of words with the marine park since its release, the times reported previously. According to the pixar employee, the animated film originally had an ending set at a marine park, but since the release of blackfish, the dory filmmakers decided to restructure their own ocean-based movie so that the sea creatures taken to the marine park will have the option to leave.

Officer caesar goodson was driving the police van in which gray was riding the day he died, and goodson faced charges including \" second-degree depraved heart murder, \" among others. He opted to have his case heard only by a judge, not a jury, and judge barry williams found him not guilty thursday morning after three days of deliberation. Four other officers still face their own trials in the case — one of those will be a retrial following a hung jury, while a sixth officer implicated was acquitted — but the goodson ruling \" throws the rest of the cases into jeopardy, \" reports the baltimore sun. Prosecutors accused goodson of deliberately giving the 25-year-old gray a \" rough ride, \" one that resulted in a broken neck, and failing on five occasions to give the unbuckled prisoner proper medical attention. But \" the state failed to prove the defendant knew or should have known that mr. Gray needed medical care, \" the judge said, per ap. \" unlike in a shooting or a stabbing, or a car accident, this injury [ a broken neck ] manifests itself internally, \" he said. \" if the doctors weren't clear, how would a person without medical training know? \" williams also said the \" rough ride \" claim wasn't proven by the state.

Their choice of punishment, per the super: suspension or getting a parent-ok'd paddling. He wouldn't say which punishment was selected, but the mom of one student did. On wednesday, jerusalem greer tweeted that the kids \" chose corporal punishment, \" adding: \" this generation is not playing around. \" her revelation soon went viral, with reactions ranging from calls to contact the aclu to a horrified \" holy hell. Corporal punishment is still a thing in schools?! \" and that's proven surprising to many, as, yes, many states do still allow it, though the exact number differs ( it's usually said to be 19 ). The daily beast reviewed greenbrier's school policy and found it stated physical punishment couldn't be \" excessive, or administered with malice \"; an attempt to talk to the school's assistant principal about the policy was met with a hang-up. Greer's son, wylie, told the daily beast his two \" swats \" didn't hurt or cause any injury. He says he has \" the utmost respect for all the adults involved, \" as they were \" merely doing their job, \" though \" the idea that violence should be used against someone who was protesting violence as a means to discipline them is appalling, \" he noted.

            "Little rock, ark. - some arkansas students have been disciplined with a paddling after taking part in wednesday's national walkout day. That's according to a twitter post by a parent. We spoke with the school superintendent in greenbrier who confirmed that three students participated in the walkout. He says no student came to school asking to participate in the walkout and had made no preparations. He adds that they were not reprimanded for protesting but for breaking school handbook rules in regards to leaving class. We're told the students were given the choice of suspension ( usually 2 days ) or corporal punishment for their participation in the walkout. Corporal punishment is a paddling and must be approved by a parent. The superintendent said he could not reveal which option the students chose.

            "Little rock, ark. - some arkansas students have been disciplined with a paddling after taking part in wednesday's national walkout day. That's according to a twitter post by a parent. We spoke with the school superintendent in greenbrier who confirmed that three students participated in the walkout. He says no student came to school asking to participate in the walkout and had made no preparations. He adds that they were not reprimanded for protesting but for breaking school handbook rules in regards to leaving class. We're told the students were given the choice of suspension ( usually 2 days ) or corporal punishment for their participation in the walkout. Corporal punishment is a paddling and must be approved by a parent. The superintendent said he could not reveal which option the students chose.

        "summary": "Michele bachmann kicks off the week as the subject of two profiles: a newsweek cover story ( whose cover image many, many people are calling creepy ) and a new yorker piece. Both suggest she's poised to do well in iowa's upcoming straw poll, but faces major hurdles to winning the republican nomination. Some key points from the profiles: in newsweek, lois romano points to concerns over \" the perception of hypocrisy \": as a lawyer, for example, bachmann represented tea party enemy the irs. She also slammed president obama's stimulus, then sought funds from it. But what could be \" more damaging \" is the country's growing recognition that the tea party movement truly is a radical one, writes romano. And the tea party itself could lose its taste for bachmann if she places more emphasis on social issues than on cutting the federal budget. In the new yorker, ryan lizza writes that alongside her reputation for verbal gaffes, her personal history includes \"a set of beliefs more extreme than those of any american politician of her stature. \" lizza notes that bachmann's law school had trouble getting accredited because \"the bible, not the constitution or conventional jurisprudence, guides the curriculum. \" her personal stories are a little mixed-up, lizza writes. She set a detailed family history in iowa when in fact it occurred in wisconsin; she calls herself an \"accidental candidate, \" but she raised the prospect of running for office for a year before doing so. Why does bachmann, but not mitt romeny, get picked apart by matt drudge? he's best friends with romney's campaign manager, explains her speech coach. Bachmann agrees, \" you never see anything about romney on drudge — ever. \"",

Seuss to remind them. \"we trust the united states forest service to 'speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues, ' \" the fourth us circuit court of appeals wrote last week in a case involving a power company's request to build a natural gas pipeline. As npr notes, the \" tongues \" quote is a reference to the lorax, who at one point declares: \"i am the lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees for the trees have no tongues. \" a three-judge panel from the court ruled that the forest service \" abdicated its responsibility \" in giving approval to dominion energy to move ahead with the pipeline. It's far from the end of the issue, however. The $ 7 billion atlantic coast pipeline would go through west virginia, virginia, and north carolina, but it would also cut through two national forests as well as the appalachian trail. The court specifically found fault with approval to run the pipe under a section of the latter trail in virginia, reports the richmond times dispatch. Dominion plans to appeal to the full court, while pipeline opponents, including the southern environmental law center, hope the decision will lead to a wholesale revocation of the pipeline's permit. Dominion also could ask congress for approval to use the federal land. ( elsewhere, a group of nuns found a novel way to oppose a pipeline near them. )",

After exposing replicas to pressures stronger than the force of gravity, researchers found the statue's ankles are just too thin to support it. Not helping matters? michelangelo picked a less-than-stellar quality marble, and carved david in an off-center pose. There also appears to be damage in the tree stump behind david's right leg, which bears the brunt of his weight. So what's to be done? well, some suggest moving the 17-foot structure away from the city of florence, which has a recorded history of 127 minor earthquakes, or at least moving it to an earthquake-proof room, reports la gazetta del sud. As for those who warned that a train line built nearby a few years ago would cause david to collapse, researchers say it was more likely the three centuries standing at a dangerous, forward-leaning position in florence's main square that did the damage.",

        "summary": "Pesticides aren't just killing off bees, they are threatening to kill a lot of people off as well by putting the world's food security at risk, a new study warns. Researchers say the evidence is now \" very clear \" that a common class of insecticides called neonicotinoids has contaminated the environment so heavily that creatures essential to food production, including bees and earthworms, are in grave danger. The pesticides are applied routinely, instead of in response to infestations, but researchers say there is a \" striking \" lack of evidence that the treatments do anything to increase crop yields. They also blame the chemicals for declines in bird populations — and for devastating water-based species like snails and dragonflies. The researchers compare the impact of the pesticides first introduced around 20 years ago to that of ddt, which was phased out after the 1962 book silent spring revealed the damage it was doing to bird and insect life. \" it is astonishing we have learned so little, \" one of the researchers tells the guardian. \" after silent spring revealed the unfortunate side-effects of those chemicals, there was a big backlash. But we seem to have gone back to exactly what we were doing in the 1950s. It is just history repeating itself. The pervasive nature of these chemicals mean they are found everywhere now. \" pesticide manufacturers, however, say there is nothing new in the study and the researchers are selectively highlighting \" worst-case scenarios, \" the bbc reports.",

Tom wolf immediately called on kane to step down, the new york times reports, saying \" the people of pennsylvania deserve to move on. \" on tuesday, kane announced that she would do so, effective wednesday, reports the ap. A jury found kane, 50, guilty of nine charges including criminal conspiracy and two felony counts of perjury for leaking grand jury information and lying about it, pennlive reports. Events that led to her downfall began after she was criticized in the media for shutting down an undercover probe of state democratic officials. She schemed to discredit a prosecutor she blamed for embarrassing her — and she meant business. \"this is war, \" kane vowed in an email, per the times. The judge in the case warned her that \" there is to be absolutely no retaliation of any kind. \" kane, who did not testify in the four-day trial, faces more than 14 years in prison. Her defenders say her take-down was payback for rattling the establishment after her election in 2012. Kane's law license was suspended last year after the criminal probe was announced.

( ap ) — the latest on pennsylvania attorney general kathleen kane ( all times local ): 1: 30 p.m. Pennsylvania's attorney general is resigning amid pressure from the governor and lawmakers a day after jurors found her guilty of abusing her power and lying to cover it up. Her office announced in a statement tuesday that kathleen kane would resign at the end of the workday wednesday. Kane's exit completes a spectacular fall for the state's highest-ranking female politician. She's a former county prosecutor who soared to victory three years ago as an outsider. But the first woman and first democrat elected to attorney general in pennsylvania squandered her early popularity. Ultimately, the 50-year-old kane was undone by what prosecutors portrayed as a personal vendetta for her critics. Now, she's facing jail time and has had her law license",
            "Norristown -- attorney general kathleen kane was found guilty of all charges by a jury of 12 citizens she represented as pennsylvania's top law enforcement officer. Kane leaned forward in her seat to hear the jury's verdict, but showed no outward emotion. Prosecutors argued that kane orchestrated a leak of secret grand jury materials and then lied about it in order to exact revenge against former prosecutors from the office who she blamed for embarrassing news coverage. In addition to the two felony perjury charges, kane faced two counts each of the misdemeanors of false swearing and obstructing the administration of law or other government functions. She also faced misdemeanor charges of criminal conspiracy related to obstruction, criminal conspiracy related to official oppression and official oppression jurors heard four days of testimony from prosecution witnesses ranging from political consultant josh morrow, who told the jury he conspired with kane to leak information from a 2009 grand jury investigation to a newspaper, to adrian king, a former deputy attorney general and long-time friend of kane who told jurors that kane tried to frame him. The defense rested friday without calling kathleen kane or any other witness to testify. They argued that the prosecution had not proven its case. Kane is the first democrat and the first woman to be elected to the post of attorney general.

( associated press ) pennsylvania attorney general kathleen kane leaves the courtroom after closing arguments in her perjury and obstruction trial at the montgomery county courthouse, monday, aug. 15, 2016, in norristown, pa., ( jessica griffin/the philadelphia inquirer via ap, pool ) ( associated press ) harrisburg, pa. ( ap ) — the latest on pennsylvania attorney general kathleen kane ( all times local ): 1: 30 p.m. Pennsylvania's attorney general is resigning amid pressure from the governor and lawmakers a day after jurors found her guilty of abusing her power and lying to cover it up. Her office announced in a statement tuesday that kathleen kane would resign at the end of the workday wednesday. Kane's exit completes a spectacular fall for the state's highest-ranking female politician. She's a former county prosecutor who soared to victory three years ago as an outsider. But the first woman and first democrat elected to attorney general in pennsylvania squandered her early popularity. Ultimately, the 50-year-old kane was undone by what prosecutors portrayed as a personal vendetta for her critics. Now, she's facing jail time and has had her law license",
            "Norristown -- attorney general kathleen kane was found guilty of all charges by a jury of 12 citizens she represented as pennsylvania's top law enforcement officer. Kane leaned forward in her seat to hear the jury's verdict, but showed no outward emotion. Prosecutors argued that kane orchestrated a leak of secret grand jury materials and then lied about it in order to exact revenge against former prosecutors from the office who she blamed for embarrassing news coverage. In addition to the two felony perjury charges, kane faced two counts each of the misdemeanors of false swearing and obstructing the administration of law or other government functions. She also faced misdemeanor charges of criminal conspiracy related to obstruction, criminal conspiracy related to official oppression and official oppression jurors heard four days of testimony from prosecution witnesses ranging from political consultant josh morrow, who told the jury he conspired with kane to leak information from a 2009 grand jury investigation to a newspaper, to adrian king, a former deputy attorney general and long-time friend of kane who told jurors that kane tried to frame him. The defense rested friday without calling kathleen kane or any other witness to testify. They argued that the prosecution had not proven its case. Kane is the first democrat and the first woman to be elected to the post of attorney general.

If italy seeks her extradition, american courts will have to decide whether the constitutional ban on \" double jeopardy \" — being tried twice for the same crime — trumps the extradition treaty the us has with italy, reuters reports. The new trial is expected to begin late this year or early in 2014, knox's italian lawyer says. An italian court overturned knox's murder conviction in 2011, and any extradition case will probably hinge on whether american courts consider that to be an acquittal, according to harvard law professor alan dershowitz. \" it's very complicated, and there's no clear answer. It's in the range of unpredictable, \" he says. A washington-based lawyer specializing in extradition predicts an \" uphill battle \" for knox if she tries to fight extradition.

Courts to enter legal territory that is largely uncharted, legal experts said. Italy's top court on tuesday ordered the retrial of knox, 25, for the 2007 murder of british student meredith kercher. The move potentially pits a u.s. Constitutional ban on double jeopardy, or being tried twice for the same offense after an acquittal, against international extradition agreements, experts said. The issue hinges on whether a lower court decision overturning her conviction amounted to an acquittal, they said. If knox is retried after she was acquitted, that would violate her constitutional rights, said christopher blakesley, a law professor at the university of nevada las vegas who specializes in international criminal law.

            "A local boy was thrilled to get a playstation 4 for christmas but found out he had been pranked when he opened the box. Brian lundy said his 9-year-old son scott was super excited when he opened a present on christmas and found a playstation 4. \" he yelled, this is the best christmas ever, this is the best christmas ever, thank you santa! \" said lundy. However, when lundy and scott opened the box to set up the console, they did not find a playstation inside. Instead, the box was stuffed with a block of wood signed with a crude drawing and message. Lundy believes that there could be a series of pranks going on because scott's cousin's friend got the same wooden block in his playstation 4 box. The family took the box back to the target in saugus where they bought it. Lundy said they were told that sometimes this does happen. \" it happens through the distribution, the assembly line or something, \" said lundy.

It was their way of atoning for their out-of-wedlock pregnancy, but as ireland is now learning, some of those illegitimate children encountered a fate much worse. The irish mail on sunday reports that 796 of them were heaped into a mass grave — a septic tank, specifies the washington post — and forgotten. There is no gravestone, and no home for that matter; housing and a playground occupy the long-ago razed location. But \" the bones are still there, \" says catherine corless, the historian who learned about the children after hunting down death records tied to the home. Her contact at the local registry office asked, \" do you really want all of these deaths? i said i do. Then she asked me did i realize the enormity of the numbers of deaths there? \" irish central reports the children were listed as dying from \" malnutrition, measles, convulsions, tuberculosis, gastroenteritis, and pneumonia, \" and points out that irish children born out of wedlock had a staggering death rate in the 1930s — at 25 %, it's closer to what was observed in the 1600s. The home, which was run by the bon secours nuns, was no exception, says corless. \" if you look at the records, babies were dying two a week, but i ' m still trying to figure out how they could [ have disposed of the bodies like that ]. Couldn't they have afforded baby coffins? \" corless is working to raise money for a monument. The post notes police are investigating, and the daily mail adds that a relative of a child who once lived there has filed a missing persons report, which could lead to an excavation of the site.",

Some banks are doing away with free checking accounts entirely; some are simply adding or increasing other fees; others are making it more difficult to actually get your account for free by increasing the minimum monthly balance required.

            "Advertisement continue reading the main story in a significant victory for law enforcement, a federal appeals court on tuesday said that government authorities could extract historical location data directly from telecommunications carriers without a search warrant. The closely watched case, in the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit, is the first ruling that squarely addresses the constitutionality of warrantless searches of historical location data stored by cellphone service providers. Ruling 2 to 1, the court said a warrantless search was \"not per se unconstitutional \" because location data was \"clearly a business record \" and therefore not protected by the fourth amendment. The ruling is likely to intensify legislative efforts, already bubbling in congress and in the states, to consider measures to require warrants based on probable cause to obtain cellphone location data. The appeals court ruling sharply contrasts with a new jersey state supreme court opinion in mid-july that said the police required a warrant to track a suspect's whereabouts in real time. That decision relied on the new jersey constitution, whereas the ruling tuesday in the fifth circuit was made on the basis of the federal constitution. Photo the supreme court has yet to weigh in on whether cellphone location data is protected by the constitution. The case, which was initially brought in texas, is not expected to go to the supreme court because it is \"ex parte, \" or filed by only one party — in this case, the government. But the case could renew calls for the highest court to look at the issue, if another federal court rules differently on the same question. And two other federal cases involving this issue are pending. \"the opinion is clear that the government can access cell site records without fourth amendment oversight, \" said orin kerr, a constitutional law scholar at george washington university law school who filed an amicus brief in the case. For now, the ruling sets an important precedent: it allows law enforcement officials in the fifth circuit to chronicle the whereabouts of an american with a court order that falls short of a search warrant based on probable cause. \"this decision is a big deal, \" said catherine crump, a lawyer with the american civil liberties union. \"it's a big deal and a big blow to americans ' privacy rights. \" the group reviewed records from more than 200 local police departments last year, concluding that the demand for cellphone location data had led some cellphone companies to develop \"surveillance fees \"",

The closely watched case, in the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit, is the first ruling that squarely addresses the constitutionality of warrantless searches of historical location data stored by cellphone service providers. Ruling 2 to 1, the court said a warrantless search was \"not per se unconstitutional \" because location data was \"clearly a business record \" and therefore not protected by the fourth amendment. The ruling is likely to intensify legislative efforts, already bubbling in congress and in the states, to consider measures to require warrants based on probable cause to obtain cellphone location data. The appeals court ruling sharply contrasts with a new jersey state supreme court opinion in mid-july that said the police required a warrant to track a suspect's whereabouts in real time. That decision relied on the new jersey constitution, whereas the ruling tuesday in the fifth circuit was made on the basis of the federal constitution. Photo the supreme court has yet to weigh in on whether cellphone location data is protected by the constitution. The case, which was initially brought in texas, is not expected to go to the supreme court because it is \"ex parte, \" or filed by only one party — in this case, the government. But the case could renew calls for the highest court to look at the issue, if another federal court rules differently on the same question. And two other federal cases involving this issue are pending. \"the opinion is clear that the government can access cell site records without fourth amendment oversight, \" said orin kerr, a constitutional law scholar at george washington university law school who filed an amicus brief in the case. For now, the ruling sets an important precedent: it allows law enforcement officials in the fifth circuit to chronicle the whereabouts of an american with a court order that falls short of a search warrant based on probable cause. \"this decision is a big deal, \" said catherine crump, a lawyer with the american civil liberties union. \"it's a big deal and a big blow to americans ' privacy rights. \" the group reviewed records from more than 200 local police departments last year, concluding that the demand for cellphone location data had led some cellphone companies to develop \"surveillance fees \"",

        "summary": "Viking is launching a review of its bestseller three cups of tea following reports that facts were fudged in the memoir and a multi-million-dollar charity that grew out of the book may largely be a fraud. Several facts in writer greg mortenson's book and the sequel, stones into schools — including his account that he was kidnapped by the taliban — have been challenged by a 60 minutes investigation and journalist jon krakauer. The former treasurer for mortenson's charity, central asia institute, has also charged that more money was spent on promoting mortenson and the charity than on its stated aim of building schools for girls in pakistan and afghanistan. Mortenson's work \" has provided tens of thousands of children with an education, \" said a viking spokeswoman. But \" in the wake of \" of the 60 minutes report, viking \" plans to carefully review the materials with the author. \" the statement is a clear sign that the publisher has serious concerns about the book's accuracy, reports the new york times. Mortenson has said the 60 minutes report was based on \" inaccurate information \" without going into specifics. In a new interview with outside magazine, he admits the books compress various experiences into one, and blames some issues with his accounts on his co-author.",

Though the sign was only visible for two minutes, it sparked a debate on social media, per the boston herald, including about what it actually meant, with some believing it was designed to promote racism. In reality, it was meant to do the opposite. Designed in response to racist comments red sox fans hurled at adam jones of the baltimore orioles back in may, the banner was meant \" to remind everyone that just as baseball is fundamental to american culture and history, so too is racism. White people need to wake up to this reality before white supremacy can truly be dismantled, \" the protesters wrote in a statement to csnne, adding they were inspired by groups tied to racial justice — including black lives matter, but not antifa. \" it's kind of telling that it is being interpreted as [ an ambiguous message ], \" one of the protesters adds.

Secret service spokesman robert hoback said in a statement that \"only authorized law enforcement personnel \" working with the agency will be allowed to carry firearms inside protected areas. \"individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint, regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event, \" hoback wrote in an email. The secret service cited federal law that allows the agency to prevent firearms from being carried into venues with protectees present, even in open-carry states. The secret service previously sent a statement to cleveland's newsnet5.com. The petition, which was posted last week on change.org, has drawn widespread attention, in large part because it seemed designed to test the limits of the republican party's support for the second amendment. The anonymous author noted that, while ohio is an open-carry state, quicken loans arena policy forbids weapons of any kind to be carried into the facility. \"this is a direct affront to the second amendment and puts all attendees at risk,"

Researchers combing the cloud forests of the andes in ecuador and peru have uncovered three new kinds of small, spiky, and colorful wood lizards that strongly resemble mythical creatures, although they're only around 5 inches long if you don't count the tail, the smithsonian reports. The discoveries bring the number of known wood lizard species to 15, with eight of those discovered in the last seven years, reports nbc news. The number of \" dwarf dragons \" found in recent years is striking since they're \" among the largest and most colorful lizards in south american tropical forests and [ their discovery ] is most likely the result of recent fieldwork in poorly explored areas of the central and northern andes, \" the researchers write in the journal zookeys. The fact that the area has yielded so many new species of wood lizard suggests there are more to be found and shows the need for conservation efforts in the region, which has some of the greatest biodiversity on the planet, the researchers say in a press release.

He concluded that holloway — stuffed into a crawl space by van der sloot — was buried under a staircase at marriott's spyglass tower. De jong even tried peeking inside by drilling into the hotel's floor. He also wrote to the victim's father, dave holloway, who's now in aruba with a cadaver dog and investigator probing de jong's claims.

( the scientists compared putin's health with that of adolf hitler, who some neurologists believe did suffer from parkinson's and who exhibited a range of symptoms. ) then something odd happened: bloem and his team noticed four other high-ranking russian officials, including pm dmitry medvedev, had the exact same walk. After some searching — and coming to the conclusion that all five russians couldn't have parkinson's disease that affected them all in the exact same way — they stumbled across their answer in the most unlikely of places: a kgb weapons training manual. \" it literally says, when you're walking, don't move the right arm, keep it close to the holster and be ready to draw the gun, \" bloem tells live science. The scientists also studied hollywood westerns and confirmed that the right arms of old-time cowboys stayed similarly immobile, live science notes. Only one of the other officials besides putin was actually in the kgb, but two of the other men may have received similar training for their military roles. As for medvedev, who was in neither the kgb nor the military, the team suggests he's simply engaging in a practice not uncommon in russia: \" imitating the boss \" and picking up on his mannerisms. ( not only does putin walk like an american cowboy, he admires our creativity, too. )",

While it could take years, and perhaps dozens of clinical trials, before these therapies hit the mainstream, \" this is the road map for how we might cure breast cancer in the future, \" one of the researchers tells the new york times. In studying tumors in 825 patients, scientists made some significant findings. One of the four types, known as basal-like cancer, actually looks less like other breast cancers and more like ovarian cancer — and routine ovarian cancer treatments might be the way forward. The majority of breast cancer cases fall into categories dubbed luminal a and luminal b. Those with luminal a respond well to hormonal treatments, while those with the latter type may need chemotherapy. Finally, there's her-2 enriched breast cancer, which involves an extra gene copy and generally calls for a drug called herceptin. But some patients with this type of cancer don't necessarily take well to herceptin, calling for more clinical trials. Despite the long road ahead, \" we are really getting at the roots of these cancers, \" says the study's lead author. The full study, published by nature, is here.",

        "summary": "Forget the sauna: new research suggests that getting a little chilly might help the body lose weight, reports ctv. Canadian researchers found that exposing men to lower temperatures — until they were at the \" threshold of shivering \" — activated their stores of \" brown fat, \" and that brown fat in turn started burning calories. \" we found there were about 250 extra kilocalories burned over three hours. \" the finding might explain why some people can handle the cold better — they might have more brown fat. It's another dent in the mystery of the substance, which is kind of like the biological alter ego of ordinary white fat. Brown fat is \" good fat \" in the sense that it actually burns calories instead of storing them, explains ctv. Adults don't have a lot of it, so researchers are figuring out ways to activate what's there. But don't head outside in the cold just yet. \" we still don't know if activating it ( brown fat ) is a good idea or not, \" says the lead researcher, \" so it is still premature to use that as a therapeutic target for ( obesity ). \" the new york times notes that another study suggests that exercise can turn white fat into brown fat in mice.

Zimmerman, acquitted in the death of trayvon martin this year, was arrested last week at the home, which he shares with his girlfriend, on suspicion of his having pointed a shotgun at her. He was released on bail and has entered a plea of not guilty. A search of the home turned up three handguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, a rifle and 106 rounds of ammunition, including two ar-15 magazines, according to a search warrant. Three handgun holsters, a pack of gum, a religious pendant, a flashlight, a pocket knife, sanitizing wipe, a soft-sided gun case and a combination lock were also recovered during the search. At the time of his arrest, zimmerman had two cell phones. An affidavit, filed monday, says he told authorities he recorded the altercation with his girlfriend on his cell phone. The florida judge that set his bail put numerous conditions on it: -- zimmerman cannot go to two florida addresses. -- he cannot have contact with the accuser, samantha scheibe. -- he cannot possess weapons. -- he must wear a monitoring device. -- he cannot travel outside florida",
            "Less than a week after he requested to be declared indigent, citing millions in debts, george zimmerman swapped his public defender in his domestic violence case for a private attorney, his former lawyer confirmed. Zimmerman was represented by the 18th judicial circuit public defender's office during a court appearance on tuesday, the day after his domestic violence arrest. He was granted $ 9,000 bail and bonded out that day. However, zimmerman has now elected to drop the public defender's office and hire a south florida private criminal defense attorney, jayne weintraub, to represent him, said his former public defender, jeff dowdy.

Those items: an apple iphone, a blackberry cell phone, a small hand-held flashlight and a pocket knife. The motion was filed by a colleague of dowdy's, apparently before zimmerman switched to the private lawyer.

        "summary": "The belief in all-seeing and punitive gods may be a huge factor in how modern civilization came to be. So report researchers in the journal nature after studying nearly 600 individuals from eight communities, including plant cultivators on the south pacific island of tanna, wage laborers on fiji and in brazil, herders and wage laborers in siberia, and east african hunter-gatherers. Using a behavioral game involving a cup and dice, the researchers found that people were more likely to reward strangers in a distant land over themselves if they thought their actions were being monitored from on high. That proved especially true if the strangers shared their religious beliefs. The upshot is that these beliefs make people more likely to cooperate with those outside their immediate social circles, and perhap explains how \" far-flung peoples \" came together, say the researchers in a press release. \" a large part of the success of human civilizations may have lain in the hands of the gods, whether or not they are real, \" writes an evolutionary biologist in nature. As science news explains, this tendency to cooperate with strangers would have had huge implications starting about 10,000 years ago as primitive communities began to have more contact with each other.

        "summary": "There's no accounting for taste — but if you want to blame anything on how you were raised, your taste in music could rank up there, a new study suggests. In music, chords can be broken down into many categories, two of which are called \" consonant \" and \" dissonant. \" a consonant chord consists of two or more notes spaced certain degrees apart — the first and fifth notes of a scale, for instance, are so pleasing to many westerners that the interval is called \" perfect. \" a dissonant chord, on the other hand — drop that fifth note down a half step, say — produces what some describe as nails on a chalkboard, or dark, or even the \" devil's music, \" explain scientists at brandeis university. But now those researchers report in the journal nature that these preferences do not appear to be hardwired from birth, and that people develop preferences for whatever music they are most exposed to growing up. To test this, they traveled to the tsimane tribe in remote bolivia. To establish a base point, they also surveyed us undergrads, bolivians in the capital city of la paz, and bolivians in the rural town san borja, all of whom had exposure to western music. Turns out the tsimane were the only ones to express no preference for consonant or dissonant music — likely because their music consists only of one person singing at a time. So any harmony, consonant or dissonant, was new to them. \" your brain basically gets tuned to the environment around it, \" one researcher tells nature news. Another researcher writes in an opinion piece in nature that the hypothesis \" provides food for thought, \" but that it doesn't necessarily rule out innate preferences. So if you like, say, bjork, whose songs can be quite textured in dissonance, it's possible you were born that way, but it could come down to whatever music your parents played.

This unit — known as ci — is one of the federal government's most tight-knit, specialized, and secretive investigative entities. Its 2,500 agents focus exclusively on financial crime, including tax evasion and money laundering. A former colleague of mueller's said he always liked working with irs'special agents, especially when he was a u.s. Attorney. And it goes without saying that the irs has access to trump's tax returns — documents that the president has long resisted releasing to the public. Potential financial crimes are a central part of mueller's probe. One of his top deputies, andy weissmann, formerly helmed the justice department's enron probe and has extensive experience working with investigative agents from the irs. \"from the agents, i know everyone has the utmost respect for both mueller and weissmann, \" said martin sheil, a retired irs criminal investigations agent. And he said mueller and weissmann are known admirers of those agents ' work. \"they view them with the highest regard, \" sheil said. \"irs special agents are the very best in the business of conducting financial investigations.",

Mueller has been overseeing settlement talks with volkswagen, the u.s. Government and private lawyers for the automaker to buy back some of the nearly 600,000 diesel cars that cheat on emissions tests. Jeff chiu/ap robert mueller, the fbi's special counsel in charge of the investigation of the trump campaign's ties to russia, is now teaming up with a specialized financial crimes unit within the irs, the daily beast reported thursday, citing people familiar with the development. The irs ' criminal investigations unit is joining mueller as the russia probe focuses more closely on potential financial crimes possibly involving people within the trump campaign. It was not immediately clear how many of the unit's 2,500 agents would take part in mueller's investigation. Martin sheil, a retired former agent of the unit, told the daily beast's betsy woodruff that the unit's involvement is a sign mueller is invested in beefing up a specific rank within his investigative team.

        "summary": "Kellen winslow jr. Is a former nfl pro bowl player who was once the highest-paid tight end in the league. He's also the son of a hall of famer. But prosecutors say winslow is something else now: a kidnapper, rapist, and burglar. The 34-year-old has been jailed in vista, calif., and faces life in prison if convicted, reports the ap. Authorities accuse him of a crime spree that includes the kidnapping and rape of a 54-year-old homeless woman in march and a 59-year-old homeless woman in may. He is also accused of breaking into at least two homes and of exposing himself in a public place. Winslow played 10 seasons in the nfl, which prompts usa today to float the possibility that cte, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, could play a role in his defense. One big problem with that is cte can currently be diagnosed only after death, but a defense attorney says the symptoms associated with the condition — such as depression and dementia — could be raised. \" the nature of the facts around this case raise huge red flags, \" says san diego lawyer m. Dod ghassemkhani. \" there could be an underlying mental illness that has been untreated. \" it's possible such a defense could at least lessen the punishment that winslow receives if convicted. He played in the league from 2004-13 with cleveland, tampa bay, new england, and the new york jets. ( the question of cte hovers over the case of another former nfl player who ended up in prison. )",

But per a new study published in marine mammal science, it was an entirely new whale species altogether — a black cetacean referred to as katasu, or \" raven, \" by japanese fishermen who'd encountered it from waters off of northern japan all the way to alaska's aleutian islands, a press release notes. The katasu had been talked about since the 1940s by the fishermen, who said they only very occasionally saw them in groups, and only for a couple of months out of the year. \" it's a really big deal, \" study co-author paul wade tells national geographic. \" on land, discovery of new species of large mammals is exceptionally rare. \" and the research team from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration went through all the paces to make sure this whale specimen in the berardius genus wasn't just another type of baird's whale ( which are usually more gray in color ) or another beaked whale called the arnoux: they checked out dna from 178 beaked whales, scrutinized japanese whaling records, and even took down a whale skeleton displayed in an alaskan high school gym, finding eight specimens of the new species that they'd previously thought were baird's variations. It \" reveals how little we know and how much more work we have to do to truly understand these species, \" co-author erich hoyt says in the release.

        "summary": "The sky above earth may once have been a little more crowded. The planet originally had two moons that collided into one, according to a new theory proposed in nature. It's widely believed that the early earth collided with a mars-sized proto-planet, and that debris coalesced into the moon. But the new theory says the debris created a pair of moons in close orbit, and their slow-motion collision is the cause for the moon's asymmetry. The second moon existed for tens of millions of years before the collision about 4.5 billion years ago, according to the theory, meaning no human would have seen it, notes scientific american. The differences between the near and far sides of the moon have long baffled scientists. The side we see is mostly lowlands lava plains, but the dark side is mostly highlands with crust that is much thicker and has a different mix of elements, all of which could be explained by the collision of the second moon. One researcher with a competing theory says, \" all this is great fun and tells us that there are very fundamental questions that remain about the moon. \"",

Born in 1926 in texas, price started off by singing at a radio station at age 18. Relocating to nashville, he scored a no. 3 country hit with \" talk to your heart \" in 1952, then moved to music city and confirmed his stardom with \" don't let the stars get in your eyes. \" he formed the cherokee boys — which included future stars like roger miller, willie nelson, and darrell mccall — and created a signature sound with a 4/4 shuffle. In the 1960s he turned to a lush style with strings, releasing hits like \" danny boy \" and \" i ' m still not over you. \" he was elected to the country music hall of fame in 1997 and kept recording in his later years, cmt notes, even after his cancer diagnosis last year. \" whether it be a shuffle, a bob wills swing tune, or a sentimental love song with a string section, he did it all — and did it all very well, \" reports billboard. \" he will be missed, but his music will endure. \"",

That's according to allison stewart, who writes for the washington post that no one seems to be able to pen an enduring seasonal jingle anymore. According to her analysis, the last 10-year span that produced anything noteworthy was 1984 to 1994, when wham! came out with \" last christmas, \" run dmc pumped out \" christmas in hollis, \" and carey trilled her way onto the airwaves with her hit. Stewart is baffled as to why even the likes of superstars taylor swift, coldplay, and beyonce haven't been able to churn out contemporary croonings that last longer than our new year's resolutions. Not that holiday classics-writing is an easy gig, stewart notes. There are rules: include just the right number of tried-and-true motifs ( think snowmen, mistletoe ), get religious references in there ( but not too much about jesus ), don't attempt depressing or dystopian christmas songs unless you're liz phair, and stay away from \" sappy, sentimental \" fare, a description used to label a recent olivia newton-john holiday album. It's also an exercise in frustration to resist the urge to write an instant hit — you want to pen a piece that has the potential to morph into a monster later on, though listeners may think it's just meh now. As one of the vocalists for pentatonix ( which just put out a christmas album with one original track ) puts it, \" it's hard to come up with great lyrics. … it's about a balance between being creative and risky and new, and also keeping that classic nostalgic feeling of what christmas is about. \" click for stewart's full piece.",

        "summary": "South korea will remove propaganda-broadcasting loudspeakers from the border with north korea this week, officials said monday, as the rivals move to follow through with their leaders'summit declaration that produced reconciliation steps without a breakthrough in the nuclear standoff. During their historic meeting friday at a korean border village, north korean leader kim jong un and south korean president moon jae-in agreed to end hostile acts against each other along their tense border, establish a liaison office, and resume reunions of separated families. They also agreed to achieve a nuclear-free korean peninsula, but failed to produce specific time frames and disarmament steps. Seoul's defense ministry said it would pull back dozens of its front-line loudspeakers on tuesday before media cameras, the ap reports. Ministry spokeswoman choi hyunsoo seoul expects pyongyang to do the same. South korea had already turned off its loudspeakers ahead of friday's summit talks, and north korea responded by halting its own broadcasts. Reuters reports north korean state media on monday announced the country will change its time zone effective saturday. North korea's clocks run 30 minutes behind south korea and japan's, and kim was reportedly disturbed to see the unaligned clocks hanging on the same wall during the summit. The afp reports the north shifted its clocks in 2015 — on the 70th anniversary of the end of japanese rule over the country — to the time in effect prior to japan taking over the peninsula in 1910.",

            "North korean leader kim jong un said he will move the country's clocks forward by 30 minutes to synchronize with the south's time zone as a conciliatory gesture after friday's inter-korean summit, seoul said sunday. The two countries on the divided peninsula have had different time zones since 2015 when the north suddenly changed its standard time to 30 minutes behind the south. Pyongyang cited a nationalistic rationale, saying changing the time would return the north to the time zone used before japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the peninsula to mark the 70th anniversary of its liberation from tokyo. But kim promised to change the time zone back during the historic summit with south korean president moon jae-in, moon's spokesman said. The pair held the summit — the third such meeting between the two koreas — at the border truce village of panmunjom, during which kim set foot on the south side of the border for the first time and the two leaders pledged to pursue denuclearization and a permanent peace. Kim said he found it \"heartbreaking \" to see two wall clocks hanging at the summit venue showing different times for the two neighbors, the spokesman, yoon young-chan, said. \"since we were the ones who made the change from the standard time, we will go back to the original time. You can announce it",

More than 40,000 troops are currently stationed in iraq and the current official plan is for all troops to come home by the end of the year.

Panetta is supporting a plan that would keep 3,000 to 4,000 american troops in iraq after a deadline for their withdrawal at year's end, but only to continue training security forces there, a senior military official said on tuesday. The recommendation would break a longstanding pledge by president obama to withdraw all american forces from iraq by the deadline. But it would still involve significantly fewer forces than proposals presented at the pentagon in recent weeks by the senior american commander in iraq, gen. Lloyd j. Austin iii, to keep as many as 14,000 to 18,000 troops there. The proposal for a smaller force — if approved by the white house and the iraqi government, which is not yet certain — reflected the shifting political realities in both countries. It also reflected the tension between mr. Obama's promise to bring all american forces home and the widely held view among commanders that iraq is not yet able to provide for its own security.
