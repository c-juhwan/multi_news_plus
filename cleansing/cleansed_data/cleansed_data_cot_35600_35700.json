        "summary": "A man who fired a warning shot at his daughter's troubled boyfriend and told him \" the next one's between your eyes \" got 20 years for doing it — and by law has to serve every day of the sentence, cbs news reports. \" and i was just like, ' what? ' \" says florida resident lee wollard, who insists he was defending his family. \" you know, the blood just drained out of my head. I almost passed out. \" but the charges against wollard were serious: child endangerment, aggravated assault, and shooting into a building with a firearm. He was also swept up in a us legal movement known as mandatory minimum sentencing, which appeared in the late 1980s as a way to lock up drug dealers and customers, including first offenders, in america's \" war on drugs. \" activists say it has led to prison overcrowding and cases that strike some as extreme — like the music producer with no criminal record who got 55 years for selling marijuana to cops while carrying a firearm, or a 19-year-old in texas who may face 20 years over a tray of hash brownies. But supporters argue that the threat of harsh sentences enables prosecutors to persuade suspects to plea bargain rather than enter costly, time-consuming trials. The debate is ongoing, as maine gov. Paul lepage argues for mandatory sentencing in domestic violence cases, the bangor daily news reports, and california quietly nixes a mandatory 90-day jail term for those under the influence of narcotics, the san francisco chronicle reports. Even florida ended its current penalty for firing warning shots, but too late for wollard. \" everything, everything is gone, \" he says.",

            "Legislation eliminates a state mandatory drug sentencing law as californians prepare to vote on lower sentences for drug possession, state lawmakers and gov. Jerry brown have quietly acted to eliminate the current 90-day mandatory jail term for being under the influence of illegal narcotics. Ab2492 by assemblyman reggie jones-sawyer, d-los angeles, passed both houses of the legislature with little fanfare, and brown signed it tuesday without comment. Effective jan. 1, it will revoke the law requiring at least 90 days in jail for the misdemeanor crime of being under the influence of illegal drugs, or of prescription drugs without a doctor's authorization. The current sentencing law does not apply to marijuana. Despite the mandatory sentencing law, judges in counties with overcrowded jails, like los angeles, have not been sending drug users to jail.

        "summary": "\" people are dying on the doorsteps of prosperity. \" that's per a city councilwoman in seattle, where local politicians hope a new tax on big business will alleviate homelessness. On monday, the seattle city council passed a \" head tax, \" which starting in 2019 will be imposed on the city's largest employers, including amazon, which cnnmoney reports is seattle's largest private-sector employer. The tax, which will be $ 275 year per full-time employee, is expected to bring in about $ 45 million a year to put toward homelessness services and affordable housing. The ordinance, which would be up for a renewal vote in 2023, will be placed on companies that generate more than $ 20 million a year in revenue — about 3 % of the businesses in seattle. The vote came after what the seattle times calls a \" weekend of high stakes negotiations \" between city council members and mayor jenny durkan. The original proposal would've charged around $ 500 per full-time employee instead of $ 275, which would've brought up to $ 86 million a year into city coffers, per new estimates; durkan had said she would've vetoed that measure. Seattle has long struggled with its homelessness issue, declaring a state of emergency because of it in 2015. \" we have community members who are dying, \" councilwoman teresa mosqueda says. Among other big companies expected to be hit by the tax are starbucks and the seattle times. Cnbc notes denver and chicago have imposed similar head taxes, though chicago ended up repealing it. A statement from an exec at amazon, which could end up forking over $ 10 million annually, says the company is \" disappointed \" in the vote, noting \" we remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council's hostile approach. \"",

Further, the dog-owning respondents said overwhelmingly that they actually enjoyed walking their pets ( 86 % ).

According to a new survey out of the u.k., a group of 3,000 dog owners spent an average of eight hours and 11 minutes exercising their pets each week. ( that total, the researchers behind the survey noted, accounted for an average of two 24-minute walks daily, as well as three longer walks per week. ) a total of 2,000 pet-less people questioned as part of the same survey reported logging an average of only one hour and 20 minutes of exercise per week. Further, the dog-owning respondents said overwhelmingly that they actually enjoyed walking their pets ( 86 % ). And the dog owners were far less likely to come up with excuses to get out of exercising than the pet-less respondents, owing, we imagine, to an understandable reluctance to disappoint a dog with a gleam like this in its eye. According to the telegraph, only 16 % of respondents said they enjoyed exercising in a gym.

            "Police have released the five minute 911 call that george zimmerman's girlfriend, believed to be 27-year-old samantha scheibe, made earlier in the day monday afternoon. In the audio recording, the girlfriend can be heard screaming at zimmerman, claiming he broke her glass table and saying \"you put your gun in my freaking face and told me to get the fuck out! \" during the call, zimmerman apparently pushed her out of her own house as she continued speaking to the 911 operator before police arrived. \"he knows how to do this, he knows how to play this game, \" the girlfriend tells the operator once she's stepped away from the house. She described the guns he allegedly had in possession, including a kel-tec shotgun that he was photographed shopping for back in august. She said he also had an ar-15 and two hand guns in the house and confirmed he has been living with her since august when they first got together. Towards the end of call, she acknowledged that the 911 call would likely \"go public \" and did not want to reveal any more details about their relationship. However, she did add, \"he's got nothing to lose at this point. \" zimmerman was later arrested and charged with aggravated assault, battery domestic violence and criminal mischief.

        "summary": "The us preventive services task force has issued two big changes to its recommendations for depression screening: every adult should be screened for depression at some point. Primary care physicians, including family doctors and gynecologists, should include screenings as a routine part of every over-18 patient's care, cnn reports. The patient health questionnaire, a nine-question test with questions about mood, appetite, fatigue, and concentration, among other things, can identify 80 % of depression cases, per an editorial on the new recommendations in jama. There is also a seven-question test that can be used; patients often complete such tests while waiting to see a doctor, and anyone who is found to be at risk gets a more thorough evaluation. Pregnant women should be screened for depression while pregnant and after giving birth. Maternal mental illness has been found to be more common than was previously believed, the new york times reports, and new research has also found that postpartum depression often starts during pregnancy. Ppd can lead to premature birth, low birth weight, and even mood disorders and developmental delays in babies born to affected mothers. A 10-question test called the edinburgh postnatal depression scale is recommended. Because the safety of antidepressants while pregnant or breastfeeding is not 100 % confirmed, doctors are recommended to try therapy as a first line of treatment in at-risk cases. The last set of recommendations, issued in 2009, only said adults should be screened if clinicians have the resources to treat depression; the new guidelines say that systems should be in place to ensure \" accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up, \" medpage today reports.

Scientists are building a \" cold atom lab, \" which would be able to bring matter within down as low as 0.0000000001 degrees above absolute zero, the christian science monitor reports. ( the lab itself will be a \" fridge-sized box, \" it notes. ) absolute zero, which is equivalent to −459.67 fahrenheit, is the theoretical point at which matter loses all thermal energy. As matter approaches it, things get weird; it begins acting like a wave, and can be in two places at once. Nasa will be studying in particular bose-einstein condensates, which are created when millions of atoms begin coalescing into a single wave. Building the lab in zero gravity will make it a lot easier to generate these low temperatures, allowing particles to sit comfortably within a force field. The effort is piggybacking on a broader microgravity lab, the tech times adds, and like that lab, isn't expected to launch until 2016. But once it's live, it ' ll be the coldest place in the known universe — even deep space between galaxies only reaches 3 kelvin, or -454.27 degrees fahrenheit, geek.com points out, compared to the lab's 100 pico-kelvin.

The international group for historic aircraft recovery says earhart's bones were perhaps found on the island of nikumaroro in kiribati in 1940, three years after her plane disappeared over the pacific ocean. Tighar scientists who've focused the earhart search on nikumaroro have been familiar with the bones — identified as male, and then lost — for some time: in 1998, scientists including richard jantz discovered the skeletal measurements and determined they were \" consistent with a female of earhart's height and ethnic origin. \" but another break came recently when jantz realized a forearm bone was longer than normal, reports news.com.au. Jantz then asked a forensic imaging specialist to compare the arm bone measurements to a photo showing earhart with partially bare arms. Paying close attention to the location of earhart's shoulder, elbow, and wrist, the specialist estimated earhart's radius bone in her forearm was 76 % of the length of her humerus, or upper arm bone — \" virtually identical \" to the castaway's bones, tighar says in a statement, per usa today. It adds the average woman's forearm was 73 % of the length of her humerus during earhart's lifetime. \" the match does not, of course, prove that the castaway was amelia earhart, but it is a significant new data point that tips the scales further in that direction, \" the group says.

            "Legendary aviator amelia earhart was attempting to become the first female pilot to fly around the world when her plane disappeared over the pacific ocean in 1937. Last month, the international group for historic aircraft recovery ( tighar ) proposed the theory that she landed her plane safely on a remote island and died as a castaway. Now, scientists say a new discovery shows a striking similarity between the pilot and the partial skeleton of a castaway found on an island of kiribati in 1940. A historical photo provided the vital clue. The legendary pilot in may 1932, amelia earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the atlantic ocean, taking off in canada and landing in ireland. Three years later, she flew solo from hawaii to california, winning a $ 10,000 prize. She was america's darling, famous for being a daring, but modest, pilot. Together with co-pilot frederick j. Noonan, she was attempting to circumnavigate the globe when the plane disappeared somewhere near howland island, in the middle of the pacific. In august, tighar's ric gillespie said earhart made more than 100 radio transmissions calling for help between july 2 and july 6 of 1937, ruling out the possibility of a crash landing. Her calls were picked up as far away as texas, florida, and even melbourne. \"she's out",

            "Legendary aviator amelia earhart was attempting to become the first female pilot to fly around the world when her plane disappeared over the pacific ocean in 1937. Last month, the international group for historic aircraft recovery ( tighar ) proposed the theory that she landed her plane safely on a remote island and died as a castaway. Now, scientists say a new discovery shows a striking similarity between the pilot and the partial skeleton of a castaway found on an island of kiribati in 1940. A historical photo provided the vital clue. The legendary pilot in may 1932, amelia earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the atlantic ocean, taking off in canada and landing in ireland. Three years later, she flew solo from hawaii to california, winning a $ 10,000 prize. She was america's darling, famous for being a daring, but modest, pilot. Together with co-pilot frederick j. Noonan, she was attempting to circumnavigate the globe when the plane disappeared somewhere near howland island, in the middle of the pacific. In august, tighar's ric gillespie said earhart made more than 100 radio transmissions calling for help between july 2 and july 6 of 1937, ruling out the possibility of a crash landing. Her calls were picked up as far away as texas, florida, and even melbourne. \"she's out",

That fear followed torres, 24, and husband nick, 23, from their home in idaho to houston, where they sought medical care ahead of the high-risk births of their daughters, callie and carter, in february. Those worries had not subsided as they packed up their car on friday to take their daughters, and 3-year-old brother jaysin, home to blackfoot, the houston chronicle reports. \" i've been dreading the return, \" says nick torres, referring to their concern that the girls will not survive the 1,700-mile trip spread out over five or six days. The good news is that those fears may be unwarranted. Doctors say the babies are healthy, though they do not recommend that they be separated, abc13 reports. The twins share two legs, one pelvis, intestines, and a colon. They have two separate torsos that face each other, fused at the diaphragm, per the houston press. Only about 5 % of conjoined twins share a pelvis; the vast majority are joined at the chest or abdomen. Although an orthopedic surgeon told the couple in january before the birth that separation was possible, nick torres says, \" i'd rather have two babies living stuck together than zero babies because of a bad separation. \" the couple sought help at texas children's hospital after doctors at home told them the babies would not die in utero or shortly after birth. With little money, the couple relied on local donations and a gofundme campaign. In blackfoot, they ' ll move in with nick torres ' mother, at least until he can land another job. \" it's still a few chapters ahead of us, \" he says. ( these twins conjoined in a highly rare way were successfully separated in october. )",

            "Home-sharing service airbnb will provide free housing to detainees and travelers impacted by the trump administration's sudden travel restrictions, u.s. Ceo brian chesky said on sunday. Chesky joined other silicon valley firms in lashing out at president donald trump's executive order, which blocked refugees, visa holders and other citizens of seven muslim-majority countries from entering the u.s. Other technology companies immediately moved to provide assistance to their employees, but airbnb appeared to be the first to offer free services to members of the public directly affected by the travel ban. \" airbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the us. Stayed tuned for more, contact me if urgent need for housing, \" chesky posted on twitter early sunday.",
            "We created lyft to be a model for the type of community we want our world to be: diverse, inclusive, and safe. This weekend, trump closed the country's borders to refugees, immigrants, and even documented residents from around the world based on their country of origin. Banning people of a particular faith or creed, race or identity, sexuality or ethnicity, from entering the u.s. Is antithetical to both lyft's and our nation's core values. We stand firmly against these actions, and will not be silent on issues that threaten the values of our community. We know this directly impacts many of our community members, their families, and friends.

The ap reports that the biggest cut in defense spending in four decades, reduced exports, and sluggish growth in company stockpiles contributed to the unexpected decline in gdp, which dropped at a 0.1 % annual rate between october and december. Just how big of a surprise was it? of the 83 economists survey by bloomberg, not one expected the decline, with projections ranging from a 0.3 % to 2.1 % gain. Whether it's a harbinger of doom ( raising fears the economy won't be able to handle new tax increases now in effect ) or a one-off remains to be seen, notes the ap. The wall street journal reports that the 15 % decrease in federal government spending marked the biggest drop since 1973 — a slump that strong consumer spending just couldn't overcome. Still, the gdp grew 2.2 % for all of 2012, besting 2011's 1.8 %.

        "summary": "On feb. 23, 1987, karl baden set his 35mm camera on a tripod, stood in front of it with a neutral expression, and snapped a selfie. He's done the same thing every day since except one — he blames \" a dumb moment of forgetfulness \" on oct. 15, 1991 — resulting in nearly 11,000 photos. Over the years, the boston college photography professor has used the same camera and lighting and has avoided growing a beard or mustache as a way to keep his photos constant, yet they show the remarkable progression of a 34-year-old into a 64-year-old man. Baden's face has become more lined and his hair more grey since beginning the \" every day \" project. But the most dramatic transformation occurs in photos from 2001, reports the ap. In these photos, baden is thinner, a result of chemotherapy treatment for prostate cancer. Baden has regained weight with his cancer in remission, but his sparse eyebrows are a lasting sign; baden says they never quite grew back after treatment. The owner of an art gallery where baden's photos have been displayed says they show the need to immortalize oneself. But they're also so relatable \" because we're all in same boat. We're all going to die. \" until death knocks on his door, though, baden will keep taking selfies, he told boston magazine in 2014. And while there's no chance his will become \" duck-faced portraits, \" per metro, the man dubbed the \" father of the selfie \" does credit the \" selfie craze \" with lifting his project from obscurity. ( selfies might be good for you. )",

        "summary": "Holocaust survivors pass on trauma through their genes, making their children and possibly even grandchildren more susceptible to ptsd and other stress disorders, according to new research. The guardian reports researchers looked at 32 jewish men and women who survived traumatic experiences at the hands of nazis during world war ii and their children. They found that parents passed their life experiences onto their offspring by altering their genetics in a process called \" epigenetic inheritance. \" in addition to affecting how well children of trauma survivors cope with stress, these genetic changes could also put them at increased risk of obesity and hypertension, according to scientific american. \"the gene changes in the children could only be attributed to holocaust exposure in the parents, \" says researcher rachel yehuda of mount sinai hospital in new york. The guardian explains that people's genes are modified by their environment through chemical tags that attach themselves to dna, and researchers found these tags on the same part of the stress-hormone gene in both holocaust survivors and their children. According to scientific american, the children had less cortisol — a hormone that helps recovery from trauma — and higher levels of an enzyme that destroys cortisol. Researchers aren't clear exactly how gene changes are inherited as chemical tags were previously assumed to be cleared before dna is passed on to offspring during fertilization.

Now the 77-year-old has been ordered to pay almost $ 60,000 in an ongoing lawsuit, reports my news la. William klein and talent agency jordan lee inc. Sued goldsmith last october, claiming that in november 2014 he stopped paying the company 10 % of his earnings — $ 2 million in 2015 and 2016, reports the los angeles times — as agreed upon in a 2002 contract. So goldsmith filed a countersuit in february, which the hollywood reporter took a look at: he claimed klein and the agency played no role in his dos equis deal, which he says he renegotiated in 2012 — and he alleges they stepped in it by disclosing that deal's terms in violation of its confidentiality clause, thereby damaging his relationship with dos equis. But a judge dismissed goldsmith's countersuit in may, and last week ordered him to pay $ 59,000 in legal fees. \" the only thing interesting about this guy is how he could have created the worst legal strategy possible, \" says one of klein's lawyers. The larger issue of whether goldsmith reneged on his contract remains in legal limbo. In the meantime, he's focused on \" finding a more interesting next gig, \" per fast company. He's already helped raise money for the make-a-wish foundation, canine cancer research, and drug dogs to combat a heroin epidemic. \" so many people just take up space, just live that quiet life of desperation, \" he says. \" that's a pretty f --- ing boring way to live.

            "Last summer's fierce political debate over raising the federal debt limit cost taxpayers more than $ 1 billion in extra borrowing costs, including hundreds of hours in overtime for federal employees responsible for avoiding default, according to a new government report. Delays in raising the debt limit forced the treasury department to pay an extra $ 1.3 billion in borrowing costs — and the final sum is expected to climb higher as multi-year obligations and other outstanding costs are added later, the government accountability office said in a report released monday. The costs came as the treasury suspended investments in several funds for federal employees, postal workers and other reserves to pay the nation's financial obligations as policymakers squabbled over raising the debt limit. More money was later spent to restore the funds after the limit was increased, the gao said.

            "Last summer's fierce political debate over raising the federal debt limit cost taxpayers more than $ 1 billion in extra borrowing costs, including hundreds of hours in overtime for federal employees responsible for avoiding default, according to a new government report. Delays in raising the debt limit forced the treasury department to pay an extra $ 1.3 billion in borrowing costs — and the final sum is expected to climb higher as multi-year obligations and other outstanding costs are added later, the government accountability office said in a report released monday. The costs came as the treasury suspended investments in several funds for federal employees, postal workers and other reserves to pay the nation's financial obligations as policymakers squabbled over raising the debt limit. More money was later spent to restore the funds after the limit was increased, the gao said. The report concluded that \"congress should consider ways to better link decisions about the debt limit with decisions about spending and revenue to avoid potential disruptions to the treasury market and to help inform the fiscal policy debate in a timely way. \" lawmakers agreed last summer to raise the federal debt limit to $ 16.4 trillion, a $ 2.1 trillion increase that came with an agreement to cut a similar amount in federal spending over the next decade beginning in january.

In separate legal complaints, the women say larry nassar groped and fondled them during multiple treatments in the 1990s and early 2000s. One woman, a medal-winning olympian, identified only as \" jane doe, \" has filed a lawsuit in california accusing nassar of molesting her between the ages of 12 and 18, reports the indianapolis star. She accuses usa gymnastics of ignoring suspicions about nassar and says it took her years to realize that the man she trusted had been abusing her. \" usa gymnastics failed this woman, \" her attorney says. The other woman, rachael denhollander, tells the star that she was a club-level gymnast in 2000 when nassar abused her at michigan state, where he's a faculty member. The university suspended the 53-year-old from clinical and patient duties after denhollander filed a police complaint last month. Nassar — whose lawyers say he denies any wrongdoing — was also suspended after a complaint of misconduct in 2014 that didn't result in charges, the ap reports.

If they block the nomination when it is sent for a full senate vote, senate republicans might choose the \" nuclear option \" and vote to change the rules, allowing the judge to be confirmed without any democratic votes. A roundup of coverage: sen. Dianne feinstein, the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary committee, tells the washington post that gorsuch is a \" bit of a puzzle \" and during the four days of hearings, she wants to learn more about his stance on: \" voting rights. Right to choose. Guns. Corporate dollars in elections. Worker safety. Ability of federal agencies to regulate. All of the environmental issues — water, air. \" the hill lists five things to watch for during the confirmation process, including how gorsuch will fare under pressure from democrats to speak out against trump, and whether red-state democrats will give the gop the votes they need. The ap looks at the complicated process for confirming a new supreme court justice. Monday will involve statements from all 20 members of the senate judiciary committee, followed by one from gorsuch himself. Two days of questioning will follow, with witnesses testifying thursday. Under current rules, the nomination will need 60 votes to proceed in the senate. The republicans currently have 52. The new york times looks at the democrats ' choice, which it describes as \" get out of the way or get run over. \" some democrats feel that since gorsuch is replacing fellow conservative antonin scalia, they should allow the nomination to proceed now and dig in their heels next time. Feinstein's office has issued a statement calling gorsuch a \" pro-life extremist \" because of his record on issues like planned parenthood as a federal appeals judge, the san francisco chronicle reports. He has also \" consistently sided with employers and corporate interests, \" the senator's office said. Gorsuch would be the only protestant on the court, but his religious background is complicated, cnn reports. He was raised a catholic, but now worships at the st. John's episcopal church in boulder, colo., which conservative groups have denounced as excessively liberal. Liberal activists have vowed that democrats who fail to hold gorsuch's \" feet to the fire \" this week will face consequences, politico reports.

Why? that part is unclear, but one theory is that some of the same factors associated with baldness — such as heightened sensitivity to testosterone and resistance to insulin — are also linked to cardiovascular trouble. The baldness, then, could be a visible sign of trouble within. One analysis found that bald men were about 30 % more likely to have heart trouble, while another put the figure at 70 %. It may sound alarming, but \" much more research is needed to confirm any link between male pattern baldness and an increased risk of coronary heart disease, \" says a cardiac expert with the british heart foundation. \" in the meantime, it's more important to pay attention to your waistline than your hairline. \"",

        "summary": "Enrique marquez didn't just purchase two guns used in the san bernardino shooting. Officials tell cnn the long-time friend and next-door neighbor of syed rizwan farook has also admitted to plotting an attack with farook in 2012. They allegedly put the plan on ice after four people in the area were accused of trying to travel abroad to carry out jihad. Marquez — who married the sister of farook's sister-in-law in november 2014 — reportedly told investigators that he and farook \" were on the path to radicalization as early as 2011, \" reports cnn. Authorities raided marquez's mother's home over the weekend and have been questioning marquez, 24, over several days, reports the los angeles times. Marquez, who admitted himself to a mental health facility after the shooting, maintains he had no prior knowledge of the attack, investigators say. Marquez's marriage license lists his address as the home of farook's father or brother, per the ap and cnn. The manager of the mosque on the license says marquez had converted to islam but only worshiped there a few times. He most recently worked as a security guard at a walmart but has since been fired, a rep says. A friend from riverside city college — which marquez attended from 2009 to 2011 — says his ultimate goal was to join the us navy. He was focused on fitness but occasionally wrote on facebook about being sad or lonely, she says. He also said he was \" not clicking \" with his russian wife and didn't live with her. Marquez \" is a really good person \" and wouldn't knowingly help farook and malik with a deadly attack, she adds. Hours after the shooting, however, a message appeared on marquez's facebook page: \" i ' m. Very sorry sguys [ sic ], \" it read. \" it was a pleasure. \"",

            "Significance the rate of erroneous conviction of innocent criminal defendants is often described as not merely unknown but unknowable. We use survival analysis to model this effect, and estimate that if all death-sentenced defendants remained under sentence of death indefinitely at least 4.1 % would be exonerated. We conclude that this is a conservative estimate of the proportion of false conviction among death sentences in the united states. Abstract the rate of erroneous conviction of innocent criminal defendants is often described as not merely unknown but unknowable. There is no systematic method to determine the accuracy of a criminal conviction; if there were, these errors would not occur in the first place. As a result, very few false convictions are ever discovered, and those that are discovered are not representative of the group as a whole. In the united states, however, a high proportion of false convictions that do come to light and produce exonerations are concentrated among the tiny minority of cases in which defendants are sentenced to death. This makes it possible to use data on death row exonerations to estimate the overall rate of false conviction among death sentences. The high rate of exoneration among death-sentenced defendants appears to be driven by the threat of execution, but most death-sentenced defendants are removed from death row and resentenced to life imprisonment, after which the likelihood of exoneration drops sharply.

        "summary": "Female sex workers ' prices seem to be dropping, the economist finds: a 12-country study of prostitute-review websites shows that an hour of sex today costs a customer about $ 260, whereas in 2006 it was $ 340. Why is that? first off, there's the financial crisis; cities affected the most, like cleveland, have seen a particular drop in prices. Then there's migration, the magazine notes: when a city has an influx of migrant sex workers, prices drop. Supply has also probably increased as a result of the internet, where prostitutes can advertise without revealing their identities. What's more, with premarital sex more accepted and casual meetings more common these days, there may be fewer men seeking out prostitutes. Despite the drop in prices, however, prostitutes may not be taking such a big hit, the economist notes. The internet has meant less need for brothels and pimps, allowing the workers themselves to take a higher percentage of the price. What's more, some cities are still seeing 2006-level prices: boston prostitutes, for instance, charge some $ 370 an hour, boston.com notes, via the economist, while san francisco prostitutes charge $ 360 and seattle $ 350.

Their 2015 book hitler's last day: minute by minute takes a look at adolf hitler's manhood via medical records they say they've accessed, and the two assert that hitler suffered from \" two forms of genital abnormality, \" per the telegraph. The first, an undescended testicle, was said to have been confirmed by another historian in december. The second is hypospadias, \" in which the urethra opens on the under side of the penis. \" though hypospadias can be accompanied by other conditions, craigie clarifies in an email to the independent that it would be a \" leap \" to say the condition led to an abnormally small penis in hitler's case, as has been reported. The cdc — which says half-a-percent of male babies born in the us have the condition — reports that untreated hypospadias can snowball into future problems, \" such as difficulty performing sexual intercourse or difficulty urinating while standing. \" hitler's sex life has long been a subject of debate, with some arguing he was \" repelled \" by sex ( ostensibly due to a fear of stds ) and others asserting he and eva braun enjoyed a typical sex life. In an april 2015 discussion about the book with the gloucestershire echo, mayo doesn't address hitler's penis, but he does recount other unusual facts he says he uncovered, like this: \" at the same time that hitler's body was being burned, winston churchill accidentally set fire to his clothing and had to be put out by a member of staff. \" ( another claim: hitler suffered from \" uncontrollable flatulence. \" )",

Instead of a \" smoking gun \" revealing tax evasion, shady financial ties, or exaggerated wealth, as some trump critics had hoped for, the document showed only that trump paid around $ 38 million in more than $ 150 million in income that year, leading some to speculate that the leak may have come from somebody close to the president — or even from trump himself. A roundup of coverage: journalist daniel cay johnston told maddow he received the pages in the mail, and it was \" entirely possible that donald sent this to me. \" \" donald has a long history of leaking material about himself when he thinks it's in his interest, \" he said. The fact that the pages were marked \" client copy \" fed speculation that the leak came from somebody close to trump, not the irs, the washington post reports. Trump, unusually, had nothing to say about the leak on twitter, though son donald trump jr. Tweeted: \" thank you rachel maddow for proving to your #trump hating followers how successful @realdonaldtrump is &amp; that he paid $ 40mm in taxes! \" maddow \" trolled us all for ratings \" by teasing what turned out to be a surprise-free leak, complains jon levine at mediaite. \" in the end, the most remarkable part of the story may be the ratings generated in an hour of cable prime time focusing exclusively on taxes, \" he writes.

            "Page content washington – as part of its ongoing investigation into the may 12, 2015, derailment of amtrak train 188 in philadelphia, the ntsb today provides this update on the analysis of the engineer's cell phone and related records. The ntsb is conducting a detailed examination of the engineer's cell phone calls, texts, data and cell phone tower transmission activity records from the phone carrier; and records from amtrak's on-board wi-fi system. Analysis of the phone records does not indicate that any calls, texts, or data usage occurred during the time the engineer was operating the train. Amtrak's records confirm that the engineer did not access the train's wi-fi system while he was operating the locomotive. To determine whether the phone was in \"airplane mode \" or was powered off, investigators in the ntsb laboratory in washington have been examining the phone's operating system, which contains more than 400,000 files of meta-data. Investigators are obtaining a phone identical to the engineer's phone as an exemplar model and will be running tests to validate the data. The engineer provided the ntsb with the passcode to the cell phone, which allowed investigators to access the data without having to go through the phone manufacturer. Last year the ntsb lab processed about 80 personal electronic devices and more than 40 cell",

( published wednesday, june 10, 2015 ) update: the ntsb determined the engineer wasn't using his phone or wi-fi at the time of the crash. Investigators have determined whether the engineer in the deadly amtrak crash that killed eight people and injured over 200 others in philadelphia was using his cellphone, two sources told reuters on tuesday. The national transportation safety board is expected to release its latest findings on wednesday between 9 a.m. And 10 a.m. The report says the officials wouldn't reveal their findings ahead of wednesday's announcement. Federal accident investigators have said amtrak's train 188 was going 106 miles per hour just before it derailed on a curve with a 50 mph speed limit. Investigators said they were still analyzing cellphone records to determine whether engineer brandon bostian, 32, was using it while operating the train. The ntsb reported last month bostian's phone records show calls were made and text messages were sent the day of the crash but they were unable to determine at that point whether the phone was used while the train was in motion. Bostian's lawyer, robert goggin, has said he kept his cellphone in a bag and used it only to call 911"

            "Page content washington – as part of its ongoing investigation into the may 12, 2015, derailment of amtrak train 188 in philadelphia, the ntsb today provides this update on the analysis of the engineer's cell phone and related records. The ntsb is conducting a detailed examination of the engineer's cell phone calls, texts, data and cell phone tower transmission activity records from the phone carrier; and records from amtrak's on-board wi-fi system. Analysis of the phone records does not indicate that any calls, texts, or data usage occurred during the time the engineer was operating the train. Amtrak's records confirm that the engineer did not access the train's wi-fi system while he was operating the locomotive. To determine whether the phone was in \"airplane mode \" or was powered off, investigators in the ntsb laboratory in washington have been examining the phone's operating system, which contains more than 400,000 files of meta-data. Investigators are obtaining a phone identical to the engineer's phone as an exemplar model and will be running tests to validate the data. The engineer provided the ntsb with the passcode to the cell phone, which allowed investigators to access the data without having to go through the phone manufacturer. Last year the ntsb lab processed about 80 personal electronic devices and more than 40 cell",
            "We could learn wednesday if engineer brandon bostian was using his cellphone at the time of last month's deadly crash. ( published wednesday, june 10, 2015 ) update: the ntsb determined the engineer wasn't using his phone or wi-fi at the time of the crash. Investigators have determined whether the engineer in the deadly amtrak crash that killed eight people and injured over 200 others in philadelphia was using his cellphone, two sources told reuters on tuesday. The national transportation safety board is expected to release its latest findings on wednesday between 9 a.m. And 10 a.m. The report says the officials wouldn't reveal their findings ahead of wednesday's announcement. Federal accident investigators have said amtrak's train 188 was going 106 miles per hour just before it derailed on a curve with a 50 mph speed limit. Investigators said they were still analyzing cellphone records to determine whether engineer brandon bostian, 32, was using it while operating the train. The ntsb reported last month bostian's phone records show calls were made and text messages were sent the day of the crash but they were unable to determine at that point whether the phone was used while the train was in motion. Bostian's lawyer, robert goggin, has said he kept his cellphone in a bag and used it only to call 911"

        "summary": "King tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in 1922, and nearly 100 years later, it may be giving up a millennia-old secret: analysis of radar scans of his burial chamber carried out in november have revealed two hidden rooms, egypt's antiquities minister mamdouh el-damaty announced in a thursday news conference. Further, the scans indicate the presence of metal and organic materials. A new scan will take place on march 31, nbc news reports, with cnn explaining that the subsequent test will reveal the dimensions of the rooms and the thickness of the walls, which will allow egypt to plan a way forward. British archaeologist nicolas reeves in august theorized that the remains of queen nefertiti might be inside, and national geographic fills in the timeline: egypt allowed reeves and radar expert hirokatsu watanabe to scan tut's tomb over two nights in november; the scans did suggest the presence of a chamber on the north side, with el-damaty saying at the time he was 90 % certain of the existence of one room. But watanabe had not completed a full analysis of the scans then. Now he has, hence el-damaty's thursday announcement and the revelation of a chamber on the west wall as well. Cnn explains that the size of tut's tomb seems inappropriately small considering his importance, with reeves suggesting the king was placed in a hastily constructed extension of a tomb intended for a queen upon his death at 17. The ap reports el-damaty thinks the new chambers could contain a royal tomb, but he wouldn't speculate on nefertiti — who was one of the wives of tut's father but is not believed to be tut's mother.

The vatican originally expected only 5,000 followers, but learned a valuable lesson: never underestimate the enthusiasm of language nerds. \" the surprise is that nerds are in all walks of life — cab drivers from south africa, homemakers, journalists, \" says a language expert at the vatican's latin office. Now, when can we expect the ancient aramaic account to launch?",

        "summary": "Keeping with president trump's promise to focus on law and order, attorney general jeff sessions has told federal prosecutors to resume going after drug offenders with maximum penalties. His two-page memo rolls back the more lenient obama-era order not to charge defendants that meet certain criteria with drug offenses that would bring long mandatory minimum sentences, reports the washington post. According to the wall street journal, sessions has suggested that lighter sentencing is at the root of america's opioid epidemic as well as rising violent crime. The memo said prosecutors can allow exceptions to the order if they document their reasoning and gain approval from supervisors. \"there will be circumstances in which good judgment would lead a prosecutor to conclude that a strict application of the above charging policy is not warranted, \" sessions wrote. While some applaud the tougher sentencing policy, advocates of criminal justice reform are not happy. The aclu said the move required prosecutors \"to reverse progress and repeat a failed experiment — the war on drugs — that has devastated the lives and rights of millions of americans. \" under the overturned guidelines by former attorney general eric holder, prosecutors were told to go easier on nonviolent defendants without a criminal history who were not members of gangs.

Joko's inaugural address built upon his previous \" people-centric \" statements, saying he would be pushing in his new role to help the nation's poor and transform indonesia into a major \" maritime power, \" given its strategic archipelago status. Joko's humble beginnings included growing up poor as the child of a carpenter, often helping his dad gather wood they could sell, the straits times reports. Even today joko and his wife dress modestly ( she rarely wears branded clothing ), and he's a self-confessed metallica and megadeth fan. There may be possible roadblocks during his tenure: joko beat prabowo subianto — a son-in-law of authoritarian former president suharto — in the july election, and now prabowo's cronies have been threatening to stymie joko's plans, the times notes. But that didn't mar the celebration of thousands of people in the streets after joko's inauguration. \" we used to have our transfers of power marked by bloodshed; today we have this: a huge party, \" one spectator tells the bbc.

Nbc news reports that the relic was taken on saturday from the church of san pietro della ienca, which is located in central italy's abruzzo region. Reuters reports the only other item taken from the church was a crucifix, leading police to believe this may have been a commissioned hit — and that the intended use could be something to do with satanic rituals, noting resale would be highly difficult. That difficulty may be due in part to its rarity: the independent reports there are only three known relics containing the late pope's blood in existence; some of his blood was saved after the 1981 attempt on his life. And it's actually not the first theft involving john paul ii's blood, though the 2012 instance was seemingly less intentional: a priest transporting a relic containing the blood in his backpack had that backpack stolen. It was later found. Now, some 50 police and sniffer dogs are combing the area ( a favorite ski destination of the pope, who liked to quietly pray in the church, reports reuters ) looking for the missing vial. The value of that relic may be rising soon: the late pope will be made a saint in april.",

The vial was taken from the san pietro della lenca church in the central abruzzo region on saturday. The area was regularly visited by pope john paul ii, who enjoyed skiing in the mountainous region before his death in 2005. It is one of only three known vials containing the polish pope's blood, who is expected to be declared a saint in a ceremony at the vatican on 27 april, and they are considered to be of great religious significance. It is not the first time one of them has been stolen. In 2012 a priest travelling north from rome had his backpack stolen by three thieves. It contained an intricate relic of blood, which had been taken from pope john paul ii following an assassination attempt in st peter's square in 1981. Having alerted local police the relic was eventually retrieved having been thrown into reeds next to a nearby railway station."

            "A relic containing the blood of pope john paul ii has been stolen from a church, sparking a major search involving sniffer dogs and more than 50 policemen. The vial was taken from the san pietro della lenca church in the central abruzzo region on saturday. The area was regularly visited by pope john paul ii, who enjoyed skiing in the mountainous region before his death in 2005. It is one of only three known vials containing the polish pope's blood, who is expected to be declared a saint in a ceremony at the vatican on 27 april, and they are considered to be of great religious significance. It is not the first time one of them has been stolen. In 2012 a priest travelling north from rome had his backpack stolen by three thieves. It contained an intricate relic of blood, which had been taken from pope john paul ii following an assassination attempt in st peter's square in 1981. Having alerted local police the relic was eventually retrieved having been thrown into reeds next to a nearby railway station."

        "summary": "Since 1841, many have wondered what might have created \" mima mounds, \" the mysterious ( and quite numerous ) large, ancient bumps emerging from the ground in washington state's mima prairie. Earthquakes? floods? glaciers? aliens? nope. Most likely, it was... Gophers. Researchers think they've finally figured it out, livescience reports: pocket gophers burrow into the earth, and over the years, they push small amounts of dirt, rocks, or dead vegetation above them in an effort to keep dry until — many, many generations later — you have an 8-foot-tall, 30-foot-wide mound. Researchers ran a computer model and used \" digital gophers \" that behaved exactly as real pocket gophers do, the lead researcher tells the bbc. ( other types of gophers push material downward, not upward. ) the model showed that after 500 to 700 years, the gophers ' normal burrowing would result in the huge mounds — which are, the lead researcher says, \" the largest structures built by any mammal not including humans \" when scaled by body size. \" in terms of effort, it would be like a single person building the pyramids. \" a mima mound expert says that while the study isn't absolute proof pocket gophers are responsible, it certainly shows that the animals are capable of the feat. Mima mounds aren't specific to washington; in fact, they're found on every continent but antarctica. The same can't be said for gophers, but researchers speculate the mounds could have been formed by other burrowing mammals, the sky valley chronicle notes.

Investigators say the former high school teacher engaged in sexual relationships with students, including a 16-year-old who moved into the dawsons ' home two days after lynette's disappearance, which chris reported six weeks later.

Meanwhile, chris ' family touts his innocence, citing \" uncontested evidence that lyn dawson was alive long after she left chris. \" ( officers dug up the couple's former home this year. )",

He defended a long list of his trademark policies -- tax increases on the wealthy, wall street reform, health care reform, government stimulus spending -- to applause from fellow democrats while also offering proposals of interest to republicans, such as corporate tax breaks and expanded oil and gas development. Declaring \" the state of our union is getting stronger, \" obama said america had come too far in its still sluggish recover from economic recession \" to turn back now.",

            "Washington — president obama pledged on tuesday night to use government power to balance the scale between america's rich and the rest of the public, trying to present an election-year choice between continued leadership toward an economy \"built to last \" and what he called irresponsible policies of the past that caused an economic collapse. Declaring that \"we've come too far to turn back now, \" the president used his final state of the union address before he faces the voters to showcase the extent to which he will try to contrast his core economic principles with those of his republican rivals in a time of deep economic uncertainty. While many americans remain disappointed with the state of the economy and the president's handling of it, mr. Obama nonetheless tried to bring into relief the difference between where the country was when he took over and where it is now. \"the state of our union is getting stronger, \" he declared in time-honored tradition. \"in the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. \" he pointed to renewed hiring by american manufacturers and — borrowing the \"built to last \""

Researchers studying the greenland shark estimate the oldest of their 28 specimens is 392 years old, give or take 120 years, science reports. They tell npr they're 95 % sure greenland sharks live between 272 and 512 years. That would make the sharks the longest-living vertebrates on the planet, according to time. The bowhead whale was the previous record holder, living up to 211 years, so even 272 years is a massively long lifespan. The shocked researchers published their findings thursday. Researchers deduced the shark's age by carbon dating its eyes. National geographic reports the greenland shark hadn't been heavily studied in the past due to living in the remote north atlantic and being hard to find. A geneticist believes the cold water in the sharks ' home is responsible for their long lives, slowing their metabolic rates and turning on an anti-aging gene. Meanwhile a biologist specializing in aging is suddenly interested in studying the greenland shark. \" there's something going on in those muscles, \" he tells npr. \" if we discover what it is, we might be able to adapt it to human use. \" ( this might be the first shark caught napping. )",

        "summary": "A watchdog report has some thrilling news for taxpayers: $ 43 million of your hard-earned money went toward building a single gas station in afghanistan with an initial budget of $ 3 million. If that's not bad enough, the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction says the department of defense has been unable or unwilling to explain the high cost of afghanistan's first compressed natural gas filling station, built in sheberghan in 2011. The dod told sigar it lacked the \" personnel expertise \" to respond because the task force in charge of the operation closed in march. \" i've never encountered anything like this, \" says sigar's john sopko, who calls the project \" an outrageous waste of money, \" per nbc news. \" there may be fraud. There may be corruption. But i cannot currently find out more about this because of the lack of cooperation. \" the dod tells nbc it's now providing access to records. But the report found \" no indication \" that the task force investigated the viability of the project, aimed at easing afghanistan's reliance on imports, or the obstacles it might face before breaking ground. \" even considering security costs associated with construction and operation in afghanistan, this level of expenditure appears gratuitous and extreme, \" the report states, noting such a project in pakistan would cost just $ 500,000. Sigar also couldn't determine whether the station was still operational; documents show the business that took it over in 2014 didn't renew its business license that year, reports fox news. Sopko adds he's still investigating the task force's other projects, for which it was given $ 820 million from 2010 to 2014.",

            "\"just so you know, \" my fiancee said to me, \"you're going to lose me to simcity. \" this was no idle threat. Throughout our relationship i had already lost her to skyrim for roughly 150 hours and to diablo iii for something approximating that. I am happy to play a game for a few hours and then move on to the next one. She plays fewer games, but exhausts every last drop of enjoyment out of them in marathon sessions that would make rand paul blush. This was my fair warning that she expected simcity, the first edition of the classic metropolis-building simulator in 10 years, to be one of those releases with her sleeping about three hours a night, more as a formality than anything else. She'd played the beta, her city falling victim to meteor showers and zombie attacks. She knew how to avoid those",

The web retailer stopped sales late on 7 march as players reported continued problems with the city building title. The latest version of simcity was launched on 5 march and, like many current games, demands players stay online as they play. Ea has also taken steps to fix login delays by turning off some features to lighten the load on game servers. Prior to this latest release, simcity was a stand-alone game, but ea has added the online element to infuse the title with more realism. Now player cities exist as part of online regions and share some characteristics of those virtual environments such as pollution, crime and essential resources.

Nt1 was found guilty of conspiring to account falsely in the 1990s and served a four-year sentence, while nt2 conspired to intercept communications and served just four months. What's more, warby says, nt2 has shown remorse, while nt1 \" has not accepted his guilt, has misled the public and this court, and shows no remorse over any of these matters. \" warby also ruled that nt2 was unlikely to repeat his crime of invading someone's privacy, while nt1 \" remains in business, and the information serves the purpose of minimizing the risk that he will continue to mislead, as he has in the past. \" google had declined requests by both men to remove search results but says it will comply with the ruling, the bbc reports. The legal \" right to be forgotten \" precedent was set in a 2014 european union case; since then google has nixed some 800,000 pages but can refuse to delete search findings it deems of public interest. More \" claims of this kind \" are likely following nt2's legal victory, warby tells the guardian.",

With jcpenney's gradual departure from print ( smaller catalogs and \" look books \" continued in various forms, the dallas morning news noted ), \" we lost a lot of customers, \" says ceo mike ullman. The catalog once reached 1,000 pages; the new version, while still fairly hefty, will only be about 120. Starting in march, specially-chosen customers will get a look at its offerings, which will focus on home goods. Jcpenney isn't alone in seeing the advantages of print, the journal notes: j.

I don't think it is a good idea for a girl to drink six tequilas and lose her virginity on the bathroom floor in a frat house....

Pbs reports the deal between the us and 11 other countries would remove trade barriers and set labor and environmental standards. It would be the largest regional trade agreement in history. Clinton tells pbs she opposes the deal because it doesn't address currency manipulation and appears to be better for pharmaceutical companies than patients. Sanders, who clinton will be debating in a few days, claims the agreement will be bad for american consumers and jobs. The new york times reports clinton's position could help her steal liberal and union support from sanders and distance her from vice president biden, who may enter the race. According to politico, clinton's announcement is part of a \" striking string of disagreements with obama \" over issues like the keystone xl pipeline and the affordable care act's so-called cadillac tax. The trans-pacific partnership was completed monday and still needs to be approved by congress, pbs reports.",

After months of delicately avoiding expressing an opinion on the controversial trade deal, mrs. Clinton said the agreement in its current form did not meet her high bar for protecting american workers, the environment and advancing national security.

        "summary": "Emmanuel macron's first handshake with president trump in may may have suggested a confrontational start, but the french president has pulled out all the stops for trump's visit to his country. On thursday, there was dinner in the eiffel tower, and on friday, trump was regaled with an extravagant military parade in the capital to commemorate bastille day. Cnn calls it \" a strategic show of friendship \" by macron. As this year's celebration also marks 100 years since the us entered wwi, the parade — watched by macron and trump from their highly guarded spot at the place de la concorde — featured appearances from 150 or so us service members and american aircraft, in addition to french military. Bastille day is france's version of july 4, marking the july 14, 1789, storming of the bastille prison that was a symbol of that time's tyrannical rule, per the independent. Cnn notes two reasons that may underlie all this pomp and circumstance: macron's wish to elevate france back to \" major global standing, \" as well as to get closer to trump — who \" has long been fascinated by the military, \" per the washington post — and serve as his \" bridge to europe. \" \" mr. Trump's presence at my side is a sign of an enduring friendship and i want to thank him, \" macron said after the parade, per reuters. The day takes on a somber note, too, as it's the one-year anniversary of the terror attack in nice, which killed nearly 90 people. Earlier this month, a man was arrested for allegedly plotting an attack on macron during bastille day. More than 130,000 security staff and emergency services workers are keeping things safe nationwide, per usa today.",

The five twitter accounts under suspicion took aim at philadelphia players joel embiid and markelle fultz, former sixers general manager sam hinkie, toronto raptors executive masai ujiri and former sixers players jahlil okafor and nerlens noel, according to the ringer.

For a while, as the ap reported, her whereabouts were unknown; she ended up checking into a different california facility late yesterday, tmz reports. Apparently lohan spent just a few minutes at morningside recovery in newport beach, which was already a last-minute switcheroo from the new york facility she originally chose. Morningside had not been approved by prosecutors and it's not licensed for residential in-patient rehab — a problem since lohan was supposed to be at a lockdown facility. Lohan \" was not happy with the place, \" dad michael says of morningside, according to cnn. \" lindsay had no idea that morningside wasn't approved. \" so she ended up at betty ford, hours before prosecutors were set to seek an arrest warrant. ( the rancho mirage facility is the same one where lohan was accused of brawling with a staffer in 2010. ) she also re-hired her old attorney, shawn holley, who negotiated the betty ford deal for her with the santa monica city attorney; now the judge just needs to sign off on it, which he is expected to do. Bizarrely, the new york daily news spotted her wandering around an electronics store yesterday; that paper says she wanted to fly back to new york, and according to the quotes it got from michael lohan, lindsay really has no grasp of the way the legal system works: \" she said,'daddy, how can they arrest me?
