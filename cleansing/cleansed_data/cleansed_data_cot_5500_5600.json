        "summary": "Johnny depp sued his former business managers friday alleging they mismanaged his earnings throughout a lucrative period of his career, although the company says the actor's spending is to blame. Depp's lawsuit filed against the management group seeks more than $ 25 million, reports the ap, alleging it failed to properly pay his taxes, made unauthorized loans, and overpaid for security. Michael j. Kump, an attorney for the management group, calls depp's lawsuit a \" fabrication. \" the company \" did everything possible to protect depp from his irresponsible and profligate spending, \" kump wrote. Depp's suit accuses the company and its owners, attorneys joel and robert mandel, of receiving $ 28 million in payments for services over 16 years. The company \" actively concealed the true state of mr. Depp's finances while driving him deeper and deeper into financial distress, \" the suit states. Depp hired the mandels in 1999 and they received 5 % of his income on hit films such as the pirates of the caribbean franchise, alice in wonderland, and charlie and the chocolate factory. The lawsuit alleges the company failed to file depp's tax returns on time, costing him nearly $ 5.7 million in penalties. The lawsuit also alleges the company overpaid for several services, including forgetting to terminate the lease on a home where depp's mother lived temporarily, and spending $ 8 million on security between 2012 and 2015 alone. Depp learned of the problems after hiring new management in march 2016. Kump wrote that depp owes the management group $ 4.2 million from a $ 5 million loan. \" his tactics and lawsuit will fail, and he will be forced to pay back the loan as promised, \" kump wrote. The suit came the same day depp finalized his divorce from amber heard, which calls for depp to pay $ 7 million in installments. Heard gets to keep the couple's dogs, notes the bbc, pistol and boo.",

Depp, 53, has agreed to pay heard $ 7m ( £ 5.6m; € 6.6m ), which she says she will donate to two charities. Heard, 30, will get to keep the couple's dogs, pistol and boo, who were at the centre of scandal when she took them to australia illegally in 2015. She had accused depp of domestic abuse - a claim he denies. According to court documents, she said depp had been physically abusive to her, culminating in him throwing a mobile phone at her face during a fight in february last year. Depp's lawyer denied the allegations, saying heard was \" attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse \".

        "summary": "In what the deputy premier of new south wales is calling a \" historic \" rescue, two teens were saved from choppy surf thanks to a drone that dropped an inflatable safety device to them — all as it recorded the rescue. The bbc reports that aussie lifeguards were still testing how to use the little ripper drone when a beachgoer saw the boys, said to be between the ages of 15 and 17, struggling in the water nearly a half-mile from shore. The lifeguards immediately launched the drone, and quartz points to the video footage of the rescue, which is also making the rounds on youtube. The drone first glides over the aquamarine waters, then spots two tiny black dots ( the teens ) being pounded by the waves down below. The clip then shows the drone drop the bright-yellow rescue device, which self-inflates when it hits the water. The boys grab hold of the inflatable and kick their way back to shore. The head lifeguard who sent the drone out calls it an \" amazingly efficient piece of lifesaving equipment and a delight to fly, \" per the sydney morning herald. He says he was able to get the drone off the ground and the inflatable to the boys all within a couple of minutes; a local parliament official says a lifeguard rescue would have likely taken up to six minutes. The new south wales government just last month announced it had put up about $ 345,000 for a drone fleet, with some meant for rescues like this and others designed for other purposes, such as spying sharks in the water. \" this was an extraordinary rescue with the very best possible outcome, \" a local parliament member notes. The rescued boys were exhausted when they got to shore but seemed otherwise ok. ( a drone saved a 92-year-old hunter in virginia. )",

Eighteen of the fatalities occurred in the city of ankang alone. The stings are believed to be the work of the asian giant hornet or vespa mandarinia, which cnn describes as the planet's largest hornet species; they measure up to about two inches in length. Scarier still, their venom contains a neurotoxin strong enough to dissolve human tissue. \" the hornets chased me about 200 meters, and stung me for more than three minutes, \" says one victim, whose kidneys were so damaged by the venom that his urine reportedly turned the color of soy sauce. Some 583 people have been stung in ankang since july 1 — some more than 200 times, with most attacks happening in remote, wooded areas — in a city where just 36 died from stings between 2002 and 2005. Experts speculate that the increase in attacks is due to the recent hot, dry weather, which is ideal for breeding, along with land development that has upset nests. To deal with the issue, the city's major said a 24-hour emergency hornet response team would be set up, though attacks aren't expected to drop until the temperatures do, too.",

        "summary": "An american man is about to face trial in south korea for a murder he says he didn't commit. Arthur patterson, 35, was just 17 when he and a korean-american friend, edward lee, challenged each other to kill a man with a pocketknife in 1997, according to prosecutors. Both have admitted to being in the restroom of a seoul burger king where college student cho choong-pil was found with multiple stab wounds to his neck, but the two friends each blamed the other for the killing, reports the new york times. In an initial trial, lee was sentenced to 20 years in prison for murder, while patterson got 18 months for possessing a dangerous weapon and destroying evidence, reports the ap. He was released in an amnesty in 1998. That same year, the supreme court ordered a retrial and lee was let off for lack of evidence. Patterson, the son of an american military contractor, returned to the us in 1999 as the main suspect in the killing; he fled while authorities were trying to renew a travel ban that would keep him in the country. Yonhap news reports he was detained in the us and formally indicted for murder in may 2011, two years after a popular movie about cho's murder led to fresh calls for justice. The ap notes crimes in south korea linked to the us military are \" a long-running source of anti-american sentiments. \" upon his arrival at incheon international airport yesterday, patterson expressed sympathy for cho's family but denied he committed murder. \" it's not right that they have to keep going through this pain over and over and over, but it's not right that i ' m here either. I ' m still shocked that i ' m even here, \" he said. A trial date hasn't been set.",

            "Washington ( reuters ) - north korea, if left unchecked, is on an \"inevitable \" path to obtaining a nuclear-armed missile capable of striking the united states, defense intelligence agency director lieutenant general vincent stewart told a senate hearing on tuesday. U.s. Director of national intelligence dan coats ( l ) and director of the defense intelligence agency lieutenant general vincent stewart testify before the senate armed services committee on worldwide threats, on capitol hill in washington, u.s., may 23, 2017. Reuters/yuri gripas the remarks are the latest indication of mounting u.s. Concern about pyongyang's advancing missile and nuclear weapons programs, which the north says are needed for self-defense. U.s. Lawmakers pressed stewart and the director of national intelligence dan coats to estimate how far away north korea was from obtaining an intercontinental ballistic missile( icbm ) that could reach the united states. They repeatedly declined to offer an estimate, saying that doing so would reveal u.s. Knowledge about north korea's capabilities, but stewart warned the panel the risk was growing. \"if left on its current trajectory the regime will ultimately succeed in fielding a nuclear-armed missile capable of threatening the united states homeland, \" stewart said. \"while nearly impossible to predict when this capability will be operational, the north korean regime is committed and is on a pathway where this capability is inevitable. \" the u.n.

The automated program, called shuti, is an online adaptation of cognitive behavioral therapy, which can help address the problem of a lack of clinicians trained to carry out such therapy. The study, carried out by university of virginia scientists and reported on in the jama psychiatry journal, focused on 303 people ages 21 to 65 with chronic insomnia, most of whom had already gone the medication or supplement route. Half received a \" digital placebo, \" which included getting educational materials and tips on how to deal with sleep issues. The others received six weeks of shuti, which uses sleep restriction ( trying to stay within the same sleep \" window \" every night ) and stimulus control ( which focuses on getting rid of the association between the bed and non-sleep activities ). The program also helps patients dump destructive beliefs about sleep, like thinking one needs meds to doze off, and requires patients to keep a daily log so sessions can be catered to each subject. A year later, 57 % of shuti subjects were enjoying normal sleep, while only 27 % of the digital placebo group were. The times notes some scientists in the study, as well as uva, have a financial stake in the product, though it says none of those people had access to the data. The study concludes that shuti could prove to be \" a less expensive, scalable treatment option that could reach previously unimaginable numbers of people, \" per a release.

He reached the 13,677-foot summit on tuesday, but as he was making his return in the late afternoon, a snowstorm descended upon the mountain, creating blinding white-out conditions. Ferracane said sverdlov made a few futile attempts to locate his pack before deciding to hunker down in the snow until daylight. She said his only protection were the clothes he was wearing. The bottle of water he was carrying had frozen. In the meantime, park officials had closed access to mauna loa earlier tuesday because of the dangerous weather.

        "summary": "In the real world, fatal animal encounters are more my girl than jaws. The new york times reports researchers — in a study published in wilderness &amp; environmental medicine — found hornets, wasps, and bees killed 478 people between 2008 and 2015. That's 29.7 % of the 1,610 people killed by animals during that period. It's also the reason dr. Jared forrester, the study's lead author, says in a press release that it's \" critical \" epipens and other epinephrine auto-injectors be affordable; their price has quadrupled in recent years. Dogs were also responsible for a high number of human deaths — 272 people, including 95 children under 10 — during the study period. The fatality rate in dog attacks for children under 4 was nearly quadruple that of other age groups. \" it's usually family dogs or dogs known to the children who are doing the killing, \" forrester tells the times. Surprisingly, neither dogs nor stinging insects were the deadliest group of animals in the study. That honor goes to pigs, cows, and horses. A category called \" other mammals, \" mostly comprised of farm animals, was responsible for 576 deaths — or 36 % of all animal-caused deaths between 2008 and 2015, science alert reports. \" preventing potentially fatal farm animal encounters should be a better promoted and supported public health initiative, \" forrester says. Overall, 72 % of animal victims were men, and most were between the ages of 35 and 64. Fatal animal attacks were most common in the southeast and least common in the northeast. Animal-caused fatalities haven't increased since the last study, but they haven't declined either. And that's concerning to researchers, who say these types of deaths should be preventable.

So say researchers who compared past surveys of nonviolent, low-level criminals to come up with the best guess on their illegal earnings. Such a figure isn't easy to reach since criminals aren't keen to report illegal profits. They also aren't particularly reliable or trustworthy, which means surveys are problematic. In the two surveys compared for this criminology study, however, respondents were asked to estimate earnings twice using different measures of time ( days, weeks, or months ), helping to weed out faulty or exaggerated answers. \" i was pretty surprised at how consistent the findings were across the two datasets, \" researcher holly nguyen of penn state university tells quartz. Both surveys were made up primarily of black and hispanic respondents, mostly males and around half of whom never finished high school. The first from 2010 involved 368 respondents convicted of a felony between the ages of 14 and 17, with average earnings of $ 1,470 a week through crimes like theft and selling drugs, per journalist's resource. The second from 1980 included 1,189 respondents with a history of employment problems, with average illegal earnings of $ 914 a week. The $ 900-per-week figure — more than double the average made legally by high school dropouts, per quartz — was reached after very high and very low amounts were omitted. Nguyen says she's \" cautiously optimistic \" that the figure will prove a \" reliable tool for future study. \"",

The program concentrated on women who had been receiving aid to families with dependent children ( afdc ) for many years, ex-addicts, ex-offenders, and young school dropouts, often with criminal records or histories of delinquency. The evaluation found that the program proved effective in enhancing the employability and earnings of long-term afdc recipients, particularly those with the least prior work experience, and in reducing their dependence on welfare payments. It also had an impact on a significant segment of the ex-addict population, who did better in getting jobs, earned more, and were less likely to commit crimes than those who were not in the program.

Using \" biological material found at the scene, \" per global news, the virginia-based company was able to figure out some of the mother's likely physical traits. Police have now released sketches of what she might look like at the ages of 18 and 25; her age is not known. See the sketches here, as well as a sketch of the baby. Police believe the mother is probably of mixed race, possibly with métis or indigenous ancestry, and that she has brown or black hair, hazel or green eyes, and a fair complexion. She is not being sought as a suspect — police say evidence at the scene leads police to think she was in medical distress at the time, and they are concerned about her welfare — but police say they have \" very difficult and challenging questions \" for her, metro news reports. Police believe the baby was born alive, but it's not clear whether she was dead when she was put in the dumpster; it's also not clear who put her there. ( this terrible sketch actually helped cops id a suspect. )",

            "Newport beach ( cbsla.com ) — police sought the public's help monday in identifying what appeared to be pranksters who entered a newport beach movie theater with a leaf-blower. Officers responded saturday shortly before 11 p.m. After several 911 emergency calls about a disturbance at the edwards big newport 6 movie theater complex in the 300 block of newport center drive, according to the newport beach police department. Witnesses told investigators between two to three male suspects had arranged to open the secured emergency exit door at the front of theater #3 during a screening of the psychological thriller \"the gift. \" one suspects entered the theater through the emergency door, holding \"some type of loud, handheld machine \" later determined to be a leaf-blower over his head, police said.

Per the source, the 68-year-old was on the premises to promote his new book, and his first few encounters, while simmons-esque, didn't cross the line: he leaped off the fox &amp; friends couch to help meteorologist janice dean talk about the weather, and he followed that up with an interview with maria bartiromo, which delved into the sexual misconduct allegations against harvey weinstein. \" men are jackasses. From the time we're young we have testosterone. I ' m not validating it or defending it, \" he said. However, he left that interview, the source says, and burst into a staff meeting, yelling, \" hey chicks, sue me! \" as he opened his shirt to show off his torso. The rest of the \" pretty severe \" behavior included rattling off michael jackson pedophilia jokes and hitting a couple of workers on the head with the tome he was promoting, \" making derisive comments about their comparative intelligence according to the sound their heads made when struck, \" as the beast puts it. A source also told buzzfeed that when simmons ran into a black employee, he asked the worker if he was african-american tv personality al roker. A complaint was subsequently filed with a supervisor, then made its way up to hr, prompting the simmons ban, which is said to be permanent.",

        "summary": "A new study has a message for twentysomethings: to land a better-paying job that you love when you're older, it's healthy to job-hop now. It seems that frequent job-switchers boost their odds of having higher-paying, more satisfying jobs in their 30s and 40s, the atlantic reports. While the cause isn't certain, a researcher has a theory: when people job-hop, they end up with \" better matches — their true calling. \" the findings shine a light on misconceptions about young people and unemployment, the atlantic notes. Yes, youngsters are more likely than older people to be unemployed, but it's not because they can't get hired; it's because they're more likely to quit. In fact, those in the 20-24 set were almost three times as likely to leave their job within a year as those ages 45 to 54. A 2012 study found that the average american has more than 11 jobs between the ages of 18 and 46, and they hold half of those positions before 25, yahoo finance reports. But frequent quitting doesn't appear to be a millennial thing: today's young people don't quit at a higher rate than young people did three or four decades ago. They are, however, more likely to switch job fields entirely when they do quit. That means more exploration, which, as the study suggests, could be helpful for the future. \" as the worker samples more occupations and accumulates knowledge about her occupational fit, the probability of finding her true calling rises, \" the researchers say, per fivethirtyeight.

Pennsylvania has 71 delegates, the most of any remaining state save california, but only 17 of them will have their first-round convention ballot choice determined by the primary vote. That leaves 54 delegates, three from each congressional district, to be selected by gop primary voters — but the delegates are free to vote for the candidate of their choosing at the convention, and the primary ballot won't indicate which candidate they're likely to support. By the times ' calculations, trump would probably win at least 40 pennsylvania delegates under another system, but the quirk could cost him just enough to fall short of the necessary 1,237 delegates at the convention. The pittsburgh tribune-review notes that in 1976, the pennsylvania loophole was a factor so important that ronald reagan named pennsylvania sen. Dick schweiker as his running mate long before the convention — only to lose the nomination when powerful delegation chief drew lewis had the entire delegation back ford. Nbc news reports that aides to ted cruz, who's around 20 points behind trump in pennsylvania polls, have been pushing a slate of cruz-loyal delegates and expect to get around 30 delegates from the state, even if he finishes third in the voting.

But less than a week later, the 28-year-old was mauled by a bear in montana, though her quick thinking helped her survive. The ap reports kornak was working solo near a stream in the cabinet mountains on may 17, collecting grizzly hair samples, when the bear attacked. Kornak was able to grab her bear spray and drive the animal off. Then, despite serious injuries — including two skull fractures and several slashes on her head, back, and neck — kornak trekked almost two miles to her vehicle and called for help. She was airlifted to a local medical facility and underwent four hours of surgery, which included drains in her skull to reduce brain swelling. She's since been taken out of the icu and is recuperating. Officials say the noise from the nearby water may have covered up the sound of the incoming bear. A fish and wildlife rep says kornak carried all the right gear for working in a bear-heavy environment, including her satellite communication device and the bear spray. As for kornak venturing out alone, the rep says there's no rule against it, but it's advisable for people to travel in groups of at least three to stay safer. A montana fish, wildlife &amp; parks statement says it's still not clear what kind of bear attacked kornak; the washington post notes less-aggressive black bears also roam the area. A gofundme for kornak has already raised more than $ 33,000 to help pay her bills while she's recuperating. \" anyone who knows amber knows that she is fierce, and will fight like hell to recover as quickly as possible, \" says the friend who set up the fundraiser.

You may think you know everything about thin mints and caramel delites. Well, here are a few facts that may enlighten you: 1. The first girl scout cookies were sold in muskogee, oklahoma, in 1917, when troops baked cookies and sold them in high schools as a service project. These pioneers had no idea what they had just unleashed on the united states. 2. The ingredients for a girl scout cookie were very simple in 1922: butter, sugar, eggs, milk, vanilla, flour, salt, and baking powder. That's a far cry from today's exotic mango crèmes with nutrifusion, which feature a food concentrate made with shitake mushrooms. ( anyone want to bet these won't make a return appearance in 2014? ) 3. In 1933, you could get a box of 44 cookies for just 23 cents. 4. Life was rough in the early 1940s; not only was there a world war raging, but there were also no girl scout cookies to be found. Due to shortages of sugar, butter, and flour, the scouts sold calendars instead. 5. Today, one-quarter of all",

When his relationship with eckler was discovered, he was kicked out of the nazi party and denied a marriage license under the harsh nuremberg laws. Still, he and eckler went on to have their first child, ingrid, in late 1935. Things escalated after the 1936 photo was taken: landmesser tried to leave germany for denmark in ' 37 but was detained at the border and arrested for \" rassenschande, \" or \" dishonoring the race, \" per business insider. He was acquitted but told to stop seeing eckler, which he refused to do. Both he and eckler were arrested in 1938; he was sent to a concentration camp, while eckler went to prison ( and gave birth to their second daughter, irene, there ) and then to a \" euthanasia center, \" where she died in 1942. Landmesser got out of prison in 1941 and was drafted for war in 1944, shortly after which he was declared mia, per the csm. As for the two girls: irene was separated from ingrid, whom she never saw again, and raised by foster parents. Her 1998 book a family torn apart by ' rassenschande'told her family's story. ( the \" last auschwitz trial on earth \" has left survivors disappointed. )",

But astronomers studying huge tombs in portugal believe ancient humans were making their own stargazing instruments 6,000 years ago, the atlantic reports. Researchers, who presented their findings wednesday at the national astronomy meeting in britain, believe the tombs themselves were a type of massive lensless telescope, according to live science. The guardian reports the long, narrow entrances to the tombs — which were the only source of light — would focus the eye on a single piece of sky, block out the sun's rays at dawn, and make the eye more sensitive to low light. \" this would allow enhanced observing, especially in the twilight hours of dusk and dawn, \" astronomer daniel brown tells live science. The tombs may \" have been the first astronomical tools to support the watching of the skies, millennia before telescopes were invented, \" the royal astronomical society says in a statement. Ancient humans admitted inside the tombs may have been seen as having \" secret knowledge or foresight \" due to being able to see the rise of seasonal stars days before those outside the tombs could see them. They might use that information to declare when it was time to move herds to new grazing areas, for example.

A cbo analysis released yesterday found that the average tax rate in 2009 dropped to 17.4 %. The previous average low since the data series began in 1979 was 2003's 19.4 %, the washington post reports. The only group whose tax rate went up in 2009 was the top 1 %, who saw a slight rise to 28.9 %, the wall street journal notes. The cbo gave two reasons for the drop: falling income levels caused by the recession and tax cuts introduced by obama to combat the recession. No prizes for guessing which parts of the analysis democrats and republicans chose to highlight. \" the facts speak for themselves: tax rates have never been lower than under president obama, \" said the senior democrat on the house ways and means committee. Under obama, \" americans have lost their jobs, seen their wages decline, and fallen into lower tax brackets, \" countered a rep for the committee's republican chair.",

He exercised regularly, got enough dairy, and had normal levels of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. Then doctors discovered the boy had celiac disease, according to a study published last month in bmj case reports. Previous studies have shown that up to 19 % of kids with celiac disease have low bone-mineral density. The new study is a reminder of the importance of testing kids with frequent bone fractures for the disease and finding it early, before too much damage is done to the bones. After the 7-year-old was diagnosed, doctors also found celiac disease in his older brother. A gluten-free diet can quickly bring bone mass up to normal levels in nearly all cases of celiac disease.

Olsen went to the cops instead, but while in jail awaiting trial, gillman allegedly approached an inmate in early 2017, called herself \" the bank, \" and asked if the inmate could have olsen killed ( those obstruction of justice charges against gillman were dismissed due to witness issues ). The third set of charges was announced friday, the same day she was found guilty in the case involving her ex. Gillman now is accused of approaching yet another inmate just a few weeks ago, allegedly trying once more to have olsen killed, as well as an attorney who'd won a civil action against her. The salt lake tribune lays out more details, including gillman's defense that she was an elderly woman taken advantage of by olsen, and that her ex had tried to poison her food and toothpaste, which apparently didn't sway the jury. Added to gillman's list of charges friday: two more counts of criminal solicitation and two more counts of obstruction of justice. Bail on the new charges has been set at $ 2.5 million; a sentencing hearing for gillman is set for april 23, with five years to life in prison on the table. \" i've never seen anything like it, \" salt lake city da sim gill says, per ksl.

In a debate focused on foreign policy, liberal democrat leader nick clegg came under fire from both david cameron and gordon brown for his plan to scrap britain's nuclear deterrent, reports the washington post. Brown and cameron clashed over immigration, the european union, and the military. Clegg sharply criticized the iraq war, while firmly denying accusations that he is anti-american. A third of viewers believed clegg won the debate while the labour and conservative leaders were tied on 29 % each, according to a guardian poll. The leaders will debate once more before britain votes on may 6.",

But clegg was less dominant thursday night in the western port city of bristol, as the longtime front-runner david cameron of the conservative party exuded a passion noticeably absent in the first debate. Snap polls showed clegg running away with last week's debate, but all three men scored close in the second round. Different polls each declared clegg and cameron the winner.

In a letter to united staff, seen by abc, munoz describes the incident in chicago sunday as \" upsetting, \" but says employees followed correct procedures in dealing with the \" disruptive and belligerent \" passenger, who refused to get off the plane when told he had been randomly selected to lose his seat. Munoz may have made his airline's pr nightmare even worse with his attempt to excuse the treatment seen in disturbing video of the incident, the los angeles times notes. In an earlier statement, munoz apologized only for \" having to re-accommodate these customers. \" in other developments: the officer who forcibly removed the 69-year-old passenger from the flight to louisville has been suspended pending an investigation, tmz reports. \" the actions of the aviation security officer are obviously not condoned by the department, \" the chicago department of aviation said.

Now, mitsutoki shigeta, 28, is about to gain custody of all 16 kids he is known to have fathered via thai surrogate mothers. The bbc explains shigeta grabbed headlines in 2014 when his bangkok apartment was raided, turning up a \" baby factory \" — nine babies, a pregnant surrogate, and 24-hour nannies — over fears of a human trafficking operation. The truth, argued his lawyer, was just that shigeta wanted plenty of kids and had the means to do so ( the ap reports he earns at least $ 3 million a year via stock holdings ); and so they sued for custody. A thai court on tuesday agreed with that premise, after hearing from thai officials who traveled abroad to verify he had sufficient resources to raise the 13 children in the country's custody. Shigeta secured custody of the three other kids in 2015, and media reports say it's possible he has fathered even more children in other locations. ( the afp suggests there are at least 19 kids. ) he reportedly bought land next to a tokyo park on which to raise them and has opened trust funds for them. \" for the happiness and opportunities which the 13 children will receive from their biological father, who does not have a history of bad behavior, the court rules that all 13 born from surrogacy to be legal children of the plaintiff, \" read a court statement. The bbc notes the thai surrogates gave up any rights to the children. The children, most around age 4, will not immediately enter his custody but will be transferred gradually out of foster care. Shigeta's case helped prompt a 2015 law that bars foreigners from paying for thai surrogates.",

        "summary": "Donald trump made what politico calls a \" puzzling pitch \" to black voters wednesday with a call to use the controversial \" stop and frisk \" tactic to reduce crime in cities across america. The practice involves officers stopping and questioning pedestrians before frisking them for drugs or weapons. \" we did it in new york, it worked incredibly well, \" trump told fox's sean hannity during a town hall event on black issues, though a federal judge found in 2013 that the nypd's use of the tactic was unconstitutional and was used to illegally target minorities. A roundup of coverage: the new york times reports that the tactic has caused tension between police and black residents of cities where it's used, and that black leaders slammed both trump's endorsement of stop-and-frisk and his apparent failure to realize that rolling out the tactic nationwide is beyond the president's constitutional powers. The guardian reports that trump also addressed friday's police shooting of unarmed black man terence crutcher in tulsa, okla., saying officer betty shelby might have \" choked. \" \" he was walking, his hands were high, he was walking to the car, he put the hands on the car — now maybe she choked, something really bad happened, \" trump said. People reports that trump was introduced at an event at a black church in cleveland by boxing promoter don king, who said the n-word while introducing him before correcting it to \" negro. \" hillary clinton is 6 points ahead of trump among likely voters, according to the latest nbc/wall street journal poll. The poll found that clinton has a 43 % to 37 % lead despite the fact that most voters view her negatively. Some 44 % of clinton voters said their main motivation was voting against trump — and 51 % of trump voters said they were mainly voting against clinton. The ap notes that according to a report from the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget released wednesday, trump's tax proposals would add a whopping $ 5.3 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade. Clinton's would add $ 200 billion.

It also won't charge more for larger sizes. The change means meijer will have to eat the extra cost of plus-size clothing, something the company says is worth it. \" it's a big deal for our customers, \" mlive.com quotes meijer executive annette repasch as saying. \" we are giving them trends of what they are looking for, regardless of size. \" sales of plus-size clothing are growing twice as fast as any other clothing segment.

The number is likely to rise as hunters have 12 hours to report their kills. Wiley said the max limit of 320 bears would likely be exceeded with another day of hunting, adding, \" we'd rather err on the conservative side. \" still, the number of dead bears did exceed limits in specific areas. Some 112 bears were killed in the eastern panhandle in the first day of hunting, though the limit was set at 40. Hunters in central florida felled 39 more bears than the area's limit of 100. \" the bears haven't been hunted in 21 years, so they're relatively naive, \" says the commission's bear expert. Wiley hailed the hunt as a success, but not everyone was pleased. Opponents warned that the loss of too many animals would be devastating to a population — estimated at 3,300 — that was only recently scratched off florida's imperiled-species list. A rep for the sierra club, which opposed the hunt, said the limitless hunting permits sold may have \" set back the recovery of the bears for years, if not decades. \" the public was generally against the hunt: about 75 % of the 40,000 responses received ahead of the commission's vote on the hunt this summer were against it. However, 3,779 hunters, including ted nugent, were eventually issued licenses, which earned the state $ 376,900, per the ap and orlando sentinel.

        "summary": "A former teacher and his twin face federal bomb-making charges after more than 32 pounds of explosives were found in their bronx apartment, alongside documents suggesting they planned to kill. Christian and tyler toro, 27, were arrested in a thursday raid in which police say they also found a diary referring to \" operation flash \" and an index card reading, \" under the full moon the small ones will know terror, \" per the new york times. It was the culmination of an investigation launched after a 15-year-old called in a bomb threat at democracy prep high school, where christian toro taught, on dec. 4, police say. After the student claimed it had been toro's idea, the teacher resigned jan. 9, turning in a laptop that held a downloaded book on bomb-making, though toro said it was from research on the boston marathon bombing and that he had only read the table of contents, per the daily beast. Authorities charged him with raping a minor on jan. 31, alleging he took a 15-year-old female student to his home to have sex on two occasions. As the investigation continued, police say they learned toro had paid at least two students to extract explosive powder from fireworks inside his apartment between october and january. Thursday's search of the apartment revealed simulated weapons, explosives, and bomb-making materials including metal balls possibly to be used as shrapnel, police say. \" if you're registered as a sex offender, things will be difficult. But i am here 100 %, living, buying weapons, whatever we need, \" read a portion of the diary containing tyler toro's name, according to the complaint. While the complaint doesn't reveal details of the alleged plot, mayor bill de blasio says the arrests of the two men \" likely saved many, many lives. \"",

            "On the day a florida gunman with an ar-15 murdered 17 at a broward county high school, new york cops and federal agents were interviewing a student at an upper manhattan high school who said a teacher had paid her and a classmate $ 50 an hour to empty black powder from fireworks. The horror in florida was all too familiar. A troubled teen had arrived at a school with an assault rifle and proceeded to shoot everybody he could. The case in new york was something new: a teacher allegedly enlisting students to help him and his twin brother amass the makings of a bomb, complete with deadly shrapnel. Yet both cases seem just variations on a dark nihilism that is at the core of all terrorism in its many forms. Foreign and domestic. Individual and group. Fiery or icy. Purportedly religious or political. Or just nakedly sociopathic. The florida gunman is said to have been a member of a white supremacist group, but when it came down to it he killed whoever he could. The bronx teacher and his twin do not seem to be bent on jihad, yet they were allegedly enlisting school kids in preparing a bomb such as was detonated in the name of allah at the boston marathon. We seem surrounded by evil at every turn. And the only real protection from it is a six-word",

        "summary": "Big changes are coming for the sat in two years, reports the washington post and wall street journal. Some of the major ones announced by the college board: essay optional: the mandatory essay introduced in 2005 will be eliminated. Among other things, critics say students couldn't knock out anything of worth within its 25-minute time limit. An optional essay will remain but with a different format. Scoring: the top score will once again be 1,600, instead of the 2,400-mark also established nine years ago. Obscure words: the college board promises to ditch \" flashcard \" vocabulary words and focus on those used in, well, the real world. The post browses an official study guide and picks out \"punctilious, \" \"phlegmatic, \" and \"occlusion \" as potential offenders. No penalties: students will no longer lose a quarter-point for incorrect multiple-choice answers. Computers: students will have the option of taking the test on a computer, reports ap. Math: the section will draw questions from fewer areas, ones deemed most relevant to college, such as algebra. Free help: the college board says it will offer free test-preparation help online, and it took particular aim at the huge tutoring industry that has sprung up around the sat. \"the college board cannot stand by while some test-prep providers intimidate parents at all levels of income into the belief that the only way they can secure their child's success is to pay for costly test preparation and coaching, \" says college board chief david coleman. \"if we believe that assessment must be a force for equity and excellence, it's time to shake things up. \" the test has come under fire for being biased toward richer students ( in part because of those test-prep tutors ) and not such a great predictor of college success.",
