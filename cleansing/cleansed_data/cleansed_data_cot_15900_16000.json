For the past 20 years the world-renowned physicist has relied on a computer to communicate with the world - controlling the machine using a muscle in his cheek. His limited movement meant everyday tasks were a painstaking process and even talking via his speech synthesiser took longer than one minute per word. Worse, hawking found he was becoming fatigued, that his cheek muscle could only control the computer for so long each day, limiting his ability to work and speak to his friends and family. Hawking needed a more efficient way"

Norwegian air international is launching $ 65 one-way flights on 10 routes between europe and the us this summer, using the smaller boeing 737 max. There are three points of departure stateside: bradley international, near hartford, conn.; tf green in providence, ri; and stewart international, which bloomberg notes is about 60 miles north of manhattan. The available destinations vary by airport, but include edinburgh, scotland; and belfast, cork, dublin, and shannon airport in ireland. Flights begin in june, and when it comes to what norwegian calls the \" cheapest transatlantic flights ever, \" reuters reports that the number of promotional $ 65 legs is \" extremely limited \"; they don't include basics like a meal or a seat reservation. The next fares begin at $ 99. Reuters took a look at expedia and found that a one-way ticket from new york to dublin on other airlines currently ranges from $ 655 to $ 2,755. Among the factors keeping norwegian's costs down: lower fees charged by the selected airports as compared to more sizable international departure points. But industry critics take issue with norwegian air international being the irish subsidiary of norwegian air shuttle asa; its us competitors have lobbed accusations that the company is trying to sidestep scandinavian labor and safety rules. At skift, brian sumers wonders if the demand from these smaller airports will be adequate, but points out the narrow-bodied, single-aisle 737 max is full once it has 189 passengers, a much lower threshold than norwegian's boeing 787-9s ' 344 seats.",

But the film's audience rating, currently 55 % after more than 124,000 user reviews, isn't nearly as impressive. It may not be that moviegoers don't like the flick, though. As quartz reports, a star wars fan who operates a facebook page critical of \" disney's treatment of franchises and its fanboys \" claims to have manipulated the audience rating by posting fake reviews. In a sunday post, the unnamed fan claims to have created bot facebook accounts that \" rigged this score and still keep it dropping. \" quartz notes that logging on to rotten tomatoes through facebook bypasses a security measure designed to distinguish bots from real users. \" look for the accounts there that have the last jedi as their only review, \" the individual says, per inverse. \" that is me. \" quartz surveyed some 20 pages of reviews and found \" dozens of 0.5 and 1 star reviews came from accounts created in december that have not reviewed any other titles. \" this was also noted by polygon, which discovered many reviews attacking the film's \" social justice warrior \" ideas, strong female characters, and non-white characters.

As for how the mint's guards missed the gold on his person: doody explained the handheld detectors they used to sweep lawrence's body weren't as sensitive as the detectors he initially walked through.

Outside picks up moro's version of events, as posted on his blog: as the sherpas were securing ropes leading to camp iii, the climbers stepped across their lines and, in the sherpas'telling, dislodged ice on them ( moro disagrees with this claim ). An argument broke out, and the sherpas retreated to camp ii; when the climbers, who stayed behind to finish fixing the ropes arrived; they say they were kicked, punched, and had rocks thrown at them. Moro writes: \" after about 50 minutes the crowd had calmed down and the climbers, who had been pushed away and told to hide, had regrouped and were told that if they weren't gone in one hour that they would all be killed. \" the three returned to base camp, and reuters reports that steck has since vowed to end his ascent unless their security was vouched for; a rep for nepal's tourism ministry said the government would indeed ensure their safety.

The fight may have broken out over an alleged breach of climbing etiquette.

The men's climbing team said the trio were then threatened and were forced to flee to base camp. Speaking from kathmandu, beni hyoju of the cho-oyu trekking company which helped organise the expedition, said: \"it happened on saturday morning. There was a fight involving the team and the sherpas located between camps two and three. \" sitaram karki, the chief district officer in solukhumbu, the region where everest stands, said the police were conducting an investigation but said",
            "A fight between a group of sherpas and the alpine team of simone moro, ueli steck, and jonathan griffith took place near camp iii and at camp ii on mount everest this weekend. Initial reports about the kicking, punching, rock-throwing skirmish have come from moro's web site and articles filed by european news outlets. A quick summary of moro's version of events: while the sherpas were fixing ropes up to camp iii, the alpine team stepped over their ropes. The sherpas said steck or griffith had kicked ice down on a member of their team. ( moro said in the report this was unlikely. ) a confrontation ensued between the alpine team and a lead sherpa, with the sherpas descending to camp ii as a sign of protest. Steck helped fix ropes to camp iii as a sign of goodwill after the sherpas left. When steck, moro,",

Simone and ueli will attempt to reach everest's summit on the 60th anniversary of its first ever ascent and on the 50th anniversary of the first american ascent, tackling a different route without using oxygen and climbing lightweight. They have decided to abandon the far too busy and equipped routes to continue everest's true exploration, even 60 years after its first ascent, going back to seeing everest as it was when the first great alpinists of the past had climbed it.

Miller — who woke up to find the house on fire and fled out the back after smoke and flames prevented him from reaching his stepson's bedroom at the front of the home — was taken to the city jail and released without being charged. The officers made a \" judgment call \" after miller \" kept trying to make entry without protective gear, \" the administrator tells the louisiana press-journal. \" they were worried he would succumb to the smoke and heat and we'd have another fatality. \" the fire is thought to have been caused by faulty electrical wiring.

The 5s is a nice incremental upgrade, but the world expects more out of apple. \" steve jobs'death wasn't an event of worldwide significance because he could craft better spec sheets. \" many investors were expecting a cheaper iphone that could compete in developing countries, and the 5c misses the mark. \" apple is now offering budget-conscious consumers around the world a strange deal, \" writes farhad manjoo at slate: \" ok, the iphone isn't any cheaper than it used to be.

He doesn't think the 5c was supposed to be a budget play, but an effort to diversify its line and give it leeway to break up its every-12-month release schedule. \" this would have been a great idea. Last year. \" rocco pendola at thestreet, meanwhile, thinks yesterday was a blackberry moment, too — for microsoft. \" the media buried the lead \" by focusing on the iphones, he argues. The real news was that apple will offer its iwork productivity suite for free. That move \" could crush microsoft office. \" twitter overall reacted with apathy, cnet reports.

But it did. We're in the early stages of a-like crash that, instead of taking a few years, could span decades. But it will happen.

            "Photo by justin sullivan/getty images for the last six years, apple has had a simple, increasingly risky plan for selling the iphone. Every year, the company makes only one new model, a phone that represents apple's platonic ideal — the one phone it thinks everybody ought to have. Apple usually sells the new phone for around $ 650, and wireless carriers sell it to customers for $ 199 with a two-year plan. To hedge its bets against low-priced competitors, apple also keeps selling its previous models, reducing the price of each by $ 100. Last year, when apple unveiled the iphone 5, it kept selling 2011's iphone 4s for $ 550 ( $ 99 with a contract ), and the 2010 iphone 4 sold for $ 450 ( free with a contract ). The advantage of this strategy is clear. Unlike its competitors, which make",

People details the story of ian manuel, who was just 13 when he was egged on to rob someone in tampa, fla., and confronted 28-year-old mom of two debbie baigrie. He shot her in the mouth, nearly killing her, and was arrested three days later and eventually sentenced to life in prison without parole for attempted murder and armed robbery. As baigrie went through an excruciating recovery, which included dozens of dental procedures to rebuild her shattered mouth, manuel thought about what he'd done — and right before christmas in 1991, he placed a collect call to baigrie to apologize. A curious baigrie accepted the call, per a 2014 new york times article, and finally asked, \" ian, why did you shoot me? \" \" it was a mistake, \" the teen, who the paper notes had a troubled childhood, replied. They started exchanging letters, and over time she became one of his biggest supporters, pushing him to get his ged and eventually lobbying for his early release — despite loved ones telling her she was nuts. \" she became a mother to me, \" manuel, now 40, tells people ( the times notes his own mom, dad, and brother have since died ). He was released from prison in november after a supreme court ruling that nixed life sentences for juveniles who hadn't committed murder, and per wtsp, baigrie was waiting outside to give him a hug.

Manuel fired the bullet when he was barely 13, and he fit all too neatly into racial stereotypes, especially that of the black predator who had to be locked away forever. One of the greatest racial disparities in america is in the justice system, and fear of young black criminals like manuel helped lead to mass incarceration policies that resulted in a sixfold increase in the number of americans in prison after 1970.

Those numbers, combined with a burgeoning number of research facilities and the infrastructure they require, are wreaking havoc on a vulnerable habitat. There are a couple of factors at work, among them the fact that humans are swarming to the ice-free areas that make up less than 1 % of antarctica. Those zones — of which only 1.5 % is protected by international treaty — contain the majority of the continent's native species, which are relatively few in number.

On the heels of the news that bacon is apparently a carcinogen and hot dogs contain human dna comes this: a new study finds that people who eat more grilled meat are at a higher risk of kidney cancer. And not just grilled red meat; even grilled chicken raises the risk, nbc news reports. The washington post notes that pan-frying was also implicated. University of texas researchers compared 659 patients recently diagnosed with kidney cancer to 699 similar but cancer-free people. \" kidney cancer is among the 10 most common cancers in both men and women, \" the american cancer society says in a statement. \" for reasons that are not totally clear, the rate of new kidney cancers has been rising since the 1990s, although this seems to have leveled off in the past few years. \" though the acs says that's probably partially due to the use of newer imaging tests that pick up on more cases of cancer, the study's researchers also wondered if an increase in eating meat could be partially to blame. \" the american/western dietary pattern consists largely of red and processed meats, and the results of the current study suggest that the association between this dietary pattern and cancer may be in part explained by exposure to meat cooking mutagens, \" they write. They found that people with two genetic mutations were at even higher risk from grilled meat, and a cancer expert notes that more study is needed: \" once we have identified more genes we will likely be able to identify a subset of the population that is at particularly high risk to develop kidney cancer if they eat meat and processed meat. \" reuters has a suggestion for everyone: when cooking meat over an open flame or at a high temperature, avoid charring it.

At slate, the show's guest host last week, mike pesca, explains that he thinks most npr listeners liked the interview, but that the vocal minority is off base. \" there is a type of npr listener — and it's a type of media consumer, it goes way beyond npr — that defines themselves by what they are not, \" he says. They tend to be \" closed-minded, they use affiliation with npr or fox or christian broadcasting not to experience a larger outside world but to congratulate themselves on the purity of their own world. \" years ago, when npr was shifting away from classic music, a researcher dubbed the type of listener who objected to the change as \" the monk, \" someone who listens solely for that \" interior serenity, \" says pesca.

There are a few amazing things about this: 1 ) it's only the second time ever that an asteroid has been spotted before impact, and 2 ) the previous one was spotted by the same guy. Astronomer rich kowalski is part of the catalina sky survey at the university of arizona, a group \" that has found more than half the near-earth asteroids known to mankind, \" the head of the lab tells the arizona daily star. The asteroid, called 2014 aa, almost definitely broke apart in the atmosphere about a day later, reports new scientist, its pieces falling harmlessly into the atlantic ocean off the coast of africa. Kowalski's prior spotting, the similarly-sized 2008 tc3, had a similarly harmless impact over sudan, where pieces of it have since been found. There's a reason these rocks aren't spotted often — this one was 150,000 times less bright than the faintest star you can see with your naked eye, according to phil plait at slate. But it also points to how important it is to look, lest the next rock be more threatening. \" it's yet another reminder that near-earth space is a busy place, \" the sky survey's director said. ( to wit, there's a small chance a big asteroid could hit in 2032. )",

Don't fret: it isn't about to erupt at any minute, but four separate clusters of smaller earthquakes have been reported under mauna loa over the last 16 months, including as recently as april and may of this year, reports livescience. Geologists from the hawaii volcano observatory note that similar events preceded the volcano's last eruption in 1984 — though these latest quakes are smaller in comparison — which may indicate magma is on the move. As wired explains further, the depth and location of the quakes suggests that magma is \" refilling the reservoir that feeds mauna loa. \" prior to the 1984 blast, scientists also observed ground deformation at the volcano's surface, as well as changes in gases streaming from cracks, and nothing like that has been seen in the last year or so. Still, the us geological society posted a photo on instragram this week with the phrase, \" a stirring giant? \" notes earthsky.org. You can track updates from the usgs on mauna loa here.

The us department of agriculture is set to give the go-ahead today, allowing schools to use ground beef containing the so-called pink slime, reports abc news. \" that's what upset me. This idea that children are passively sitting in a lunch room eating what the government sees fit to feed them and mcdonald's has chosen not to use it, but the government is still feeding it to them, \" said a houston-based food blogger who has gotten 220,000 signatures on a petition asking the department of agriculture to ban pink slime in school food, according to the ap. \"it kind of looks like play dough, \" says a former beef industry quality assurance manager who now speaks out against the product. \"it's pink and frozen, it's not what the typical person would consider meat. \" us regulators do not require pink slime to be labeled, but it is estimated to be in 70 % of ground beef sold in america, and can account for up to 15 % of a serving. The company behind the trimmings, beef products inc., is fighting back, saying \" boneless lean beef trimmings are 100 % usda inspected beef. \" it's also launching the website pink slime is a myth.",

        "summary": "Marijuana may have no effect on a teen's iq, but a new study suggests cognitive problems will appear in time with daily use. Researchers out of switzerland's university of lausanne studied the marijuana habits of 3,400 participants beginning as young adults via data compiled over 25 years. About 84 % of participants reported past marijuana use and 11 % continued to smoke into middle age, per medical daily. To study usage on the same scale, they tallied a person's marijuana-years of exposure — a figure referring to every 365 days a person smoked weed, whether spread across a single year or seven. While scientists found no link between exposure and brain function or processing speed, they did find verbal memory slackened slightly after the equivalent of five years of daily marijuana use. Essentially, someone who smoked marijuana every day for five years could recall 8.5 out of 15 words they were told to memorize 25 minutes earlier, compared to nine words for non-users, per the washington post. But each year of exposure added more damage. Researchers estimate a person who smoked pot daily for 25 years would remember 2.5 fewer words than their non-smoking counterparts. None of the study participants actually claimed 25 years of pot use — just 8 % managed five years — but marijuana use is on the rise. Researchers can't confirm if marijuana causes memory problems — people with lower cognitive abilities may simply be more inclined to use marijuana — but it's possible thc affects how the hippocampus processes information, reports live science.

It was just right for the 96-year-old and her adopted daughter, 30. Dyck's son, rick, first met chenda kaub chumb during a visit to cambodia in 2003 and casually suggested she should attend school in the us. A visit to the fresno city college's website soon \" began a process which changed all of our lives, \" he tells the fresno bee. He agreed to finance chenda's education from his home in tokyo and his parents agreed to host her. Over the next decade, she \" grew to love and appreciate both of my parents, \" says dyck's son, skip, who lives in michigan. \" we fell in love with her, \" adds bernice. But with every visit home came the possibility that chenda's visa would be denied. Adoption eventually came to mind. Chenda officially joined the family in september — with the approval of her birth mom — making bernice the world's oldest adoptive parent, per guinness world records. \" i have always been grateful for her presence, since i am so far away, \" says skip. \" i have called her'sis'regularly. I guess this sort of makes it legal now. \" chenda and bernice, now a widow, refer to their situation as the \" immaculate conception. \" but \" the full life she helps me live, as my child, is the miracle, \" bernice says. \" i was scared that i would be all alone, that i would have to give up my home. \" now, \" we travel when she isn't studying to complete a master's degree at fresno state. \" chenda, meanwhile, says she has \" finally experienced true love. \" the dyck family \" brought out the best in me, and knew there was and is good in me.

Later, she said, it had been a good day: the electricity didn't play hooky ( which meant the three ceiling fans worked all day ) and so it wasn't oppressively hot, she had fish curry for lunch, and the floor manager didn't yell at her for humming too loudly. She did that from 9 a.m. To 9 p.m., except for an hourlong lunch break. She had a pair of cutters in her hands, much like eyebrow tweezers, and she was trimming threads from a navy collar. She cleared one collar after another of threads until the big pile, which had been bigger than her, was no more. It took her all morning and she didn't look up much, did not join any conversation. When it was done, she took a few gulps of water from a scrunched bottle, walked around for a bit, her little hands rubbing her back, and went back to trimming threads — this time, from navy cuffs.

Researchers for a study published in jama surgery pored over a database that included cancer cases from 1975 to 2010 to draw out colorectal cancer rates among different age groups, reuters reports. The incidence in all age groups fell 1 %, but it rose among those aged 20-49. Scientists aren't sure why younger folks are experiencing these increases, though speculation includes not eating right or exercising, while the incidence of more advanced cancers in younger people may simply be because younger people and their doctors might not suspect colorectal cancer until it's progressed significantly. If the underlying causes aren't addressed, researchers posit ominous stats: using a computer model, they predict that by 2030, the number of colon and rectal cancer cases will roughly double among people between 20 and 34 and grow 28 % to 46 % for people 35 to 49. As it stands now, there will be an estimated 136,830 new colorectal cases overall by year's end, with about 50,000 deaths, the national cancer institute notes. While an american cancer society report indicates more screening may help, a gastroenterology doctor tells reuters, \" we don't want to send the message that people in their 30s should be running out and getting a colonoscopy. \" an editorial on the new study suggests being mindful of symptoms — bloody stools, unexplained weight loss, bowel movement changes — and eating better.

Since the 70-year-old from downers grove, ill., began traveling in the 1960s, he's been to many geographic subregions of all 193 countries currently recognized by the united nations and is about to tick off all 321 territories listed by the travelers ' century club. ( the 193rd country he made it to was mongolia — four years ago. ) but all 874 places listed by a man named charles veley on mosttraveledpeople.com? \" no one will ever finish that list, \" parrish tells the daily herald. \" it's just too difficult. \" he attributes his wanderlust to his five ancestors who boarded the mayflower in 1620 in search of a new world and life, a tradition he's carrying on. Parrish started off locally, hitting all 50 us states before expanding his focus abroad, reports the bbc. The no. 1-ranked traveler on the mtp site even risked being kidnapped in somalia, although he did hire four guards carrying ak-47s to get around. Traveling to the most remote places six months a year, often alone, can take its toll — \" you have to be willing to suffer; if you value your own convenience, forget it \" — but he adds that on the road, \" you start picking up pieces of big themes and you start understanding it in a lot more depth. \" his current focus is on un world heritage sites, and when things calm down he hopes to visit the gaza strip and guantanamo bay. As for his favorite place in the world? he may answer in several languages, but it's always the same: the us. ( speaking of travel, here's why the trip home feels shorter. )",

The canadian government sold off 21,851 ounces of gold in february, leaving it with just 77 ounces at most, reports bloomberg. Those 77 ounces are worth about $ 100,000, but the official value of canada's gold reserves is $ 0 because asset valuations are rounded to the nearest $ 1 million. That goose egg is actually a good thing in the government's perspective. Canada hoarded some 1,000 metric tons of gold in the 1960s but has been slowly selling it and stashing other countries ' currencies instead. Canada holds $ 48.6 billion in us dollars and $ 22.5 billion in other currencies, reports the globe and mail. \" the government has a long-standing policy of diversifying its portfolio by selling physical commodities ( such as gold ) and instead investing in financial assets that are easily tradable and that have deep markets of buyers and sellers, \" a finance department rep tells the cbc. A former finance official adds that holding onto gold isn't economical because it hasn't had a good rate of return over the years and is costly to store. Clearly not everyone agrees: russia, india, and china, are shoring up their reserves. Still, one professor suggests the only reason the us federal reserve isn't selling its gold is because \" it knows it would get attacked in congress. \" indeed, ted cruz is a big fan and has suggested the us return to the gold standard, notes the globe and mail.

Unnamed by the post, these aides see kim jong un's promise to stop tests and close a nuclear facility as important for what it's missing — a promise to move toward nuclear disarmament. Kim's fairly modest pledges, they say, could make it harder for washington to dismiss the north's demand that harsh economic sanctions enacted by trump be removed. Not to mention that trump has already praised pyongyang for its concessions, tweeting friday that \" this is very good news for north korea and the world — big progress! \" aides tell the new york times that trump is captivated by the chance to make history, but diplomatic challenges await. He has to navigate regional tensions, with south korea eagerly seeking to reduce war tensions with the north and japan pressing for full north korean denuclearization, the japan times reports. Trump has said he wants that too, sparking fears that anything less could be perceived as failure — yet putting a mere cap on kim's nuclear power could legitimize his current arsenal. \" the gap between reality and what we're planning for is problematic, \" says analyst toby dalton, who wrote a pro-cap essay, \" as it creates expectations that can't be met in the summit process, and we're back to where we were. \"",

Kim believes it would be suicidal to give up his \"existential \" deterrent, so complete denuclearization is simply not on the table today. Even if it was negotiable in the near-term, cvid is based on an",
            "North korean leader kim jong un's sudden announcement saturday that his country had suspended nuclear and longer-range missile tests and shut down its main atomic test site to focus on its sanctions-hit economy may have caught the u.s. And japan off guard, but experts say it is unlikely to deepen any rifts between the allies ahead of a landmark summit between u.s. President donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un. As the white house gears up for the first-ever meeting between a sitting american president and a north korean supreme leader, tokyo had been pushing its top ally to recognize its concerns and present them at the summit, slated for late may or june, for talks on the north's missile and nuclear weapons programs. Prime minister shinzo abe had been especially worried that, despite his \"bromance \" with trump, the mercurial u.s. Leader might seal a deal that effectively leaves japan in"

Some of the latest developments and coverage: the washington post takes a look at the six people who will be most instrumental in the looming debate: president obama, who's being cautious so far; michael bloomberg, who is pushing for revamped laws and has the money to perhaps even compete with the nra's influence; dianne feinstein, who's planning to introduce an assault weapons ban in the senate; carolyn mccarthy, a congresswoman whose husband was killed and son injured in a 1993 train shooting; orrin hatch, one republican who may actually be open to gun control; and harry reid and other senate democrats facing re-election in pro-gun states. Senate democrats appear to be gearing up for a gun control fight. Even joe manchin iii, the democratic west virginia senator known for his pro-gun-rights stance, is changing his tune a bit, the new york times reports. \" i don't know anybody in the sporting or hunting arena that goes out with an assault rifle, \" he said this morning on msnbc. \" i don't know anybody who needs 30 rounds in a clip to go hunting. I mean, these are things that need to be talked about. \" one issue in the gun control debate could hit the supreme court soon: whether people have the right to bear arms in public. An appeals court recently struck down the last state ban on concealed weapons, but that ruling is \" somewhat at odds \" with other federal court rulings upholding state gun laws, the ap reports. Competing rulings could lead to a high court case, experts say. For more, see today's opinion columns on the gun control debate.",

Since 2013 the silicon valley startup has been producing its nutrient-dense, just-add-water powder — \" a jock protein shake but for nerds, \" reports bloomberg — and suddenly, something didn't seem right. Soylent voluntarily stopped making powder 1.6 and recalled the bars, and wrote last week on its blog that it was investigating which of its ingredients wasn't sitting well with the less than 0.1 % of its consumers complaining. Now, the company is blaming algae. Soylent notes that complaints were not reported with its so-called 1.5 formulation; a key ingredient added to the 1.6 formulation and the bars is algal flour, and soylent suspects that's the culprit. Terravia, the company that makes the flour, begs to differ, arguing that it is very safe and has caused few issues though it's been an ingredient in 20 million servings of various products. It points a finger at other soylent ingredients, like soy protein isolate and glycerin. That said, colorado energy bar maker honey stinger has also recalled a product that contains terravia's algal flour due to similar complaints. Terravia says the companies didn't use an identical ingredient. \" our best guess has been confirmed, \" reports gizmodo, which suggested that algae is the problem earlier.

O ' connor, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, said she had felt alone since losing custody of her 13-year-old son and revealed she is suffering from three mental illnesses but has been left isolated.

        "summary": "Wisconsin gov. Scott walker's victory in a fierce recall battle is a costly blow to labor that will likely have major repercussions across the nation, notes the wall street journal. Inspired by walker's ability to withstand a challenge to his labor changes cutting collective bargaining rights for most public workers, other legislators may now be emboldened to press for anti-union measures such as \" right to work \" laws, further decreasing the number of dues-paying union members and diluting labor's political clout. And what's bad for labor is generally regarded as bad for democrats. Public sector union pacs have donated $ 4.7 million to congressional candidates so far this year, with about 90 % of that going to democrats, according to the center for responsive politics. Republicans control legislatures and governorships in 24 states, and that's where further changes in worker rights will most likely occur, notes the journal. But the wisconsin vote didn't necessarily reveal crystal clear support for walker's anti-union policies — or republicans. Exit polls revealed that 18 % of walker supporters favored president obama, reports the new york times, and a majority of voters said they believe recalls are only appropriate for incumbents accused of misconduct, not simply because their policies are unpopular.",

Scott walker, whose decision to cut collective bargaining rights for most public workers set off a firestorm in a state usually known for its political civility, easily held on to his job on tuesday, becoming the first governor in the country to survive a recall election and dealing a painful blow to democrats and labor unions. With 53 percent of the vote, mr. Walker soundly defeated mayor tom barrett of milwaukee, the democrats ' nominee in the recall attempt, who had 46 percent, with most precincts across the state reporting results. The victory by mr. Walker, a republican who was forced into an election to save his job less than two years into his first term, ensures that republicans largely retain control of this state's capital, and his fast-rising political profile is likely to soar still higher among conservatives. Here in waukesha, some republican voters said the result ended the most volatile partisan fight in memory, one that boiled over 16 months ago in the collective bargaining battle and expanded into scuffles about spending, jobs, taxes, the role and size of government, and more. Democrats, some of whom are already pledging to mount strong challenges for state lawmakers'seats in november, seemed less sure about the meaning of mr. Walker's victory. \"tonight, we tell wisconsin, we tell our country and we tell people all across the globe that voters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions, \" mr. Walker said, delivering a victory speech to supporters here. \"but now it is time to move on and move forward in wisconsin. \" in his concession speech in milwaukee, mr. Barrett said: \"we are a state that has been deeply divided. It is up to all of us — our side and their side — to listen, to listen to each other. \" the result raised broader questions about the strength of labor groups, who had called hundreds of thousands of voters and knocked on thousands of doors.

        "summary": "President obama landed in saudi arabia on wednesday morning at a time when relations between the two countries are especially dicey. Here's a look: usa today digs into five big issues, most notably a bill in congress that would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue the saudis. Friction over how to deal with iran is also a problem. Tensions have gotten worse in recent years \" under the more assertive king salman and his ambitious son. \" the guardian explains. Another \" delicate \" issue: before he left, obama supported the idea of releasing 28 confidential pages from the 9/11 commission suggesting that saudi officials in the us had some role in the attack, reports the new york times. The washington post takes a deeper dive into the long-simmering allegations that the saudis were involved. Despite the tensions, \" there is little chance the president's sojourn in riyadh will bring any significant changes to america's long-term alliance with saudi arabia, \" according to an analysis at time. From a more international perspective, al jazeera notes that the wars in syria and yemen will be high on the agenda of a defense summit thursday. The intercept has a critical analysis: \" obama is making his fourth trip to riyadh, having presided over record-breaking us arms sales to saudi arabia while offering only muted criticism of the kingdom's human rights violations. \" along those lines, the washington post editorial board wants obama to speak up for imprisoned blogger raif badawi.",

        "summary": "A woman who was born without the ability to feel pain was hurt for the first time in 39 years when researchers burned her with a laser, new scientist reports. \" i think she quite enjoyed the experiment, \" researcher john wood says. But that's not just good news for one budding masochist, it could also offer hope for people living in chronic pain. A small number of people are born without the ability to feel pain because their body lacks something called nav1.7 channels. While researching mice genetically engineered to lack those channels, scientists discovered their bodies produced more painkilling opioid peptides. Wood figured a drug like naloxone — used in heroin and morphine overdoses — that blocks opioid peptides could reverse the condition. It worked, and he published the results friday in nature communications. The woman hopes the breakthrough could be used to treat her children if they're born with the same condition, new scientist reports. Babies born unable to feel pain will chew their fingers and toes until they bleed. Of wider interest, researchers reversed the process to create a possible new way to treat chronic pain, according to upi. They were able to replicate the woman's condition in mice using a combination of nav1.7 blockers and opioids and hope to start human trials in 2017. One expert points out this potential treatment may not be ideal, as patients would have to take highly addictive opioids for their lifetime, new scientist reports. But researchers hope opioids below the level thought to be addictive, when combined with the channel blockers, will be enough, according to upi. ( centipede venom was found to treat pain better than morphine. )",

            "London, dec. 4 ( upi ) -- using mice genetically altered to lack a nerve channel that enables people and animals to feel pain, researchers developed a two-drug method of treatment they think will help people who have chronic pain. Nerve cells use various channels to communicate with the nervous system, including to signal pain. Previous research showed the sodium channel nav1.7 is important specifically for signaling pain, and people born with a non-functioning nav1.7 do not feel pain. Broad-spectrum channel blockers are not good for long-term use because of complete numbness and side effects that develop over long periods of use, and opioids are highly addictive and cause side effects, which has led researchers to search for a way to artificially recreate the rare condition of living pain-free. The researchers believed people with the mutation have higher than normal levels of natural opioids, which they confirmed in both mice and people, which combines with the lack of a functioning nav1.7 to prevent pain -- leading to the combination treatment researchers plan to patent and develop. \" after a decade of rather disappointing drug trials, we now have confirmation that nav1.7 really is a key element in human pain, \" said john wood, a professor at university college london, in a press release. \" the secret ingredient turned out to be good old-fashioned opioid peptides, and we have now filed a"

            "Many proteins have several, quite distinct functions. For example, some chromatin proteins such as high-mobility group box 1 protein are also extracellular signalling molecules14, whereas the β4-subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels has been shown to have a role as a transcription factor15. We wondered whether na v 1.7 had an additional role to that of propagating action potentials. We therefore analysed the patterns of gene expression in the sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia ( drg ) from na v 1.7, na v 1.8 and na v 1.9 knockout ( ko ) mice16, 17, 18. Whole dorsal root ganglia were included in the analysis, but as the sodium channels are neuronal proteins, alterations in gene expression can be ascribed to changes in the sensory neuron transcriptome. The three channels are all expressed at high levels in peripheral damage-sensing neurons and have been linked to human loss- or gain-of-function pain conditions2, 3. Na v 1.9 seems to play a role in setting thresholds of activation, whereas na v 1.7, which is expressed in most drg neurons, transmits action potentials that are generated by noxious stimuli that depolarize the neurons18. Na v 1.8, which is specifically expressed in the same subset of sensory neurons that express na v 1.9, is responsible for much of the nociceptive electrical input into the central nervous system and is activated at more negative potentials than na v",

        "summary": "Pope francis didn't chew coca leaves on his visit to la paz after all, but he would still probably flunk a drug test: to ward off altitude sickness, francis drank coca leaf tea on his flight to bolivia from ecuador yesterday, reuters reports. The tea, which also contained chamomile flower and anise seeds, is made from the main ingredient in cocaine, but its use is no more controversial in bolivia than coffee, and the mild stimulant effect is about the same, according to the catholic news agency, which notes that pope john paul ii drank coca leaf tea during his 1988 visit to bolivia, and pope paul vi did the same in 1968. Francis — who lost part of one lung to disease as a young man — only spent a few hours in la paz because of the high altitude, but he did not appear to suffer from it, reuters notes. The ap reports that president evo morales gave him a politically charged gift: a crucifix carved into a hammer and sickle, identical to that worn by a left-wing jesuit priest killed by bolivia's military dictatorship in 1980. \" remember one of our brothers, a victim of interests that didn't want him to fight for bolivia's freedom, \" francis said in a speech at the site where the rev. Luis espinal's body was dumped. \" father espinal preached the gospel, the gospel that bothered them, and because of this they got rid of him. \"",

        "summary": "It's not your imagination — more people are having twins these days. A recent study found that the rate of twin births in many developed countries has nearly doubled ( or more than doubled, in some cases ) in the past few decades, the atlantic reports. The study, published in population and development review, looked at data on twin births per 1,000 deliveries between 1975 and 2011. During that period, twin births increased from 9.5 to 16.9 in the us, 9.9 to 16.1 in england and wales, 9.2 to 17.2 in germany, 9.3 to 17.4 in france, 9.6 to 21.2 in denmark, and 5.0 to 14.6 in south korea. As the atlantic notes, these rates apply to fraternal twins, when two eggs are released and fertilized by two different sperm. The rate of identical twin births has remained consistent. The study pinpoints two primary reasons for what the atlantic terms the \" twincrease \" in wealthy countries. First, women in developed countries are more likely to have children later in life, and older mothers are more likely to have fraternal twins than younger ones. ( in england and wales, women between the ages of 35 and 39 were the most likely to have twins, the independent reports. ) second, fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization, increase the chances of a woman becoming pregnant with more than one baby. However, cases of fraternal twins ( which peaked between 1998 and 2010 in about 25 % of the countries studied ) linked to fertility treatments may be declining as doctors become more precise in how treatments are applied ( such as transferring a single embryo at a time, rather than several ). Nonetheless, the increase in twin births is a public health issue, according to the study's authors. Risks include a higher risk of premature birth, stillbirth, and infant mortality; lower birth weights and more complications at birth; and a higher risk of gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and postpartum depression in mothers.",

The rate of identical twins, who develop from one zygote that splits and forms two embryos, tends to stay relatively constant around the world, and doesn't seem to be affected by any external factors. But the likelihood of having fraternal twins, or dizygotic twins, changes depending on the age of the mother, how many children she's already had, the country she lives in, and genetic factors. In 1975, there were 9.5 twin births per 1,000 deliveries in the united states. In 2011, there were 16.9 twins per 1,000 births. The increase over that time was similar in england and wales ( from 9.9 to 16.1 ), france ( 9.3 to 17.4 ), and germany ( 9.2 to 17.2 ), and a little steeper in denmark ( 9.6 to 21.2 ) and south korea ( 5 to 14.6 ).

Modern parents, she realizes, may be creating unhappy adults by caring so much about their children's happiness that they insulate them from discomfort and criticism, leaving them unable to handle the setbacks of adult life. Much like the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens, \" kids also need exposure to discomfort, failure, and struggle, \" a child psychologist tells gottlieb. \" i know parents who call up the school to complain if their kid doesn't get to be in the school play or make the cut for the baseball team. \" parents may be mistaking their own emotional needs for their children's, creating a generation of narcissists as a result, gottlieb writes. \" by trying so hard to provide the perfectly happy childhood, we're just making it harder for our kids to actually grow up, \" she writes. \" maybe we parents are the ones who have some growing up to do — and some letting go. \" click to read gottlieb's entire piece.",

Wate reports his alleged intention was either to cross the border via land or to do a test-run in a small boat departing san diego. In carrying out his \" audacious scheme, \" the 50-year-old cummins switched vehicle license plates twice, disabled his vehicle's gps system, used aliases, altered his appearance, paid only in cash and used back roads during his nearly six weeks on the run with elizabeth thomas, according to the documents. The document alleges cummins \" made a number of damaging admissions to law enforcement that provide alarming insight inside his mentality. \" cummins acknowledged in federal court in sacramento on monday that he is the suspect in the case and agreed to return to tennessee to face charges there. Us magistrate judge kendall newman ordered him held as both a flight risk and a danger to the public. He offered minimal responses as he was advised of his rights and the charges that could send him to prison for 10 years to life. Cummins is charged with taking a minor across state lines to have sex and also faces state charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. Assistant federal defender ben galloway argued the girl went willingly and that cummings had no criminal history. \" this was not an abduction or kidnapping as has been suggested, \" he added in an emailed statement, per the ap. ( his sister says cummins explained his reasoning to her. )",

Selling fetal parts for a profit is illegal. However, the senior director of medical services tells pro-life activists from the center for medical progress — who were impersonating biotechnology reps — that planned parenthood clinics may charge $ 30 to $ 100 for a fetal sample to make up for the costs of processing and transporting. \" this video is abhorrent and rips at the heart, \" republicans on the house energy and commerce committee say, per the washington post, adding they will \" get to the bottom of this appalling situation. \" the investigation will focus on claims that the organization \" altered abortion procedures in order to harvest the organs and body parts of aborted children for money, \" per msnbc. The republican governors of texas and louisiana have also ordered state investigations. \" when an organization monetizes an unborn child — and with the cavalier attitude portrayed in this horrific video — we must all act, \" says john boehner. A planned parenthood rep says republicans ' claims are \" flat out untrue, but that doesn't matter to politicians with a longstanding political agenda to ban abortion and defund planned parenthood. \" the director of medical ethics at nyu tells the new york times the most concerning part of the video is the mention of manipulating a fetus to save particular organs for researchers or middlemen, who can sell two million fetal liver cells sells for $ 2,240. \" you cannot, must not, alter how or when you do an abortion simply to obtain tissues you want, \" he says.

His father likened the 17-year-old's face to that of the \" elephant man. \" turns out blake had contracted herpes gladiatorum, or \" mat herpes, \" a highly contagious, lifelong virus that wrestlers have come down with before, either from skin-to-skin contact or from the mat itself, per the san jose mercury news. Now blake has come forward to try to stop this weekend's california state championships. Health protocols were apparently not strictly carried out at the tournament where blake believes he contracted the virus: female wrestlers received only \" cursory \" skin checks and the on-site boys bathroom is said to be notoriously unsanitary. But the california interscholastic federation says it's not postponing the championship, noting everything's soundly in place to stop anyone else from getting the virus. \" we are confident that our practices, along with an exhaustive medical review of this particular situation, ensure that there is no justification for concern, \" the director for the group says, per the news. Despite not being able to stop the championship from proceeding, blake says the one good thing that's come out of all of this is the response he's received since making his news public. \" i've gotten a lot of supportive comments — 100 %, \" blake says, with his dad adding, \" he said to me,'dad, it's unbelievable. I haven't gotten one negative response. ' \" ( you may not wrestle, but you probably have some form of herpes, too. )",

Not only does matt drudge score some \" three-quarters of a billion page views \" each month, as the daily beast notes; he's also a key driver of the political conversation. For one thing, politicians can head to the drudge report to find out what their opponents are digging up on them: drudge is \" more likely to simply take ( material ) and post it rather than looking for where the holes are — as a more mainstream site would do, \" cillizza notes. Those reading the site include political power players: \" reporters, cable tv bookers, and other campaigns. \" and drudge sticks to one or two storylines for \" weeks or months. \" right now, he's into scott walker, and if that continues, it will boost walker's national profile among party leaders. When it comes to the democrats, drudge has long had a fascination with the clintons, publishing key stories on bill's affair in the 1990s and running somewhat positive articles about hillary around the end of the last decade. But recently, he's gone negative, and he could put the national spotlight on stories that don't look good for her. \" all of the republican campaigns ( and maybe even the clinton campaign ) will fear him — and have a strategy on how to deal with him.

As of 3: 15 p.m. Eastern time monday, wisconsin gov. Scott walker was dominating with 47 percent ( more than 84,000 votes ) followed by sen. Ted cruz ( tex. ) at 14 percent and sen. Rand paul ( ky. ) at 13 percent. Former florida governor jeb bush, who has been anointed by the party establishment as the front-runner in the race, takes 5 percent. Who cares, you might ask? a totally non-scientific poll — you can vote as many times as you want! — on a conservative link site. Blah. It's so 1990s.

Such tallying is not merely academic; it is precisely the kind of reading of the entrails that republican political operatives are enduring as the presidential campaign season gets under way. Because just as there are the real primaries in iowa and new hampshire, whose voting is nearly a year away but whose voters candidates are already courting, and just as there is the so-called money primary, which involves the seeking out of the money people who can bankroll such a venture, there is the \"the drudge primary \" — the battle to curry favor with the internet's most notorious aggregator.
