        "summary": "The former student accused of killing 17 people in america's worst school shooting since sandy hook had been flagged as a threat at marjory stoneman douglas high school after he was expelled, a teacher says. Fellow students at the school in parkland, fla., say nikolas cruz, 19, was obsessed with weapons and had displayed increasingly strange behavior. Parent john crescitelli tells the miami herald his son had warned him about cruz. He says his son told him: \" if you were to pick one person you might predict in the future would shoot up a school or do this, it would be this kid. \" student victoria olvera, 17, says cruz was expelled last year for fighting his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, the ap reports. Another classmate says he was caught with bullets in his backpack. He apparently attended another school in broward county after the expulsion. Teacher jim gard says an email was sent last year warning staff about cruz, who had allegedly threatened students and been banned from returning to campus carrying a backpack, though broward county public schools superintendent robert runcie told reporters that cruz hadn't been considered a threat, the guardian reports. \" you see in these situations that there potentially could have been signs out there, \" he said. \" but we didn't have any warnings, there weren't any phone calls or threats that we know of that were made. \" cruz, who was reportedly armed with an ar-15 rifle, was arrested after the attack. Broward county sheriff scott israel says investigators have looked at the teen's social media posts and found \" very, very disturbing material. \" at least 15 injured victims were hospitalized after the attack, five of them in life-threatening condition.",

In 2017, the market for security equipment in the education sector was estimated at $ 2.68bn, according to industry analysts at ihs markit. Some companies have capitalized on parents ' fears by selling bulletproof backpacks or whiteboards, as well as offering ways to fortify school buildings against attack. While refusing to pass substantive gun control restrictions, congress has approved hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending to help put police officers in public schools, including $ 45m in 2013, the year after the sandy hook elementary school shooting.

That's because the network was planning to use debate criteria that, in the words of the new york post's rich lowry, \" couldn't be more harmful to her if she had shot cnn honcho jeff zucker's dog. \" the former hewlett-packard ceo's current polling numbers are thanks to a recent surge after her standout performance in the fox \" kids'table \" debate, but cnn was planning to use polls that date back to mid-july, a time when fiorina was regularly polling under 2 %. After outcry, however, cnn decided today to change its criteria, the hill reports. Now, cnn will choose the participants based on an average of recognized polls between aug. 6 and sept. 10, which, the hill notes, will likely help fiorina more than any other candidate. But the old criteria ( an average of polls from july 16 through sept. 10 ) is still the base cutoff, meaning fiorina won't bump anyone who qualified for the debate under that criteria. Before the change, fiorina was battling chris christie for the last of the 10 spots in the upcoming debate, and christie's supporters were doing everything they could to make sure he won out, spending $ 1 million on tv ads in the lead-up to the debate. A former romney strategist predicted to the hill that cnn would relent and change its own rules to let her in.

The court's decision in citizens united v. Federal election commission clears the way for corporations and unions to use their general fund cash to run sharp, targeted ads in political campaigns. It's a ruling that advocates of campaign finance reform claim will allow businesses to tap into their vast treasuries and flood the airwaves with hard-hitting ads — commercials that democrats fear will be aimed mostly at them. That's certainly possible, and, even if corporations hold off initially, they could unleash their cash in the future if relations with congress truly go bad. In addition, there could well be some ideologically driven firms that decide to target particular candidates — just as some wealthy individuals have done in the past.

And in texas, lawyers for tom delay, the former house majority leader, said the pending state campaign finance case against him should be thrown out. A day after the united states supreme court ruled that the federal government may not ban political spending by corporations or unions in candidate elections, officials across the country were rushing to cope with the fallout, as laws in 24 states were directly or indirectly called into question by the ruling. \"one day the constitution of colorado is the highest law of the state, \" said robert f. Williams, a law professor at rutgers university. \"the next day it's wastepaper. \" the states that explicitly prohibit independent expenditures by unions and corporations will be most affected by the ruling. The decision, however, has consequences for all states, since they are now effectively prohibited from adopting restrictions on corporate and union spending on political campaigns.

            "New money will flow into campaigns this year as a result of thursday's supreme court decision, but will the impact be as dramatic as all the hyperventilating in washington suggests? experts say probably not. \"it's time for everybody to calm down, \" said ken gross, a campaign finance expert at skadden, arps, slate, meagher &amp; flom, who, like other lawyers in the field, thinks the possible repercussions of the decision have been exaggerated. The court's decision in citizens united v. Federal election commission clears the way for corporations and unions to use their general fund cash to run sharp, targeted ads in political campaigns. It's a ruling that advocates of campaign finance reform claim will allow businesses to tap into their vast treasuries and flood the airwaves with hard-hitting ads — commercials that democrats fear will be aimed mostly at them. That's certainly possible, and, even if corporations hold off initially, they could unleash their cash in the future if relations with congress truly go bad. In addition, there could well be some ideologically driven firms that decide to target particular candidates — just as some wealthy individuals have done in the past. But the reality is likely to be something more modest, mainly a shifting of cash that's already in the system away from so-called",
            "In wisconsin, conservative and pro-business groups said friday that they were considering a lawsuit to block a proposed law that would ban corporate spending during political campaigns. In kentucky and colorado, lawmakers looked for provisions in their state constitutions that may need to be rewritten. And in texas, lawyers for tom delay, the former house majority leader, said the pending state campaign finance case against him should be thrown out. A day after the united states supreme court ruled that the federal government may not ban political spending by corporations or unions in candidate elections, officials across the country were rushing to cope with the fallout, as laws in 24 states were directly or indirectly called into question by the ruling. \"one day the constitution of colorado is the highest law of the state, \" said robert f. Williams, a law professor at rutgers university. \"the next day it's wastepaper. \" the states that explicitly prohibit independent expenditures by unions and corporations will be most affected by the ruling. The decision, however, has consequences for all states, since they are now effectively prohibited from adopting restrictions on corporate and union spending on political campaigns. In his dissent to the 5-to-4 ruling, justice john paul stevens highlighted the burden placed on states. \"the court operates with a sledgehammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of"

The orange county register reports tabay may very well now be the youngest certified yoga instructor in america, leading classes at his family's yoga studio in san clemente, calif. Tabay tells the san clemente times the classes help some of his peers from school deal with their stress. One of his 13-year-old students likes that tabay brings \" the happiness... And the kid energy \" during his yoga classes. But tabay isn't just teaching kids. A middle-school teacher and 16-year yoga veteran says tabay even taught her a few new tricks. Tabay was introduced to yoga in 2012 when his mom, sahel anvarinejad, was battling cancer. She realized yoga helped her in that battle and got her own instructor certification while recovering. Tabay says that as a 6-year-old he realized yoga helped heal his mom \" mentally and physically. \" now he says he wants to \" help other people, like yoga helped her. \" classes taught by tabay are free; donations go to the children's hospital of orange county and other charities for children with cancer. Anvarinejad calls her son an \" amazing \" kid who \" touches everyone's heart, \" and his dad, former nfl linebacker larry atkins, says tabay's \" energy just lifts everyone up. \"",

How its new safety check feature works: if you're in an affected area — this is determined using the city listed in your profile, a location last recorded by the nearby friends feature if applicable, and where you're using the internet — the tool sends you a notification asking if you're safe, according to facebook's blog. When the \" i ' m safe \" button is clicked, an update is automatically posted to your news feed, along with any comments you provide, engadget reports. You can also mark friends as safe, browse through all check-ins, or inform facebook that you're not actually in the affected area. Mark zuckerberg unveiled the feature in japan, which was just hit by two typhoons in a week. \" a truly useful tool, or just a cagey way to try to take some of the creepiness out of the apps ' location tracking features? \" asks richard lawler for engadget. \" we're figuring the latter impression doesn't hurt from facebook's perspective. \" safety check was born out of a japanese effort. Facebook engineers there created the disaster message board after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc on the country. A test of that tool spawned an \" overwhelming \" response that inspired this latest feature, which will be available worldwide on android, ios, and desktops. But safety check may step on the toes of another internet giant, pc world points out.

Wonders anthony lane in the new yorker: \" had we really congregated in this place to savor the spectacle of bodies being flung around by the machinations of an evil plan? \" as for the film itself: it's got \" an uncommon zest and zip, \" writes lane, along with a twist that \" signals both the making of iron man 3 and, with any luck, the possible unmaking of the genre. From here on, the dumb-ass grandeur around which superhero plots revolve can no longer be taken on trust. \" in the new york times, manohla dargis isn't particularly impressed. The movie, \" despite the needless addition of 3d and negligible differences in quips, gadgets, villains, and the type of stuff blown up, plays out much like the first two movies. \" as for robert downey jr., \" the role has gradually, maybe inexorably, swallowed him. He no longer necessarily does — and probably isn't asked to do — the hard work of a real performance. \" kenneth turan calls the movie a \" spiritual reboot \" of the franchise in the los angeles times. It \" does tend to fall back on massive explosions and action set pieces as the conclusion nears. But by even posing questions of identity, the film creates the kind of jeopardy we can believe in, and for a superhero movie, that is an accomplishment in and of itself. \" in the washington post, ann hornaday writes that the film \" seems designed less as an artisanal object or visual entertainment than a full-body assault on the senses, \" she writes.

Instead of letting her explain what was happening to her daughter, shirley says agents kept her 20 feet away and called for backup over the pa, bringing armed airport police. \" one of them slammed her down, hit her head on the cement, and there was blood everywhere, \" shirley tells the chattanooga times free press. All shirley could do was take a photo of hannah on the ground, \" handcuffed, weeping, and bleeding, \" per the guardian. Hannah spent the next 24 hours in police custody. All charges were dropped a few days later, but shirley says the ongoing stress from the incident caused hannah to lose a college scholarship.

In 1992, university of michigan researchers asked 26,000 americans between the ages of 51 and 61 if they thought they would make it to 75. Some 22 years later, researchers with the brookings institution crunched the data and found people tend to underestimate how many years they have left. Of those born between 1931 and 1934, a full 49 % who said they wouldn't see 75 were wrong. In fact, almost all that group's respondents, except those who gave themselves 90 % or better odds of making it to 75, turned out to have been overly pessimistic, the wall street journal reports. It's more than just an interesting stat: with the dwindling state of social security, researchers worry people won't save enough money to cover the possibility that they ' ll live longer than they expect, phys.org reports. \" individuals do not fully understand the longevity risk they face, \" the authors explain. A longevity annuity could be a solution: an individual hands over a chunk of cash and begins receiving payments after a set number of years. The researchers outline what $ 100,000 spent on an annuity by a 60-year-old male could result in: $ 1,052 monthly payments beginning at 70, or $ 2,539 payments if the purchaser waited until 80 to collect.

Pew researchers asked respondents to select their first and second choices for which president in their lifetimes did the best job in office. While obama was ranked the highest in the survey overall – 44 percent said he is the best or second-best president of their lifetimes – it revealed generational and partisan differences in presidential preference. In the survey of 2,002 adults conducted between june 5-12, pew found that a plurality of americans ( 31 percent ) viewed obama as the best president in their lifetimes, and an additional 13 percent picked him as their second choice for the best president. Ronald reagan was americans ' next top choice at 21 percent, with 10 percent naming him as their second choice for the best president in their lifetimes. Bill clinton also had a strong showing in the survey, with 13 percent who chose him as the best president and 19 percent who chose him second.

Nps photo february 19, 2016 contact: abby wines, 760-786-3221 contact: linda slater, 760-786-3279 death valley, ca – there are unusually dense displays of wildflowers in several areas of death valley national park. Triggered by a series of storms in october, the current flower display is the best the park has experienced in a decade. Death valley is the hottest place on earth and the driest place in north america, averaging about two inches of rain per year. These extreme conditions make it difficult for most plants to survive. Most of the time, the lower elevations in the park appear stark: a landscape of salt flats, sand dunes and rocky mountains vegetated by a few hardy shrubs and small trees. Rain in cooler months triggers wildflower seeds to sprout, some of which may lay dormant for years until just the right conditions occur. Wildflowers bloom each spring in death valley",

The site had links to the company's online catalogs, at least until criticism from prominent gaming enthusiasts prompted ea to disable the links. \"it was almost like a virtual showroom for guns, \" says ryan smith, a contributor to gaming magazine gameological society. Ea and magpul also posted youtube video about their ties. Despite what critics like the nra's wayne lapierre might say, no studies have provided a connection to violent games and gun violence. Still, the ea example \" illustrates how the firearms and videogame industries have quietly forged a mutually beneficial marketing relationship, \" write barry meier and andrew martin of the times.",

In i had to survive: how a plane crash in the andes inspired my calling to save lives, canessa recounts the nightmarish ordeal in which he and 15 others ( 29 died ) survived more than two months stranded in the frigid mountains, people reports. The story was dramatized in the 1993 film alive, and the new book is out on march 1. A 19-year-old medical student at the time of the crash, canessa is now a pediatric cardiologist. He speaks of the \" very humble \" shepherd who played a crucial role in the survivors ' eventual rescue. \" now, \" canessa says, \" when i have the chance to save the heart of a baby... I believe i am giving back what the shepherd gave me. \" in an excerpt of his book published by the daily mail, canessa shares poignant details from the crash and its aftermath: \" i held on to my seat so fiercely that i tore off chunks of fabric with my bare hands. Bowing my head, i waited for the final blow that would send me into oblivion. But it didn't happen. \" people reports canessa first raised the idea of cannibalism. \" i will never forget that first incision nine days after the crash. Four of us... With a razor-blade or shard of glass in his hand, carefully cutting the clothes off a body whose face we could not bear to look at. \" \" we laid the thin strips of frozen flesh aside on a piece of sheet metal. Each of us finally consumed our piece when we could bear to. \" when the decision was made that he and two others would venture to find help, canessa writes, \" all i could think about, with terror in my head and heart, was the sheer walls of ice that lay between us and salvation. \" read more of his harrowing account here.

Among the developments monday: john mccain weighed in: \" in recent days, donald trump disparaged a fallen soldier's parents. He has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the united states — to say nothing of entering its service. I cannot emphasize enough how deeply i disagree with mr. Trump's statement. I hope americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our republican party, its officers, or candidates. \" read it in full at cnn. Columnist charles hurt, however, thinks democrats deserve blame because they used khizr khan — and his son's death — as a political tool at the convention. And khan \" allowed himself to be tricked into it. \" read his column at the hill. Khan himself went on cnn monday morning and said the gop wasn't doing enough to rein in trump. \" every republican has rebuked his behavior, yet no one has stood up and said, enough, stop it, you will not be our candidate.

            "After the guests at justin timberlake and jessica biel's wedding were whisked to southern italy via private jet last week, they were greeted by a video produced by timberlake's longtime pal, l.a. Real estate agent justin huchel. The video had a gag: huchel hit the streets of los angeles and asked a bunch of homeless people, street musicians, and transexuals to wish the multimillionaire newlyweds well. Funny, funny stuff. The 8: 30 video featured street interviews with ten people, many of them obviously homeless, premised on the idea that they were friends of timberlake and biel's who, for whatever reason, couldn't quite swing the trip to the borgo egnazia resort in puglia for the nuptials, which were reported to cost $ 6.5 million. \" greetings from your hollywood friends who just couldn't make it, \" reads the opening title",

The report also alleges that management told staff to reprocess and repackage of 10 tons of green and odorous frozen beef with a new expiration date, and that staff hid these practices from mcdonald's inspectors. \"isn't everywhere like this? i ' ll keep going because wherever i eat, the issues are all the same, \" a 20-year-old shanghai student says in response to the revelation — while eating at mcdonald's. The response has been harsh. Chinese regulators shut down husi and the fast-food chains have stopped orders, report reuters and bloomberg. Mcdonald's and yum intend to investigate, but the scandal is a serious hit even in a country that generally trusts foreign companies more than domestic ones, says the financial times. The stakes are huge, with 2,000 golden arches and 4,400 kfcs in china. And after melamine-laced baby formula, fox meat masquerading as donkey, and antibiotics in chicken, this might be the last straw. \" i don't know that this is something an apology can fix so easily, because at this point people don't have a whole lot of trust that they have good systems in place, \" one expert tells reuters.",

John kasich has 10 days to sign or veto the bill. \"the passage of animal sexual abuse legislation is a great victory for the animals of ohio, \" says a policy director at the humane society, which campaigned for the bill. The senators who sponsored the bill argued that sexually abusing animals can be a stepping stone to sexually abusing children. But of course it's not as simple as making it illegal to have sex with animals. Whio reports the bill originally sought to stop local governments from regulating large-scale dog breeders, meaning animal-rights groups opposed it. Then republican legislators added a section to the bill to stop cities like cleveland and cincinnati from raising the minimum wage, according to the new york daily news. Now the bill was now also unpopular with workers ' rights groups. To make the controversial bill more palatable, republican legislators then added the anti-bestiality legislation. And that's how 40 legislators, mostly democrats, ended up voting against making it illegal to screw animals while the state made it easier to keep screwing workers.",

But they provide fodder for the north koreans. They took him hostage. And the outcome is self-evident. \" fred warmbier offered his thanks to the trump administration for getting otto home, saying it was his understanding that the directive to secure otto's release came from the president. As for the previous administration, it asked that the warmbiers keep a \" low profile.... Earlier this year, cindy and i decided the time for strategic patience was over, \" he said, per the hill. When asked if obama could have done more, he said, \" i think the results speak for themselves. \" danny gratton, warmbier's roommate in north korea, spoke publicly for the first time thursday, telling the washington post: \" i think in the western world we just can't understand, we just can't grasp, the evilness behind that dictatorship. \" he says otto didn't do anything to deserve his treatment by the north korean government.",

The cold, damp conditions have preserved the bones remarkably well. \" it's an incredible site, \" a bureau of land management paleontologist tells ap, adding that some specimens might go back 100,000 years.

            "Scientists excavating an ancient wyoming sinkhole containing a rare trove of fossils of ice age mammals have unearthed hundreds of bones of such prehistoric animals as american cheetahs, a paleontologist said on friday. The two-week dig by an international team of researchers led by des moines university paleontologist julie meachen marked the first exploration of natural trap cave at the base of the bighorn mountains in north-central wyoming since its initial discovery in the 1970s. Meachen said the extensive excavation that began late last month uncovered roughly 200 large bones of animals like horses that roamed north america from 12,000 to 23,000 years ago and an uncounted number of microfossils of creatures such as birds, lizards and snakes. \"we found evidence of bison, a bit of gray wolf and quite a lot of cheetah and horse, \" she said of the first of three planned annual digs, which ended on friday. Researchers expect their study of the fossils to provide new insights into the climate, diets and genetic diversity of north american creatures that disappeared during the ice age extinction more than 10,000 years ago. A number of animals that fell 85 feet to their deaths after stumbling into the 15-foot-wide mouth of the cavern were unusually well preserved by cold and damp conditions, meachen said. \"some bones still have collagen with intact dna for genetic testing and some fossils are fragments crushed by rocks.

            "Scientists excavating an ancient wyoming sinkhole containing a rare trove of fossils of ice age mammals have unearthed hundreds of bones of such prehistoric animals as american cheetahs, a paleontologist said on friday. The two-week dig by an international team of researchers led by des moines university paleontologist julie meachen marked the first exploration of natural trap cave at the base of the bighorn mountains in north-central wyoming since its initial discovery in the 1970s. Meachen said the extensive excavation that began late last month uncovered roughly 200 large bones of animals like horses that roamed north america from 12,000 to 23,000 years ago and an uncounted number of microfossils of creatures such as birds, lizards and snakes. \"we found evidence of bison, a bit of gray wolf and quite a lot of cheetah and horse, \" she said of the first of three planned annual digs, which ended on friday. Researchers expect their study of the fossils to provide new insights into the climate, diets and genetic diversity of north american creatures that disappeared during the ice age extinction more than 10,000 years ago. A number of animals that fell 85 feet to their deaths after stumbling into the 15-foot-wide mouth of the cavern were unusually well preserved by cold and damp conditions, meachen said. \"some bones still have collagen with intact dna for genetic testing and some fossils are fragments crushed by rocks.

The women, a former member of baylor university's volleyball team, filed a lawsuit against the college tuesday over its handling of the alleged assault in 2012, cnn reports. The lawsuit says the institution in waco, texas, allowed football players to \" run wild \" and she was \" manipulated into not pursuing her rights \" after she was allegedly drugged and raped by up to eight players. Her attorney says she didn't inform police at the time because \" the mindset at that time was the football players could do whatever they wanted. \" court documents state that a coach spoke to some of the players involved and they said they had only been \" fooling around, \" calling it \" a little bit of playtime, \" the dallas morning news reports. In the lawsuit, the woman says that after the coach's talk, football players verbally harassed her on campus and sent her family text messages. This is the seventh title ix lawsuit for the university, which has been dealing with allegations of mishandling of football-related sexual assaults for years, reports reuters.

        "summary": "Experts really can't stress enough how much you absolutely shouldn't look at this monday's eclipse without proper eye protection — and maybe not even then. \" there are serious risks associated with viewing a solar eclipse directly, even when using solar filter glasses, \" usa today quotes ohio optometrist michael schecter as saying. He says one of the problems is that during an eclipse, the moon covers enough of the sun to allow it to be viewed without pain, tricking people into thinking it isn't doing harm. And nasa warns that eclipse glasses that filter out 100 % of harmful rays still need to be used perfectly — for example, by not peeking over the top of them. Just a few seconds of looking at a solar eclipse can do lasting damage. A recent case out of florida shows just what that damage can entail, live science reports. A 12-year-old girl was taken to the emergency room with blurry vision after she spent a minute looking directly at the sun. She suffered solar retinopathy, which is what happens when extremely bright light creates molecules that kill cells in the retina, creating blurry vision and blind spots. There is no treatment for solar retinopathy, and while vision can improve, it will rarely return to \" normal. \" in this case, the girl's vision never improved. The risk of looking at an eclipse is the same as staring at the sun. Nj.com has a bunch of safety tips for viewing monday's eclipse, including instructions not to use regular sunglasses. And quartz warns that researchers find young males are the most likely to damage their eyes while looking at an eclipse.",

What tyerell przybycien is charged with doing instead: helping her set up and carry out her suicide, the daily herald reports. On tuesday, a 4th district court judge ruled there was \" reasonable belief \" that enough evidence exists to send the spanish fork man to trial for jchandra's death, charging him with first-degree murder and failure to report a dead body, both felonies. If convicted, he could face 15 years to life in prison. In court documents cited in the washington post, prosecutors say when jchandra told przybycien of her plans, the 18-year-old texted another friend to ask what he should do, and the friend told him he should persuade her otherwise. Przybycien, however, reportedly had the reverse reaction. \" it be awesome, \" he texted back, noting he wanted to help her carry out her plan. \" like getting away with murder. \" those records also detail przybycien's alleged role, including mapping out jchandra's suicide, picking her up from work may 5, and buying rope and compressed air. He's then accused of taking jchandra to the maple lake campground in payson, setting up a noose for her, and filming her as she inhaled the compressed air, passed out, and fell off a wooden pedestal, hanging herself in the process. The salt lake tribune has reported he also provided running commentary through the video found on her cellphone, including noting at one point: \" that's when the brain stops getting oxygen. \" przybycien's lawyer argues his client didn't actually carry out the actions that killed her, but judge james brady says przybycien's help was a \" substantial factor \" in her death. Przybycien's arraignment is set for oct. 24. ( radio host delilah revealed the contents of her son's \" goodbye note. \" )",

            "Kampala, uganda ( ap ) — kanye west has met with uganda's president during a visit to the east african nation and given the 74-year-old leader a pair of white sneakers. President yoweri museveni said he and the american rapper held \" fruitful discussions \" on monday about promoting tourism and arts. West and his wife, reality tv star kim kardashian west, have been vacationing in a national park in uganda. He is said to be recording music in a tent. Uganda's presidency released photos of a hoodie-wearing west meeting museveni at the state house and exchanging gifts. While excited tourism officials see the visit as an endorsement of the country's tourism potential, some ugandans wryly pointed out that museveni cracked down on hoodies earlier this year when he announced that motorcycle riders could no longer wear them in a bid to fight rising crime. The president, one of africa's longest-serving leaders, has been at the center of unrest in recent weeks as uganda's large youth population increasingly expresses frustration over unemployment and accuses museveni of being out of touch. Uganda's government has been criticized over its treatment of a local pop star-turned-opposition lawmaker, bobi wine, who alleges torture by security forces. The government denies it. ___ follow africa news at https://twitter.com/ap_africa",

        "summary": "The jade trade in burma \" may well be the biggest natural resource heist in modern history, \" according to a report published friday by an international anti-corruption organization. That organization, global witness, puts the value of the jade produced in 2014 in burma at at least $ 31 billion — more than half of the country's gdp, the new york times reports. Unfortunately, very little of that money ends up in the hands of burma citizens, who are some of the poorest in the world. According to the abc, global witness states 50 % to 80 % of burma's jade is smuggled out of the country and into china, where the times reports the growing middle class has a high desire for it. According to the times, global witness claims the profits from the jade trade work their way through fake companies with fake owners to the pockets of military leaders, politicians, and the family of the country's former dictator, whose sons control two mining companies. Burma's military also owns two companies and uses the profits to battle rebel groups fighting for independence and control of the jade supply. Global witness states jade mining is leading to wars, heroin abuse, prostitution, and rising hiv rates. According to the abc, one local calls her jade-rich state \" hell on earth. \" the times reports global witness wants obama to work with burma to change the jade trade so its profits actually improve the lives of its citizens.",

Assets that could be liquidated should bp not be able to pay on time; 3 ) bp received no assurances that the ultimate economic damages would not be higher; 4 ) bp is still liable for all individual and state claims in court; 5 ) the fund is completely separate from any environmental damages, which the obama administration says could top $ 30 billion; 6 ) bp paid another $ 100 million for workers made unemployed by president obama's indefinite ban on"

As recently as 2008-09, leicester was in third-tier league one, the equivalent of a double-a baseball team filled with prospects. Just two years ago, captain wes morgan and many of his teammates were playing in the far-from-glamorous second-tier league championship. One bookmaker, sky bet, said it paid out $ 6.8 million to those who backed leicester to win the title, with 128 putting money on the team at 5,000 to 1. The bbc notes that at the start of the season, things that british bookies considered more likely than leicester winning the league included elvis presley turning up alive and well, which was 2,000 to 1; kim kardashian becoming president, also 2,000 to 1; and the loch ness monster being discovered, which was 500 to 1.",

        "summary": "Hurricane patricia — the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere — is scheduled to cut a swath of destruction along the west coast of mexico friday evening, the los angeles times reports. Two days ago, it was a mere tropical storm. So how did it undergo what experts call \" rapid intensification \" and the times calls a \" hurricane explosion? \" experts say hurricane patricia was enabled by a perfect combination of warm water, calm atmospheric winds, and a relatively compact size. Unfortunately, that's about as specific as they can get. \"we have had situations with equally warm water and with low wind shear and we don't get a record-breaking storm, \" james franklin at the hurricane center tells the times. \" what is the exact combination of factors to produce a storm? i don't think anybody really knows. \" the weather channel reports hurricane patricia is one of the most rapidly intensifying tropical cyclones ever seen in the modern world. It took two days to go from a tropical storm to a dangerous category 5 hurricane, according to the times. In 24 hours, sustained wind speeds jumped from 85mph to 200mph. Experts believe winds could be as high as 205mph when hurricane patricia makes landfall in mexico, scientific american reports. Those would be the highest wind speeds ever recorded at landfall. In comparison, hurricane katrina's were 125mph when it hit new orleans, and hurricane sandy's winds were 94mph as the storm battered new york.",

            "Hurricane patricia is now described as the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere. Meteorologists are talking about its stunning \"rapid intensification. \" the rest of us can call it a hurricane explosion. From wednesday night through friday, tropical storm patricia blew up into a record-setting category 5 hurricane that is headed toward mexico's west coast. In about 24 hours, the maximum sustained winds increased from 85 miles per hour thursday morning to more than 200 miles per hour by early friday, meteorologists say. \"it was a perfect environment for the rapid intensification, \" said dennis feltgen, a meteorologist with the national hurricane center in miami. That perfect environment includes warm ocean water, low wind shear or calm winds in the atmosphere and a relatively compact storm structure, according to meteorologists. Cooler waters, tossing upper winds and a broad storm footprint all serve as brakes to rapid growth. Why patricia turned into a monster is a bit of a mystery, said james franklin, chief of forecast operations at the hurricane center. \"we have had situations with equally warm water and with low wind shear and we don't get a record-breaking storm, \" franklin said. \"what is the exact combination of factors to produce a storm? i don't think anybody really knows. \" but the physics of growth is known, he explained",
            "In the past 24 hours hurricane patricia, bearing down on mexico's west coast, has rapidly intensified to become the strongest storm ever recorded in the western hemisphere. As of this morning, data from air force planes show peak winds ( sustained for one minute ) of 200 mph and a surface pressure bottoming out at 880 millibars ( typical pressure at sea level is 1013 millibars ). The numbers push patricia past the former record holders: hurricane wilma in 2005 and hurricane gilbert in 1988.

            "Hurricane patricia is now described as the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere. Meteorologists are talking about its stunning \"rapid intensification. \" the rest of us can call it a hurricane explosion. From wednesday night through friday, tropical storm patricia blew up into a record-setting category 5 hurricane that is headed toward mexico's west coast. In about 24 hours, the maximum sustained winds increased from 85 miles per hour thursday morning to more than 200 miles per hour by early friday, meteorologists say. \"it was a perfect environment for the rapid intensification, \" said dennis feltgen, a meteorologist with the national hurricane center in miami. That perfect environment includes warm ocean water, low wind shear or calm winds in the atmosphere and a relatively compact storm structure, according to meteorologists. Cooler waters, tossing upper winds and a broad storm footprint all serve as brakes to rapid growth. Why patricia turned into a monster is a bit of a mystery, said james franklin, chief of forecast operations at the hurricane center. \"we have had situations with equally warm water and with low wind shear and we don't get a record-breaking storm, \" franklin said. \"what is the exact combination of factors to produce a storm? i don't think anybody really knows. \" but the physics of growth is known, he explained",
            "In the past 24 hours hurricane patricia, bearing down on mexico's west coast, has rapidly intensified to become the strongest storm ever recorded in the western hemisphere. As of this morning, data from air force planes show peak winds ( sustained for one minute ) of 200 mph and a surface pressure bottoming out at 880 millibars ( typical pressure at sea level is 1013 millibars ). The numbers push patricia past the former record holders: hurricane wilma in 2005 and hurricane gilbert in 1988. On friday morning the national hurricane center said patricia's winds could rise to 205 mph as it hits mexico's shores, which would be the highest landfall reading ever, worldwide. When \"super typhoon \" haiyan struck the philippines in 2013 winds were 195 mph.

Republicans dropped their filibuster and allowed the bill to proceed to the floor for debate instead of blocking it a fourth time. Talks to forge a bipartisan deal behind closed doors apparently had gone as far as they were going to go, and when harry reid called for the bill to proceed by unanimous consent this evening, nobody objected, reports the new york times. Richard shelby said republicans had won concessions, in particular on a portion of the bill they characterize as a bailout fund.

That's not hypothetical. \" \"none of this is conservative, \" obama said. \"it's not conservative. It sure isn't normal. It's radical. It's a vision that says the protection of our power and those who back us is all that matters. \" \" i ' m here today because this is one of those pivotal moments when every one of us as citizens of the united states need to determine just who we are, what it is that we stand for, \" obama said. \" as a fellow citizen, not as an ex-president, i ' m here to deliver a simple message, which is",

A former inmate of the prison who worked in the tailor shop with sweat and joyce mitchell three years ago had this to say about their relationship to abc news: \"we had a joke. It was like, that was his boo, that was his girl … she would bring him like barbeque chicken, spareribs, things that were cooked on her home grill. \" but sweat allegedly told investigators nothing sexual occurred between the two of them — and that richard matt and mitchell did have sex. Syracuse.com points out that the former inmate, erik jensen, also claimed sweat and mitchell had sex multiple times a week in a storage closet. Cnn's info comes by way of law enforcement officials briefed on the case, who, along with the local da, shared three more tidbits of note: the official says matt's desire to get drunk after they broke into a cabin was at the root of the men's split; sweat allegedly also found matt to be out of shape. As for that practice run, clinton county district attorney andrew wylie tells cnn the men emerged from a manhole but found the area to be fairly populated with homes. They decided to try to exit via a different manhole the next night. And as for how they got out in the first place, sweat says they stumbled upon a sledgehammer in an underground passageway, possibly a forgotten remnant of prior construction work. They may have used it to bust through a brick wall.",

Scientists say that by answering the questions ( 13 for men, 11 for women ), respondents can get a percentage risk factor for death that's 80 % accurate, the guardian and telegraph report. As the test explains, \" if the risk of dying within five years is 2 %, this means that out of 100 people of the same age, sex, and risk profile, 98 will survive and two will die over the next five years. \" among the topics the questions touch on: how many cars you own, and the speed of your walking pace. Those questions are based on 655 measures that can influence the risk of premature death, uncovered using data collected on 500,000 britons over the years 2006 to 2010, reuters reports. That data source makes for a noteworthy caveat for would-be american test-takers. The test warns that the calculator \" will only provide accurate estimations for men and women... Living in the uk. \" still, it's an interesting exercise, and the calculator also gives one's \" ubble age \"; any number above a person's real age should be a red flag. \" we hope that our score might eventually enable doctors to quickly and easily identify their highest risk patients, \" a researcher says. \" of course, the score has a degree of uncertainty and shouldn't be seen as a deterministic prediction. \" ( another way to test your risk of death: squeeze something. )",

            "London health researchers have developed a scientifically rigorous death risk calculator that predicts a person's risk of dying within five years and say they hope people will use it to improve their health. Using a simple set of around a dozen questions about such things as the number of cars you own or whether you tend to be a slow or, better, a fast walker, the predictor can give a five-year death risk calculation for any briton aged between 40 and 70 years old. The researchers who developed the calculator with sense about science, a uk charity that works to help people make sense of scientific and medical claims, say it could improve health awareness and also in future be used by family doctors to identify high-risk potential patients. \" the score can be measured online in a brief questionnaire, without any need for lab tests or physical examination, \" said andrea ganna from sweden's karolinska institute, who co-led the work and published it in the lancet medical journal. To create the score, ganna and his colleague erik ingelsson from sweden's uppsala university, analysed data collected for the uk biobank between 2006 and 2010 from nearly half a million adults aged between 40 and 70. They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle and health measurements could predict death from any cause",

Whether you would rate your health as excellent, good, fair or poor is a better predictor of death in the next five years for men aged 40 to 70 than physical measures including blood pressure and pulse rate, according to scientists writing in the lancet medical journal. Other significant questions include how briskly you walk and how many cars you own. The first major publication from scientists using data from the uk biobank scores 655 different measures that can affect the chances of premature death. The researchers have used this to put together a short questionnaire. Just 13 questions for men and 11 for women will produce a percentage risk factor for death within five years. While self-assessed health is the strongest risk factor for men, the strongest for women is any diagnosis of cancer, which is the biggest cause of women's death in this age group. For people of both sexes who do not have any serious disease or disorder, smoking is the most significant factor. The website, called ubble ( for uk longevity explorer )"

        "summary": "Political eyes are on alabama on tuesday, where a republican primary for the senate has turned into a proxy war. The race pits luther strange, who was appointed to temporarily fill jeff sessions'seat, against former state supreme court justice roy moore. Strange is backed by president trump and the party establishment, including mitch mcconnell. Moore, however, is backed by steve bannon, who says a moore victory will send the message to mcconnell and the gop hierarchy that their \" day of reckoning \" is coming, reports politico. Coverage: the polls: moore is up big, 52-41, in an election-eve poll by alabama data firm cygnal, reports the hill. The poll, which came after trump appeared with strange at a rally on friday, suggests the president's support isn't much of a factor. Trump disagrees, tweeting tuesday that \" strange has been shooting up in the alabama polls since my endorsement. Finish the job - vote today for ' big luther. ' \" however, it seems moore's lead has been shrinking in recent days, notes fivethirtyeight. Bannon's fight: he gave a thundering speech for moore on monday night, one that suggests a nasty republican \" civil war \" is in the offing, observes politico. Bannon has made \" electing moore — a like-minded, pugilistic outsider — the first of what he hopes will be many pet projects to oust ' globalist'republican incumbents, \" writes alex isenstadt. Bannon is similarly backing candidates against sens. Dean heller in nevada and jeff flake in arizona, notes cnn. ' rubes ': in his speech, bannon told alabama residents that gop leaders think they're \" a pack of morons \" and \" nothing but rubes. \" send a message with tuesday's vote, he urged. British brexit leader nigel farage appeared at the same rally, asserting that a moore victory would \" rejuvenate \" the trump grass-roots movement. Trump: why the split with bannon over the race? bannon suggests the president was led astray. \" we did not come here to defy donald trump, \" he said monday. \" we came here to praise and honor him. \" and in his own speech for strange last week, trump seemed to be having second thoughts. \" i ' ll be honest, i might have made a mistake, \" he said, per the washington post. He later added, however, \" luther will win. \"'ten commandments ' judge: moore is perhaps best known for being removed from the bench because he refused an order from the us supreme court to remove a ten commandments",

        "summary": "On march 2, 2002, mike mcqueary went to joe paterno to tell him what he'd seen the night before in the penn state locker room: former defensive coordinator jerry sandusky raping a boy who looked to be about 10. Mcqueary, then a 28-year-old grad assistant in the football program, immediately fled the locker room after witnessing the scene. Sources tell the new york times that the next day mcqueary gave paterno, the athletic director, and another senior administrator all the details of what he saw. Mcqueary was told, weeks later, that sandusky was no longer allowed to bring children on campus, and there's no evidence showing that he pushed the issue further after that point. The times paints a picture of mcqueary as a local kid who lived and breathed football and led penn state's nittany lions as a senior quarterback — and one of just two penn state employees known to have witnessed sandusky's alleged sexual abuse. Neighbors, teammates, and a former coach describe him as \"a real decent \" kid, a \"fiery \" redhead who was constantly tossing a football. After returning to penn state to work in the football program in 1999, it became mcqueary's dream to someday take over paterno's job as head coach; after the 2002 incident, he continued rising up the ranks, often visible at paterno's side. The times notes that saturday's penn state game could determine whether the lions will reach a major bowl game — and tmz reports that mcqueary will still be acting as receivers coach that day.",

        "summary": "You might hear your stomach rumbling, telling you to fill it with something tasty, but the actual impulse to eat originates in the brain. Now researchers studying the brain cells responsible — called agouti-related protein ( agrp ) neurons — say that alcohol activates them, thereby triggering the urge to eat even though alcohol can be highly caloric, reports scientific american. To test this, researchers at a lab in london got mice drunk and watched the electrical activity of agrp neurons spike, which seems to explain why following these binge-drinking sessions, the mice ate a lot more — even though their bodies weren't even remotely in need of calories. The findings won't necessarily translate to humans, but the researchers note in the journal nature communications that alcohol intake is already associated with overeating in humans. \" i don't doubt that agrp neurons are activated in humans, \" says a study co-author, \" and that's why you see this effect. \" agrp neurons are normally activated in times of starvation, compelling a person to eat, and the study notes that it seems this \" widely consumed nutrient can paradoxically sustain brain starvation signals. \" obesity and heavy drinking play major roles in the development of diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic health issues now affecting millions globally, reports reuters. But, says the co-author, \" this study ties them together. ( it ) shows that if you have an increased alcohol intake, then you're going to, as a result of that through the effect of alcohol on your brain, have an elevated level of food intake. \" ( scientists have decided there are four kinds of drunks. )",

The fbi has just announced the painting will be returned to the family following its recovery in january 2017. In a twist, it was a man in possession of it who contacted the fbi. The maryland man, believed to have purchased the painting from the suspected thief, had tried unsuccessfully to sell the painting in 2017 to a gallery, and he called the fbi afterward wondering if there might be a reward, per the washington post. ( there wasn't. ) the painting, estimated to be worth $ 300,000 to $ 900,000, will now go back to the heller estate. The family plans to put it up for auction, with proceeds going to columbia university, nyu medical center, and an arts organization, after the insurance company takes a cut. Authorities say the suspected thief was previously convicted of \" interstate transportation of stolen property and mail fraud related to the theft and sale of other works of art. \" it isn't clear if new charges will be laid, but the investigation is continuing.

He has also been an outspoken supporter of president trump, though he attracted some controversy last summer when he told abc news he \" absolutely \" knew former president obama was a muslim and that the us took a \" bad turn \" during obama's tenure. \" being a republican and with proximity to the white house and republican leadership, he's going to be able to get more done — being in the majority, with his notoriety, for the residents of the 26th district, \" moran tells the times. Sabato's social media is quiet on his new plans, save for a cryptic tweet accompanied by an american flag emoji: \" whatever you decide to do in life, do it with passion &amp; conviction 2 be continued. \" ( trump has also inspired a former snl star to mull politics. )",
