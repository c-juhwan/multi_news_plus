        "summary": "The ak-47 has been called \" the coca-cola of small arms. \" it's said to be responsible for 250,000 deaths every year and believed to have killed more people than all other modern weapons combined. On tuesday, a 30-foot monument dedicated to its designer, lt. Gen. Mikhail t. Kalashnikov, was unveiled in moscow, the new york times reports. Kalashnikov, whose gun was first produced in 1947, died in 2013 at the age of 93, according to npr. The bronze statue features his likeness cradling his signature invention — as russian state tv puts it — \" like a violin. \" the inscription on the pedestal below the statue reads: \" i created a weapon for the defense of my fatherland. \" the statue was unveiled on weapons maker day, an official russian holiday in its seventh year. During the ceremony, russian minister of culture vladimir medinsky said this of kalashnikov: \" extraordinary natural talent, simplicity, honesty, organizational skills. \" he called the ak-47 \" a true cultural brand of russia. \" but not everyone was enamored by the statue. One nearby resident tells the guardian it \" reaffirms the image of russia as a militaristic and neo-imperialistic country that feels it is surrounded by enemies. \" another neighbor tells radio free europe the statue is \" trash \" and \" loathsome, \" adding that poets and playwrights \" are probably more worthy. \" at least one protester was detained while holding a sign reading \" a weapons designer is a designer of death. \" at the unveiling, kalashnikov's daughter said her father didn't like that his gun was used so widely and felt weapons should \" always be under secure lock and key and only in the army. \"",

But fly them she did, delivering british spitfires and other warplanes to the front lines during world war ii, reports the new york times. Ellis'story — which the 5-foot-2 aviator chronicled in her spitfire girl autobiography — is getting attention again this week because of her death at 101 at home on the isle of wright. Ellis estimates that she flew 1,000 planes during the war as a volunteer with britain's air transport auxiliary, reports the bbc. Only three other female ata pilots are believed to survive now. Remarkably, most of their missions were flown solo and without compass or radio assistance, notes the washington post. Ellis ' 2016 memoir recounts a flight in which a german fighter plane flew near her. \"with one hand i waved at this pilot to move away and get out of my sight, \" she wrote. \"i can picture his grinning face now. Then he cheekily waved back again and again — and then suddenly he was gone. I wondered if it was my blonde curls that caused him to stare as i never ever wore a helmet during my whole career with the ata. What was the point of a helmet when we couldn't speak to anyone? it didn't do much for the hairstyle either. \" ellis took flying lessons as a teenager but flew for pleasure until hearing a radio ad in 1941 looking for ata volunteers. She signed up and flew through the entire war.",

Do your service, \" says beck, whose 13 deployments included service in iraq and afghanistan. \" i was defending individual liberty, \" she says. \" i defended for republicans. I defended for democrats.

In other coverage: the white house doesn't appear to have worked out the details of how trump's decision will affect active-service transgender troops, who are believed to number in the thousands, buzzfeed reports. White house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders declined to provide details on the issue in a wednesday briefing, and threatened to end the briefing early if reporters kept asking about it. Trump's decision will weaken the military, and not just by costing it an estimated 15,000 active-duty and reserve troops, phillip carter and amy schafer write at slate. Millennials are strongly in favor of equal rights for lgbt people, they write, and trump's decision will send the message to potential recruits that the military isn't the kind of employer they want to work for. The washington post takes a close look at trump's claim that medical care for transgender people would be a \" tremendous burden \" on the military and finds that even the highest cost estimate is just $ 8.4 million a year — or around 10 % of what the military spends on erectile dysfunction medication. The military spend on viagra alone is around five times the estimated annual cost of providing transition-related medical care to transgender troops. Politico looks at the \" legal land mine \" of trump's decision and predicts that the military will face \" profound \" legal difficulties if it tries to expel transgender soldiers who are already serving openly. Fivethirtyeight finds that republican senators aren't falling over themselves to rush to support the ban: only two gop senators endorsed it wednesday, while nine ( not all of them moderates ) said they didn't support it. Many others chose to remain silent. Transgender servicemembers vowed to fight any attempt to force them out of the military. \" i would like to see",

        "summary": "It might seem like an easy generalization to say that female characters in modern disney films are a more enlightened bunch than those of the snow white and cinderella variety. Which is why two linguists who are crunching data on a dozen of the animated movies going back to the 1930s were surprised by one clear trend: female characters speak less of the dialogue in today's films than they did in those made decades ago, reports the washington post. For example, women speak 50 % of the lines in snow white, 60 % in cinderella, and 71 % in sleeping beauty, a trio of films made more than a half-century ago. Contrast that with percentages in more modern ones such as the little mermaid ( 32 % ), beauty and the beast ( 29 % ), mulan ( 23 % ), aladdin ( 10 % ), pocahontas ( 24 % ), and frozen ( 41 % ). \" my best guess is that it's carelessness, because we're so trained to think that male is the norm, \" says researcher karen eisenhauer of north carolina state. \" so when you want to add a shopkeeper, that shopkeeper is a man, \" she says. \" or you add a guard, that guard is a man. I think that's just really ingrained in our culture. \" quartz notes that the trend applies to films with actual humans, too, citing research on how male best-actor oscar nominees have far more screentime in their role than their female counterparts. One silver lining is that the words swirling around the more modern disney females are focused less on appearance and more on skills and accomplishments than they used to be, note the researchers. On that note, e! online rounds up quotes from newer disney princesses to illustrate the point, including, \" you control your own destiny, \" from merida in brave ( a modern exception, women have 74 % of the lines in this one ). Otherwise, it finds the study \" depressing, \" and a blogger at refinery29 shares the sentiment. \" disney is failing the bechdel test, big time. \" ( it turns out that our fairy tales are much older than we thought. )",

The move represented an effort by the white house to walk a careful middle line that would retain the support of women's groups and liberal lawmakers, who back the original rule, while easing tensions with catholic critics, who reacted with cautious optimism and even praise to the shift. The new policy did little to quell criticism from republicans, who have been rallying opposition to the rule and using the issue on the campaign trail to paint obama as hostile to religion. The announcement caps a frenetic month in which the administration often sent mixed signals and appeared caught off guard by the political fallout as even allies questioned its handling of the issue. Obama took the unusual step friday of making"

        "summary": "Donald trump's immigration policy is taking heat this week from critics who claim aspects of it might be illegal or could lead to \" staggering economic and social havoc. \" the washington post editorial board calls out the gop presidential frontrunner's plan to deport all illegal immigrants, a scheme it says would cripple the us economy and create a refugee crisis to rival that in syria. The post uses california, which accounts for 13 % of the united states ' gdp and has 2.6 million undocumented workers, as an example of what mass deportation would do. Up to 50 % of the state's farm and orchard workers are undocumented, as are another 14 % in construction. There are thousands more undocumented workers in california than unemployed people, which means mass deportation would cause a labor shortage even if americans wanted to fill those jobs. On the other hand, politico finds fault with trump's plan to \" impound \" remittances sent home by immigrants in order to force mexico to get on board with building a border wall. On his campaign website, trump claims this would net $ 22 billion, citing a fox news story. But politico reports the majority of that $ 22 billion likely comes from legal immigrants. Furthermore, experts aren't exactly sure how trump would \" impound \" that money, which would require new laws that would likely face \" equal protections \" challenges: why just mexican nationals and not those from europe? besides, undocumented immigrants could send remittances by snail mail to avoid the new laws. Plus, the post thinks \" impounding \" remittances would hurt the mexican economy and actually make the problem of illegal immigration worse.",

But the billionaire businessman turned republican presidential frontrunner also includes an idea rarely, if ever, discussed on the national stage: a vague proposal to \"impound \" the remittances of undocumented immigrants. Mexico, he writes, \"relies heavily on the billions of dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the united states back to mexico ( $ 22 billion in 2013 alone ). \" if a trump administration \"impounded \" that money, it could gain significant leverage in its efforts to get mexico to play ball with its other schemes, like building the wall. Except he's getting that number wrong. In 2013, mexican immigrants — both legal and illegal — sent $ 22 billion back to their home country. Considering that around half of mexican immigrants are here legally and that legal immigrants earn more money than undocumented ones, it's likely that a large percentage of that $ 22 billion is derived from legal wages, not illegal ones. So far less money is available than trump is claiming — meaning he'd have less leverage for his plan. Perhaps more importantly, immigration experts aren't sure how his idea could actually work — or even what exactly \"impounding \" means.

The 11-year-old's mother, 39 — a friend of the mom of 2-month-old zuri whitehead, who was watching the infant to give her mom a break — fell asleep on a basement couch with both girls around 3am friday, reports the cleveland plain-dealer. In the hour the mother was asleep, the girl allegedly took zuri upstairs and beat her. She returned and woke her mother to tell her something was wrong with the baby, who was bleeding with her head badly swollen. The mother immediately called 911, but zuri died of massive brain injuries and internal bleeding at a cleveland trauma center. The 11-year-old, who is not being named, was charged with murder yesterday; a juvenile court judge entered a not guilty plea and ordered a competency hearing. The child is too young to be charged as an adult. The crime scene was so traumatic that the police chief is bringing in counselors for responding officers. \" i've been a policeman for 30 years and i've never come across something like this, \" he says. \" we're trying to figure out what could possibly motivate someone to do something like this. \"",

The visit would end only after cusack was dragged by a speeding car for about a half-mile, according to police in pembroke pines. Cusack's body camera captured part of the scene before it was dislodged: the officer is seen putting on protective gloves as he speaks with a man and woman found in a car with a \" small, clear plastic baggie with an unknown substance in plain view, \" according to police. But as the man begins to drive away, cusack gets hung up in the door frame. Police say he was then dragged as the driver hit 60mph, made \" several sharp maneuvers, \" and attempted to hit responding emergency vehicles, report cbs miami and the miami herald. Police say cusack feared he'd be run over if he let go of the vehicle but finally released his grip when the car slowed. Cusack — whose \" uniform and shoes were shredded \" according to a police report — was then taken to a hospital where he underwent surgery for \" significant road rashes, \" per the south florida sun-sentinel. Meanwhile, authorities say thomas cabrera, 38, reached speeds of 105mph as he led police on a 20-mile chase. He was arrested after his vehicle was impeded by traffic. He later admitted to using heroin and cocaine before encountering cusack and said he fled because he didn't want to go to jail, according to police. He's charged with attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, felony fleeing and eluding, reckless driving, and driving with a suspended license. Cusack, who left the hospital wednesday, says he's \" doing well. \"",

The item in question is a chicken diaper made by featherwear, and if you've never heard of chicken diapers, well, start by knowing they're a thing. In a piece for the outline, michael waters explores \" the booming business of luxury chicken diapers, \" which are designed to do the obvious: catch chicken poop. ( waters explains chickens don't both urinate and excrete, but simply produce excrement. ) the diapers have been embraced by both chicken owners who want to bring their pets inside without sullying the house and instagrammers who think it's just cute to post a photo of a chicken in a diaper. As for their popularity level, waters shares the story of julie baker, who with her young daughter abigail made one for one of the chickens abigail liked to bring inside from their claremont, new hampshire, farm. After they got a few requests from others, baker decided to have her homeschooled daughter launch an online store as a lesson. Now they're selling up to 1,000 diapers a month at $ 18 a pop, and the demand has her shipping to all 50 states. Waters gets into the nitty-gritty, explaining how the rise of urban chicken raising is feeding the trend and charting the different types of diapers available ( some you just wipe the excrement out of while others require paper-towel inserts ). He also touches on a side accessory: the chicken dress. Read the full piece and see photos here.",

Around 10 years ago, baker was raising chickens with her daughter on their small farm in claremont, new hampshire when she first saw a youtube video of a chicken wearing what looked to be an upside-down apron that stretched across its backside. The diaper, so to speak, was used to catch chicken poop so the birds wouldn't leave droppings everywhere ( chickens do not urinate separately from defecation. Their urine is technically in their excrement ). \"i ' m like, 'oh my goodness, i so need to do that, ' \" baker said. Baker's daughter liked to bring her favorite chicken, an old english hen named abigail, inside their house, and because chickens poop close to a dozen times per day, baker needed a better system for managing abigail's excrement. So she began sewing abigail diapers out of cotton fabric, and soon other poultry owners asked if baker could make diapers for their chickens, too. Baker, who was homeschooling her daughter at the time, decided to turn the task into an assignment — she and her daughter would launch an online store.

Then-secretary of state john kerry was reportedly at that meeting, as were ag loretta lynch, national security adviser susan rice, and dhs secretary jeh johnson, and they all balked when the fbi director held up what appeared to be a draft on what he knew about the tampering, one source notes. \" i want to go forward, \" the source says comey said, an idea dismissed by the others. Their reasoning, per the source: an op-ed \" doesn't have the same stature \" and wouldn't be as effective as a joint letter from multiple government agencies. An ex-fbi special agent tells newsweek this shows comey's \" determination to be transparent, \" especially since he's taken pen to paper and gone public before ( he wrote a letter to the editor in the times in 2014 defending the fbi's occasional use of deception ). Either way, comey probably won't be too flustered by any criticism he faces as this news filters out. On wednesday, he spoke at an intelligence and national security alliance dinner, explaining that the fbi was nonpartisan — \" we're not considering whose ox will be gored, \" he said, per the week — and that people angry he went public with the fbi's investigation into hillary clinton's emails are \" wearing glasses that filter the world \" to match their point of view. He also noted what usually happens after a \" hard decision. I know … a storm is going to follow, \" he said. \" honestly, i don't care. \" ( comey issued a \" double blow \" to president trump. )",

Film description: outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, pulp fiction was widely considered the most influential american movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter quentin tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of david mamet; the serious violence of american gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as citizen kane, rashomon, and la jetée. The oscar-winning script by tarantino and roger avary intertwines three stories, featuring samuel l. Jackson and john travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the french names for american fast food products; bruce willis as a boxer out of a 1940s b-movie; and such other stalwarts as harvey keitel, tim roth, christopher walken, eric stoltz, ving rhames, and uma thurman, whose dance sequence with travolta proved an instant classic.

        "summary": "Electric car maker tesla motors is handing over the keys to its technology in an unusual effort to encourage other automakers to expand beyond gasoline-burning vehicles. Tesla ceo elon musk promised today to give away the company's entire patent portfolio to all comers, as long as they promised not to engage courtroom battles over intellectual property. \" if we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines behind us to inhibit others, we are acting in a manner contrary to that goal, \" musk wrote in a blog post on the company's web site. Other automakers using tesla's technology could potentially share the cost of tesla's charging stations, for example. And more charging stations could entice skeptical buyers to try electric cars. Tesla currently makes one vehicle — the $ 70,000 model s sedan — and is developing two others. But musk said tesla can't make a dent in the market by itself, and thinks the patents could be a \" modest \" help to other companies developing electric cars. \"even if other competitors copy tesla's design, tesla still gets to sell them batteries, and that's pretty awesome, \" a stanford patent law expert tells the la times. \" tesla's decision isn't entirely altruistic. \" the shift to open source is intriguing, but \" there are many unanswered questions \" about how it will fly in reality, writes brian solomon at forbes.",

One analyst told the la times last month that ive's design sensibility is \"even better than steve jobs '. \" still, tim cook's widely-panned performance at the iphone 4s launch has some worried. \"tim's not steve, \" one analyst tells usa today. \"he's much more low-key. \" but others say he shouldn't be underestimated. \"we don't think steve jobs picked tim without him having somewhat of a 'vision thing, ' \" another analyst said.

Vox adds that that's a higher percentage than one barack obama managed in the state in 2008, when he got 78 % of the black vote. And therein may lie the rub for sanders: while clinton has hugged her old boss close on the campaign trail, sanders has emphasized a broken system that needs rebuilding from the ground up. \" in many ways he's got to almost overhaul ( his message ) because he's been able to energize a lot of democrats who feel angry about the political process, but i don't think sanders acknowledged strongly enough the progress that president obama has made, \" a democratic strategist tells politico. To wit: ap cites exit polling that found three-quarters of voters want obama's successor to generally continue his policies, while about two in 10 wanted the next president to tack to the left.

That's thanks to communication between the plants involving a pheromone called gibberellin, vox reports. Early-maturing plants, which tend to become female, start developing the pheromone, but they don't finish. Instead, these plants send the chemical into the forest floor, where nearby plants can absorb it, nature reports. When these less-mature plants pick up the chemical, they finish the process of making gibberellin. Higher amounts of gibberellin tend to lead to male plants. In short, the older plants have caused their neighbors to turn male. The system generally leads to female ferns surrounded by male ones, meaning a more diverse bunch of plants, phys.org reports.

But for japanese climbing ferns ( lygodium japonicum ), it depends on the entire community communicating across generations, researchers report in science1. Older fernlings secrete pheromones that determine the sex of the younger ones — maintaining a balanced ratio so that they can all reproduce faster, the study shows. It is the most intimate look yet at the sex lives of ferns, which spawn not from seeds, but from spores. They mature into full plants known as gametophytes, which can be male, female, or hermaphroditic. If there are no other gametophytes around, they will remain hermaphroditic and self-fertilise — reproducing but at the risk of inbreeding. Six of one, half a dozen of the other but in the"

Researchers analyzing how sperm cells move have come up with what they call a \" simple mathematical formula \" to explain what's happening, reports the bbc. They found that the tail creates a rhythm that propels the sperm forward, pulling the head forward and sideways in what may seem like chaotic fashion but is far from it. The \" sperm stirs the fluid around in a very coordinated way to achieve locomotion, not too dissimilar to the way in which magnetic fields are formed around magnets, \" says dr. Hermes gadelha in a release from the university of york. The vast majority of the sperm cannot overcome the resulting fluid drag, but a select few are able to move forward. \" it is true when scientists say how miraculous it is that a sperm ever reaches an egg, but the human body has a very sophisticated system of making sure the right cells come together, \" says gadelha, whose team's study is published in the journal physical review letters. This phase of the research focused on the movement of one sperm cell — they fed measurements of the tail's beat into a computer — and the next will try to create a model for larger numbers. Figuring out how the sperm move and why some are more successful than others could theoretically improve infertility treatments in the future, say the researchers.

Researchers from the uk and japan found that the head and tail movements of sperm made patterns similar to the fields that form around magnets. And these help to propel sperm towards the female egg.

            "\" every sperm is sacred. Every sperm is great. If a sperm is wasted, god gets quite irate, \" goes the song from monty python's movie the meaning of life. If the lyrics strike you as funny, it's most likely because calling a sperm cell \" sacred \" sounds ridiculous when men can produce so many of them. In fact, the average male will produce roughly 525 billion sperm cells over a lifetime and shed at least one billion of them per month. A healthy adult male can release between 40 million and 1.2 billion sperm cells in a single ejaculation. In contrast, women are born with an average 2 million egg follicles, the reproductive structures that give rise to eggs. By puberty, a majority of those follicles close up and only about 450 will ever release mature eggs for fertilization. But if it only takes one sperm and one egg to meet and create a baby, then why do men produce such a whopping number of sperm? wouldn't it be less wasteful for a man to release a single sperm, or at least fewer, to meet one egg? the reason for this predicament boils down to two words: sperm competition. Since the dawn of the sexes, males have vied with each other to get as many of their own sperm",

Now the grandchildren of a jewish lawyer killed by the nazis say the 700-year-old haggadah belongs to them. The grandchildren, led by 75-year-old eli barzilai, don't want israel's most important museum to return the manuscript, but they do want compensation — less than $ 10 million, according to the art newspaper — and a plaque noting their family's ownership of the manuscript. The museum doesn't dispute the haggadah was owned by ludwig marum for a time until 1933. It's what happened after that's a mystery. Marum was arrested by the nazis and died in a concentration camp in 1934, the jewish press reports. A coworker who remembered the haggadah, which features illustrations of humans with bird heads, from marum's office saw it was in the museum's possession and decided to investigate. The museum told him it bought the manuscript from a jewish immigrant for $ 600. The immigrant said he got it from a jewish doctor, but the doctor denied it, and the trail went cold. Barzilai says that's because the manuscript was stolen from his family. The museum wants documentation from barzilai showing what happened to the haggadah between 1933 and 1946. The family has hired an american lawyer recently portrayed by ryan reynolds in the film woman in gold to represent them. ( a painting looted by nazis recently turned up in an ohio home. )",

Her elder brother, prince george, aged four, will be a pageboy alongside three other young boys. So far, the details of the bridesmaids'dresses and the pageboys ' uniforms remain under wraps. Ms markle, 36, will not have a maid of honour as she wanted to avoid choosing just one of her closest friends. As well as his niece and nephew, prince harry has picked three godchildren - three-year-old florence van cutsem, two year-old zalie warren and jasper dyer, six - to have starring roles on his big day. Jasper is the son of prince harry's close friend mark dyer, a former royal equerry to prince charles, who supported harry after the death of his mother, princess diana. The pair travelled together on harry's gap year and mr dyer inspired the prince's charity work in lesotho, africa. Ms markle's goddaughters, remi litt, six, and her elder sister, rylan, seven, will also be joining the procession of bridesmaids. And the three children of one of her best friends, jessica mulroney - ivy, four, and seven-year-old twins brian and john - will complete the picture. Jessica, a stylist, is married to ben mulroney, a canadian tv host and son of former canadian prime minister, brian mulroney.

But everything suddenly felt doable just when i thought i couldn't make it anymore. \" the self-administered gas costs less than $ 100, while an epidural can run up to $ 3,000, says one midwife. One doctor in the story who isn't a fan says women who use the gas may no longer be \" totally aware \" and miss out on the experience of childbirth. Want to ease the pain without laughing gas? consider kicking your baby daddy out of the delivery room. A new study finds that women who lack emotional intimacy with their partner experience more pain if he's present, the telegraph reports. When given a laser pulse to a finger, women who said they tended to avoid closeness in relationships reported more intense pain, perhaps because \" the presence of others disrupts their preferred method of coping with threats on their own. \" the partners of women who sought closeness in their relationships didn't have a significant effect on the women's pain.

Researchers surveyed 38,000 adults aged 20 and older, then estimated that 59 % of americans took prescription drugs as of 2012, compared to 51 % in 1999. They also found those on five or more medications rose from 8 % to 15 %, reports newsweek. Why the jump? scientists note the 65-and-older population is growing, with 40 % of those in this group taking five or more meds. However, the number of people taking at least five meds rose across all ages. Researchers say part of the reason is likely obesity, noting eight of the 10 most commonly used drugs treat conditions like hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes, per the washington post. There's also better screening and diagnosis, but the possibility of medications being overprescribed remains, reports time. Researchers say the use of drugs to treat high blood pressure jumped from 20 % to 27 %, while the use of statins, which lower cholesterol, rose from 2 % to almost 8 %. The most commonly used drug, taken by 8 % of americans, was simvastatin, which lowers cholesterol and the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The use of antidepressants also grew from 7 % to 13 %, a change scientists link to \" shifting attitudes regarding depression, \" while the use of narcotics rose 2 %. Still, some prescription drugs are being used less. The use of antibiotics fell 1.5 % from 1999 to 2012, while hormone drug use dropped 8 % after a study found menopausal hormone therapy increased a woman's risk for heart disease and some cancers.

Actiniaria comprises approximately 1,200 species of solitary and skeleton-less polyps and lacks any anatomical synapomorphy. Although monophyly is anticipated based on higher-level molecular phylogenies of cnidaria, to date, monophyly has not been explicitly tested and at least some hypotheses on the diversification of hexacorallia have suggested that actiniarians are para- or poly-phyletic. Published phylogenies have demonstrated the inadequacy of existing morphological-based classifications within actiniaria. Superfamilial groups and most families and genera that have been rigorously studied are not monophyletic, indicating conflict with the current hierarchical classification. We test the monophyly of actiniaria using two nuclear and three mitochondrial genes with multiple analytical methods. These analyses are the first to include representatives of all three currently-recognized suborders within actiniaria. We do not recover actiniaria as a monophyletic",

Though the owner of the last two alaska stores claims they were still profitable, he tells the new york times that \" there were more things going wrong than a bunch of russell crowe stuff could fix. \" locations in north pole, soldotna, and wasilla closed earlier this year. But don't look for the bend store to close anytime soon: \" we still have that core group of customers that know we're local, are very loyal and come in every week, \" the store's general manager tells the times. \" everyone's tired of sitting at home on their phones and their laptops and not having any personal interactions. \"",

        "summary": "Occupy wall street celebrated its first anniversary today not so much with a bang as with a whimper — police and press outnumbered protesters. Reactions from both sides of the fence: in the daily beast, matt taylor says the movement has \" fizzled \" as organizers, too worried about being \" co-opted \" by a political party, started to fight internally. \" so long as occupy remains a symbolic phenomenon that exists only to sustain its own subculture — to speak to its own members — it won't be able to tap into the broader economic anxiety that is still festering across a battered, wary electorate, \" he writes. But on salon, rebecca solnit insists the movement is far from over. Today's protests may not be as attention-grabbing as some of the first events, but organizers are meeting regularly in cities across the us and even abroad. Those meetings have resulted in many \" little victories, \" like a foreclosure being prevented or a restaurant chain unionized, and some big ones, too — but more important is \" the less tangible spirit of occupy and the new associations it sparked, \" which will continue to have an impact for years to come. Stephen zunes is with taylor — the movement has \" fizzled \" — but it has undoubtedly had an impact on the american \" political narrative, \" zunes writes on cnn. Just look at president obama's \" populist stance: \" occupy made the 99 % a force to be reckoned with. One thing is for sure: occupy has been good for the markets. Since the movement launched, the s&p 500 is up 20 % and financial stocks are up 25 %, according to marketwatch. Ironically, the six biggest banks on wall street are all doing better, too.",

Though they actually lost seats, the liberal dems have the power to determine who becomes prime minister. Clegg has given himself until the end of the day to strike a deal, the guardian reports, because he's afraid the public will rebel if he waits longer. But other liberal democrat sources tell the times that it might not come until thursday. Clegg has promised to work with david cameron first, because his conservatives won the most seats, but cameron has reportedly told clegg that he won't bring a vote on electoral reform, the liberal dems'top priority. A labour pairing would be more natural ideologically, and clegg met with gordon brown yesterday. That ' ll amp up the pressure on cameron, but many fear a lib-lab coalition would be seen as illegitimate, even if gordon brown steps down — which he's being pressured to do.

Clegg met gordon brown for an hour at the foreign office today and is understood to have set out his fear that a lib-lab coalition might be regarded as illegitimate even if brown stood down as its leader. Senior cabinet figures have told brown in the last 48 hours that he should stand down and operate merely as a transitional figure for an unspecified period.

As the avalanche struck, anker ran to the left while bridges and lowe ran downhill and right. Anker was partially buried and had a rib snapped and his head gashed open by the ice projectiles that hit him. But he could walk.

            "Los angeles ( ap ) — the bodies of a renowned mountain climber and expedition cameraman who were buried in a himalayan avalanche 16 years ago have been found. The widow of alex lowe said in a statement friday that two climbers attempting to ascend the 26,291-foot shishapangma in tibet discovered the remains of two people partially melting out of a glacier. The climbers described the clothing and backpacks seen on the bodies to conrad anker, who was climbing with lowe and cameraman david bridges at the time of the october 1999 avalanche and survived. Anker concluded that the two were bridges and lowe, the statement said. \" alex and david vanished, were captured and frozen in time. Sixteen years of life has been lived and now they are found. We are thankful, \" jenni lowe-anker said. She married anker, her husband's friend and fellow elite climber, in 2001. They live in bozeman, montana, and run the alex lowe charitable foundation together. Anker said the discovery has brought closure and relief to him. He told outside magazine that although he hasn't seen photos of the remains, he's convinced they are those of lowe and bridges. \" they",

His second marriage lasted 47 years, until his wife's death, but he recalls how they'd sometimes cry because they could never have a biological family. Although no amount of money can fully erase those facts, the 85-year-old found out that he ' ll be receiving $ 25,000 from the state of virginia to compensate him for the reason he couldn't have kids, the ap reports. The state had forcibly sterilized him at age 13 — along with about 7,000 other victims ( reuters puts the number at closer to 8,000 ). Virginia's legislature yesterday approved a $ 400,000 measure that will result in each surviving victim — there are 11 known in the state — getting $ 25,000. It's now the second state to pay out to victims of forced-sterilization programs; north carolina was the first to do so in 2013, awarding $ 50,000 to each victim. The sterilizations occurred between 1924 and 1979 under the state's eugenical sterilization act, which was used as a model by some of the 32 other us states that passed similar legislation — and by adolf hitler. Forced sterilization was also common during that time in countries such as canada, japan, and sweden, the bbc notes. As for virginia, its law was upheld in a 1927 supreme court case in which justice oliver wendell holmes wrote, \" three generations of imbeciles are enough. \" reynolds, who was sterilized for supposed epilepsy ( his symptoms were actually temporary ones tied to his being hit in the head with a rock ), tells the ap, \" i think they done me wrong.

Researchers made the discovery during a 20-year dig in the ancient greek city of stagira, reports atlas obscura. Aristotle was born there in 384 bc, but he died in a different city, chalcis, about 50 miles north of athens. Literary sources mention that aristotle's remains were moved to stagira after his death, but his burial site has been a topic of debate for many years, the international business times reports. The tomb in stagira believed to be the philosopher's is a 32-foot-tall dome with a marble floor and views of the entire city. \" the thing is, the archaeologist data is in fine accordance with historical sources, \" archaeologist konstantinos sismanidis tells cnn. The tomb appears to have been built quickly and later fancied up, reports the greek reporter, which has photos. The structure was destroyed in later years by the byzantines, who built a tower on top of it. Aristotle is seen as \"the first genuine scientist in human history, \" as raw story puts it, studying under plato and tutoring alexander the great. And he's believed to be the author of more than 200 works. ( historians say they've found leonardo da vinci's relatives. )",

            "Rome -- former pope benedict xvi, who shocked the world by resigning in february, has reportedly revealed that god told him to do it during a \" mystical experience. \" the first pontiff to step down in six centuries, benedict said, \" god told me to, \" when asked about his decision to dedicate himself to a life of prayer instead. The 86-year-old pope emeritus said he had not witnessed a vision of god but had undergone a months-long \" mystical experience \" during which god gave him the \" absolute desire \" to forge a deeper relationship with him. Benedict also said that the more he witnessed the \" charisma \" of his extremely popular successor, pope francis, the more he understood how his stepping aside was the \" will of god. \" the former pontiff's comments were reported by the catholic news agency zenit, which did not disclose to whom benedict made the remarks. But the report was backed by a senior vatican source. \" the report seems credible -- it accurately explains the spiritual process that brought benedict to resign, \" the source told the times. When announcing his resignation to cardinals on feb. 11, benedict had focused on his ill health, stating his strength \" has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted",
            "\" god told me to do it, \" the 86-year-old former pontiff told a friend, six months after his decision to step down shocked the world's 1.2 billion catholics. God had implanted in his heart the \" absolute desire \" to resign and to devote himself to a life of prayer and reflection, benedict told the anonymous confidante, according to zenit, a rome-based catholic news agency. \" it was not because of any type of apparition or phenomenon of that sort, \" he said, but instead the result of a \" mystical experience \" received during \" a direct rapport with the lord \". He said the more he sees the \" charisma \" of pope francis, his successor, the more he is convinced that it was \" the will of god \" that he became the first pontiff in 600 years to resign.

            "Rome -- former pope benedict xvi, who shocked the world by resigning in february, has reportedly revealed that god told him to do it during a \" mystical experience. \" the first pontiff to step down in six centuries, benedict said, \" god told me to, \" when asked about his decision to dedicate himself to a life of prayer instead. The 86-year-old pope emeritus said he had not witnessed a vision of god but had undergone a months-long \" mystical experience \" during which god gave him the \" absolute desire \" to forge a deeper relationship with him. Benedict also said that the more he witnessed the \" charisma \" of his extremely popular successor, pope francis, the more he understood how his stepping aside was the \" will of god. \" the former pontiff's comments were reported by the catholic news agency zenit, which did not disclose to whom benedict made the remarks. But the report was backed by a senior vatican source. \" the report seems credible -- it accurately explains the spiritual process that brought benedict to resign, \" the source told the times. When announcing his resignation to cardinals on feb. 11, benedict had focused on his ill health, stating his strength \" has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted",
            "\" god told me to do it, \" the 86-year-old former pontiff told a friend, six months after his decision to step down shocked the world's 1.2 billion catholics. God had implanted in his heart the \" absolute desire \" to resign and to devote himself to a life of prayer and reflection, benedict told the anonymous confidante, according to zenit, a rome-based catholic news agency. \" it was not because of any type of apparition or phenomenon of that sort, \" he said, but instead the result of a \" mystical experience \" received during \" a direct rapport with the lord \". He said the more he sees the \" charisma \" of pope francis, his successor, the more he is convinced that it was \" the will of god \" that he became the first pontiff in 600 years to resign.

        "summary": "Ah, weddings: the chance to celebrate love, commitment... And the increasingly staggering amount of cash couples are forking over to tie the knot. One trending nod to frugality, however, is the rise of the less costly thursday wedding. In fact, the times reports that in the united kingdom, nearly 22,000 weddings took place on thursday last year, which is about 6,000 more than in 2008, according to data from hitched.co.uk. That's an increase of a third in just seven years, with friday weddings basically holding steady, and it's happening in spite of the fact that couples are essentially asking their guests to take off work to attend a wedding just so the couple can save money. \" with many venues and wedding suppliers booking up months or even years in advance, a thursday wedding can also give wedding planning couples a better chance of booking their first choice vendors, \" says the site's editor. Insurance data backs these findings, showing a 43 % increase for next year among couples who've taken out policies for thursday weddings, reports the telegraph. The paper interviewed one couple who found not just the general booking cheaper ( by a third ) but even the catering. And their guests saved on hotel costs. But the telegraph notes separately thursday nuptials aren't all love at first sight. One woman says friends and family left their reception by 11pm and didn't \" let their hair down as much as they might \" because they had to work the next day, while there was no one around for brunch the morning after. Still, she says, they'd do it again — they saved $ 10,000 having thursday nuptials, which they put toward their kids instead. ( this woman chose to exchange vows in a hospital. )",

            "Nearly seven years after two boys pushed a shopping cart off a walkway at a manhattan mall, severely injuring a woman four stories below, a jury decided to award more than $ 45 million to her and her family. The woman, marion hedges, had just shopped for halloween candy with her son, dayton, then 13, at the east river plaza mall in east harlem in october 2011 and was at a parking kiosk when the two boys hoisted the cart over a railing above. It plummeted more than 70 feet and struck ms. Hedges on the head. Ms. Hedges, a philanthropist, stopped breathing and was rushed to the hospital. She suffered serious brain damage and today she struggles with diminished cognitive abilities, double vision, incontinence and memory loss, her lawyer, thomas moore, said.

The nitty gritty: the new parker institute for cancer immunotherapy will bring together about 300 scientists and 40 labs at the six centers, including memorial sloan kettering and stanford. The ap has more basics. The idea is to fund \" high-risk best ideas that may not get funded by the government, \" jeffrey bluestone, who will lead the institute, tells usa today. This is the biggest donation ever for immunotherapy and one of the biggest for cancer, period, but a post at mit technology review takes a look at why \" parker's money alone won't defeat cancer. \" one of parker's big ideas is that the institute itself will manage the patents and negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry to bring therapies to market, while the centers themselves will retain the intellectual property, reports the washington post. Immunotherapy involves harnessing the body's own immune system to fight cancer cells, and \" it's hard to overstate how hot \" the field is right now, reports wired. Sfgate explains why immunotherapy is a personal issue for the 36-year-old parker, who has long suffered food allergies and asthma. Parker's net worth is estimated to be $ 2.4 billion, reports the new york times.",

The 2014 sochi torch, which will not be lit during its five days in space, blasted off on a soyuz rocket this morning accompanied by russia's mikhail tyurin, american rick mastracchio, and koici wakata from japan. The torch has been to space before, aboard the space shuttle atlantic before the 1996 atlanta games, but two russian cosmonauts plan to take it on its first spacewalk this week. As part of a four-month, 14,000-bearer relay before the games kick off in february, the torch has already been to the north pole aboard a russian icebreaker and will be taken to the bottom of lake baikal, the world's deepest lake, and to the top of mount elbrus, europe's highest mountain, the ap reports. But in another setback for a games already troubled by allegations of corruption and a backlash against russia's harsh anti-gay laws, the flame has gone out several times since the relay last month, the bbc notes.",

        "summary": "Mummified remains were found in mongolia this week, and there's something remarkable about them. \" the mummified body sits in a lotus position, as if still meditating, \" says a report in mongolia's morning news cited by the siberian times, which reports that the age of the remains was pegged at 200 years following a preliminary visual exam. The corpse, which was covered in a skin of some kind — perhaps from a cow, horse, or camel — has since been delivered to a forensic facility. According to the new york daily news, the body showed \" no visible decay. \" early speculation: that he was perhaps a teacher of lama dashi-dorzho itigilov, who acted as spiritual leader to russia's buddhists. In 1927, the then-75-year-old told his students he planned to die and instructed them to \" look at \" his body in 30 years. As the story goes, itigilov got into the lotus position and started to meditate and chant, then died. Roughly 30 years later, his followers did indeed exhume his body and reportedly found it still in the lotus position and undecayed, the new york times reported in 2002 — the year his body was again exhumed and found to still be preserved. It was transported to a russian monastery where it is said to remain. At the time, a scientist said the soil, the condition of the coffin, and salt placed in the coffin could help explain how the body remained so well-preserved, but suggested itigilov may have had a defect in a gene related to decomposition, or was perhaps embalmed in some way. In a report on mummified monks, ancient origins notes that \" self-mummification \" by way of a years-long ritual known as sokushinbutsu has been known to have occurred 28 times. The excruciating process, which reportedly takes more than six years, involved steps including a 1,000-day diet of only bark and roots and the drinking of poison tea said to eliminate bacteria that cause decay.

China is among the asian countries searching that huge arc for the plane, and experts say they'd be amazed if it had somehow slipped through the country's radar. While countries along the suspected route are understandably tight-lipped about their air defenses, analysts believe radar systems in china — along with those covering india's tense northern border and around us bases in afghanistan — are far too robust for an unidentified boeing 777 to pass through the region undetected, the new york times finds. Reuters'source says much the same, and then some: \" the working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor, \" based on the absence of northern radar data and lack of debris in the initial part of the southern corridor. More: the southern indian ocean is \" one of the remotest places on earth and also one of the deepest seas, \" notes reuters, diminishing the chances we ' ll ever find the plane. And the clock is ticking. In 18 days, the batteries that are sending out pings from the box that holds the flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders will likely die, reports cnn. Australia, which is at the helm of the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, has winnowed its search area to 89,000 square nautical miles — about the size of italy, reports the times.",

        "summary": "The first signal came earlier this week, in the wake of the james foley execution, when joint chiefs chairman martin dempsey said islamic state militants could not be defeated without taking the fight to them in syria. Now the white house is considering doing exactly that, according to reports in the new york times, the washington post, the los angeles times, the guardian, and pretty much every large media outlet. That could involve everything from boosting arms and training to rebels fighting the militants, to encouraging other groups such as syrian kurds to join the fight, to us airstrikes and special ops missions. One thing us officials insist they won't do is collaborate with the army of syrian leader bashar al-assad, notes the guardian, although defeating the islamic state would clearly benefit him, too. President obama could theoretically order military action in syria on his own under the rationale of protecting american citizens, reports the washington post, and he did just that earlier this summer in giving the green light to an unsuccessful rescue attempt for foley. But the administration could also go to congress to ask for a more formal authorization. One big drawback to airstrikes is that the us has no ground presence in syria to direct them, notes the la times. Countering the push toward some kind of action is this assessment from an official of the group win without war: \"we've seen this movie before and we know how it ends, \" he says. \"we play into their hands by giving them what they want, which is a battle with the west. \"",

As us aircraft continued to pound the islamist militants in northern iraq, the obama administration was studying a range of options for pressuring isis in syria, primarily through training \" moderate \" syrian rebels as a proxy force, with air strikes as a possible backup. Leaders in washington and london are adamant they will not collaborate with the regime of bashar al-assad in tackling their common enemy, and on friday the pentagon insisted that it had yet to decide on whether to expand the us air war into syria. But isis has demonstrated its rampant authority in northern syria in recent days, with the brazen murder of the us hostage james foley and a series of attacks on towns and villages in the north, including the vital airbase at taqba, where it has surrounded a detachment of syrian army soldiers.

( reuters ) deputy national security advisor ben rhodes tells reporters that the islamic state is a greater threat now than it has been in the past. ( reuters ) the obama administration is considering seeking congressional authorization for military action against the islamic state under a revamped counter­terrorism strategy president obama announced last year. A mandate from congress could provide domestic legal justification for the unlimited use of force against the sunni muslim group across iraq and syria, a senior administration official said. Congress last formally authorized such action in 2001, against al-qaeda and its associates, and 2002, against iraq under saddam hussein. The new authorization is one of several alternatives under active internal discussion as the administration grapples with whether and how to try to militarily defeat the islamic state, which controls a wide swath of territory between damascus and baghdad. The \"range of options \" for direct use of the u.s. Military includes temporary authority under the war powers resolution, constitutional authority for emergency action to protect u.s. Citizens, and \"having that discussion with congress \" about a more open-ended authorization to combat the islamic state, the official said. Obama has ordered airstrikes in iraq under the first option, good for 60 days until early october."
