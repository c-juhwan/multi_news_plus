Seems the story started on a right-wing website called wnd, which attributed it to an unnamed \" former intelligence officer \" in iran — but that hasn't quelled speculation entirely. \" any explosion in iran that doesn't hurt people but hurts its assets is welcome, \" said israel's defense minister. And an israeli foreign policy expert said iran may have cooked up the story to keep inspectors from entering fordow. After all, the story broke right after iranian state media reported that talks could resume between tehran and western powers, although the eu quickly said no such agreement existed. Also note that fordow started making uranium at 20 % fissile purity in 2011, far higher than the 3.5 % needed at nuclear energy plants.",

        "summary": "Following north korea's most powerful weapons test yet on sunday, a south korean lawmaker tells cnn his country's intelligence service believes the north has an intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) on the move. Things get pretty vague beyond that: he didn't know the method of transport or when the movement was noticed. But reuters does pick up some alleged details on those fronts, via an unnamed source quoted by south korea's asia business daily. Its source says the icbm started moving monday, is only being moved at night, and is headed toward the nation's west coast. Reuters notes there's some likelihood that another test could come on or around saturday: sept. 9 is the country's founding day holiday. Cnbc notes north korea conducted a nuke test on sept. 9, 2016. Two more details that allegedly came from the south's national intelligence service briefing: word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the north's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations, and suspicions that the next icbm test firing might be directed toward the north pacific but aimed at a lower angle, which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests, which had more of an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the white house tells reuters it has given \" in-principle approval \" to a request by south korean president moon jae-in to abolish a limit regarding warhead weights, a move that would strengthen the power with which it could attack the north, if necessary. Meanwhile, vladimir putin on tuesday gave his take on the situation: north korea \" will eat grass but will not give up the ( nuclear ) program if they don't feel safe. \"",

That study found that qualified black jurors  those not released for cause, such as opposition to the death penalty  were struck by prosecutors at nearly twice the rate as qualified white jurors. In cumberland county, they were struck at 2.6 times the rate, according to the researchers. Defense attorneys used a sweeping study of capital cases in north carolina done by michigan state university law school researchers to bolster their claims. In selecting that panel, robinsons defense team claimed, prosecutors struck half the blacks eligible for the jury and only 15 percent of those who were not black. Defense attorneys for robinson argued earlier this year that prosecutors struck blacks from the jury pool at a much higher rate than whites. The jury that sent robinson to death row included nine white jurors, one american indian and two blacks, according to court filings. Cases he has presided over: in the mid-1990s, he presided over the court proceedings in robeson county against the two men accused of killing james jordan, father of basketball star michael jordan.

It was all part of a test of a new drone-delivery feature the company hopes to bring to residential areas, consumerist reports. The workhorse group's horsefly unit — which can buzz along for about a half-hour, carrying packages that don't exceed 10 pounds — traveled a quarter-mile or so from the truck to the farm, dropped off its package, then circled back to find the ups truck, on its way to a new destination. Techcrunch reviewed the test runs and said the process \" still needs work, \" noting that interference caused one launch to be aborted. Reuters reports the experiment followed on the tail of a ups announcement that automation and new technology were high on the company's priority list. Mark wallace, a ups senior vp, explains to consumerist that rural areas could be a particularly viable place for the truck-launched drones, as a truck could settle in the middle of a \" triangular delivery route \" and send the drone to different destinations. Another ups exec, john dodero, tells reuters that there's no set timeline for getting the drones into wider circulation because federal regulations are in flux. Faa rules, for example, currently require commercial drones to stay in operators ' view, and they can only buzz over their operators, not other people. ( inc. Notes the risk to those below if the drone malfunctions and drops the package. ) one thing dodero can speak clearly to: \" ups is never looking to replace our ups drivers, \" he tells reuters.

In one of the more buzzed-about pieces from the story, baum gets hold of an email from an aha rep on the set of life of pi that describes how the \" tiger damn near drowned, \" instructs the recipient to keep it quiet, and adds, \" i have downplayed the f --- out of it. \" ( salon reprints the full email here. ) there's also the chipmunk that got stepped on and killed in failure to launch, the dog that got repeatedly punched by its trainer in eight below, the nearly 30 goats and sheep that died in the hobbit: an unexpected journey, and all manners of injuries and even deaths to horses over the years on a slew of films. The examples go on and on — there's all kinds of wiggle room from the aha, especially if the accident occurred off-camera instead of during filming or was accidental — and baum's piece suggests that aha has gotten too \" cozy \" with the industry to adequately protect animals. It includes this quote from an aha board member defending the \" no animals were harmed \" disclaimer: \"i think what people think [ it means ] is that when a horse dies in the movies, it didn't really die, \" she says. \" i think that people think [ the aha's monitoring ] is just when the cameras are rolling. \" at slate, lv anderson finds that tough to take: by those standards, \" no one cares if you punch, step on, or starve animals as long as there's no camera turned on nearby, \" she writes. \" if that's the best defense the aha can come up with, i hope the department of agriculture, the governmental agency usually tasked with protecting animals from neglect and abuse, begins sending agents to hollywood very, very soon. \" the aha, meanwhile, calls the piece an inaccurate hatchet job in a statement picked up by the sacramento bee.

The incident occurred around 10am ( 0900 gmt ) in the compiegne forest, about 85 kilometres ( 53 miles ) northeast of paris. The man was acting as a beater, who normally help corner the animal in a certain area, when he was struck. He \" was charged and pierced by a deer which stabbed him with his antlers, \" a police spokesman said. The hunter, who was not carrying a rifle, died of internal bleeding before emergency services could arrive. Police said this type of death was \" uncommon \". Guy harlé, the president of the local hunters federation said: \" normally the animal would flee, but this time he decided to charge. It came after him. \" the antlers of the stag are like many knives piercing you, there is nothing you can do. This tragic accident reminds us that we do not play with a wild animal. There is an inherent risk with hunting, \" said harlé. The victim was named as regis levasseur. He was due to get married in the coming months. \" for him, hunting was more than a hobby, it was his life, \" said harlé. The killing of the hunter by a deer comes just a week after there was an outcry in france after hunters and their hounds tracked a stag to the garden of a private house before shooting it at close range ( see video below ). The incident took place in the town of lacroix-saint-ouen, on the edge of the compiegne forest, not far from where regis lavasseur was gored. It prompted france's environment minister, nicolas hulot, to slam hunting with hounds as \" a practice from another century \" that \""

Police yesterday arrested two more people, a man and a woman, both 29, as suspected conspirators in the attack, the wall street journal reports. They also searched the homes of six people — including, reportedly, suspect michael adebolajo's father's home. Neither these two conspirators nor the wounded alleged killers have been charged yet. Other developments include: police also haven't identified any of the suspects, but adebolajo's name was widely reported yesterday, and today the telegraph has identified the other alleged knife-man as the confusingly similarly named michael adebowale, 22. Neighbors identified adebowale after police armed with submachine guns raided his flat yesterday, emerging with two children, a baby, and two large envelopes. Adebowale was apparently known for distributing radical islamist leaflets, and his girlfriend had recently converted to islam. \" when you walked past, you would hear them singing muslim songs, \" one neighbor says, adding that she \" saw the man who was in the video go inside the house. I think he was a boyfriend. \" rigby, \" was due to come up this weekend, \" his wife tells the guardian. \" you don't expect it to happen when he's in the uk.

        "summary": "The winter solstice officially occurred at 6: 04pm est yesterday, marking the first day of winter and the longest night of the year. But all \" longest nights \" aren't created equal, and the longest night in earth's history likely happened in 1912. Here's why: the earth's rotation has been slowing a little bit every year since the planet formed some 4.5 billion years ago, and we have a phenomenon known as tidal acceleration to thank. The moon's gravity pulls on our oceans, tugging the oceans that face it into a \" bulge \" ( livescience digs into why there's a bulge on the other side, too ). But as the earth rotates, that tidal bulge is pushed to a position just ahead of the point of our planet that's directly below the moon. That causes the earth to experience \" just a bit of friction from this bulge of water as it rotates, slowing it down slightly, \" explains vox. And as a nasa article explains, as earth slows, the moon is able to inch away from us. The effects of these things are so tiny it takes atomic clocks to spot them, but they're very gradually making our nights longer — mostly. In the long view, we're slowing, but geological factors ( like ice melting at our poles, for instance ) can impact the rotational speed, and as this university of california observatories graph shows, the length of our day has gone infinitesimally up and down over the last century, but the peak — and therefore the longest night in our history — occurred in 1912. As far as the length of last night goes, it depends on where you spent it, notes the washington post. Washington, dc, saw about 9.5 hours of daylight yesterday, while miami got almost 10.5, and fairbanks, alaska, saw less than four.

        "summary": "It's been rumored for a few years now; nautilus'take on the looming \" bourbon shortage \" is that it already has hit. Though we're awash with knob creek and maker's mark, high-end and small-batch bourbons are in short supply, spurring well-heeled drinkers to clear the next tier of bourbon from the shelves. As io9 explains, the reason we've arrived at this point can be distilled down to some poor predictions made as many as 20 years ago when the golden liquid filling today's premium bottles started being made. Basically, distillers didn't predict just how much demand would swell in this decade, and the wall street journal reported in september that they've been burned before: they jacked up production in the 1970s, but demand plunged and prices followed. But nautilus places us in a \" mad men-inspired mixology epoch, \" stacking up the 19 million cases of bourbon sold last year to the 13 million sold in 2002. And while actual data detailing the shortage is hard to come by, one independent survey by writer fred minnick finds that 82 % of 149 \" high-end \" bourbon drinkers report not being able to get their hands on certain bourbons right now. More on why: the aging process is what takes the edge off bourbon, so much so that anything aged less than 4 years must be labeled as such; many fine bourbons are aged 18 or more years. Nautilus takes a look at how some makers are attempting to hack down that timeline: by using oak barrels much smaller than the standard size or adding oak chips to regular-size ones in order to balloon the \" alcohol-to-barrel-surface ratio, \" for instance. But for those who want the real, decade-aged deal, \" there simply isn't enough of the good stuff to go around, \" observes nautilus.

The team analyzed 3,485 nordic women and their babies, and found that a woman's height actually shapes the fetal environment, thereby influencing the length of her pregnancy. This has broad health implications around the world, where 15 million babies are born prematurely every year and more than 1 million of them die due to complications of early birth — which include breathing problems, vision loss, and intellectual delays, report researchers in a press release. \" that a woman's height influences gestational length, independent of the genes she passes on that determine fetal size, is a major finding by our research networks, and the first of what we expect to be many genetic contributions, \" one researcher says.

            "Summary of major findings while the extremes of birth size, particularly birth weight, and gestational age at birth are important global contributors to infant mortality, more modest deviations in these parameters have been repeatedly linked to risk for adult disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease [ 58 – 60 ]. Thus, understanding the determinants of fetal growth and the duration of pregnancy are essential to improve both newborn and later-in-life health. Epidemiological evidence has suggested that these birth outcomes are shaped by intrauterine environment, but the relative contribution of maternal genetic, fetal genetic, and nongenetic factors that may drive epigenetic physiological adaptations remains incompletely understood. Moreover, should fetal genetics shape these outcomes, their direct involvement in the risk for the adult diseases, as well, is an intriguing possibility. Recently, to better understand normal fetal growth in healthy pregnancy, a multinational longitudinal assessment has been reported [ 61 ]. These data demonstrate similar average growth profiles across geographic populations but do not define the mechanisms for variability within a given population. In this study, we observed the consistent associations between maternal height and birth length, birth weight, and gestational age in each of the three study cohorts. The estimated effect sizes of the observed associations were respectively ~0.05 cm/cm for birth length, ~10 g/cm for birth weight, and ~0.34"

Halloween sales, which had been expected to hit $ 8 billion, will surely see an impact, usa today reports. \" small businesses relying on last-minute shoppers will get hit, \" says a national retail federation rep. One such small business reports that the storm will cost it as much as $ 50,000, a good chunk of its profits for the year. Some halloween events are still happening tonight, like new york's greenwich village halloween parade, but the crowds are expected to be much smaller than those of a normal year. Other festivities have been delayed to this weekend or even next, the huffington post reports.",

On friday afternoon, the large pup chased a ball out onto the frozen lost lagoon in stanley park, but crashed through the thin ice. After being alerted by someone nearby, officers arrived to see the tired dog struggling to stay above the water. That's when const.

Resignation is now on the table, the 77-year-old archbishop of washington wrote in a tuesday letter to priests, laying out a plan to discuss the subject with pope francis in rome. Wuerl submitted his resignation at age 75 as is required of catholic bishops, but the pope kept him on as one of his top us advisers, per the new york times and cnn. During a meeting two weeks ago, the pope told wuerl to consult with priests about the best way forward, reports the wall street journal. Amid questions over whether he knew about molestation claims against his predecessor, former cardinal theodore mccarrick, he heard calls for him both to stay and resign. That showed the need for \" some decision, sooner rather than later, on my part, \" wuerl writes. Noting abuse survivors \" have personally suffered so much, \" his letter adds non-victims \" have also been wounded by the shame of these terrible actions and have questions about their bishop's ability to provide the necessary leadership. \" the letter doesn't say whether wuerl will ask the pope to accept his resignation, however.

        "summary": "President obama unveiled sweeping actions on immigration reform last night, and while the civil unrest sen. Tom coburn warned of hasn't materialized, it's safe to say congressional republicans are deeply unhappy. Obama criticized republicans for failing to act and dared them to \" pass a bill, \" but the forceful actions gop congressional leaders have promised in response are not expected to include immigration reform. More: incoming senate majority leader mitch mcconnell promised a tough response when the gop majority takes office next year, but he didn't spell out any specific actions, politico reports. Obama needs to understand that if he \" acts in defiance of the people and imposes his will on the country, congress will act, \" mcconnell says. \" we're considering a variety of options. But make no mistake. When the newly elected representatives of the people take their seats, they will act. \" possible actions include a lawsuit against the white house or choking off funding to federal agencies. House speaker john boehner was among many republicans who warned that obama's order will make it tougher to reach compromise on other reforms. \" by ignoring the will of the american people, president obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left, \" boehner said in a statement. \" his ' my way or the highway ' approach makes it harder to build the trust with the american people that is necessary to get things done on behalf of the country. \" the immigration order not only sets the gop against obama, it raises the prospect of yet more intra-gop conflict, with some conservatives demanding a government shutdown, reports the washington post. \" the president wants to see an angry and intemperate response, thinking the republicans will do something that leads to a shutdown, \" says rep. Charlie dent from pennsylvania. \" don't take the bait, and don't have a hysterical reaction. We can be strong, rational, and measured. \" democrats were broadly in support of the move to defer deportation for millions, but many called it just the first step in a process that should be completed by congress, the hill reports.

That gibes with the report of a cabin owner who checked his place and found that somebody had gotten into his alcohol, polishing off half a bottle of gin and leaving other bottles on the table. It might have been a birthday bash: matt had turned 49 the day before he was killed. His final days clearly weren't pleasant, however. The state of his body made clear that he'd been exposed to the elements, and — this part is a little gross — his soiled underwear suggests he'd been sick, maybe the result of consuming bad food or water. What's more, cnn reports that when troopers finally zeroed in on him, after a motorist reported a gun shot, it was a telltale cough that gave him away. They heard the sound in the woods, spotted matt, and ordered him to raise his hands. Authorities say that while matt didn't shoot at troopers — he had a shotgun — he also failed to comply with their order, and so they opened fire.

            "We ask if the 2012 rape and murder of a new delhi student changed attitudes in a land that has long favoured its sons. The first anniversary of a fatal gang rape in india has been stirring fresh debate on women's rights. The savage sexual assault in december 2012 shook the nation, and the world, setting in motion nationwide protests and much soul-searching about attitudes towards women. The 23-year-old victim suffered appalling injuries at the hands of six men, after being attacked on a bus while travelling home with a friend. I do not feel so unsafe in travelling in busses, or walking, anymore. I have developed confidence in the people around, not much in the security forces but in the people around me … i would say [ that ] what has happened is that people have come out to the streets … there has been an expression that this cannot go on, and i think that is now contributing to women like me, even younger women, to start to feel a little more confident that they can protest against harassment, and they expect that people will understand and will support.

        "summary": "The state of louisiana's refusal to install air conditioning on death row has already cost taxpayers at least $ 1,067,000 in expenses fighting a lawsuit filed on behalf of three inmates with medical problems, according to records obtained by the ap. Meanwhile the state could spend roughly the same money — and possibly much less — on an ac system that would satisfy a federal judge's order to protect death row inmates from dangerous heat and humidity inside louisiana state penitentiary at angola. This tally, based on state documents provided in response to the ap's public records requests, is the first public accounting of how much the case has cost taxpayers. Most of the money has gone to private attorneys on opposing sides of the case, which us district judge brian jackson says could ultimately cost many more millions of dollars, and expert witnesses and state contractors also have received tens of thousands of dollars. More than two years have passed since jackson ruled louisiana imposes unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment once the heat index exceeds 88 degrees. The index routinely crosses that threshold on death row, occasionally exceeding 100 degrees; plaintiff james magee said it's like a \" sauna \" in the morning and an \" oven \" in the afternoon. A plaintiffs ' expert estimated it would cost about $ 225,000 — sans engineering fees or operating costs — to install ac on death row's six tiers. A state engineer in 2014 said nine ac units could cool all eight tiers in the 10-year-old building that holds death row, with a state attorney saying each unit would cost \" several thousand dollars. \" state attorneys argue installing ac would spawn more suits from prisoners nationwide demanding cooler cells. Jackson is set to hear testimony wednesday on whether the state's current heat remediation measures — one cold shower a day, ice chests in the cells, and fans outside — are adequately protecting the plaintiffs as louisiana's sweltering summer approaches.",

        "summary": "After a months-long investigation, an alabama mom has been charged with murder: prosecutors in westchester county, ny, say lacey spears poisoned her 5-year-old son through a feeding tube, likely in an effort to gain sympathy on social media. She \" was intentionally feeding her son salt in toxic levels, \" said a district attorney in court yesterday, where spears pleaded not guilty. Her charges include second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter; prosecutors aren't arguing that she meant to kill her son garnett, but they say she behaved without regard for his life, the journal news reports. There was no medical explanation when his sodium levels soared, and prosecutors say spears had done online research into how salt affects one's health, cbs 2 reports. The case may be among the first to grapple with the psychiatric disorder munchausen by proxy in the internet age: spears posted updates about her son's frequent illnesses on facebook. She told friends he needed to be fed through a tube, but they regularly saw him eat solid foods. Police believe spears may have poisoned him more than once, and the investigation began even before he died on jan. 23. When he did, she initially got sympathy, the journal news notes. But some who know her now tell the paper they're not surprised at the charges. \" i really wish we could have prevented this because there were signs, \" says one. \" she put all over facebook how wonderful she was. She had us all snowed. \" the murder charge carries a sentence of 25 years to life. Click for more on the lies spears reportedly told.",

A study finds that 30 % to 50 % of the water found in our taps and oceans contains molecules created more than 4.5 billion years ago — making them older than our solar system and the sun, the los angeles times reports. The findings from the study, published in science, indicate that certain water molecules contain a deuterium atom instead of a hydrogen atom ( making what's called \" heavy water \" ), which could only be created under very cold, energy-replete conditions — specific conditions that didn't exist before the earth, sun, and solar system were formed. Earth was actually \" born dry, \" in an extremely hot environment, according to the times. Scientists believe we eventually received water via comets or asteroids that crashed down on earth's surface. Figuring out where the water in the comets and asteroids came from, however, is another story, though researchers think they've narrowed it down to two possibilities: that the heavy deuterium water was dispersed among bodies in the solar system during the \" violent \" process of our sun's birth, or that the heavy water originated from ice found in the gas cloud from which our sun and solar system were born. Either way, researchers say this could indicate that young planets all around the universe contain water: according to scientists, there are up to 11 billion planets outside our own system that could house liquid water and, possibly, life, notes time.

While you next take a sip, ponder this, too: the fact that earth's water is so old bodes well for our hunt for wet environments — and, for life — elsewhere in the universe. Life on earth owes everything to the presence of liquid water here, but, even so, scientists don't have definitive answers for how or when the water got here — or, for that matter, when the water itself was formed. The new research seeks to answer that last question: was our water made before the sun existed, brewed in the same cloud of dust from which the sun would form? or did water come later, forming as the earth also formed? as the washington post explains, during the sun's birth a band of unused space dust gathered like skirt hems around it. Such material, called the protoplanetary disk, would go on to form the solar system's planets. Scientists know that water accompanied the sun's birth but wondered if it might have been destroyed in the process of the sun's formation, leaving earth to go it alone in stirring up its own water. To find out if the water from that dust cloud made it to earth, researchers measured the ratio of deuterium, or heavy hydrogen to hydrogen. The findings show that heavy hydrogen levels on earth are higher than they would have been in the protoplanetary disk. That means that some of our water must predate the sun, when heavy hydrogen was in abundance. So, if water can survive a star's birthing process, and if other solar systems in the universe formed much like ours did, that means that water might be a common ingredient in the making of other planets far from our own. \"by identifying the ancient heritage of earth's water, we can see that the way in which our solar system was formed will not be unique, and that exoplanets will form in environments with abundant water, \" said tim harries, a professor at the university of exeter's physics and astronomy department, in england, and an author of",

Here's what people are saying: if director brian helgeland's \" intention was to tell jackie's story in a linear, paint-by-numbers fashion, he has achieved that goal, \" writes james berardinelli at reelviews. \" the film takes no chances and does nothing bold. \" still, he gives it a decent score, saying it's \" a worthwhile sports movie \" that \" evokes powerful emotions \" thanks to its compelling story. Ao scott at the new york times has a more charitable take, writing that helgeland \" has honorably sacrificed the chance to make a great movie in the interest of making one that is accessible and inspiring. \" the film is pure hero-worship. \" it is blunt, simple, and sentimental, using time-tested methods to teach a clear and rousing lesson. \" in the process, it gives younger viewers an unflinching look at the ugly \" world their grandparents were born into. \" \" chadwick boseman is perfect as robinson, \" gushes stephen whitty at the star-ledger. \" he captures, in a clenched jaw or a sidelong glance, a lifetime's worth of dearly attained dignity. \" harrison ford, meanwhile, might get a supporting actor nod; \" it is the first time in years i have seen ford have fun onscreen. \" sure, the movie is \" thick with hollywood cliches … but that doesn't mean it won't make you feel good. \" wesley morris at grantland complains that the movie is a little too reverential. Robinson doesn't have to change, \" white america does. That's great for messaging, but hell on drama. \" it's the white characters who evolve, not the saint wearing 42. \" having an actor play robinson makes sense for realism, but most of the time a piece of cardboard with robinson's likeness would have done the trick. \"",

Enter the nokia 8 and its \" bothie. \" nokia's attempt to compete with samsung and apple in the high-end smartphone market hits stores in europe in september. Wired reports the nokia 8 is standard stuff for a high-end smartphone; it's got 64 gigs of storage, 4 gigs of ram, a 5.3-inch screen, and so on. And the verge came away fairly unimpressed by the phone, calling it \" average, \" especially compared to what apple apparently has planned for its new phone. The one thing the nokia 8 does have, and what it could live or die on, is the bothie. The bothie uses dual sight technology to let users take photos or videos using both the front and rear cameras at the same time, the guardian explains. The resulting video or image shows whatever is in front of the user alongside the user's reaction to it. Those photos and videos can then be shared directly to facebook or youtube. Wired calls the bothie the nokia 8's \" only truly unique feature, \" meaning the phone was made \" for the youtubers and instagrammers of the world. \" and they ' ll have to embrace the bothie if nokia has any chance of competing with apple and samsung. Meanwhile, the future of the american bothie is unclear, as nokia has not announced plans to bring the phone to the us.",

The members of the campus group feminists united say they've received so many abusive threats online that they feel unsafe on their own campus, and they accuse the school of doing too little to protect them. Last month, one of their members was killed, allegedly by a male roommate, though authorities have made no links between the yik yak threats and the death of grace rebecca mann. Yik yak is popular on college campuses because it allows users within a relatively small area to post and receive anonymous messages on their phones. Members of the feminists ' group say they've endured cyber-stalking and repeated threats of rape and murder, in particular after two incidents: they spoke out against allowing frats on campus because of concerns over sexual abuse, and they got the rugby team suspended over an abusive chant. ( mann's accused killer is a former rugby player. ) afterward, the yik yak threats came pouring in. \"it created an increasing level of fear and anxiety, \" says attorney lisa banks. \"they had no way to know if people who were posting messages were sitting next to them in class or walking next to them on campus. \" the school says it has investigated all threats of violence, and yik yak says it is working to curb hate speech on its service, reports the washington post",

The company has encouraged subscribers to use devices like fitbit and jawbone — and even has its own activelink device. But while use of such devices soar ( venturebeat in november pointed to research that estimated 19 million trackers were in use in 2014, with that number slated to triple by 2018 ), weight watchers ' membership keeps falling. It sank 15 % in q4 to a hair over 2.5 million subscribers, who pay a minimum of $ 20 for the service; bloomberg points out that once a user invests in a tracker, the associated tracking apps are free. In early 2013, weight watchers didn't seem concerned by wearable devices. It acknowledged a challenge \" similar to what we saw back in 2000 with the low-carb diet fad \" a few months later. Now it's taking a hit: revenue slid 10 % to $ 327.8 million in the fourth quarter, and as of yesterday its share price had declined 78 % over three years. It expects profit of 40 cents to 70 cents per share in 2015, while analysts had estimated profit of $ 1.43 per share, the wall street journal reports. The company has announced a deal with humana to bring discounted diet programs to certain health insurance plans, which an analyst suggests is the company's best option, but it will also undergo cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, to save $ 100 million.

Juniper analysts expect fitness to remain the dominant segment in wearable devices until that time, pushed ahead by new fitness use cases, new biometrics measurements, and lower prices. But from now until 2018, the smartwatch category will be gaining steam and by 2018 will take over as the most-worn wearable device. This movement will begin in earnest with the launch of apple's long awaited watch, which is expected to show up on the market in the first half of 2015. Apple reportedly expects to sell 15 million of the devices in the first year. If this happens, smartwatch sales would overwhelm fitness tracker sales far sooner that 2018, as juniper predicts.

The government also wants to keep the cartels from regrouping after the loss of key leaders, federal police spokesman alejandro poire said wednesday. But poire gave no details on the operation, saying only that there will be a \" significant \" increase in forces. He answered no questions at a media briefing with mexico security officials and the two state governors, and the government later said it would not provide numbers for its forces now in the area or the level after the reinforcements because of security reasons. Intense cartel violence has gripped nuevo leon in and around the industrial, high-tech hub of monterrey, once one of mexico's safest large cities. Bloodshed also is high across all of tamaulipas, which shares a 560-mile ( 900-kilometer ) border with texas",
            "Reporting from mexico city — mexican authorities wednesday announced they had arrested the new leader of the drug gang formerly run by suspected kingpin edgar \" la barbie \" valdez villarreal. The arrest late tuesday of carlos montemayor marked a fresh blow against the remnants of the once-formidable beltran leyva gang, battered by arrests, deaths and vicious internal fighting. Mexican federal police said montemayor took over the faction once led by valdez, a u.s. Citizen arrested in august. The in-fighting has stoked months of killings and beheadings across the states of morelos and guerrero, home to the resort city of acapulco. Ramon eduardo pequeno, head of the anti-drug division of the federal police, told reporters that montemayor had said that 20 mexican men who disappeared in acapulco in late september were seized and killed in a case of mistaken identity."

Hugh laurie also jumped on the anti-trump allusion train, hinting that this may be the last golden globes show because of the new administration's distrust of celebrities and noting he was accepting his best supporting actor award for the night manager \" on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere, \" the hill reports. Fallon himself noted, per mediaite, that \" many people [ had been ] wondering what it would be like if king joffrey [ from game of thrones ] had lived. Well, in 12 days we're gonna find out. \" he also announced the night's votes had been tabulated by the \" accounting firm of ernst, young, and putin \" and told the crowd that the globes are \" one of the few places left where america still honors the popular vote, \" people reports. The night's host couldn't resist a callback to the show's opening teleprompter issues, incorporating the ongoing mariah carey new year's eve saga to make his point. \" i just got off the phone with mariah carey and she thinks that dick clark productions sabotaged my monologue, \" he said, per us weekly. The new york daily news recaps some of fallon's other zingers. Amy schumer and goldie hawn appeared as the \" golden globes comedy duo we never knew we needed, \" per e! online, to present the award for best performance by an actor in a motion picture, musical, or comedy. Hawn turned on the loopiness while schumer played the straight one, with goldie using the word \" mystical \" instead of \" musical \" and announcing the \" nominees of the five most tainted men \" instead of the five most \" talented \" ones. \" kurt, do you have her glasses? \" schumer asked hawn's partner, kurt russell, who was sitting in the audience. Two other comedians also made an impact at the awards show, but their turn was more of the \" hilariously dark \" version, per people.

Five senior police investigators discovered their voicemail had likely been hacked in 2006, soon after scotland yard began its initial investigation into the matter, the new york times reports. And the revelation raises some sticky questions, like: could this have caused investigators to ease up on the tabloid out of fear their private lives would be exposed? members of parliament will question several police officials today to determine whether the hacking impacted the police inquiry, which was initially very limited, and whether those hacked experienced a conflict of interest. Former prime minister gordon brown today accused murdoch's media empire, specifically the sunday times, of hiring \" known criminals \" to gather personal details about his bank account, legal files, and taxes, the new york times reports. Brown also believes the paper somehow got access to his son's medical records and passed it along to the sun, a source says. Meanwhile, more reports are emerging that police officers were bribed for information on brown, the royal family, and others, and that money was spent to secure a copy of the green book, which details the queen and prince charles ' activities.

Employees to $ 9 in june 2014 and $ 10 in june 2015, after the white house said the minimum wage for federal contract workers would be raised to $ 10.10 an hour in 2015.

        "summary": "\" on the face of the evidence, there is concern that is raised about this officer's conduct, \" says salt lake county district attorney sim gill. Many of the people who have racked up nearly 3 million views of the video that shows detective jeff payne arresting university of utah hospital nurse alex wubbels would likely agree. Gill on friday called for a criminal investigation into the encounter, in which payne handcuffed a screaming wubbels after she refused to permit a blood draw from an unconscious patient — as she was right to do, according to law, because payne had neither a warrant nor the consent of the patient, who was not under arrest. The salt lake tribune reports payne was put on administrative leave friday afternoon, along with a second unnamed officer connected to the july 26 incident. More: mayor jackie biskupski and chief mike brown both called wubbels to apologize. Per the city, the unified police department will begin a criminal probe into the matter, and an internal affairs investigation will be conduced as well. The tribune also offers more background on the patient in question: william gray, a 43-year-old who was driving a semi when a 26-year-old who was trying to evade the utah highway patrol crashed into gray head-on. That driver was killed, and a police official explains it's typical to get blood draws of those involved in fatal crashes, even if they aren't suspected of wrongdoing. The ap cites payne's police report, in which he wrote he was trying to avoid a \" scene \" by taking wubbels outside and that this his boss told him to arrest her if she didn't cooperate with the draw. Wubbels ' attorney says the nurse was left in a hot police car for 20 minutes before the detective realized the hospital had already drawn the patient's blood as part of treatment. The tribune notes that while the video may suggest payne was demanding wubbels draw gray's blood, payne is actually one of a handful of officers certified to draw blood in accident cases, and was looking to draw the blood himself.",

Now, another boat has been found just 45 miles north of the first, and it also held eight — except all are dead. The 23-foot wooden \" ghost ship \" was discovered sunday on a beach near oga. It had no navigational devices and had lost a rotor blade. Some aboard had been \" reduced to bones, \" and kyodo news reports that the coast guard suspects it originated in north korea, which sits about 450 miles away. Sky news reports foreign ships aren't an uncommon occurrence in japan: 44 have washed ashore this year; 66 did so in 2016. The bbc presents a theory as to why: some believe north korea has been calling for more seafood to be fished in order to feed a hungry population. The increased demand may be leading its citizens to take boats that are in subpar condition far off its shores. And as a professor with japan's tokai university tells sky news, the sea of japan \" starts to get choppy when november comes. It gets dangerous when northwesterly winds start to blow. \" kyodo notes the boat that carried the eight live men has vanished; police are reviewing both cases. ( this ghost ship was found gutted by fire. )",

Developments: audio, transcript: the times released excerpts from the interview, as well as audio here. It's not clear what trump meant in saying that the newspaper set up corker, but the transcript makes clear that corker knew he was on the record, notes cnn.

And it's why last week's news reduced the odds of the gop retaining its majority from a good bet to even money. \" ulterior motives? pascal-emmanuel gobry of the week calls corker a hypocrite for his sudden public turn on the president and suggests that the retiring senator is positioning himself to be an \" establishment \" primary challenger to the president in the 2020 election. Now what? james fallows at the atlantic writes that if corker truly believes trump might blunder his way into world war iii, he has an obligation to \" do something about it \" by providing a crucial check on trump's actions through his position as chair of the foreign relations committee. \" talk is better than nothing, but action is what counts. \" wsj weighs in: the conservative editorial page of the wall street journal thinks corker spoke the truth about the president's \" lack of discipline, short fuse, narcissism and habit of treating even foreign heads of state as if they are rosie o'donnell, \" and it hopes other top republicans follow corker's lead because it might actually help.

        "summary": "Scientists have discovered a talent never seen outside of humans in a small australian bird: the ability to string sounds together to convey different meanings. Essentially, \" it's a very basic form of word generation, \" researcher andy russell tells the bbc. The team started out by listening to chestnut-crowned babbler birds. Rather than sing, they produce \" discrete calls made up of smaller, acoustically distinct individual sounds, \" an expert says in a press release. Two sounds, identified as \" a \" and \" b, \" kept getting repeated. For example, the birds used an \" ab \" call to tell other birds where they were while in flight ( listening birds would look to the sky ), while a \" bab \" call told chicks it was feeding time ( listening birds would look at nests ). Rearranging the sounds of the flight call to produce the latter call showed no alteration in the birds ' behavior, and vice versa, proving the individual sounds were in fact the same. \" although the two babbler bird calls are structurally very similar, they are produced in totally different behavioral contexts and listening birds are capable of picking up on this, \" a researcher explains. Russell adds, per the christian science monitor, the babblers may communicate this way because it's easier to swap existing sounds than make up new ones. What's perhaps most fascinating is that researchers believe the birds ' \" b \" sound differentiates the meaning of the call. In other words, it's the \" c \" that discerns the words \" cat \" and \" at \" in the english language. Such distinguishing elements are called phonemes, and this basic example \" might help us understand how the ability to generate new meaning initially evolved in humans, \" an expert says. \" it could be that when phoneme structuring first got off the ground in our hominid ancestors, this is the form it initially took. \" russell says the ability likely exists in other animals. ( learn why these \" bachelor \" birds could save their species. )",

        "summary": "Los angeles county homicide detectives have reopened an investigation into the 30-year-old mystery of actress natalie wood's death. The star's 1981 drowning was ruled an accident. But her last evening, which she spent on a yacht with husband robert wagner and movie co-star christopher walken, has long been the subject of speculation. Law enforcement officials have now decided to take another look at the case after receiving fresh information, and they plan to interview the boat's captain about comments he made about the case recently, the los angeles times reports. In the captain's book goodbye natalie, goodbye splendour, he recalls that on the night she drowned, wood was drinking and taking quaaludes with wagner and walken. An argument erupted between the two men, apparently over wood, followed by shouting between the couple in their room — and thumps, according to the captain.

Last week, a worker at the midway atoll national wildlife refuge — wisdom's home in the north pacific — saw the mother caring for a new chick, according to a press release. And it's a feat she's managed for each of the past seven years, livescience notes. For comparison, most laysan albatrosses live between 12 and 40 years, per the us fish &amp; wildlife service. Wisdom first came to the attention of researchers while incubating an egg... In 1956. She was tagged then, and has likely raised no fewer than 30 chicks in her lifetime. Wisdom's \" ability to continue to hatch chicks during the last half century is beyond impressive \" given \" the threats that albatross face at sea, \" says a biologist. Chief among those threats: tsunamis. Battered by five-foot waves in the wake of japan's 2011 earthquake, some 2,000 adult albatrosses on midway's islands were estimated to have died; wisdom obviously survived. And she's racked up many such feats, says the refuge manager. Among them: she's \" logged literally millions of miles over the pacific ocean in her lifetime to find enough fish eggs and squid to feed herself and multiple chicks. \" ( we noted last year that the second-oldest albatross known to hatch a chick was 61. )",

Pistorius never once said the shooting was an accident because he \" intended to kill, \" nel said, per the guardian. Nel noted that given the lack of imminent attack, pistorius is still guilty of murder even if he did believe steenkamp to be an intruder. Nel also drew attention to the contents of steenkamp's stomach, which indicate she ate hours after pistorius said the pair went to bed, and other inconsistencies in the runner's testimony. \" all these lies caught him up, \" nel said. He also noted the defense never tried to disprove the claim that a neighbor heard a woman's raised voice an hour before the gunshots. As to the defense's claim that pistorius'screams sound like a woman's, nel said there is a recording of pistorius screaming but the defense didn't present it because it doesn't support their version of events.

        "summary": "Uganda's harsh new anti-gay law — which makes \" aggravated homosexuality \" punishable by life in prison — is costing the country: the us yesterday cut aid to uganda over it, and didn't stop there. It slapped visa restrictions on ugandans believed by the us to have been involved in human rights violations or corruption, the ap reports; a planned national institutes of health meeting will be moved from uganda to south africa; and a planned military exercise with uganda has been axed. Among the aid cuts: $ 2.4 million that was meant to fund a ugandan community policing program has been halted, and $ 3 million planned to fund a national public health institute will be reallocated to another unnamed african country. The moves \" reinforce our support for human rights of all ugandans regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, \" the white house said in a statement, according to reuters. But a government spokesperson in uganda was unswayed: \" uganda is a sovereign country and can never bow to anybody or be blackmailed by anybody on a decision it took in its interests, even if it involves threats to cut off all financial assistance, \" he says. And uganda has experienced more than threats: before yesterday's announcement it had already seen $ 118 million in aid from western donors pulled. The us will continue its involvement in the hunt for joseph kony, cnn notes.",
