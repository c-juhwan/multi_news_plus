        "summary": "Harriet krzykowski felt abandoned — and terrified. A new counselor at dade correctional institution's mental-health ward in 2010, the then-30-year-old heard about guards taunting and starving inmates, so she told her superior. That's when guards began abandoning krzykowski in areas packed with potentially dangerous prisoners. \" it scared the hell out of me, \" she tells the new yorker. She realized how risky it was to complain about abuse at the florida prison, where workers relied on guards for safety. So like most other counselors, krzykowski said nothing when inmates were periodically tortured and beaten in the run-down, mildewed, cockroach-ridden facility. Then, in 2012, guards killed schizophrenic darren rainey by hosing him down with 180-degree water in a locked shower stall. Krzykowski still kept quiet, but encouraged a prisoner to cope with rainey's death by writing about it in his diary. The prisoner later filed complaints about the killing, which led to miami herald reports and a lawsuit that forced changes at dade, like a new camera system and improved guard training — though one source says prisoners there still get poor treatment. Now the justice department is investigating whether there's a wider abuse pattern in florida prisons. Caught in the middle are people like krzykowski, who quit dade in 2013 and lost most of her hair from stress. \" there was one particular night i couldn't sleep because i was crying too hard, thinking, oh, my god, all this time has gone by and i didn't say anything, \" she says. \" these guys are still suffering. They're still there. Why didn't i do more? \" ( an ex-riker's island inmate says two years of solitary ruined her life. )",

        "summary": "After taking grief for saying the us lacks a strategy in the fight against the islamic state, president obama sought to fix that yesterday by lining up nine nations at the nato summit in a new coalition. The other nine are britain, australia, canada, denmark, france, germany, italy, poland, and turkey, reports the bbc. As the guardian points out, one key weakness is that only one muslim nation — turkey — is in the mix, which is why john kerry will head to the middle east to try to add more before a un security council meeting later this month. For obama, the strategy \" echoes the war on terror developed by his predecessor, george w. Bush, more than a decade ago, \" observes the new york times. Obama's plan: \"you initially push them back, you systematically degrade their capabilities, you narrow their scope of action, you slowly shrink the space, the territory that they may control, you take out their leadership. \" for now, that means continued airstrikes — though not in syria, at least for now — and more support for groups fighting isis in iraq and syria. Success will likely hinge on the arab component: getting a government in place in iraq, and then convincing leaders in baghdad to cooperate with nations such as saudi arabia and qatar, writes doyle mcmanus at the la times. But he sees it as a \" sensible beginning — and an important test of whether us military intervention with a light footprint can be made to work. \"",

        "summary": "Two sets of male crickets on neighboring hawaiian islands have been able to avoid attracting deadly parasitic flies by simply shutting up. The crickets likely arrived from oceania in the late 1990s, and the flies came from north america around the same time. When the crickets tried to lure nearby females with their evening serenades — the chirping sound produced by scraping one wing across the other — they unwittingly attracted the new predators, pregnant flies who would spray maggots onto their backs. The fly larvae would then burrow into the crickets, grow, and emerge victorious a week later, with nothing but cricket carcasses in their wake. But, scientists were surprised to discover, the cricket wings changed shape to stop producing sound over the course of just 20 generations. In other words, \" in what appears to be the blink of an eye in evolutionary time, \" the lead researcher tells the bbc. Even more remarkably, scientists also found that the adaptation happened differently and independently, but almost simultaneously, in the populations on kauai and oahu, reports nature — the phenomenon is known as \"convergent evolution. \" and though many of the crickets are now chirpless, they are doing something right; the so-called \"flatwing \" populations on both kauai and oahu are still alive and procreating, while the flies will have to devise a new way to find them. As for how the chirpless crickets find mates? they hang around the few crickets that still chirp, and then steal away some of the females that come calling.

Police raided the mountainside cabin where the fugitive had holed up, and authorities say \" charred human remains \" were discovered after the cabin was torched, the new york times reports, adding that they are very likely dorner's. Still, police plan a forensic identification. The raid near big bear, calif., came after a furious gunfight in which one deputy was killed and another wounded, reports the los angeles times, bringing to four the number of people believed to have been killed by the fugitive. Tv news footage showed the cabin engulfed in flames, reports cnn, and police reported hearing a single gunshot from inside as they closed in. Today's developments got their start when two people — reports have conflicted on whether they were a married couple or maids — entered a cabin that was supposed to be empty and instead encountered dorner, who tied them up and fled in a car stolen from the cabin. One of the two managed to call police, who were soon on the lookout. Dorner apparently ditched that first car at one point and stole another, and he had two separate chases with fish and wildlife officers. Eventually he crashed and fled by foot into the second cabin in the san bernardino mountains. \" hundreds of rounds \" of gunfire were exchanged in about a half-hour, police say, and that's apparently when the two deputies were hit. The wounded deputy does not have life-threatening injuries.",

But in colorado springs in 1996, things actually got much worse from there for brad pitman, the father of a 4-year-old girl hurt so badly she required five surgeries, per the gazette. Through a convoluted series of events, suspicion was cast on pitman; though he was never arrested, he ended up being denied parental rights to his daughter and then-6-month-old son. But in 2014, a federal grant supplied the resources needed to add old physical fingerprint cards from around the country to a national database — and pitman's name was cleared as a result. A handprint found on a kitchen window after the girl's rape matched up with joel market, a man who lived less than a mile away at the time, reports kdvr. \" i might not have went to jail, but i've been in prison for 20 years, \" says pitman, 44, whose family still wants nothing to do with him. The crime took place in june 1996, two weeks after pitman and his wife had separated. The girl's screams woke her mother, who called pitman; he rushed over. In an interview, the girl described the perpetrator as a stranger. But in february 1997, she said her dad \" hurted me. \" cops determined there was no way pitman could have assaulted his daughter and driven to his apartment in time to answer his wife's call, but social workers insisted that he participate in a \" sex offender evaluation \" and \" take responsibility for the... Abuse. \" he said he wouldn't, and the el paso county department of human services had his parental rights terminated. Market was sentenced to 24 years for the crime in january.",

And while it's too early to conclude that alcohol consumption causes skin cancer, researchers report in the british journal of dermatology that there's a clear association between how much someone drinks and how likely they are to get non-melanoma skin cancers. These malignancies are directly linked to ultraviolet radiation and are the most common cancer types in the us and some of the most common in the world. In 2014, for instance, hugh jackman made headlines for having multiple malignancies removed from his nose and urging people to wear sunscreen. For this review, researchers analyzed findings from 13 studies about basal cell carcinoma ( bcc ) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma ( cscc ), and found that for every extra 10 grams of alcohol consumed per day, the risk of developing bcc goes up by 7 % and cscc by 11 %. ( there are 28 grams in an ounce. ) \" this is an important finding given that there are few ways to prevent skin cancer, \" senior author dr. Eunyoung cho says in a press release.

Images released saturday by the beauval zoo south of paris show mother huan huan enveloping the cub and zoo handlers feeding it in an incubator with a small bottle. The pink, hairless male weighing 5 ounces is tiny compared to its 190-pound mother. She bore twins friday, but the firstborn was too weak to survive. Reuters has this statement from the zoo: \" the first baby came quickly and huan huan held it against her and licked it clean. The second followed 14 minutes later. Huan huan abandoned the first and looked after the second. \" xinhua reports this is the natural behavior: female pandas living in the wild opt to raise the cub that has the best chance of survival. Huan huan and partner yuan zi are on a 10-year loan from china. Panda births are closely watched because they remain rare — there are only about 1,800 pandas in the wild in china and about 400 in captivity worldwide, reports the ap. Reuters reports huan huan and yuan zi's offspring will be sent to china once they reach the age of two or three.",

They told residents they can't arrest anyone for a misdemeanor unless they actually witness said misdemeanor, but that residents who witness wrongdoing are welcome to put bieber under citizen's arrest, law enforcement sources say. Tmz's previous stories make it clear just how awful it must be to live near bieber: four of the complaints cops received over the weekend were for loud music on the roof between 8: 30pm and 3am, and each time, bieber was not cited because he said he'd turn it down. He moved to the building — renting both the penthouse and a non-connecting unit on the floor below it — last month, apparently opting for two units so he'd have room for his entourage, sources say. Neighbors quickly complained to both police and the homeowner's association about noise and the smell of marijuana, and the hoa decided earlier this month to hire security guards to work between 6pm and 8am to keep bieber and his entourage under control.",

The brothers took the man's mercedes suv and forced him to come along.

        "summary": "It now takes 100,000 signatures to get an official white house response to a we the people petition — and angry cell phone users got more than 114,000 after it became illegal to unlock your cell phone on jan. 26. That's the day the librarian of congress ruled that unlocking is a copyright violation, even if it's done after any contract with a carrier has expired, and punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. The petition demanded the decision be rescinded, and the white house agrees, politico reports. \" consumers should be able to unlock their cell phones without risking criminal or other penalties. In fact, we believe the same principle should also apply to tablets, which are increasingly similar to smart phones, \" reads the official response. And as far as using that unlocked phone on a different network, the response continues: \" if you have paid for your mobile device, and aren't bound by a service agreement or other obligation, you should be able to use it on another network. It's common sense, \" and crucial for competition and consumer choice. ( the national journal, however, sees that \" if you... Aren't bound by a service agreement \" as a big caveat. ) politico points out that it's not clear the white house can actually do anything to reverse the decision, but the library of congress responded to the white house statement saying it is willing to reconsider. The fcc also issued its own statement backing legal unlocking and urging congress to overturn the ruling, the new york times reports.",

            "Photo washington — for a decade consumers have been able to keep their cellphone numbers even if they switched their wireless carriers. On monday, the obama administration and the federal communications commission said consumers should also be able to switch carriers and keep their actual phones. For consumers, being able to take their iphone or any other type of handset with them when they switch carriers could make it easier to take advantage of lower rates once an initial contract is fulfilled. That might mean more price competition and more choices for cellphone customers. The administration and the f.c.c., under julius genachowski, announced that they will urge congress to overturn a ruling last year by the copyright office of the library of congress that made it illegal for consumers to unlock their cellphones, opening the software that restricts most phones from working on another carrier's network.

Allowed to trespass into a person's vehicle criminally and without permission for the seemingly singular cause of filming, a young man's dying moments, for profit, \" wrote capt.

Leandra english, who was set to become acting director after the early departure of richard cordray, filed a lawsuit sunday night to block president trump's appointment of white house budget director mick mulvaney to head the agency, the new york times reports. \" the law is clear: ms. English is acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau until the senate confirms a new director, \" attorney deepak gupta said in a statement. The lawsuit seeks an emergency restraining order against the trump appointment and a court declaration that english is the agency's director. The administration is aware of the lawsuit, but \" the law is clear: director mulvaney is the acting director of the cfpb, \" white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said sunday, per cnn. She added that the cfpb's own general counsel agrees with the administration's interpretation of the law, and slammed cordray for the \" stunt \" of appointing english as deputy director, which would make her acting director under the 2010 dodd-frank law that created the agency. The white house says mulvaney was appointed under a different law, the federal vacancies reform act. Georgetown law professor marty lederman tells the times that the administration's move is \" at the very least, contestable. \" while serving in congress, mulvaney voted to kill the watchdog agency, calling it a \" sad, sick joke. \"",

Before her appointment, she was a low-profile career civil servant who joined the agency in its infancy and rose steadily through its ranks, serving most recently as its chief of staff. She holds degrees from new york university and the london school of economics, and previously held senior positions at the office of personnel management and the office of management and budget.

And toward that end, the suit seems to be ready, per musk, who notes it's been \" already tested to double vacuum pressure. \" space attire devotees are already weighing in, with techcrunch noting the suit looks \" svelte and tight to the body, \" while engadget praises the \" simple \" design of \" minimal grey lines and patches that sit nicely alongside its traditional white coloring \"; it adds that the spacesuit was crafted by the same costume designer who worked up outfits for dc and marvel superheroes in batman vs. Superman and captain america: civil war.

            "This week's saturday night live was all over the map: lame one minute, funny the next, and at the end, there was one sketch that — well, i ' ll get to it in a little while. As host, blake lively was firmly in the plucky-not-awful tradition. It was one of those snls when you felt the rest of the cast had been enlisted to make sure the host was always surrounded by enough activity so that it wouldn't look as though she was responsible for the dull patches. She did not do her version of riverdance, which she performed so charmingly on jimmy fallon and had promised fallon's audience she'd do on snl as well.

I think it's a shame. \" the justice department did not bring charges against clinton over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and law enforcement officials have said they do not believe clinton misled investigators. \" we have no basis to conclude she lied to the fbi, \" then-fbi director james comey said during congressional testimony in july 2016. Yet flynn, who was forced out of the white house in february after less than a month on the job, pleaded guilty last week to charges of lying to the fbi about his pre-inauguration contacts with the u.s. Ambassador to russia. More: trump lawyer takes blame for flynn tweet that sparks obstruction concerns",
            "Trump responds to flynn's guilty plea president donald trump told reporters monday morning that he feels \"very badly \" for michael flynn, his onetime national security adviser who pleaded guilty last week to making a false statement to the fbi and is cooperating with the russia investigation led by special counsel robert mueller. Trump, who spoke briefly with the white house press pool before boarding marine one to begin a day trip to utah, suggested flynn has been treated unfairly compared with 2016 democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton. Story continued below \"well, i feel badly for gen. Flynn. I feel very badly. He's led a very strong life, and i feel very badly. I will say this, hillary clinton lied many times to the fbi. Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and they destroyed his life. I think it's a shame, \" trump said. \"hillary clinton on the fourth of july weekend went to the fbi, not under oath. It was the most incredible thing anyone's ever seen. She lied many times. Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied, and it's like they ruined his life. It's very unfair. \" clinton was interviewed over the fourth of july holiday weekend in 2016 as part of the fbi's investigation into her use of a"

The democrats ' 12-point margin is up 4 points from august. Other key points: good for gop: republicans are catching up in terms of voter enthusiasm. In the survey conducted sept. 16-19, 61 % of republicans had high interest in the election ( 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale ), close to the democratic figure of 65 %. Democrats had a 16-point advantage as recently as july. More on enthusiasm: seniors have the highest level of interest in the election, with 73 % at a 9 or 10 level; following are democrats ( 65 % ), whites ( 61 % ), republicans ( 61 % ), and african-americans ( 53 % ). Groups on the lower end of the scale include independents ( 37 % ) and voters age 18-34 ( 35 % ). Men vs. Women: both men and women favor democratic control, but women apparently feel much more strongly about that. They support the idea by a margin 58 % to 33 %, compared to 47 % to 43 % among men. Trump: the president \"has defied political gravity, \" says democratic pollster peter hart, who worked on the survey. \"he's created a very loyal base. \" proof: trump's approval rating remained at 44 %, and 69 % were satisfied with the economy; a plurality gave trump credit for the latter. Key demographics: the poll sees trouble spots for republicans in some important areas: the gop trails democrats among moderates and independents by more than 30 points; they trail by almost 20 points among women ages 50 and older; and they trail in competitive congressional districts by 12 points.",

Spacex yesterday unveiled its dragon v2, which is designed to carry seven astronauts to the international space station and will ultimately be able to \" land anywhere on earth with the accuracy of a helicopter, \" ceo elon musk said. Since 2011, nasa has handed the russians $ 70 million per astronaut per ride to the iss on russia's soyuz spacecraft; musk says the dragon v2 would cost more like $ 20 million per seat. Spacex is joined by boeing, sierra nevada corp., and blue origin in its development of replacements for nasa's retired space shuttle fleet, and the agency intends to pick the projects that it wants to see realized in the next few months, with an eye on a 2017 launch. As nbc news points out, spacex's dragon cargo capsules are well-acquainted with the iss — they've been making trips there since 2012. The second-generation version has the accommodations needed to carry people: seats for one, along with life support systems and a thruster system that could kick in if things go awry during the ascent. This newest capsule will also be able to autonomously dock at the iss, reports phys.org. What spacex still plans to add: legs, which would enable the dragon to land on, well, land, rather than in the sea. \" that is how a 21st-century spaceship should land, \" musk said.

The dragon v2, short for version two, is the first attempt by a private company to restore americans ' ability to send people to the orbiting space station in the wake of the space shuttle program's retirement in 2011. \" it's all around, i think, really a big leap forward in technology. It really takes things to the next level, \" said spacex ceo elon musk. Spacex is competing with other companies — including boeing, sierra nevada and blue origin — to be the first commercial outfit to take astronauts to space, possibly as early as 2017. Until then, the world's astronauts must rely on russian soyuz spacecraft at a cost of $ 70 million per seat. The dragon v2 was shown for the first time at a jam-packed evening press conference in hawthorne, california. The shiny dragon v2 sat on a white stage floor, as a scorched dragon cargo capsule was suspended above, bearing the blackened markings of a capsule that had returned to earth from orbit.

Those feelings may be soothed after hearing florida gov. Rick scott's latest news: that he's reassigned markeith loyd's case to another attorney in a nearby district, usa today reports. Instead of state attorney aramis ayala of orange county's 9th judicial circuit court handling the first-degree murder probe, state attorney brad king will be taking on the case instead after ayala refused to recuse herself, per a release from scott's office. \" these families deserve a state attorney who will aggressively prosecute markeith loyd to the fullest extent of the law, \" said scott, who added he was \" outraged \" and \" sickened \" by the murders loyd is accused of. Loyd has been hit with 11 counts of murder and firearm charges, among others, after allegedly killing his pregnant ex, sade dixon, in december, then gunning down orlando lt. Debra clayton in january, per cnn. Ayala had noted before she was kicked off the case that, after \" painstaking thought, \" she'd decided not to seek capital punishment in any cases, as she doesn't think it's effective or humane. \" the death penalty traps many victims, families in a decades-long cycle of uncertainty, \" she noted, just two days after scott signed a bill reinstituting the florida death penalty, per the sun sentinel. While human rights groups like amnesty international took ayala's side, orlando police chief john mina railed against her in a statement, noting \" heinous crimes \" like the one loyd is accused of \" are the very reason \" for capital punishment.

        "summary": "A recently uncovered pre-world war ii sketch purports to show that vincent van gogh cut off most of his left ear, not just a small part of it. And while that fact is still being debated among historians, the name of the woman who supposedly was given that ear is now being revealed, the guardian reports. The original legend has it that the troubled artist gave his severed body part to a prostitute named rachel. But now, in what the bbc is calling \" eargate, \" author bernadette murphy's new book includes documentation about a young, unnamed daughter of a farmer who lived near arles, france, and who was supposedly the recipient of the ear. Murphy writes that the girl was too young to be a prostitute and may have been a brothel maid. Van gogh reportedly gave her his ear to make her feel better after she had been bitten by a dog and treated for rabies, instructing her to \" keep this object carefully. \" murphy had promised the girl's descendants she wouldn't reveal her name, and she kept that promise in van gogh's ear: the true story. But the art newspaper did a little sleuthing and says it can id her as gabrielle berlatier, an 18-year-old whose medical records it found at the institut pasteur in paris. Berlatier was said to have been bitten by the rabid dog on jan. 8, 1888 ( van gogh cut his ear off in december of that year ), and her life was saved by a vaccine. The paper also discovered clues that suggest berlatier worked as a cleaner at a local cafe, which so happened to be owned by two of van gogh's friends. He's said to have lived in a room there in 1888 from may to september, making it possible he knew the young berlatier, and who allegedly kept the van gogh secret away from others for the rest of her own life.

Today, van gogh is regarded as an artistic genius and his masterpieces sell for record-breaking prices; however, during his lifetime, he was a poster boy for tortured starving artists and sold only one painting. Vincent willem van gogh was born on march 30, 1853, in the netherlands. He had a difficult, nervous personality and worked unsuccessfully at an art gallery and then as a preacher among poor miners in belgium. In 1880, he decided to become an artist. His work from this period – the most famous of which is the potato eaters ( 1885 ) – is dark and somber and reflective of the experiences",

        "summary": "Mark fields'tenure as ford motor ceo is coming to an end after just three years, during which the company's shares plunged 40 %. The new york times details various bumps in his road: recent safety recalls, the discarded plan to build a $ 1.6 billion plant in mexico, q1 profit down 30 % -plus year-over-year, less progress on the self-driving vehicle front than its competitors, and the fact that it's apparently \" making little, if any, money on the cars it does sell. \" fields has been with the company for 28 years, and will be replaced by jim hackett, the former ceo of office furniture maker steelcase and the current head of ford's mobility unit. Forbes reports favorably on hackett's 30 years at steelcase, but shares his recent claim to fame: while serving as the university of michigan's interim athletic director, he convinced former 49ers coach jim harbaugh to coach the school's football team. The ap recalls that fields'start in the position was a shiny one, with fields kicking off ford's shift from a traditional automaker into a \" mobility \" company, laying out plans to build autonomous vehicles and explore new services such as ride-hailing and car-sharing. Under fields, ford achieved a record pretax profit of $ 10.8 billion in 2015 after the company's new, aluminum-sided f-150 pickup went on sale. But there were rumblings that fields wasn't focusing enough on ford's core business, as popular products like the fusion sedan grew dated. The editorial director of kelley blue book suggests the challenge for hackett will be great: \" despite turning in credible profits, fields was unable to turn ford into a stock market darling, and that may well prove elusive going forward. \"",

One wildlife ecologist received threats against his family, and researchers in the field have been shot at with high-caliber rifles. \" at my university, there is nobody who will even go near \" the issue, said a sociologist at humboldt state university. Cops have conducted raids, but only bust the undocumented farm workers who work there. The emerald triangle, a tri-county area in the central valley, was once hippie heaven. But when california legalized pot for medicinal use in 1996, out-of-work loggers went into pot farming and made millions. Prices dropped as domestic supply grew, so the farms expanded — as did the environmental impact of pesticides and generators, analysts say. Not only that, weed production sucked up massive amounts of water in a drought-plagued region and devastated local salmon populations. Solutions? one environmentalist suggests fully legalizing pot so it can be regulated and grown where it's cheapest: \" it is not the growers who are a disease. They are just a symptom.

It started in november when american airlines announced it was reducing its service to cuba, the miami herald reports. According to bloomberg, american airlines cut total flights to cuba by 25 % and switched to smaller planes for some of its remaining flights. Silver airways followed suit in december. Now jetblue has announced it will be using smaller planes for its cuba flights, reducing capacity by 300 seats per day. Meanwhile, so many british tourists are flocking to cuba they're swamping the country's infrastructure, the telegraph reports. So why aren't american tourists doing the same? first, it remains technically illegal to go to cuba solely for tourism under the us embargo still in place. Most americans who now visit do so under \" people-to-people \" exchanges, one of several allowed categories. The restrictions put pressure on would-be tourists to mislead the us government — though travel experts tell bloomberg that enforcement isn't strict — and has made airlines nervous about advertising cuba as a destination. And after us flights to cuba were announced, prices on the island skyrocketed, making everything from hotels to taxis unusually expensive. Finally, because of the ongoing embargo, visitors to cuba can't use american credit cards, meaning they have to carry thousands of dollars in cash to pay for hotels and everything else.

In what was admittedly at least one-half marketing scheme from the get-go, bergün/bravuogn in switzerland on may 29 decide to instate a photography ban and a $ 5.62 fine for tourists who circumvent it, reported travel &amp; leisure. \" it is scientifically proven that beautiful holiday photos on social media make the viewer unhappy because they cannot be there themselves, \" the village tourist office announced in a statement defending the fine. Instead of drowning in your sorrow, per mayor peter nicolay, \" we cordially invite you to visit. \" but the local reports that on june 1 ( after being found funny by some and likened to north korea by others ) the town did an about-face. In a video posted to facebook that day, nicolay explains \" we have found a solution \" for the people who \" obviously \" want to take photos of all his town's beauty. \" until the friendly photography ban has officially been lifted, everyone with a camera will be given a friendly special permit. So now you can snap away! \" and even that friendly special permit won't likely be needed for long: the local reports the town's assembly will vote to do away with the ban when it next meets. That said, the smithsonian noted the move wasn't wholly unprecedented: it quotes a 2016 observer article that dives into why some popular tourist spots — among them the sistine chapel, the van gogh museum, and the state rooms of buckingham palace — don't permit the use of camera.

The no-photos policy is not limited to just england but is a worldwide phenomenon. Visitors cannot take photos in places like the sistine chapel in rome, the van gogh museum in amsterdam or inside thomas jefferson's monticello home. Some large art museums like new york's metropolitan museum of art and boston's museum of fine arts have changed their policies and now allow photography in parts of their permanent collections. However, they typically ban all photography in special exhibitions, which are often the main reason people are visiting. What gives? i decided to dig into the reasons – largely financial – that museums restrict photos. In the process, i became convinced that it's time for museums to find creative ways to satisfy people's desire to snap memories while keeping their collections funded. Why the ban is a problem photography bans block our incredible desire to visually record our lives.

The class-action complaint set into place by florida's anne cannon alleges that tele pay holds back overtime and other pay by classifying workers as independent contractors, as well as pays some employees wages well below the federally mandated $ 7.25 per hour, courthouse news service reports. Cannon alleges tele pay workers are urged by management to keep callers on the line for as long as possible via \" sexually explicit talk, \" per law360. But her suit alleges when average call times fall below six minutes, so does workers ' hourly rate, to as low as $ 4.20 per hour. The suit adds it's difficult to keep calls above that benchmark — despite a guy named \" don \" who offers tips on how to keep callers interested — as the workers field brief prank calls and experience dropped calls or other technical snafus, all of which get factored into the average; cannon calls them \" draconian measures \" to cut her paycheck, per the washington post. Cannon, who has worked for tele pay since 2008, also says she's often asked to put in more than 40 hours a week without overtime pay. And the company requires that she remain in her home and near a phone during \" certain periods of time. \" the suit covers similar claims from others over the last three years.

        "summary": "A new study out of the university of utah finds that women with either no sexual partners or one — most typically, her future spouse — before marriage are the least likely to get divorced within five years; women with 10 or more are the most. A closer look at the numbers, though, reveals what researcher nicholas h. Wolfinger reports on the institute for family studies ' blog to be a \" complicated picture of the association between sex and marital stability that ultimately raises more questions than it answers. \" that is, in part, because women who've had exactly two sexual partners before getting married are more likely to get a divorce than women who've had three to nine, and in the 1980s and ' 90s they were actually more likely to divorce than women with 10 or more sexual partners. \" in short: if you're going to have comparisons to your [ future ] husband, it's best to have more than one, \" wolfinger says in a newswise statement. In the 2000s, about 33 % of women in the 10+ category saw their marriages end by year five; that fell to 30 % for two partners, roughly 25 % for three to nine partners, and just over 20 % for one. Virgin marriages had just a 6 % divorce rate. While the takeaway of news outlets such as the federalist and christian post is that abstinence is key, the daily beast takes issue with the fact that women, not men, are \" placed under the magnifying glass when we examine the effects of premarital sex on marriage. \" indeed, wolfinger notes that the national survey of family growth, which he used, \" doesn't have full data on men's premarital sexual behavior. \" ( slept with many people? here are five ways to see where you rank. )",

But the new york times notes that obama is using the opportunity to address income inequality, which he's staked out as a key issue, using an idea some republicans have floated in the past: expanding the earned income tax credit for poor workers with children to the childless. To pay for the $ 60 billion outlay over 10 years, the budget cuts two tax breaks that benefit the wealthy. The wall street journal also believes the white house's request for $ 300 billion in new infrastructure spending, to be paid for with tax code reforms, could have some bipartisan appeal; several high-profile republicans have called for the same thing. The budget is also expected to... Call for a major redesign of the military to shift it from a ground war footing to one targeting cyberthreats from china and africa. The journal calls it one of the budget's \" few new proposals, \" but notes that republicans are skeptical because it would reduce troop levels.

Washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama will take his campaign to increase the minimum wage on the road in the coming week in an effort to build pressure on republicans who oppose the raise. Obama will appear on wednesday in new bristol, connecticut alongside four new england governors to make the case, the white house said. The president wants to increase the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour from $ 7.25, where it has been since 2009. The president will make the pitch a day after presenting his federal government budget proposal for fiscal year 2015. His budget is expected to emphasize programs aimed at speeding economic growth and creating jobs, but is not likely to be enacted in a divided congress.

Even so, obama and democrats see the issue as a way to draw a contrast between their party and republicans in an election year.

He will propose expanding a longstanding tax break to better benefit workers who are childless, which the white house estimates will help 13.5 million additional americans who hold jobs yet remain poor. The current tax break favors low-wage workers with children. Mr. Obama would offset the costs, $ 60 billion over 10 years, by ending two tax breaks for some wealthy taxpayers, as a republican house leader also recently proposed as part of a broader plan to overhaul the tax code. The changes would close loopholes that lower taxes for some self-employed professionals and investment-fund managers. The white house had recently signaled that mr.

But the boston globe reports there is now a connection with teixeira and the building: prior to 2016, teixeira worked a security job at the two-building condo complex that includes the macallen building where the engaged couple lived. The exact dates of teixeira's employment haven't been released; field purchased the 2,025-square-foot penthouse in july 2013. Teixeira's employment there surfaced during police's 2016 investigation of two bank robberies, for which teixeira served nine months; he was released in april. People quotes an email it reports was sent to macallen residents from management: \" the suspect... Did serve our community as a concierge before leaving the building on his own terms after a few short weeks. \" the globe explains doormen didn't staff the complex; palladion services, a \" concierge service, \" was in place at the time, and employees were stationed in the lobby to oversee building entry. Palladion was replaced by another concierge company in february. The ap reports officers found a knife and fake replica gun at the scene, along with a black backpack containing jewelry. Cops arrived at the penthouse after field texted a friend that there was \" a gunman in the house \"; the friend called 911. More on the crime here.",

Noting a distinct lack of data on the relationship between exercise and sex drive in men, researchers at the university of north carolina dug into the subject, and their findings may not please devoted gym rats. They report in the journal medicine &amp; science in sports &amp; exercise that light and moderate exercise is associated with higher libido, while strenuous exercise is associated with lower libido. The results were drawn from detailed questionairres about the men's exercise habits and sex lives, reports sf gate. It turns out that men who regularly engage in workouts that are particularly long or intense might not have enough reserve energy or even testosterone to want to, well, sweat between the sheets. The new york times reports that the small sample size is only of men who volunteered to fill out a highly personal questionnaire, and that it's impossible to determine whether their answers were honest or representative of a larger population of men, but the researchers hope to follow up with research that also tracks hormone levels and perhaps even sorts out just how long or strenuous exercise must be to reach a \" tipping point \" that then affects sexual desire.

South african judge thokozile masipa found the athlete not guilty of murder or premeditated murder. Sentencing will begin oct. 13, reports cnn, which says a typical sentence for culpable homicide is five to eight years. The sentence for such a crime is at the judge's discretion; technically, it could range from a suspended sentence and a fine to a maximum of 15 years in prison. The bbc's legal experts say he's likely to get seven to 10 years. Prosecutors say they ' ll decide whether to appeal after pistorius receives his sentence. He was also convicted of unlawfully firing a gun in a public place: the 2013 incident, in which his friend's gun discharged in a restaurant while pistorius was handling it, occurred weeks before steenkamp's death. That charge carries a sentence that could range from a fine to as many as five years in prison. He was acquitted on two other firearms charges, one of which was related to firing from a car's sunroof and the other of which was a count of illegal possession of ammunition in his home. In a marked departure from his dramatic courtroom behavior, pistorius \" showed no emotion \" as the judge read the formal verdicts, the ap notes, though the bbc points out that he was \" emotional \" in court yesterday.",

But now, unpublished letters plath wrote to her former therapist and friend dr. Ruth barnhouse between february 1960 and february 1963 allege a dark detail: plath wrote that hughes beat her two days before the miscarriage and also told her that he wished she were dead, reports the guardian. The ted hughes estate has responded on behalf of carol hughes, his widow, that plath's unpublished claims are \" as absurd as they are shocking to anyone who knew ted well. \" plath was treated by barnhouse after a 1953 suicide attempt. She would eventually kill herself in 1963 at the age of 30. Plath met hughes as a fulbright scholar at cambridge in 1956, and they married within months and had a daughter and son. In the letters, plath also wrote about the pain of hughes ' infidelity with their friend assia wevill in 1962. ( a few years after that, wevill killed herself and the 4-year-old daughter she had with hughes after another hughes affair, notes the monitor. Like plath, she used a gas oven. ) plath penned several poems about her miscarriage, including the line, \" already your doll grip lets go. \" smith college, her alma mater, claims ownership of the letters in a lawsuit, which will keep the collection under wraps until settled.

In indonesia, the worst-hit country with more than 170,000 deaths — 126,000 of them in aceh province alone — thousands in the provincial capital banda aceh gathered at the great mosque yesterday, which was one of the few buildings left standing after the devastation, the bbc reports. The mosque's imam praised the \" harmony and peace \" that prevailed after the disaster, which led to a peace deal to end a 30-year separatist conflict in the region. In sri lanka, the ocean queen express train will be at the center of memorial events. More than 31,000 sri lankans were killed by the tsunami, including at least 1,700 who were on the train. In thailand, where tourists from 38 countries were among the more than 5,000 dead, survivors from around the world joined a beachside service. \" i didn't expect it would touch me so much after 10 years again because i've come back every now and then in recent years, \" a german survivor who nearly lost her leg tells the ap. \" but this has been a completely different experience now connecting with all the other people. \" the freak wave — spawned by a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off the coast of sumatra — took many coastal communities completely by surprise, wiping some of them entirely off the map. One legacy of the disaster has been a tsunami early warning system in the area, the guardian reports in a look at how more than $ 6 billion in donations was spent. At many memorial ceremonies, stories of hope and cooperation after the disaster were emphasized. One such story surfaced this summer, when a girl who was 4 years old when she was washed away by the tsunami was finally reunited with her parents, who thought she died in the disaster.",

Since armstrong — the first man on the moon — was carrying the camera, \" the only moon man earthlings would see clearly would be the one who took the second steps. \" in addition to discussing the famous photo, aldrin also shared what was going through his mind when the apollo 11 crew left the moon: \" oh man, i wanna go home. \" he tells business insider: \" we were successful doing what we were sent there to do. \"",

It is possible that the crisis could continue for weeks, reports the san francisco chronicle.

They said it was necessary for public safety after engineers spotted a hole in an emergency spillway, which they feared could have failed within an hour. The water level of the massive reservoir known as lake oroville dropped monday, slightly easing fears of a catastrophic collapse. But with more storms on the horizon, crews raced to fortify heavily eroded soils where water flowed over the edge of the reservoir and carved huge channels in the earth as it gushed toward the feather river. The acting head of the state's department of water resources said he did not know if anything had gone wrong and was unaware of a 2005 report that recommended reinforcing the earthen emergency spillway with concrete for just such an event.

Now, in reaction to that decision, the state is overhauling its system, with the florida legislature sending a bill to gov. Rick scott that would mandate at least 10 out of 12 jurors recommend execution before it's able to be greenlit by a judge — not simply a majority of the jurors, as is currently required, the ap reports. Florida's supreme court put two executions on hold after the high court's ruling, and other cases across the state have also been in limbo since. The us supreme court's ruling came about because juries only hold an advisory role in execution decisions, meaning a judge could reach a different decision than a jury, even if it was a close vote. The case that the ruling was based on was that of timothy hurst, convicted of killing his manager at a florida popeyes in 1998. The jury in his case was divided almost down the middle ( seven for execution, five against ), and the judge chose execution. ( one of hurst's lawyers filed a motion last month arguing his case should be moved to a lower court that can impose a sentence of life in prison. ) florida legislators at first considered requiring the jury decision to be unanimous — florida is one of only a few states that doesn't carry that mandate — but state senators reached the 10-2 decision as a \" compromise \" with the house, which capitol news service says wanted the jury requirement to be 9-3. At least one state senator says that compromise is a mistake. \" judges are uncertain in regard to what the jury really decided, \" state sen. Geraldine thompson tells the service. \" with a unanimous verdict, they know without question that this is the will of the jury. \"",

Greg evers read from the us supreme court decision. \"a defendant has the right to have a jury, not th judge, find the fact necessary to impose a sentence of death \" read the senate criminal justice chair.

            "Florida is one step closer to having a death penalty on the books once again. The us supreme court told lawmakers in january it wanted more jury involvement in the decision to impose death. Now as mike vasilinda tells us, lawmakers are responding with legislation likely to be challenged. New death penalty legislation requires a unanimous jury to agree on at least one factor that is so heinous or cruel that it makes a crime eligible for a death. Sen. Greg evers read from the us supreme court decision. \"a defendant has the right to have a jury, not th judge, find the fact necessary to impose a sentence of death \" read the senate criminal justice chair. But the senate was closely divided on whether after the first vote, a ten-two jury recommendation was enough, or if a jury should be unanimous in a recommendation for death. Sen.

Supreme court. Bondi's office filed a document monday in the florida supreme court arguing that what is known a \" harmless error analysis \" should be conducted in the case of timothy lee hurst. An attorney for hurst filed a motion last month asking the state supreme court to send the case to a lower court for imposition of a life sentence. A challenge by hurst led the u.s. Supreme court in january to issue an 8-1 ruling that found florida's death-penalty sentencing system unconstitutional.

One animal rescue worker called the die-off a \" historic event. \" hundreds of birds, meanwhile, have also been found dead in kentucky and louisiana less than a week after thousands of blackbirds fell from the sky in arkansas, reports the new york daily news. Us investigators speculate fireworks may have triggered the bird deaths. The affected birds — largely blackbirds, starlings and jackdaws — all sleep together in large flocks. It's possible they were startled by something and flew into one another, an expert told the christian science monitor. But there were no fireworks or storms in the swedish town, notes the bbc. Bizarre die-offs are also affecting sea life. Some 40,000 dead crabs have washed ashore in the uk, 2 million fish have died in chesapeake bay and 100,000 dead drum fish washed ashore in arkansas all within a week. Officials speculate the marine die-off could be caused by unusually low temperatures. Click for more on the animal deaths.",

The mayor, who still refuses to resign despite allegations of sexual harassment from at least 14 women, yesterday responded to the attempt to recall him from office, saying that \" now is not the time to go backwards. \" but things are looking even worse for him, reports cnn, with a city councilman asking him to explain more than $ 500 in charges to his official city credit card. The charges are from the westgate hotel, which is across the street from the mayor's office, and regulars at the hotel bar say filner was often there with various women. The city councilman points out that the card also includes charges from an online reputation-management firm ( $ 3,000 ), a trip to paris ( $ 30,000 ), and a juicer ( $ 128 ).",

        "summary": "About a week into his presidency, president trump signed an executive order on ethics that would limit the work former lobbyists could do for the white house, as well as prevent white house staff from working on issues that might affect former clients or employers, politico reports. Since then, the white house has issued 14 ethics waivers covering 17 appointees working for trump and vice president pence. In comparison, president obama, who had similar ethics rules, issued 17 waivers over eight years, according to the washington post. The ap reports information on the current waivers was released by the white house on wednesday upon request by the office of government ethics. Here are some of the white house staffers freed from trump's ethics rules by waivers: under a waiver, stephen bannon, former executive chairman of breitbart news, can communicate with reporters and others at the conservative news site even in situations when other news organizations would be excluded. Kellyanne conway received a waiver that allows her to communicate and meet with former clients, which could include the american conservative union and americans for prosperity, among others. Reince priebus was given a waiver to participate in communication and meetings involving the republican national committee, of which he used to be the chairman. Another waiver covers four former lobbyists, allowing them to do government business in the same area they used to lobby: energy policy adviser micheal catanzaro is a former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry now involved in environmental regulations; tax policy adviser shahira knight is a former fidelity executive now working on taxes and retirement; economic aide andrew olmem lobbied for insurance companies and banks; and joshua pitcock, pence's chief of staff, is working in multiple areas like opioid abuse and education on which he formerly lobbied for the state of indiana.",

President donald trump's executive order on ethics has been waived at least 11 times since the administration came into office in january, according to records the white house posted online wednesday night. The waivers allow white house staffers to work on matters that could affect their former employers or clients or involve issues from which the aides would be normally be excluded because of past lobbying work. Story continued below about a week after taking office, trump signed an executive order restricting the role of lobbyists in his administration and limiting the work government employees could do relating to former clients and former employers. However, the newly disclosed waivers show how often the white house has set those rules aside in order to allow key staffers to oversee issues they worked on in the private sector. Counselor to the president kellyanne conway received a waiver that allows her to take part in \" communications and meetings involving former clients which are political, advocacy, trade, or non-profit organizations, \" the white house said.

Theranos has taken heat for what was once thought to be a revolutionary way of testing blood on just a finger prick, with allegations including shoddy qa procedures and a lack of response to complaints. Sources tell the wall street journal that both walgreens boot alliance ( parent of walgreens, which houses dozens of theranos wellness centers ) and the new york state department of health have received subpoenas asking for \" broad information \" on how theranos represented itself while pushing its technologies and how well it was developing these technologies. The journal has done much of the deep digging into theranos, including an october article that detailed its troubles. Theranos provided a memo to cnn stating the latest probes started \" following the publication of certain news articles \" and that the company \" continues to work closely with regulators and is cooperating fully. \" it also notes that an fda probe and investigations by the state health departments of arizona and pennsylvania had been \" successfully closed out. \" meanwhile, holmes appeared on the today show monday and said she was unaware of lacking oversight within her company, per ars technica. \" probably the most devastating part of this is that i thought we did [ have protocols in place ], \" she said.

The united states preventive services task force, which the new york times describes as influential, says that there's not enough evidence to make a recommendation yet, and it's calling for more research to be done to analyze the benefits and risks associated with routine pelvic exams. ( routine cervical cancer screening is still recommended. ) the exams are controversial, with the american college of physicians recommending in 2014 that doctors stop performing them as part of a woman's physical and the american academy of family physicians endorsing that recommendation. The american college of obstetricians and gynecologists still recommends the exams be given to women 21 and older each year, though pbs reports acog acknowledged tuesday that there's no evidence the exams help women who aren't displaying symptoms. Some experts say routine pelvic exams can actually cause harm; the task force notes that, for example, the exams can detect ovarian cancer — but ovarian cancer is fairly rare, meaning there are often false-positives that result in unnecessary surgeries or other follow-up procedures.

Officials will review each of the 300,000 deportation cases now in the works and proceed only with the high-priority ones. Those illegals deemed low priority, such as undocumented students, could get work permits, notes the los angeles times. \" the idea is to make sure that we are investing enforcement resources where they are best utilized, \" a white house official said. The plan also benefits the approximately 11 million illegals who aren't in the deportation system, making them less likely to get ensared by it. Predictably, hardliners faced off against immigrant advocates over the policy decision. \" in essence, the administration has declared that us immigration is now virtually unlimited to anyone willing to try to enter, \" said dan stein, president of the federation for american immigration reform.
