        "summary": "Sweden is dealing with a surprise surplus of something it didn't quite expect: men. Per the ap, the scandinavian country of 10 million now has more males than females for the first time since they started tracking such things in the mid-1700s, and this guy growth has been booming exponentially since early last year: in march 2015, there were nearly 300 more swedish men than women, according to the scb, the nation's stats agency, and that number has since stretched to 12,000. \" this is a novel phenomenon for europe, \" a university of oxford scientist says, conceding, \" we as researchers have not been on top of this. \" ( the scb had initially said in 2003 there wouldn't be a male surplus until 2050, then changed that date to 2040 in 2006 — still a huge underestimate. ) it's all based on what's known as the \" sex ratio, \" which is the number of men per 100 women. There are actually more boys than girls born in europe overall ( 105 to 100 ), but because women typically outlive their male counterparts, the sex ratio eventually tips to favor the ladies ' numbers. Other countries already have a more masculine demographic ( e.g., norway clocked more men than women in 2011 ) or are well on their way. What's interesting in sweden's case is a global factor making an impact on the population: the tens of thousands of teen refugee boys fleeing syria, afghanistan, and north africa to settle down in norse country. Some are worried about this sudden shift and what a more male-dominated society may look like. \" are people thinking about whether this could undermine the gains that have been made by swedish women over the last 150 years? \" the director of a women's program at texas a&m university says. Other educators disagree. \" hogwash, \" a politics professor at australia's monash university says, noting it matters more how each society ranks \" hyper-masculine \" gender traits such as aggression and male-dominated hierarchies — characteristics sweden traditionally downplays in support of women's rights, the ap notes.

An expert at syed's 2000 trial testified that incoming call data placed syed in baltimore's leakin park on the night of lee's death, per usa today. However, syed attorney justin brown argues the data should never have been accepted because at&t warned incoming calls weren't reliable for determining location. Court documents reveal the state will call experts who believe the cellphone evidence is in fact reliable, reports abc news. But the judge's decision also rests on an affidavit from asia mcclain, a former classmate of syed's who says she saw him at a school library around the time lee was strangled. Brown argues syed's trial lawyer violated his right to due process when she failed to contact the alibi witness; she was disbarred a year later. \" it's our position that the alibi issue all by itself is an issue strong enough to win a reversal of adnan's conviction, \" brown tells the guardian. \" but also the cell tower evidence even by itself is also strong enough to merit his sentence being vacated. \" the judge could issue an oral ruling friday, but a written ruling is more likely and could take weeks or even months.",

One of his largest tasks will be to forge a relationship with merkel, whose ideas about austerity he has railed against. He could meet with her as soon as the very day of his inauguration. From there, his schedule is packed: the g-8 summit, the nato summit, campaigning for june's parliamentary elections and, if the socialists win a majority, choosing a prime minister. This could be one of the most significant shifts in europe since the economic crisis began, the new york times notes, but the analysts expect the markets to give france a \"grace period \" to see if hollande can increase investor confidence. The ap looks back on sarkozy's unconventional presidency, charting his downfall since his first day in 2007 when he jogged up the steps of the presidential palace in shorts. Ultimately, he came to be seen as self-centered and too showy — not to mention unable to deliver on his campaign promises. Many are cheering his defeat, al-jazeera reports from bastille square, where throngs celebrated by chanting, \"sarkozy, it's over. \"",

Still, as the new york times put it, \" there is no public evidence to suggest a connection, \" which some members of the public seem to find unbearably frustrating. With no specific target for their suspicions and no easy way to find one, folks all over the blogosphere have been settling for the next best thing: making light of the sexual assault charges and smearing one of the alleged victims. By sunday, when keith olbermann retweeted bianca jagger's link to a post about the accuser's supposed cia ties -- complete with scare quotes around the word \" rape \" -- a narrative had clearly taken hold: whatever assange did, it sure wasn't rape-rape. All he did was fail to wear a rubber! and one woman who claims he assaulted her has serious credibility issues anyway. She threw a party in his honor after the fact and tried to pull down the incriminating tweets. Isn't that proof enough? the only reason the charges got traction is that, in the radical feminist utopia of sweden under queen lisbeth salander, if a woman doesn't have multiple orgasms during hetero sex, the man can be charged with rape. You didn't know? as of today, even naomi wolf -- naomi effin ' wolf! -- has taken a public swipe at assange's accusers, using her status as a \" longtime feminist \" to underscore the absurdity of \" the alleged victims...

Paratarsotomus macropalpis is smaller than a single sesame seed — and can run up to 322 body lengths per second. So, while the mite isn't exactly covering much ground, by that measure this tiny insect clocks in about 20 times faster than a cheetah, science daily reports. But a cheetah wasn't the previous record holder in this category: that honor went to the australian tiger beetle, which can cover 171 body lengths per second.

        "summary": "A chimp would never be able to throw a fastball, or anything even close to a fastball, and that seemingly weird fact helps explain why humans came to rule the animal kingdom, says a new study in nature. Researchers say that early humans — homo erectus, to be exact — developed the ability to throw about 2 million years ago, thanks to a handful of anatomical changes, reports the washington post. Among other things, we got longer waists, lower shoulders, and the ability to cock an arm way behind our back for extra power. ( the researchers studied the motions of college pitchers to zero in on key factors. ) these changes allowed humans to become great hunters, providing the ability to take down big game with a well-aimed spear. Hunting \"really did have a tremendously profound effect on who we are, \" says the lead researcher. The study shows how the anatomical changes dovetailed with a fossil record that shows how hunting intensified about the same time, reports the boston globe. ( \" i throw, therefore i am, \" is how globe writer carolyn johnson sums things up. ) both stories also quote sports experts who say the findings could help them determine which pitchers are destined for greatness and which for the injured reserve.",

Edita tracey tells myfoxphilly.com she was at her hair salon last month when her back started to hurt, and when the pain shifted to her chest she called 911: \" the last thing i remember is emergency people coming, and that's it. \" at the hospital, the doctors got to work pinpointing the issue; a ct scan revealed a rare and serious problem: tracey's aorta, the large blood vessel that pumps blood from the heart to the rest of the body, was bulging so badly there was a one-foot tear along it. The condition, known as aortic dissection, can be lethal in seconds — but the full anesthesia she'd need to undergo to repair it could harm the baby. So two surgical groups teamed up in the hopes of saving both tracey and her child. The first team delivered the healthy baby girl by c-section within 30 seconds of her going under, and then the cardiac team opened tracey's chest, drained the blood collecting around her heart and got to work rebuilding her aorta in a highly complicated surgery that took nine hours. Thanks to the surgeons ' fast work, the pennsylvania mom and baby arabella are now home and doing well. \" i think that the baby saved my life, \" tracey tells abc news, which reports a \" perfect storm \" of conditions seems to have led to her rare condition: marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disease that weakens blood vessels ' walls, and preeclampsia, a pregnancy disorder characterized by high blood pressure.

The company will remove artificial dyes from its spongebob squarepants, halloween, and winter shapes varieties; the \" original flavor \" version will see no such change, the ap reports.

For vani hari, who started a change.org petition calling for kraft to remove yellow dye 5 and yellow dye 6 from its pasta, it's a victory. \" i was so shaken with the news that my body was trembling, \" says hari, whose petition now has more than 348,000 signatures. She tells abc news it's only a matter of time before kraft follows with new recipes for the rest of its mac and cheese, noting the brand's uk variety uses no dyes and tastes pretty much the same. \" i knew all along that it wasn't going to be an overnight change, \" she says.

The cdc announced 14 new possible cases of the virus in the us — all of which are women, some pregnant, infected by male sexual partners who have traveled to zika-affected areas, nbc news reports. According to the new york times, the sexual transmission of zika was thought to be rare. \"we were surprised that there was this number, \" the cdc's deputy director says. \"that's much more than i was expecting. \" only two of the 14 cases have been confirmed so far. The virus is believed to cause serious birth defects and possibly a syndrome that causes temporary paralysis. Still, it's \" relatively harmless to most people, \" as nbc puts it. The first known case of sexually transmitted zika in the us was reported earlier this month in dallas. The cdc is advising pregnant women to avoid sex or use a condom if their partners have been traveling to areas affected by the virus. Zika has been found in semen, and there is so far no evidence that infected women can pass it along to their sexual partners. Zika is most commonly spread by mosquitoes, though experts say a big outbreak of the virus is unlikely in the us. Meanwhile, the puerto rican government has outlawed \" condom price-gouging, \" meaning stores aren't allowed to raise the price of condoms, npr reports. The government wants to slow the spread of zika without allowing people to profit off the virus. \" now is not the time to raise prices, \" one official says.",

A three-year quest that began at a cairo university in 2011 led medieval history lecturer margarita torres and art historian josé manuel ortega del rio to determine the onyx goblet is the one jesus christ used at his last supper, and was contained within the \" chalice of doña urruca \"; the two presented their theory in a book out last week called kings of grail. In cairo, they stumbled on two egyptian parchments that described the upper part of the goblet and recounted its passage to cairo from jerusalem via muslims who then gave it to a spanish emir, reports the irish times. That led them to what had been long referred to as the goblet belonging to the daughter of fernando i, which the afp describes as \" formed by two goblets joined together. \" fernando i ruled león from 1037 to 1065 and was, in torres'telling, given the goblet, whose construction they were able to date to a range of 200 bc to 100 ad, by an emir. The historians'revelation caused crowds to swarm the san isidro basilica to such an extent that the goblet was taken off display on friday by curators now searching for a more crowd-conducive display space.

News of the suspension comes as the whale rescue community mourns joe howlett, a canadian who died during a rescue operation on monday. Howlett, a former fisherman and boat captain, had founded a whale rescue team and was based in campobello island, just across the border from lubec, maine.

The department said efforts to untangle other whales will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

        "summary": "A man was given a last-minute stay of his execution in pakistan today, not over concerns that the country is running \" a conveyor belt of executions \" — though that is a real criticism — but because abdul basit is unable to stand on the gallows. Basit, 43, acquired tubercular meningitis in prison and became paralyzed from the waist down after his conviction for killing the uncle of a woman with whom he was in a relationship, reports the los angeles times; he says he's innocent. Prison rules only allow execution by \" long-drop \" hanging, and the length of rope used must be measured according to the inmate's height while standing to ensure an instant death, leading to concerns that basit would be decapitated or face prolonged strangulation, reports the bbc. The stay came just an hour before his hanging was scheduled at dawn. It isn't clear if authorities will go ahead with the execution, but \" he is still alive, \" basit's sister says. \" we have been told that he could not be executed on technical grounds. But why don't they stop it on humanitarian grounds? \" his mother adds basit \" was trapped in this murder \" and has become \" a skeleton \" with bedsores. \" he is already half dead.

Investigators got granular, keeping tabs on vallerius'social media accounts to see if his writing style matched with that of \" oxymonster \" ( alleged giveaways include his propensity for writing \" cheers \" and using double exclamation points ) and tracking his bitcoin transactions.

The baby was hospitalized with an infection at 6 days old and died 19 days later. Texas department of state health services researchers believe the pool the baby was born in at home is the only likely source of infection. No legionella bacteria — which thrive in warm water — were found in the pool, but it had already been disinfected by the time investigators were called in, livescience reports. The researchers say the tragic death in january of this year highlights the risks of water births and the need to follow strict cleaning procedures. \" those who opt for water birth procedures should know that this is a risk and talk to their doctor about it, \" says epidemiologist elyse fritschel. She co-authored the report on the case published in emerging infectious diseases. The researchers note that legionella bacteria \" are ubiquitously found in the environment \" and lead to as many as 18,000 hospitalizations in the us each year, but \" underdeveloped lungs and immune systems place infants at high risk for severe complications. \" there are only a handful of similar cases on record, including one in the uk earlier this year. After a baby born in a rented home-birthing pool became seriously ill, authorities temporarily banned the use of pools with built-in heaters and recirculation pumps, the guardian reports. They explained that while most birthing pools are safe, the legionella bacteria can thrive in ones that use recirculated warm water and are capable of being filled well in advance of the birth.",

But she also has a husband, jahangir hajiyev, who is serving 15 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and embezzlement in his capacity as chairman of the international bank of azerbaijan. It all adds up to hajiyeva becoming the first ever target of the uk's new unexplained wealth order power, which targets foreign officials suspected of laundering stolen money through the uk. In this case, hajiyeva, 55, must explain how she paid for the two aforementioned properties, per cnn, which include a home in london and golf course estate in berkshire. If she's unable to do that, she risks having the assets seized. In 2009, the according to the bbc, a company in the british virgin islands, ultimately traced to hajiyeva and her husband, bought the london property. Another company linked to them bought the golf estate in 2013. Hajiyeva is living in the uk under a visa program for wealthy investors. Hajiyeva has denied any wrongdoing.

Zamira hajiyeva, who is the subject of the first two unexplained wealth orders obtained by the uk national crime agency ( nca ), also spent more than £ 16 million over a decade at luxury department store harrods, a high court judgment said, according to pa. The high court order dismissing her attempt to throw out the nca case and maintain her anonymity was made last week, when hajiyeva was named only as \" mrs a, \" but her lawyers were given a week to appeal. The anonymity order was lifted wednesday after a judge ruled that \" no good case \" had been made for extending it, pa said. If hajiyeva cannot explain how she afforded the assets in question, she could lose them. One property, worth around £ 11.5 million, is in the rich london neighborhood of knightsbridge, where harrods is located. Hajiyeva's husband, jahangir hajiyev, was the chairman of the state-controlled international bank of azerbaijan from 2001 until his resignation in 2015. He was later sentenced to 15 years on fraud and embezzlement",

            "London ( cnn ) a woman whose husband is a jailed state banker in azerbaijan has lost a court fight to avoid being named as she seeks to explain how she paid for two properties worth £ 22 million ( $ 29 million ) in total, britain's press association reported wednesday. Zamira hajiyeva, who is the subject of the first two unexplained wealth orders obtained by the uk national crime agency ( nca ), also spent more than £ 16 million over a decade at luxury department store harrods, a high court judgment said, according to pa. The high court order dismissing her attempt to throw out the nca case and maintain her anonymity was made last week, when hajiyeva was named only as \" mrs a, \" but her lawyers were given a week to appeal. The anonymity order was lifted wednesday after a judge ruled that \" no good case \" had been made for extending it, pa said. If hajiyeva cannot explain how she afforded the assets in question, she could lose them. One property, worth around £ 11.5 million, is in the rich london neighborhood of knightsbridge, where harrods is located. Hajiyeva's husband, jahangir hajiyev, was the chairman of the state-controlled international bank of azerbaijan from 2001 until his resignation in 2015. He was later sentenced to 15 years on fraud and embezzlement",

But she says when the other group became more aggressive, her family reported them to campsite management, which is when things took an even worse turn: the man they say was the ringleader of the neighboring campers started yelling racial slurs and charged their campsite. \" all you could hear was ' i ' m going to kill you f ' ing n's, ' \" allen tells the station. \" the guys in our campsite told us to run. \" she adds to fox40 that \" the guy ran down the hill with a shovel and you're in the dark, i thought he had a shotgun. \" allen tells abc10 kids were screaming in terror in the dark and that her 66-year-old mother fell while running and sliced open her face. Allen's family called the cops, who tell fox40 they didn't find any weapons on the man and so didn't arrest him, though a captain at the nevada county sheriff's office tells abc10 his agency is recommending to the da a charge of making a criminal threat, with hate-crime charges possible as well. Meanwhile, nevada county residents who heard about the incident are appalled and have offered their support to allen's family, even setting up a gofundme page — which has already raised more than its $ 5,000 goal — to fund their reunion next year, per usa today. \" let's show them what this county is truly about … a community full of compassionate people that values diversity, \" the page reads.

Tax day is normally april 15, but not so this year because it fell on a weekend. Typically, that would mean it gets pushed to the following monday, but because washington, dc, observes emancipation day on monday — the day lincoln freed the slaves in the capital, which is actually april 16, but that, too, fell on a weekend — tuesday it is. A look at coverage: consider this stat: 57 % of americans think they pay too much in federal income taxes, but 45 % of americans actually pay no federal income taxes at all. How to explain the anomaly? americans are seriously ignorant about taxes, writes tulane prof marjorie kornhauser in the washington post. Progressive vs. Flat? marginal rates vs. Effective rates? she's got some suggestions to remedy this, including teaching tax literacy in schools. Think you are among the tax literate? prove it with a quiz from npr. Sample question: the highest earners pay a significantly higher share of federal income taxes than they did in 1980. True or false? which state sends the most tax dollars per person to the federal government? delaware is tops at $ 16,000. However, washington, dc, trumps all the states by a mile at $ 37,000, reports the ap. See where your state ranks here. As many people remember in the spring, filing taxes can be an \" absurdly complex \" process, writes tr reid in the new york times. He makes the case that it doesn't need to be this way, starting with the irs pre-filling in our forms with the numbers it already knows. Tax day may be behind the markets'recent struggles, explains a post at cnbc. A post at scientific american floats the idea of moving tax day up a month to march 15. The idea is that, counter-intuitively, the shorter deadline will reduce the number of late filers. With tax day comes freebies at various businesses on tuesday.

        "summary": "Syria's bashar al-assad addressed his country's new parliament on tuesday, and he sounded very much like a confident ruler with no plans to step down. \"just like we liberated palmyra and many other areas before it, we are going to liberate each and every inch of syria from their hands, \" he said, referring both to the islamic state and us-backed insurgents fighting him separately, per usa today. The defiant speech comes in the wake of the collapse of peace talks in geneva, which failed in part because assad rejected a rebel demand that he give up power. Some related coverage of the speech: al-jazeera: \" assad's comments were a far cry from remarks he made last july when he conceded that his army was facing a series of setbacks on the battlefield and was being forced to relinquish certain areas. However, the scales of war have tipped in assad's \" favor. Washington post: \" his tough words came amid indications that russia is preparing to reengage in the war in support of assad.... The violence has already been ticking up, with government and russian warplanes conducting air raids over northern syria in the past week and rebels launching an offensive to recapture territory south of the city of aleppo. \" new york times: \" assad's defiance was notable partly because of efforts in recent months by secretary of state john kerry and other leaders of a 17-nation collaboration, known as the international syria support group, to set a series of deadlines and limits that syria could not violate. Every one of the directives has been broken. \" middle east eye: \" during the speech, assad also appeared to harden his position on un-sponsored peace talks, saying that syria will be ruled by a ' unity government ' — not a'transitional governing body ' without assad as president, a central demand of the opposition. \"",

He won a court ruling tuesday, but it wasn't enough to stop the execution, al.com reports. \" they are going to kill me this time, \" the man called the \" houdini \" of death row tells the ap.

But he also maintains his innocence and will continue to do so \" until i draw my last breath. \" his lawyer says there's no physical evidence tying arthur to the murder and is pushing for new dna testing. But arthur does admit to killing his sister-in-law on accident, a crime for which he spent years in prison. He also briefly escaped from prison in 1986 by shooting a guard in the neck.

To illustrate, alaska dispatch news points out that a 10-pound winter king salmon would currently go for about $ 7.34 a pound, or $ 73 per fish, while a barrel of crude oil is running about $ 30.

Renowned british surgeon simon bramhall, who branded his initials on the livers of at least two transplant patients in 2013, pleaded guilty to assault wednesday, the bbc reports. The liver, spleen, and pancreas surgeon used an argon beam — normally used to stop livers from bleeding or to sketch out areas to be operated on — to brand \" sb \" on the patients ' organs. Such marks usually disappear on their own, but bramhall's handiwork was discovered when a colleague operated on a patient whose liver had failed to heal normally, the guardian reports. Bramhall was suspended from birmingham's queen elizabeth hospital and resigned after a disciplinary hearing in 2014. At wednesday's hearing, prosecutor tony badenoch said the \" highly complex and unusual case \" was \" without legal precedent in criminal law. \" he added that the branding of initials required \" some skill and concentration \" — and was carried out in the presence of colleagues. The prosecutor said the guilty plea shows bramhall accepts what he did to unconscious patients \" was not just ethically wrong but criminally wrong. \" bramhall will be sentenced next month. Npr notes that while the case was apparently without precedent in britain, there have been similar incidents in the us, including a 2010 case in which a california gynecologist was sued for branding a patient's name on a uterus he had removed.",

The federal indictment filed last week charges that the tinimbangs used their home health care business \" patients first \" to put themselves first and even forced a woman into indentured servitude. An arraignment date hasn't yet been set. The husband and wife are accused of using three home healthcare companies owned by richard's mother, josephine tinimbang, to pay bribes and kickbacks to get medicare beneficiaries between 2008 and 2014, and of both ignoring doctors who wouldn't certify beneficiaries as needing home health care as well as falsifying records to make patients appear sicker than they were. The doj estimates a resulting $ 45 million hit to medicare, which afforded the couple their house, vehicles, jewelry, and stock shares. Meanwhile, they allegedly brought a filipino woman they said would be a business analyst back to the states and paid her $ 66 a day to serve as their nanny and housekeeper, all while threatening to charge her $ 25,000 in damages should she leave before seven years were up.

It's beyond insane. \" that's how one sports business expert describes the record-shattering deal that will send neymar — widely recognized as the third-best soccer player in the world — from barcelona to paris saint-germain. The washington post reports psg paid $ 263 million just to get the 25-year-old brazilian to transfer there. It's more than double the previous highest-ever transfer fee. In addition, neymar will get $ 36 million per year for five years. Here's everything you need to know about the story that's got the soccer world in a froth: in a deep dive into what it calls the \" story of the summer, \" bleacher report looks at neymar's reasons for leaving barcelona after four years for a team and league that are seen as a step down. Essentially, neymar wants a shot at being seen as the best player in the world and wasn't going to get that chance playing alongside teammate messi, the current best player in the world. Neymar says moving to psg wasn't about the money, the bbc reports. \" if i was following the money, i would be somewhere else, with other clubs in other countries. I ' m really sad that people still think that way. \" in an opinion piece, the independent calls neymar's astronomical transfer fee an \" insult to fans and downright immoral, \" connecting it to regular people's \" daily struggles with the neoliberal economy. \" psg chairman nasser al-khelaifi says anyone concerned about the amount of money the team spent on neymar should \" go have a coffee and don't worry about \" it. According to the new york times, the chairman claims adding neymar will increase the team's value from $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion. However, business insider reports psg is being accused of breaking the financial fair play rules by spending so much on neymar. It may be required to somehow boost revenue or sell some of its players or face being booted from the champions league. Psg's acquisition of neymar is as much about international politics as it is international soccer, according to cnn. The french team was bought by qatari interests in 2011. Qatar throwing money at the world's third-best soccer player is a way of raising its profile in the world — the same reason it's spent money supporting islamist rebels and intervening in neighboring conflicts.

        "summary": "Occupational and environmental exposure to pesticides has already been linked to lower semen quality, according to a new study in the human reproduction journal. But scientists from the harvard th chan school of public health were curious to conduct what they're calling the first study to examine how sperm production and quality are affected by eating pesticide-heavy produce, a harvard press release announced yesterday. Researchers looked at 155 men taking part in a boston fertility-center study in which they gave a sperm sample and answered questions about whether the fruits and veggies they consumed were those generally known to have high pesticide residue or low residue. Results: if the men ate more produce usually steeped in residue ( think spinach, strawberries ), the result was a 49 % lower sperm count and 32 % lower quality of sperm — as well as a lower volume of ejaculate — than that of men who consumed the least fruits and veggies in that high-level category. Meanwhile, the men who ate a plethora of produce from the low-residue group ( think grapefruit, onions ) churned out a higher sperm percentage than their counterparts who didn't chow down as much from the low-level group, indicating consumers shouldn't shy away from eating produce — just find the best kind to eat. \" these findings should not discourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables in general, \" lead author jorge chavarro says, per the harvard press release; instead, he suggests buying more organic fare. He warns more investigation is needed, as the study's subjects were men who already had fertility issues, livescience notes; the study's abstract also mentions that actual pesticide levels weren't measured — they were instead estimated based on subjects'survey answers and a comparison chart from the usda's pesticide data program, time reports.

Deputies say the young drink vendor reported that a male teenager with a camouflage hat and black shirt placed a black handgun to the boy's stomach saturday, demanded money and then fled on foot. Sheriff's spokesman tony underwood tells the charlotte observer less than $ 20 in cash was stolen. According to a statement the sheriff's office posted to facebook, authorities found a camouflage hat, a black bb handgun and a stolen metal tin along a trail in some nearby woods. Deputies believe the suspect left a bicycle in the brush for his getaway. Authorities said they're unsure if the bb gun they found is the same weapon used in the holdup, but that is appears to likely to be the case because of where it was recovered along with the other items.",

        "summary": "Shinzo abe has vowed to promote women in the workplace — called his \" womenomics \" platform by some — but a new report in japan's largest newspaper shows a major university seemingly trying to flout the prime minister's plan, per the bbc. In a thursday expose, an anonymous source tells yomiuri shimbun that school officials at tokyo medical university had a \" silent understanding \" to keep the number of women accepted to the school at less than 30 %. How the officials allegedly implemented this discriminatory plan: by changing test scores of female applicants, the source says. The women's exam scores were reportedly reduced between 10 % and 20 %, per the japan times. The report notes only 30 women were accepted this year to the university, while 141 men nabbed a spot. The rumored reason for the alleged anti-woman initiative — which the source called a \" necessary evil, \" per quartz — is the belief that women are more likely than not to ditch their plans to enter the medical field after they graduate to raise families instead, leaving hospitals understaffed. The strategy to reduce the school's female demographic was reportedly started after 2010 admissions showed women making up 38 % of total accepted applicants, the ap notes. An education ministry official tells the asahi shimbun that colleges actually can set whatever gender ratios they desire, as long as those quotas are made public; that didn't seem to be the case here. As commenters on social media continue to rail against the university in the wake of the report — one post said the accusations veered \" beyond a matter of outdated mindset \" — the school has promised to look into the allegations.",

In fact any advertising of birth control will become illegal, reuters notes, a stark turnaround for a nation that once promoted birth control and gave away condoms for free. So why is the ayatollah khamenei supporting the new bill and urging young iranians to resist \" undesirable aspects of western lifestyles \" by having bigger families? because of iran's low birthrate, which has sunk to 1.8 children per woman, a full 0.3 children less than is needed to keep up the present population, irna reports. Iran had the opposite problem in the 1980s, when its population was growing too fast for the economy — so the government promoted birth control and required couples to have family-planning counseling before marriage. Women indeed had fewer babies, got more involved in the workforce, and eventually outnumbered men in higher education. \" government officials were wrong on this matter, and i, too, had a part, \" khamenei said in 2012. \" may god and history forgive us. \" now critics say the new plan could cause a rise in abortions ( which are only legal when a mother's life is at risk ), and may force women out of the workplace into \" traditional roles, \" reports the post. Before taking effect, the bill needs approval from a council to ensure that it jibes with islamic law.",

Slate writer jody rosen dusted off the annals of history to paint the colorful portraits of the three who have come before her in the last 2,600 years: a slave-owner in ancient babylonia, an irish countrywoman who gained the aristocratic title madame de gaga through marriage in 1817, and a fictional '20s flapper and socialite. It's the last gaga who the bears the most resemblance to the modern-day gaga, writes rosen. The third gaga was born into the world via the pages of an april 1929 issue of punch, a british humor magazine. This lady gaga was \" the lead character in a satire that took aim at the so-called bright young people, \" as the young aristocrats and socialites of the age were known. Tell me this doesn't sound a bit like the gaga you know and love: the bright young people threw \" freak \" or \" stunt \" parties — \" themed soirees featuring elaborate costumes, cross-dressing, wild animals, and outlandish musical entertainment. \" furthermore, this \" blue-blooded party-girl \" had a \" slangy vocabulary ( ' aren't they too ultra-super?

A diet high in certain carbohydrates — highly refined ones, like that bread, for instance — may bump up the risk of depression in postmenopausal women, per a new study. Columbia university researchers write in the american journal of clinical nutrition that while previous studies have suggested a link between consuming things like pastries or soda and depression risk, \" any influence that refined carbohydrates has on mood could be commensurate with their proportion in the overall diet. \" so their analysis factored in something additional: glycemic index ( gi ) — the gi scale runs from 0-100 and measures the amount of sugar in the blood after eating; highly refined carbs rank higher on the gi scale — and glycemic load, as well as overall carb and sugar intake. When blood sugar levels are high, a hormonal response can occur in order to bring them down — a response that may also trigger or worsen mood changes, fatigue, and other signs of depression, per a press release. Researchers reviewed data from 70,000 postmenopausal women who'd participated in a separate study between 1994 and 1998 and found a high gi index score raised a woman's risk of depression by 22 %, while high amounts of added sugars and refined grains in a woman's diet increased her risk by 23 %, upi reports. On the flip side, women who consumed more whole grains, vegetables, and dietary fiber saw a decreased risk. Though more study is needed, researchers are optimistic that eating more of these foods could prevent or even treat depression in postmenopausal women.

Consumption of carbohydrates increases blood sugar levels to varying degrees, depending on the type of food ingested. The more highly refined the carbohydrate, the higher its score on the glycemic index ( gi ) scale. The gi scale, which goes from 0-100, measures the amount of sugar found in the"

Officials say a fellow diver was with the man, who has not been identified, at a 20-foot decompression stop on tuesday near the spot where the italian luxury liner went down on july 26, 1956, report cnn and wcvb. When the witness reached the surface, however, the man was nowhere to be found. A commercial diving boat reported the incident to the coast guard, which was on the scene within three minutes, reports the boston globe. The coast guard last night called off the search for the missing man after scouring some 350 square nautical miles by air and sea over 30 hours. The andrea doria, known as \" the mount everest of wreck diving, \" per scubadiving.com, lies 240 feet underwater some 60 nautical miles southeast of nantucket. It's a popular attraction for advanced divers, but officials note recreational divers shouldn't attempt a visit. Seven people have died and four have been injured while diving there since 2005. In addition to the deep waters that preserve the 697-foot vessel — which took at least 46 lives when it collided with the stockholm almost exactly 59 years ago — the wreck itself poses a risk to divers as sections of it have been known to collapse. On top of that, \" here in new england, water temperatures are especially cold and there are strong currents, especially around our shores and islands, \" says a coast guard search and rescue specialist.
