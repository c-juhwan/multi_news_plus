The endorsement comes despite what the post calls trump's \" blistering critiques \" of carson early in the contest. Those critiques included comparing carson to a child molester at one point, according to usa today. Regardless, sources say carson, who dropped out of the race last week, sees trump as the gop's best chance to win the white house. In an interview thursday, carson complimented trump, saying he \" is actually a thinking individual \" when you get him away from big crowds and television cameras. The hill reports a carson endorsement could help trump in a number of ways, including bolstering support from evangelicals, helping fight claims trump is racist, and bringing a \" quiet dignity \" to trump's campaign. The post says carson could be trump's biggest endorsement since another former rival, chris christie.",

The new york times reported thursday charges against weinstein were anticipated to involve the rape of one woman and forcing another woman to perform oral sex, and the ap reports he was indeed hit with rape, criminal sex act, and lower-level sex abuse and sexual misconduct charges. Cnn notes weinstein arrived at the nypd's 1st precinct \" through a flurry of reporters and photographers... Not unlike the red carpet walks he used to do. \" usa today says he showed a \" brief smirk \" as he emerged from his vehicle and apparently had some trouble walking into the precinct. He subsequently left the station wearing handcuffs and what the ap describes as a \" strained smile. \" he was arraigned later friday morning in a manhattan court, with bail set at $ 1 million, per the ap. He's also required to wear an electronic monitoring device and not venture outside of new york and connecticut. Msnbc has video of the arraignment. \" harvey weinstein shattered the lives of an untold number of women. We stand with them, and remain in solidarity with women everywhere who have faced unsafe and abusive workplaces, \" time's up says in a follow-up tweet. \" we look forward to seeing justice prevail. \"",

        "summary": "Plan to enjoy a few extra helpings of mashed potatoes, gravy, and gingerbread men over the coming weeks — but worried about all those pounds you're bound to pack on? cut yourself some slack, suggests travis saunders on the plos blog. He points out that while people regularly parrot the line that we gain 5 to 10 pounds over the holidays, research has shown that just isn't true. He digs up a study, published in the new england journal of medicine in 2000, that says just that. The researchers determined that between thanksgiving and new year's, the actual average holiday weight gain is just 0.81 pounds. The study tracked the weight fluctuations of 195 adults, who were weighed four times over the pre-holiday ( beginning in late september ), holiday, and post-holiday ( till about late february ) periods. But even with that relatively modest pool of subjects, \" the idea that the average person gains large amounts of weight during the holidays is completely untrue, \" saunders writes. Still, smithsonian points out that the researchers found that most of the participants didn't lose the holiday weight before the beginning of the next pre-holiday period, suggesting, the researchers wrote, that this seasonal weight gain \" probably contributes to the increase in body weight that frequently occurs during adulthood. \" ( meanwhile, other research suggests \" bad \" carbs may not be so bad after all. )",

The family is one of more than 100,000 to respond to a twitter request for stories about the impact the hike might have, reuters reports. Obama employed a similar tactic during the payroll tax holiday debate. In other fiscal cliff news: while obama's trip is intended to drive home the damage going over the cliff might cause, tim geithner told cnbc yesterday that the administration was \" absolutely \" ready to do that if the gop didn't agree to let tax cuts for the top 2 % of earners expire. Many republicans appear to be softening on that point, saying they ' ll accept tax hikes if they come with entitlement cuts, the washington post reports. \" quite frankly, some people in this 2 % who call me, they're more worried about the fiscal cliff than about the rates going up, \" one rep said. In another sign that the gop is eager to deal, house republicans were falling over each other to heap praise on and express support for john boehner during a closed-door meeting yesterday, the new york times reports. If boehner no longer needs to fear a mass conservative defection, as he did in the last round of budget talks, it might free his hand in negotiations. But don't expect a deal to come too quickly.

Cnn reports the defense department office of inspector general has been investigating dana white, the assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, for a number of weeks after subordinates filed complaints about her alleged misuse of staff. They allege that she tasked them with errands like picking up dry cleaning, buying her pantyhose, fetching her lunch from the cafeteria, arranging hairdresser appointments, calling a california foster care facility to discuss adoption, and assisting with her mortgage paperwork in violation of pentagon ethics standards, which prohibit officials from assigning personnel to non-official activities. Cnn points out that some staffers did the errands willingly, but that the standards don't distinguish between voluntary and non-voluntary non-official work. Cnn reports two staffers claim that after complaining about their situation to higher-ups in may 2018 they were subsequently transferred in what they view as a retaliatory move; nbc news sources say it's actually four staffers, at least one of whom was moved to a \" lower-profile job. \" the ap reports the pentagon acknowledged the \" ongoing review \" in a statement but didn't elaborate.

According to discovery, gravitational waves — ripples in space-time — are believed to be created by things like black holes, supernovas, and \" galactic mergers. \" the washington post reports their discovery could help scientists study black holes and other cosmic curiosities. \" we would have a new window on the universe, \" krauss tells the guardian. \"gravitational waves are generated in the most exotic, strange locations in nature. \" but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Gizmodo reports the official word out of ligo — the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory — is that it's still analyzing data and has nothing to report at this time. And krauss tells the guardian he's only 60 % positive the rumors are true. He tells the post he only tweeted about the possible discovery because he's heard other physicists discussing it. But scientists say it could be dangerous to post those kinds of things before findings have been peer-reviewed and confirmed. If what's reported turns out to be false, the public trust in science and scientists could be damaged. But, as gizmodo notes, \" if confirmed, this would be one of the most significant physics discoveries of the last century. \" ( another discovery, finally confirmed, grabbed headlines earlier this month. )",

A team of scientists at the european institute managed to capture 38 of the atoms for a fraction of a second, each in a trap described as a \"magnetic bottle, \" the bbc reports. They believe the device will allow them to unlock the mysteries of antimatter, which is identical to matter but has the components of its atoms in reverse, with negatively charged nuclei and positively charged electrons. Scientists believe equal amounts of matter and antimatter were created at the birth of the universe, and the question of what happened to all the antimatter is one of the biggest mysteries in science. The cern team hopes that capturing more atoms will provide the answer. \" we don't know where this is going to lead, \" a physicist on the team tells ctv. \" but the ultimate motivation is really to try to address this question: why do we live in a universe composed of matter? \" he describes the experiment as \" science fiction become science fact. \" ( if you're having a tough time wrapping your head around this, check out this great explanation of antimatter. )",

Of course, those were also the days when doctors had only recently stopped endorsing cigarettes, and \" few people could yet conceive of the government lying to us or allowing food manufacturers to do us any harm. \" but times changed, and hostess failed to change with them. The company \" never even pretended to provide ' healthier'snacks, \" and lost market share when parents started switching to still-unhealthy, but seemingly healthier snacks like granola bars. Regardless of how it emerges from bankruptcy, \" the days when hostess ruled the 3pm snack world as well as the lunchtime-sandwich world are over, \" bittman writes, and that's a good thing. \" the companies that deserve to survive are the ones that produce things we need and provide gainful employment.

        "summary": "Last saturday, laura wolf stopped off at a waffle house in her neck of the woods in texas for a meal, and what she witnessed there — and what she did afterward — ended up changing the life of a teen waffle house employee. Per khou, wolf happened upon the la marque restaurant on a morning when 18-year-old evoni williams, a recent high school graduate, was working one of her shifts, trying to scrape together funds to pay for college. As wolf explains in a facebook post, accompanied by a photo of the incident, she overheard an elderly customer sitting at the counter and tethered to an oxygen tank tell williams that \" his hands don't work too good. \" it was then, \" without hesitation, \" that williams took the plate from the struggling customer, ided as 78-year-old adrien charpentier, and started to cut his meat. That's when wolf snapped the photo, which has since gone viral on social media. \" this may seem small but to him, i ' m sure it was huge, \" wolf wrote of charpentier, who williams tells ktrk is a regular but hadn't been in until that day after a recent hospital stay. Since wolf posted her photo, it's been shared more than 46,000 times and received more than 55,000 votes on reddit, per the houston chronicle. And when texas southern university got wind of it, the college had a surprise for williams: a $ 16,000 scholarship, which she plans to put toward a business management degree. Per ktrk, la marque's mayor honored williams on thursday, with the guest of honor noting she was thrown by all the attention. \" it just came from the heart, \" she says. As for charpentier, he's enjoying the publicity as well, joking with khou that \" they got a fancy picture of my suspenders in the back. \" ( something similar happened at a chicago mcdonald's a few years back. )",

        "summary": "Because the nation's student-debt situation wasn't enough of a mess: a new federal report warns that some students are going into default even when they've been paying back their loans on time, reports usa today. It's because of an obscure provision covering private student loans — if the co-signer dies, the loan automatically goes into default, a development that can wreak havoc on a student's credit record, reports the washington post. The consumer financial protection bureau says it's been receiving a rising number of complaints about the issue. A typical example is when a parent or grandparent co-signs for the loan, but dies before it's paid off. What's strange, points out the new york times, is that this kind of automatic default doesn't seem to be in the best interest of the students or the lenders. \" it doesn't seem that there is a thoughtful business decision, \" says a cfpb official. The agency didn't have exact numbers, but the problem affects only private loans, and the vast majority of student loans are federal ones, which don't require a co-signer. Not that all is rosy on the federal front: the wall street journal reports that critics are worried that increasingly popular debt-forgiveness programs are not only costing the government too much money but might be encouraging schools to raise tuition even higher.",

She knew she had crashed, and put the car in park, her sister said. Then she lost consciousness. \" she doesn't know for how long but when she came to, she thought the car might explode and she knew she had to get out, \" caufield said. There was no way for her to get out of the driver",

They say michael fanfarillo, who was born feb. 1, had been left in the car for \" an extended period of time \" by his father, who has been placed on administrative leave while he grieves and the investigation continues, syracuse.com reports. It isn't clear whether fanfarillo, a 10-year veteran of the rome force, was on duty at the time his son died. A neighbor tells newyorkupstate.com that she saw a distraught fanfarillo standing in his driveway monday afternoon as emergency vehicles arrived. \" he had his hands on his head and was not in a good way, \" she says. It isn't clear how long the baby had been left in the vehicle, though a pediatrician tells wktv that on a hot day, a child trapped in a car could suffer heatstroke and die within just 15 minutes. Her advice for preventing similar tragedies: \" put a stuffed animal in the car seat and whenever you put your kid in the car seat, you take the stuffed animal out and put it in the front so that's like a visual reminder. \"",

The alleged saturday night rendezvous was with a fellow freshman with whom he'd previously been intimate but was not dating. Prosecutors say that after asking her to undress in his dorm room, he proceeded to tie her hands above her head to a bed with a belt, bind her legs with another belt, stuff her mouth with a tie, cover her eyes with a knit cap, and strike her repeatedly with another belt — even after the woman said \" no, \" \" stop, \" and \" you're hurting me, \" according to the police report, via dnainfo. The report further states that the woman tried to escape several times, but that hossain held her down and sexually assaulted her. Hossain is a triathlete, student ambassador to the alumni association, and member of multiple uic leadership programs. \" how can someone involved in all that let a movie persuade him to do something like this? \" asked the judge, who yesterday set hossain's bail at $ 500,000. \" he would say that it was consensual, \" replied his lawyer. The woman called university police the night of the incident, and hossain admitted \" doing something wrong. \" \" it makes people think that this is kind of a healthy intimacy that they should try to engage in in order to spice up their relationship, but really it's just violence, \" a rep with the national center on sexual exploitation tells abc7.

Amsterdam an experimental roche drug that seems to work particularly well against lung cancer in smokers may be a \" game changer \" for these normally difficult-to-treat patients, researchers said on sunday. Presenting detailed data from an early-stage trial of the drug, called mpdl3280a, in patients with a form of the disease called non-small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ), investigators said what they had found was \" great news for lung cancer patients \". Of 53 patients with nsclc tumours treated with the drug, 23 percent saw their tumours shrink, according to results presented at the european cancer congress ( ecc ) in amsterdam. But the most encouraging numbers were among smokers, where the response rate was 26 percent compared with 10 percent of patients who had never smoked, said professor jean-charles soria of france's institut gustave roussy, who led the study. Lung cancer, which is usually caused by smoking, is extremely difficult to treat successfully and once it has started to spread to other parts of the body, it is incurable. Roche's mpdl3280a is an engineered antibody that targets a protein called pd-l1 - a defence mechanism that tumours use to trick the immune system's t-cells into being inactive. By",

            "A logo of swiss pharmaceutical company roche is pictured in front of a company's building in rotkreuz, april 12, 2012. Amsterdam an experimental roche drug that seems to work particularly well against lung cancer in smokers may be a \" game changer \" for these normally difficult-to-treat patients, researchers said on sunday. Presenting detailed data from an early-stage trial of the drug, called mpdl3280a, in patients with a form of the disease called non-small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ), investigators said what they had found was \" great news for lung cancer patients \". Of 53 patients with nsclc tumours treated with the drug, 23 percent saw their tumours shrink, according to results presented at the european cancer congress ( ecc ) in amsterdam. But the most encouraging numbers were among smokers, where the response rate was 26 percent compared with 10 percent of patients who had never smoked, said professor jean-charles soria of france's institut gustave roussy, who led the study. Lung cancer, which is usually caused by smoking, is extremely difficult to treat successfully and once it has started to spread to other parts of the body, it is incurable. Roche's mpdl3280a is an engineered antibody that targets a protein called pd-l1 - a defence mechanism that tumours use to trick the immune system's t-cells into being inactive. By",

According to a press release, the study found that no astrophysical catastrophe nor extinction event will be enough to kill the mighty tardigrade, also known as the \" water bear. \" these microscopic animals can survive for 30 years without food or water and in the vacuum of space. The washington post reports tardigrades can live in temperatures from 350 degrees celsius to just a degree above absolute zero. Tardigrades can be dried out for a decade or hang out at the bottom of the ocean, according to smithsonian. \" tardigrades are as close to indestructible as it gets on earth, \" says dr. Rafael alves batista, co-author of study. In an attempt to theoretically kill off the tardigrade, researchers tried three of the most destructive forces known: asteroids, supernovas, and gamma-ray bursts. All three failed for various reasons ( no asteroids large enough to boil off the oceans in a collision, no stars besides the sun close enough to release enough radiation in a supernova, etc. ). The study concludes that means at least one form of life on earth will last as long as the sun is still shining. \" it seems that life, once it gets going, is hard to wipe out entirely, \" co-author dr. David sloan says. Not only that, but the ability of tardigrades to survive cataclysmic events gives researchers hope for finding life on other planets. ( after 30 years on ice, this thing came back to life. )",

The latest development: the new york times reports that she requested research into billionaire george soros after he went after facebook. Sandberg sent an email to the company's communications team requesting the research after soros called facebook a \" menace to society \" at a global forum in january. Sandberg has been downplaying her role in the opposition research conducted on soros and other facebook critics ever since an earlier times report revealed that facebook had hired a firm called definers public affairs. But the email, which buzzfeed reports facebook confirmed, suggests she played a larger role than first acknowledged. A facebook statement downplayed the significance of the new report, saying sandberg wanted to know if soros stood to gain financially from his criticism. \"mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to facebook, \" the company said. \"that research was already underway when sheryl sent an email asking if mr. Soros had shorted facebook's stock. \" sandberg initially said she was unaware facebook had hired definers, then acknowledged that some of its work had shown up on her desk. A spokesman for an anti-facebook coalition called freedom from facebook said sandberg has lost credibility. \" in light of sandberg's continuously changing story on the soros research, there's no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value, \" said eddie vale.

        "summary": "A new study could bring hope to thousands of women who are susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, the telegraph reports. Analyzing breast tissue prone to cancer, australian scientists found that a protein that fuels pre-cancerous cells also causes osteoporisis — and can be stymied by a common osteoporosis drug. \" it is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the ' holy grail ' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk, \" says study co-author jane visvader. Published in nature medicine, the study looked at breast tissue in mice and three women with a faulty brca1 genetic mutation that carries a high risk of aggressive breast cancer, per a press release. When the osteoporosis drug denosumab was applied to the tissue, pre-cancerous cells stopped dividing; when used on brca1 mice, two thirds of them developed no tumors, the sydney morning herald reports. For the roughly one in 400 women who carry the mutation, this could be a way around surgery. That wasn't an option for angelina jolie, who underwent a double mastectomy and hysterectomy upon learning she had what's now dubbed the \" jolie gene. \" but australian mom kylie gellie, who had her breasts, ovaries, and fallopian tubes removed, says her two young daughters may now be able to avoid surgery even if they inherit the gene. \" maybe they don't have to go through such drastic measures as i did or maybe it can buy them some time, \" she says. A worldwide human trial should be starting within two years. ( meanwhile, double mastectomies are on the rise — among men. )",

His lawyers denied the encounter took place at all, but said if it had, farooqui didn't know she did not consent. The judge said he had to give \" the benefit of the doubt \" to farooqui because, even though the alleged victim claimed she said \" no, \" she also acknowledged she ultimately \" went along with \" the sex act. But, the guardian notes, she testified that she ultimately stopped resisting because she feared she'd be hurt or even killed, and said that farooqui only let her go when she faked an orgasm. The judge's take on that? she may have \" wrongly and mistakenly \" signaled that she was consenting. He also said consent is complex and \" may not necessarily always mean yes in case of yes or no in case of no. \" women's rights activists say this could set a dangerous precedent, and the times of india calls it \" a slippery slope. \" the alleged victim's lawyers will appeal to the indian supreme court. Meanwhile, farooqui's wife tells the indian express she's \" very relieved. \"",

That's sarah chrisman's take in her vox essay, in which she defends the victorian-era lifestyle she and her husband, gabriel, have adopted in their 1888 home in port townsend, wash. Chrisman, who's authored a couple of books on 19th-century living, documents their day-to-day existence in meticulous detail, both in the vox piece and on her website. \" every morning i wind the mechanical clock in our parlor, \" she writes. \" each day i write in my diary with an antique fountain pen that i fill with liquid ink using an eyedropper. \" the list of olden activities goes on, and she explains this existence was the result of seeing the \" value in older ways of looking at the world \" and their desire \" to challenge society's dogmas of how we should live. \" but she writes they've also suffered indignities at the hands of \" a world that can be terribly hostile to difference of any sort. Societies are rife with bullies who attack nonconformists of any stripe. … we have been called ' freaks, \" bizarre, ' and an endless slew of far worse insults. \" some have rushed to the couple's defense, but not everyone is charmed. Rebecca onion points out on slate that chrisman isn't actually living the hardscrabble victorian life — wearing a corset because you think it's quaint, for example, is a lot different than being forced to wear one while you have tb or to seem more \" womanly. \" and amanda marcotte writes for raw story that \" chrisman's piece was an object lesson in the dangers of nostalgia, \" noting that victorian life was pretty awful for women and that \" if you think that you know what it's like to be a lady in 1880 because you reject store-bought bread and love using an inkwell, then you don't know the first thing about what it was actually like to be a lady in 1880. \" ( read chrisman's entire piece, as well as the slate and raw story rebuttals. )",

The lawsuit, filed by garden of eden residents last month, claims police violated their rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure during the aug. 2, 2013, raid, in which the 20-man team came in with guns drawn, cut down and hauled off healthy plants ( among them, sweet potato and tomatillo ), and broke irrigation lines. \" we were treated worse than criminals, like terrorists, \" resident quinn eaker tells the chronicle. He says the garden of eden is filing the suit to keep the same thing from happening to anyone else. The lawsuit alleges police had no probable cause; the chronicle relays the four points detective magdalena perez made in a probable cause affidavit: eaker \" committed the offense of possession of marijuana \" about a month prior; an anonymous source claimed eaker had guns on the property; a pilot on a surveillance flyover saw what he thought was possibly pot; and the commune's website described its food as \" uber dank high vibe cuisine, \" which perez wrote she knew was slang for good pot. Except the dallas observer reports eaker hadn't been arrested or cited for pot possession; nbc dfw reports the tall plants spotted by the surveillance plane turned out to be tomatoes; and no drugs or guns were found.

        "summary": "Japan is trying to reduce the number of car accidents involving elderly drivers by offering seniors the only thing they love more than their independence: discounted meals. The guardian reports that starting this month elderly drivers in aichi prefecture can hand their driver's licenses over to police, receive a certificate in return, and then present that certificate at any of 176 sugakiya restaurant locations to receive a meal of ramen, rice, and salad for about $ 4.50 — a 15 % discount. The certificate also entitles its holder to discounts at public baths, barbershops, and more. A similar plan in other parts of the country gives elderly drivers who voluntarily give up their licenses a discount on buses, trains, and taxis, the miami herald reports. There are 4.8 million drivers over the age of 75 in japan. That's double the number in 2005. And over the past decade, the share of traffic accidents involving elderly drivers has gone from 7.4 % to 12.8 %. The main causes in such accidents include dementia and elderly drivers mixing up the gas and brake pedals, rocket news reports. \"i hope you will surrender your driver's licence and live to the end of your natural lives, \" says a 97-year-old buddhist priest who turned his license over this month, per the guardian. \" it's stupid to try to maintain your licenses just out of pride. \" it's also stupid to pay more than you have to for ramen.",

What was ailing the nonagenarian turned out to be more horrifying than her family could have imagined, and now a judge has ordered the home to pay them $ 250,000 for wrongful death and for violating the illinois nursing home care act, the daily herald reports. After a maggot was spotted moving in mccann's ear on sept. 16, 2012, by a nursing home worker, she was whisked to a local hospital. There, her daughter watched as \" the larvae of flies crawled out of her mother's left ear \" as 57 maggots were removed, chicago tribune originally reported; it's thought that a fly landed in her ear and laid the eggs. Mccann had been diagnosed with wax buildup a little over a week before the maggots were discovered and was prescribed eardrops, cbs news noted; lutheran says she had received drops the night before her hospital visit. \" how can you put drops of medicine in an ear that has 57 maggots? \" the family's lawyer asked cbs in a november 2012 interview. After the maggots were taken out, the herald notes, mccann lost her appetite, started humming, and died a few months later at another nursing home her family had moved her to. \" the maggot infestation in her left ear created this geriatric cascade that led to her death, \" their attorney notes to the herald. The nursing home's administrator told the tribune in 2012 what happened to mccann was simply \" a freak occurrence that has nothing to do with the care she was provided. \" ( an indian man reportedly had 50 maggots taken out of his nose and sinuses. )",

And trying to treat it costs us consumers nearly $ 4 billion a year, reports the huffington post. Now a team of researchers at northwestern is celebrating its findings that a daily full-body application of moisturizing cream for the first six months of a baby's life can cost as little as $ 7 and appears effective at preventing the development of eczema in infants with close family members who have it. \" we could really save a lot of newborns — and save families — a lot of suffering, \" says one of the researchers. \" it's also a pretty good deal in terms of cost. \" there are still many unknowns. It's still unclear, for instance, what causes eczema in the first place, or how moisturizers appear to be preventing it, or even whether certain moisturizers are superior to others, reports reuters. The researchers treated all equally here, though they did sort out the cost of a six-month supply and found that vaseline is the most affordable at 4 cents per application and $ 7.30 over six months, while avinoply was the most expensive at $ 173 over over six months, the researchers report in jama pediatrics. Because petroleum jelly ( vaseline ) is a byproduct of the oil refining process, the huffington post notes that those who prefer an alternative moisturizer might consider sunflower seed oil, the second cheapest option at $ 18.25 over six months.

        "summary": "A man and woman work in the same room all day long. One is perfectly comfortable while the other is freezing her tush off. Sound strange? nope, it's just daily life in offices, according to a new study that says our average building temperature is outdated and favors the bristling male metabolism, the new york times reports. Researchers figured this by placing 16 young women in 75-degree \" respiration chambers \" and measuring their temperatures while they did light office work in summer clothing. The takeaway: their metabolic rate averaged 20 % to 32 % less than the chart we use to design building temperatures. That chart was made in the 1960s and based on a 40-year-old, 154-pound guy wearing a suit and tie, reports the new yorker. Today that model is \" a huge assumption that is a mistake, \" study co-author boris kingma tells the washington post. He reckons women prefer 75 degrees, while a guy likes 70, which is about average for a modern office. And half of today's workers are women, so what now? men in suits and ties could \" take off a piece of clothing, \" kingma says, while others are designing systems to let workers set their own cubicle temperatures. Plus there's a bigger issue: carbon-dioxide-spewing power plants send about 40 % of their energy to residential and commercial buildings, the feds say, so warmer buildings should help reduce climate change. Meanwhile, \" we need to keep pushing \" for ideas because \" the phenomenon of women getting cold is very, very obvious, \" one expert says. ( meanwhile, one theory predicts that a \" mini-ice age \" is coming. )",

The tech giant found that out tuesday when, in what bloomberg calls \" the worst-kept secret in brussels, \" europe's competition chief hit it with a $ 2.7 billion antitrust fine — the largest ever in this kind of case, per the new york times. Google was fined for giving its own comparison shopping service preference over its competitors in its search results, with vestager noting in a european commission statement that google \" abused its market dominance as a search engine, \" keeping other firms from competing and consumers overseas from benefiting from that competition. The ruling notes if the company doesn't make changes within 90 days, it risks more penalties \" of up to 5 % of the average daily worldwide turnover of alphabet, google's parent company, \" which the bbc estimates could amount to $ 14 million a day. The google comparison shopping product, now called \" google shopping, \" hit the eu in 2004, but even though its performance lagged, it still always fell at or near the top in google search results, while rival services were \" demoted. \" google isn't the first silicon valley notable to fall onto vestager's radar: she's also gone after facebook, apple, and amazon, with critics saying her efforts have been overzealous when it comes to american companies. Google, which is expected to appeal the ruling, denies it's done anything untoward, saying competition is booming ( it cites amazon and ebay as examples ) and asserting it has helped boost europe's digital economy.

Michael cosme, devon ayers, and carlos perez were behind bars for 17 years after being convicted of two murders in 1995. They had already been exonerated of killing a cab driver, and two others convicted in that case were freed last month. But cosme, ayers, and perez were still in prison for the second murder, until prosecutors asked a judge to vacate their sentences, the new york times reports. The second slaying had been too closely linked to the first, the prosecutors said. They have 90 days to see if there's any new evidence. William lopez was in prison for 23 years after being convicted of killing a man during a robbery attempt on a drug den in 1989, the wall street journal reports. The only witness to identify lopez as the murderer later admitted to being on a two-day crack bender the night of the killing, and lopez's case was further plagued by defense attorneys who didn't follow up on appeals, investigate evidence that could have cleared lopez, or interview the people who said they were with him at the time of the murder.

In an affidavit filed today, williams ' mother, marsha henson, claimed that she met prince in july of 1976 at a hotel in kansas city, missouri. Shortly thereafter, she claimed in the affidavit, they had sexual intercourse and conceived a son. Nine months later, she gave birth to carlin q. Williams on april 8,",
            "Prince i ' m his long lost son prince: i ' m his long lost son prince has a biological son who is not mentioned in the probate case... At least according to the alleged son. Carlin q. Williams of missouri is 39 years old and filed legal docs claiming his mom met prince in the lobby of the crown center hotel in kansas city, missouri back in july 1976. She says in an affidavit she drank wine with the singer and checked into a room and had unprotected sex. According to carlin's mom, marsha henson, she didn't have sex with anyone 6 weeks before and didn't have sex with anyone during her entire pregnancy. Carlin -- who is currently in federal prison for gun possession -- now wants an order testing prince's dna samples against his to unlock the mystery."

He later characterized it as an ambush interview and said he had been misled about the subject matter ( explaining the schoolkids around him ), per the washington post. But things didn't get much better for the house freedom caucus member at the town hall, where he faced constituents angry at the prospect of diminished coverage. \" this bill, trumpcare — whatever you want to call it — is about the individual market only, \" he said. \" if you're in the group health insurance program through your employers, if you're getting your insurance through the group health insurance, nothing changes. \" but that was met with cries of \" that's not true! \" elsewhere: gop rep.

Radar images show that it shrank about an inch, reports the weather channel. The change may have been greater had the world's tallest peak been directly above the fault line, notes phys.org, but as things stand, everest is still at 29,029 feet. The situation is radically different near the capital of kathmandu, which rose at least 3 feet. \" that's one of the reasons why kathmandu has so much damage, \" a geophysicist from the uk's university of leeds tells livescience. Measurements before and after the 7.8-magnitude quake show that an area 75 miles long and 30 miles wide rose 3 feet, and the rise peaked just 10 miles from the city. Scientists are poring over the radar images not only to get a better sense of the quake's \" anatomy, \" reports the bbc, but to better predict where the next big one may hit.

        "summary": "If placing super premature babies into fluid-filled bags sounds inhumane, consider that they are currently hooked up to invasive machines in sterile compartments with a survival rate around 50 %, with many going on to struggle to do basic things like see, hear, walk, and talk. Researchers testing a new \" bio bag \" on premature lambs are finding surprising success, and hope that in the next decade or so human babies born on the very edge of viability — born after just 23 to 25 weeks gestation — might have a greater chance of survival in a womb-like environment, reports the atlantic. They would be delivered via c-section and placed inside the bio-bag immediately after birth; a drug would prevent them from taking in any air after delivery ( which is what halts lung development ) and they would continue getting oxygen through their umbilical cords once inside the bio-bag. In the us alone, 30,000 babies are born \" critically preterm, \" before 26 weeks, at a time so early in their development they are \" not ready to be here, \" a research fellow at the children's hospital of philadelphia ( chop ) says. After multiple trials, a team at chop says they've hit on a system that closely mimics the womb, with a circuit driven by the fetal heart oxygenating the blood at normal levels through the umbilical cord, reports science. The lambs in the trial continued developing normally in the bio-bags for up to 4 weeks, and one of them has now lived more than a year; more animal testing is in the works, with human testing at least three years away. Researchers say this isn't intended to deliver babies any earlier, but simply to give those born critically preterm a better chance — in a gentler environment — to survive.

The researchers used eight lamb fetuses that were 105 to 115 days old — a level of development comparable to a 23-week-old human fetus. As they floated, the lambs ' brains and organs developed normally. The pinkish creatures opened their eyes, fattened up, and grew coats of white wool. The researchers anticipate the animal studies will be completed within two years, and if approved, the wombs can be tested on human preemies within three to five years. One reason preterm birth is so dangerous is that, for an underweight baby, the first few breaths of air halt the development of the lungs. \"infants that are currently born and supported in a neonatal intensive care unit with gas-based ventilation demonstrate an arrest of lung development, \" partridge says, \"which manifests in a long-term, severe restriction of lung function. \" with the artificial womb, the infant would continue \"breathing \" through the umbilical cord as its floats in amniotic fluid, which would flow into and out of the bag.

        "summary": "Even if there were an equal number of male and female justices on the supreme court, a new study suggests the sexes wouldn't have an equal voice. Researchers at the northwestern pritzker school of law say female justices simply \" do not have an equal opportunity to be heard \" as they've been interrupted three times more often than male justices over the last 12 years, despite speaking less often. During the 2015 term, a female justice interrupted a male colleague seven times at most, per scotusblog. But female justices were interrupted up to 15 times by a single male colleague. Justice sonia sotomayor was interrupted 15 times by justice anthony kennedy, 14 times by justice samuel alito, and 12 times by chief justice john roberts, the study says. Roberts, alito, and kennedy also interrupted justice elena kagan at least 10 times each, while kennedy interrupted justice ruth bader ginsburg 11 times, the researchers say. Though kagan and sotomayor were interrupted more often than ginsburg, the researchers add \" gender is approximately 30 times more influential than seniority. \" not only do the interruptions show a lack of respect, the researchers argue, but they could have deeper implications since \" oral arguments shape case outcomes, \" allowing justices to form opinions and persuade colleagues. The study shows that female justices \" gradually learn to set aside such politeness, \" and develop a sharper tone over time. Researchers say awareness could help solve the issue. But over at jezebel, they think the real solution \" is for men to learn to stop being so in love with the sounds of their own voices. \" ( justices also encounter racism. )",

            "108 pages posted: 16 mar 2017 last revised: 26 dec 2017 date written: october 24, 2017 abstract oral arguments at the supreme court are important — they affect case outcomes and constitute the only opportunity for outsiders to directly witness the behavior of the justices of the highest court. This article studies how the justices compete to have influence at oral argument, by examining the extent to which the justices interrupt each other; it also scrutinizes how advocates interrupt the justices, contrary to the rules of the court. We find that judicial interactions at oral argument are highly gendered, with women being interrupted at disproportionate rates by their male colleagues, as well as by male advocates. Oral argument interruptions are also highly ideological, not only because ideological foes interrupt each other far more than ideological allies do, but we show that conservatives interrupt liberals more frequently than vice versa.

Now three female justices sit on the bench, suggesting that gender equality on the court is suddenly within reach. But equality is not just a question of representation – our new research shows that even when women become justices of the supreme court, they are given less respect than the male justices give one another, and receive less deference from male advocates. Our empirical study examines interruptions among justices, and between the justices and the advocates, during supreme court oral arguments. It shows that women still do not have an equal opportunity to be heard",
            "108 pages posted: 16 mar 2017 last revised: 26 dec 2017 date written: october 24, 2017 abstract oral arguments at the supreme court are important — they affect case outcomes and constitute the only opportunity for outsiders to directly witness the behavior of the justices of the highest court. This article studies how the justices compete to have influence at oral argument, by examining the extent to which the justices interrupt each other; it also scrutinizes how advocates interrupt the justices, contrary to the rules of the court. We find that judicial interactions at oral argument are highly gendered, with women being interrupted at disproportionate rates by their male colleagues, as well as by male advocates. Oral argument interruptions are also highly ideological, not only because ideological foes interrupt each other far more than ideological allies do, but we show that conservatives interrupt liberals more frequently than vice versa. Seniority also",
            "Image via getty. One of the most depressing things about the last year, for women, has been to realize that no matter how far a woman climbs in her career, she will never command the same amount of respect as a man. We saw it when hillary clinton lost to an old guy who doesn't have a brain, again when elizabeth warren was silenced by a guy who doesn't have a neck, and yet again when reporter april ryan was told to \"stop shaking your head \" by a guy who doesn't have a heartbeat. So maybe it's not totally surprising to learn that the former and current female justices on the supreme court — yes, all four of them ( out of 112 total justices ) — aren't treated with the same respect and authority as their male counterparts.

In a ruling this week, pam bondi opposed granting a divorce petition because doing so would have required recognizing the same-sex civil union and declaring the state's marriage laws unconstitutional, reports the miami herald. Some background: heather brassner and former partner megan lade were granted a civil union in vermont in 2002, but brassner says lade disappeared after cheating on her years ago. The florida resident can't get a divorce in absentia if the state won't recognize the union, and vermont can't dissolve the union without an affidavit from lade, whom a private investigator couldn't track down. Brassner fears that without a divorce, lade could do things like use her name to obtain property, reports the new times broward-palm beach. Bondi — who has defended the state's same-sex marriage ban in several lawsuits — argues that a civil union isn't \" equivalent to marriage for purposes of florida's dissolution of marriage laws, \" so brassner's case isn't one in which the 2008 ban can be declared unconstitutional. In august, a federal judge struck down the ban, but he issued a stay delaying the effect of his own order.",

However, it is known that minke whales \" call frequently, \" says nieukirk, and acoustic robots recorded the western pacific biotwang on several occasions between the fall of 2014 and spring of 2015. \" it's very distinct, with all these crazy parts, \" nieukirk says in a statement. \" the low-frequency moaning part is typical of baleen whales, and it's that kind of twangy sound that makes it really unique. \" if the sound is confirmed to come from a baleen whale, it would be significant as identifying a new baleen-whale call is a rare occurrence. It's unclear what the call might mean — a mating call would only be heard seasonally — but researchers plan to collect biopsy samples to learn more, reports the christian science monitor. ( the mariana trench is quite noisy. And dirty. )",

        "summary": "Chatter about a michael keaton comeback was inevitable when early press started trickling out about birdman, but he's surpassed expectations and \" soars \" in the role ( as more than one media outlet describes his performance ). The surreal movie by alejandro gonzález iñárritu, which documents washed-up actor riggan thomson trying to launch his own revival on broadway, also stars emma stone, zach galifianakis, and edward norton. Some highlights from critics: peter travers gives the movie four stars at rolling stone, writing that he's \" jazzed by every tasty, daring, devastating, howlingly funny, how'd-they-do-that minute \" of the film. He calls director iñárritu a \" risk-taking mexican visionary, \" informs us that cinematographer emmanuel lubezki is a \" camera genius, \" and raves about the actors, especially keaton, who \" delivers the best performance of his career \" in a \" potent, pinballing tour de force. \" as for the haters travers predicts this \" cinematic whirlwind \" will provoke, he has some advice: \" they can all go piss off. \" the meta nature of the film isn't lost on aa dowd over at the av club, who writes about \" the casting coup of the year: aging former movie star who once played a winged superhero returns as an aging former movie star who once played a winged superhero. \" as keaton stomps around on screen, \" cursed/blessed with terrible facial hair, and always walking or yelling or arguing with himself, \" he \" hasn't seemed this alive in years. Maybe ever. \" at usa today, claudia puig points out all the other facets of life that the movie explores through one man's midlife crisis, writing, \" birdman delivers an incisive commentary on celebrity culture, ambition, social media, and fractured families. \" it doesn't sound like it's for the weak of heart, though: she adds that the movie \" plunges the audience into a state of riveted, heightened apprehension, then catapults viewers to bizarre heights. It can be exhausting but supremely exhilarating. \" meanwhile, peter rainer isn't as impressed with the film, taking the entire plot to task in his christian science monitor review and stating that birdman \" never makes the case that riggan had a talent worth redeeming. … why, then, should we care about the ambitions of a mediocre actor with delusions of artistic grandeur? \" he adds that keaton's \" tightly controlled, indrawn performance has its fair share of blahness \" and calls the film \" tone-deaf \" when it comes to its knowledge of both broadway and hollywood.",

        "summary": "A judge's highly unusual order has added an extra layer of controversy to a contentious child death case in canada. Last month, david stephan was sentenced to four months in prison and his wife, collet stephan, was sentenced to three months of house arrest for failing to provide the \" necessaries of life \" for their 19-month-old son. Ezekiel died from bacterial meningitis in 2012 after the alberta couple ignored advice to seek medical treatment and instead used naturopathic remedies. But justice rodney jerke also ordered collet stephan to post unedited copies of the decision to social media accounts and websites associated with the family.

The judge's sentencing decision includes a timeline of events that describes how the stephans continued to treat ezekiel with remedies like garlic and horseradish after a nurse — and even a receptionist at a naturopathic clinic — urged them to take the ailing boy to a doctor. The judge also ordered the stephans to take their three surviving children to a doctor once a year, reports the huffington post.

The businessman says that after he logged into his own uber account on his wife's phone and then logged out again, a glitch in the app caused her to keep receiving notifications whenever he used the service, arousing her suspicions that he was having an affair and leading her to file for divorce, reports le figaro. The first hearing in the case is scheduled for march. \" uber doesn't publicly comment on individual cases, and especially those which concern things such as a divorce procedure, \" the company said in a statement. The local predicts that the glitch could lead to similar lawsuits, though not from android users: the problem appears to be confined to iphone ios versions of the uber app that were updated after dec. 16 last year.
