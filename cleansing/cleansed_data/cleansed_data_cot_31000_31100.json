        "summary": "A friend of boston marathon bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev was convicted today of two counts of lying to fbi investigators about the 2013 attack, the ap reports. Robel phillipos, now 21, was accused of lying to agents about being in tsarnaev's dorm room on april 18, 2013 — three days after the bombing — and watching as two other friends removed a backpack that allegedly contained tsarnaev's things, including fireworks, the boston globe reports. Phillipos ' attorneys argued that the then-19-year-old was \" high out of his mind \" on marijuana and couldn't remember everything that happened that day and that he signed the confession put in front of him by the fbi because he was frightened. Perhaps the most surprising defense witness: former massachusetts gov. Michael dukakis, reportedly a good friend of phillipos ' mother, a social worker in cambridge. Dukakis, who testified that he took phillipos with him to the 2004 democratic national convention in boston, said that he talked to phillipos on the phone on april 20 after the teen had been grilled by the fbi for five hours; dukakis said that phillipos indicated \" he was so confused he was not sure what he'd said \" to agents, carl stevens of wbz news radio tweeted. Dias kadyrbayev and azamat tazhayakov, the friends who removed the backpack, have already been convicted for conspiracy and obstruction of justice, the boston herald reports; phillipos ' lawyer argued that \" this is a case about a kid high out of his mind, saying, ' i don't remember.'they're not saying he destroyed evidence. They're not saying he touched evidence. He committed no crime. \" until his sentencing on jan. 29, when he could receive up to 16 years in federal prison, phillipos will be under house arrest and wearing a gps bracelet.",

        "summary": "A new batch of cholesterol-lowering drugs could bring new hope to patients who can't take popular statins, or for those who don't feel their effects. Today, an fda advisory committee recommended approval of amgen's repatha, reports ap, just one day after it gave the green light to a similar drug called praluent from sanofi and regeneron. Both self-injected drugs are designed to lower ldl cholesterol ( the \" bad cholesterol \" ) and belong to a class of drugs known as pcsk9 inhibitors, healthday reports. Early studies suggest they lower ldl more effectively than statins. The fda will make its decision this summer, but is expected to follow the committee's advice, reports cnn, which calls the drugs \" the most important new class of cholesterol-lowering medications since the first statin was approved in 1987. \" however, \" definitive evidence \" on whether they actually reduce heart attacks and deaths won't be out until 2017, after long-term trials, reports the new york times. While statins are proven to prevent heart attack and stroke, they don't work for everyone, and up to 25 % of statin users battle side effects like muscle pain, which hasn't appeared in trials of pcsk9 inhibitors, notes cnn. However, some patients on pcsk9 inhibitors have reported being confused and unable to focus. \" for all those patients unable to take statins, finally there might be an option that can change ( their ) outcomes, \" says a cardiologist not involved in the research. \" we need to patiently wait for the next phase of trials to see whether the clinical outcomes are as promising as the initial studies suggest. \" the downside: most estimates say the drugs could cost $ 10,000 per year, while statins cost a few hundred dollars per year.",

The ban on niqabs ( veils that cover all of the face except the eyes ) and burkas ( full body-and-face coverings that usually have just a mesh opening to peer through ) was included in a 35-page packet of policies meant to counteract the ascension of the ultra-conservative freedom party, per the independent. \" we believe in an open society that is also based on open communication, \" reads the document, which adds that face-hiding coverings in public spaces \" stand against that \" open communication.

        "summary": "Ukraine has ordered all of its troops to evacuate from crimea starting at 3pm today, after russia seized one of its last remaining military installations in the peninsula. Russian forces seized the marine base after attacking from two directions early this morning using armored personnel carriers and stun grenades, a ukrainian official tells the bbc, in the third such attack in 48 hours. Ukrainian officers were taken away for questioning with their hands tied, officials tells reuters. In other developments: russia moved on the base just before president obama arrived in the netherlands for urgent talks with allies, reports voice of america. He is in the country for a nuclear security summit, but is expected to focus on the ukraine crisis and has called a meeting of g7 leaders to discuss tougher sanctions on russia. Acting president oleksander turchinov said he was ordering the evacuation because russia had threatened the lives and health of ukrainian service staff and their families. \" despite the huge losses, ukrainian forces in crimea have fulfilled their duty, \" buying time for ukrainian forces to regroup he said, in what reuters characterizes as an attempt to put a \" brave face \" on troops ' inability to defend their bases. Moscow, meanwhile, is stepping up economic pressure on kiev's government, the new york times finds. The border has been closed to most trucks, a ukrainian factory in russia has been shut down, and the price of natural gas has been raised — again. Russia gave ukraine a discount on gas to pay rent for the crimean base where its black sea fleet is station, a discount moscow says is no longer warranted because crimea is now russian territory. As russia tightened its grip on crimea, nato's top commander warned of a huge buildup of russian forces on ukraine's border, cnn reports. Gen. Philip breedlove warned that the \" very, very sizable and very, very ready \" russian force could easily storm right across ukraine to moldova's separatist, pro-russia trans-dniester region. \" there is absolutely sufficient force postured on the eastern border of ukraine to run to trans-dniester if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome, \" the general said.",

( associated press ) the contentious tax overhaul is beginning to deliver a change that many will welcome — bigger paychecks. Workers are starting to see more take-home pay as employers implement the new withholding guidelines from the irs, which dictate how much employers withhold from pay for federal taxes. Those whose checks have remained the same shouldn't fret — employers have until feb. 15 to make the changes. Treasury secretary steven mnuchin has estimated that the new rules will mean more take-home pay for about 90 percent of american workers.

Meanwhile, trump described meetings at the summit as \"great \" on twitter, and upon returning stateside, tweeted, \"just returned from europe. Trip was a great success for america.

When researchers followed up at later intervals, about 40 % of the stories — or \" flashbulb memories, \" as they're called in the vernacular — had changed. \"human memory is not like a computer, \" says study author william hirst of the new school for social research. \"human memory is extremely fallible. \" one quirk: the stories tended to change fairly early, say in the first year, and then remain constant after that. \"you begin to weave a very coherent story, \" says hirst. \"and when you have a structured, coherent story, it's retained for a very long period of time. \" another 9/11 study suggests that the stress of the day took a toll on the heart health of americans, even those far removed from the attacks. Researchers in utah discovered a spike in heart attacks in the months after 9/11, along with telltale changes in dna strands called telomeres that are affected by stress, reports the salt lake tribune.

        "summary": "A weekend camping trip may be the solution to everything from a lack of productivity at work to diabetes, according to a study published thursday in current biology. Melatonin levels in the body regulate the body's sleep schedule, increasing when it's time for bed and falling when it's time to wake up. But npr reports most people's melatonin levels don't fall until a few hours after they wake up because our modern environment has thrown the body's natural circadian rhythm all out of wack. This creates a kind of minor jet lag every morning. The problem is a combination of too little natural light during the day and too much artificial light at night. A simple fix? get back to nature. Researchers sent groups of subjects into the colorado wilderness to do a little camping without artificial lights of any kind, the bbc reports. According to a press release, just two days of camping in the summer caused melatonin levels to rise 1.4 hours earlier. A week of camping in the winter caused them to rise a whopping 2.6 hours earlier. Campers were going to bed earlier and sleeping more to fit with nature's — and the body's — natural rhythm. Past studies have shown that healthier sleep patterns can reduce the risk of heart attack, mood disorders, obesity, and more. For those who can't go camping, researchers suggest getting as much natural light as possible during the day and turning off phones, tvs, and laptops well before bed. ( nonstop artificial light might even affect your bones. )",

And while nine democrats joined republicans in favor of the bill, the total of 62 falls short of the two-thirds majority that would be necessary to override the president's promised veto. Before it hits obama's desk, however, the bill has to be reconciled with one that passed the house. The wall street journal predicts that will happen within a week. The white house today reiterated that obama will not sign the measure as long as a state department review of the pipeline remains in progress. That might be finished this month, reports politico, which sums up the state of keystone like this: \" despite the intensity of the debate in congress, keystone is still largely where it began: a symbol to republicans of the white house's hostility to fossil fuels, and to democrats as another effort by gop to do the bidding of big oil. \"",

No face is visible and weiner's office denies the pic is of the congressman. \"the weiner gags never get old, i guess, \" the congressman tells politico. But some news outlets — particularly andrew brietbart's big government site — say no way, and that weiner is lying. Critics point out that weiner had earlier tweeted about an appearance on rachel maddow's program, including a hashtag about what time that would appear in seattle. The woman in question has deleted all her social media accounts. \" if nothing else, it does look to have been a very unusual night on twitter for representative weiner, \" said dan riehl, a writer at big government.",

An endometrial \" scratch \" more than doubles a woman's chances of getting pregnant, researchers report in a press release, but they also urge caution because their findings are based on a review of eight trials whose quality was, on the whole, \" low. \" experts say the line of inquiry began thanks to a chance finding when israeli scientists studying endometrial cells under a microscope realized that a noticeable number of women were getting pregnant the month following the biopsy, reports the telegraph. The review found that the scratch increased the chances of a live birth from 9 % to between 14 % and 28 %. The scratch has become increasingly popular not too many decades after the similar \" dilation and curettage \" procedure — in which the lining of the uterus was essentially scraped — following a miscarriage was abandoned due to lack of evidence. Major international trials are now underway to put these findings to the test, especially given it's still unclear exactly how the simple procedure impacts fertility. Some theorize that scratching the lining of the womb stimulates cell regeneration, while others suggest it could trigger a beneficial inflammation, reports sbs. Study head sarah lensen of the university of auckland calls endometrial scratch a \" cheap and simple procedure, \" but warns that the results \" must be treated with caution \" until more rigorous studies weigh in.

( aap ) the jury is still out on whether the procedure known as \" endometrial scratch \" should be recommended to women wanting to conceive. Scratching the inside of the womb before conceiving a baby may double the chances of a successful birth, research suggests. But experts urged caution over the study findings and stressed that \" endometrial scratch \" was not a pleasant procedure. They said there was insufficient evidence to recommend such a step to ordinary couples wanting to conceive naturally. International trials are now under way to investigate whether the procedure might be worth considering for women undergoing ivf ( in-vitro fertilisation ) treatment. Endometrial scratch involves causing a small injury to the lining of the womb using a catheter tube about the thickness of a straw. The idea is that doing this somehow makes the womb \" stickier \" and more receptive to the embryo, which stands a greater chance of implanting. A review of eight trials with more than 1000 women planning to undergo insemination or conceive spontaneously appeared to show that endometrial scratching really does improve the odds of giving birth. The study was conducted by researchers from the cochrane collaboration, which assesses medical evidence to inform policy makers. Based on the trials analysed, it found that endometrial scratch roughly doubled the chance of live birth compared with no intervention. The procedure increased the normal likelihood of a successful live birth or ongoing pregnancy over a set amount of time from around 9 per cent to between 14 and 28 per cent. However, sarah lensen from the university of auckland in new zealand, who led the review, pointed out that research evidence was not of a high standard. She said: \" the results must be treated with caution. \" the findings were presented at the annual meeting of the european society of human reproduction and biology ( eshre ) taking place in finland. British experts said despite its increasing popularity the jury was still out on whether endometrial scratch should be recommended.

City officials have latched onto an idea by a landscape architecture student, who himself was inspired by a city councilperson's joke decades ago: \" why don't we just crack the fire hydrants open, flood the streets, and let people skate to work in the winter? \" matthew gibbs built on that idea to suggest an approximately seven-mile \" freezeway. \" essentially, it's a highway to be used by commuters and others on ice skates. The freezeway, gibbs says in a video, would \" promote winter programming, active lifestyles, sustainable forms of transportation, ( and ) social activity, \" the bbc notes. It would also be a major tourist attraction, boosting the city's \" identity. \" and there's already a good site for the project: old rail lines that go into downtown edmonton. In case it sounds nuts, it's worth noting that other cities have ice-skating trails: popular science points to ottawa's rideau canal skateway, which has been around for 45 years, the cbc reports. Next winter could see a pilot project for edmonton's freezeway, which wouldn't go to waste in the summer, gibbs notes on youtube: it would be a bike path.

But rather than just trying to survive the winter, one canadian city is trying to turn it into an asset. With an average temperature of -12c ( 9.5f ) in the heart of winter, and home to seven city-owned outdoor skating rinks, edmonton, alberta is no stranger to the cold. Unlike other cities in the us and canada that have banned activities such as tobogganing because of insurance costs, edmonton has no such laws. Now the city is considering flooding an 11km route for residents to commute through the city on skates. It's called the freezeway. Organisers are planning a pilot project for as early as next winter. The premise first came about years ago, as an offhand comment from a civic leader with an environmental bent. \" why don't we just crack the fire hydrants open, flood the streets and let people skate to work in the winter? \" teased city councillor tooker gomberg, in the 1990s.

Years later, she was convicted again after agreeing to pick up a package for a friend, which she later learned contained drugs. She's one of hundreds of thousands of legal permanent residents with one or two misdemeanor convictions whom donald trump has promised to deport, reports the new york times. But she has one final hope. More than 100 advocacy groups are urging president obama to pardon the civil immigration violations of up to 200,000 green card holders now eligible for deportation under federal immigration law before he leaves office. Obama's pardon can't be applied to the individuals ' crimes, which violated state rather than federal law. But according to the constitution, it could be applied to any \" offenses \" against the us, which include civil immigration violations, advocates say. This has never been done before but would give obama, the so-called \" deporter in chief \" — who oversaw the deportation of more than 2.5 million immigrants, per the ap — an opportunity to reshape his legacy, advocates say. \" these are people he said it makes no sense to rip out of their american families, \" a law professor tells the guardian, after making the case for such a pardon in a new york times op-ed in july. \" it's really a moment where we are going to see whether he lives up to the commitment to those communities. \" and while liz says that \" mistakes in life have to be looked at case by case, \" she says of obama: \" i think god has given me the strength to accept whatever decision he makes. \"",

        "summary": "Shares for two big corrections companies took a deep dive thursday after a report that the justice department is moving away from using private prisons, with the eventual goal of no private prisons under its umbrella at all, cnbc reports. Prison companies geo and corrections corporation of america saw more than 40 % drops in their share prices after a memo issued by deputy ag sally yates was reported by the washington post, with instructions for prison officials to not renew contracts with private operators or to \" substantially reduce \" what the contracts cover. The end goal: \" reducing — and ultimately ending — our use of privately operated prisons, \" upon which the federal bureau of prisons spent $ 639 million in fiscal 2014, per an office of the inspector general report issued this month. Yates ' memo notes the 13 private prisons under the bureau's watch, holding about 12 % of the bureau's total prison population, aren't as safe as those run by the feds, don't offer notable cost-savings, and don't have the \" same level of correctional services, programs, and resources \" as government-run facilities. An in-depth report by mother jones in its july/august issue by a journalist who went undercover to work in a private louisiana prison highlighted some of those issues. The three private companies that run the contracts for the private prisons, which david shapiro calls a \" public shame \" in the chicago sun-times, are already expressing discontent with the ig's report, with the president of management and training corporation writing in response that comparing private prisons to federally run ones is like \" comparing apples and oranges. \" ( bernie sanders is against private prisons. )",

Now, with the news that china's ruling communist party has proposed scrapping the clause that president and vice president \" shall serve no more than two consecutive terms \" from the constitution, a path may be opening that would allow xi to rule for life. Five takes on the news: bloomberg, brendan scott: \" the move shows the speed with which xi has consolidated power over a fifth of humanity, sidelining rivals and silencing dissent. And it provides short-term stability to investors who have come to view xi as a steady — if heavy — hand as china manages slowing growth, increasing middle-class demands and expanding global clout. \" new york times, chris buckley and keith bradsher: \" the timing of the announcement startled even experienced observers of chinese politics: mr. Xi completes his first term as president next month and could have waited until late in his second term to act. He also could have stepped down after his second term and run the country from behind the scenes, as some of his predecessors have. \" blog of china expert jerome cohen: \" term limits for the leadership are not usually found in dictatorships. The... Proposed abolition of china's presidential term limit means that it has forgotten one of the main lessons of mao's long despotism. The two-term limit... Reflected a widespread desire to prevent the return of one-man dictatorship. Its abolition signals the likelihood of another long period of severe repression.... Xi decided to strike while the iron is hot rather than wait for later in his new term when increasing problems might have made the change more difficult. \" guardian: \" bill bishop, the publisher of the sinocism newsletter on chinese politics, said the move confirmed xi's mutation into a species of ' putin-plus ' — only xi was ' much more effective, much more powerful and, frankly, much more ambitious'than his russian counterpart. \" washington post, simon denyer: in an otherwise critical piece, denyer sees \" a potential upside to all of this. Xi has already used his power to implement a far-reaching crackdown on corruption, even if it has also been used to instill obedience and eliminate rivals.

Even more distressing to the community: this same church was torched in 1995 by kkk members, notes the ap. \" that was a tough thing to see, \" a county councilman says. \" it is hurting those people again. \" after the church burned 20 years ago, the two klan members responsible were sent to prison for almost 20 years each, and then-president bill clinton came to speak in greeleyville. \" we cannot let someone come into our democratic home, the home of our faith, and start torching our houses of worship, \" he said at the time, per the ap. Investigators were on the scene this morning, combing through debris and taking pictures, though a federal law enforcement source not authorized to discuss the case publicly tells the ap that arson wasn't the cause, based on preliminary findings. Another possibility that's been floated: the church caught fire after a lightning strike ( there were storms in the area last night, nbc notes ). Either way, \" it's gone, \" state rep. Cezar mcknight tells the post and courier. \" south carolina has been through a lot the last two weeks and we've made the best of a terrible situation.

Men's curling team after matt hamilton competed in the mixed doubles event. Hamilton is back as the no. 2 on the men's team, joining skip john shuster, lead john landsteiner, third tyler george, and alternate joe polo for the four man u.s. Team in the men's curling competition. While the u.s. Team isn't considered one of the favorites in pyeongchang, they do have experience and an outside chance at a medal when round robin play begins tuesday night. Here's everything you need to know about each member of team usa: he returned to the olympics at the 2010 vancouver and 2014 sochi winter games, both times as skip of his own rink. Credit: usa today sports john shuster, skip 35 years old from chisholm, minnesota olympic experience – three previous, bronze medal in 2006 shuster was a member of the only u.s. Team to ever medal in olympic curling when he won bronze in the 2006 torino games. He now will make his third straight appearance as the skip of the men's team. Since the last olympics, as leader of the u.s. Team he led them to a fifth place finish at the 2015 world championships, third place in 2016 and fourth place in 2017. Shuster said the most important role of a skip is \"really diving into the strategy of the sport and really trying to understand what makes their team and teammates great. \" the biggest change for shuster since 2014 has been a new commitment to the gym. He's lost 30 pounds since the last olympics in which the u.s. Finished in ninth place out of 10 teams. He said he prepared for pyeongchang much differently"

        "summary": "Hope santa has a summer outfit on hand. The new york times reports scientists have been \" startled \" by the extremely warm temperatures in the arctic over the past two months. In mid-november, some areas of the arctic were more than 35 degrees above average, while mean temperatures for the month were 23 degrees warmer than normal. But wait, there's more: reuters reports that temperatures at the north pole neared the melting point on thursday. It was 24.8 degrees at midday; a normal temperature for this time of year is -22 degrees. A new study published wednesday on climate central ties the recent record temperatures in the arctic to human causes, such as greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, noaa's arctic program released its arctic report card 2016 earlier this month, and it wasn't good — even before the extreme warmth of november and december. This summer, the arctic had the second lowest extent of sea ice since 1979. It had the lowest extent of spring snow cover since 1967. Mashable reports it's been the warmest year in the arctic since at least 1900. In fact, the arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the earth. Returning to the times, experts warn the current record-low ice coverage will only make warming worse this coming summer because there will be less surface area to reflect the sun's rays. \" we're going to be watching the summer of 2017 very closely, \" noaa's jeremy mathis says.",

Roskomnadzor has the power to block websites the russian government doesn't want its people to see, and the agency used that power tuesday to block access to youporn and pornhub — the world's most popular porn sites — among others, the independent reports. The sites were accused of \" spreading information that is detrimental to the development of children, \" according to newsweek. The ban presumably meant some russian internet users found themselves with extra free time, which they used to complain about the ban online, the bbc reports. The lead singer of pussy riot called the blocking of pornhub a \" blow below the belt, \" while pornhub itself tried to tempt roskomnadzor into removing the ban by offering the agency a pornhub premium account. Some russians even took to asking the us for \" pornographic asylum. \" but roskomnadzor was less than sympathetic, suggesting on twitter that anyone feeling put out after losing access to their favorite porn sites \" could try and meet someone in real life \" instead. A russian court will rule on whether the ban on pornhub and youporn remains in place at some point in the future, the moscow times reports.",

A death warrant hanging over his head, dante alighieri fled the city of florence in 1302, never to return again. The father of the italian language was charged with fraud and extortion after becoming entangled in a feud between rival noble families. Living most of his remaining years in verona, dante's persecution wasn't all bad: it was during this time that he wrote his masterpiece, the divine comedy, which satirized his enemies and florentine politics. He died in ravenna in 1321. It was a magistrate named cante gabrielli who had signed the order sentencing dante to burn at the stake, and now gabrielli's hometown wants to make up for that fact. Gubbio, in umbria, is seeking pardon for its ( admittedly distant ) role in persecuting dante because officials feel it is the town's \" moral responsibility \" to do so, per a spokesperson. The town council voted 19 to five to revoke dante's exile, and also presented his descendants with its highest honor, the golden florin. \" we don't intend this to be a reprisal against ( gabrielli ), but rather highlight an event that changed the course of literary history, \" says gubbio's mayor. Last year, italy celebrated the 750th anniversary of dante's birth, prompting other mea culpas — not all of them welcome. One of dante's descendants rejected florence's efforts to present him with that city's golden florin, reports the guardian; count pieralvise serego alighieri said the florentines were not sorry enough. There was no word on whether he would accept gubbio's apology.",

Born into a noble family that had fallen onto hard times in florence, dante found himself on the wrong side of the bitter feud between the rival guelphs and ghibellines. He was accused of crimes that included fraud and taking bribes, and when he failed to turn up to face the charges, was sentenced to be burnt at the stake. Dante fled into exile in 1302 and never saw florence again. The death warrant was signed by cante gabrielli, a powerful magistrate who originally came from gubbio in umbria, and the town has now asked to be belatedly pardoned, albeit seven centuries after the event.

Lexington police said that officers were called to the 3600 block of appian way to assist a teenager who had burned himself after watching the \"fire challenge \" videos online, wykt-tv reports. The teen, whose name was not given, mimicked the online videos by pouring rubbing alcohol on his body and then setting himself on fire. \"unbearable, yeah, basically, \" said the teen who suffered second-degree burns. \"literally after it got put out it was already blistering, it's just hard. \" videos of the \"fire challenge \" also show teens spraying themselves with aerosol cans before lighting portions of their body on fire in order to singe off their own hair.

        "summary": "As astronomers get a better look at the planets circling other stars, it's becoming increasingly apparent that our solar system is pretty strange — and jupiter seems to be the reason why. Most other solar systems appear to have at least one large planet orbiting very close to the star, but the inner part of our solar system is missing, according to a study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. The researchers believe jupiter's orbit wandered during the early years of our solar system, with the giant planet's gravity causing destruction by, as discovery puts it, flinging proto-planets around and \" creating a shooting arcade that could have easily destroyed planets in the region, \" including the \" super-earths \" that appear in the \" default mode \" of solar system formation. The research is based on the \" grand tack \" theory, which holds that jupiter migrated toward the sun and then back out again with the influence of saturn. The destruction allowed a second generation of planets, including ours, to form out of the debris, researchers say, but the theory could mean that planets capable of sustaining life as we know it may be rarer than the number of other planets spotted suggests. \" in the context of our hypothesis, earth-mass planets should be very common, \" researcher greg laughlin tells the christian science monitor. \" truly earth-like planets, however, with solid surfaces and atmospheric pressures similar to what we have here on earth, would be expected to be rather rare. I would hazard a guess that the earth will indeed turn out to be rather special. \" ( a vast ocean has been detected inside jupiter's biggest moon. )",

        "summary": "Scientists have stumbled upon the oldest known fossil of a hand bone that looks a lot like one found in your own hand, though this one is at least 1.84 million years old. Found in olduvai gorge in tanzania, the hominin bone — likely from the pinky of a left hand, reports livescience — is remarkable for a couple of reasons: first, it suggests the humanlike hand, which evolved to make and use tools, dates back 400,000 years earlier than scientists previously believed, upi reports, via the study in nature. Until this discovery, researchers weren't entirely sure when our ancestors ' hands, with curved finger bones for hanging in trees, straightened out. \" this bone belongs to somebody who's not spending any time in the trees at all, \" lead researcher manuel domínguez-rodrigo tells new scientist. He adds the hominin likely used tools more often than its predecessors. Second, the bone suggests its owner, an unidentified and possibly unknown human relative, was much taller than other hominins, standing five feet, nine inches. At about 1.4 inches long, the bone is \" the same size as the equivalent bone in our hand, \" says domínguez-rodrigo. He believes the species falls somewhere between modern humans and tree-dwellers like homo habilis — about three feet tall — and paranthropus boisei on the evolutionary scale. The hominin's size could help explain why early sites in olduvai include ancient animal carcasses that weighed up to 770 pounds. \" i always had trouble understanding how homo habilis... Could efficiently hunt animals that big, \" the researcher says. \" now, the new discovery shows that a bigger and more modern-looking creature existed at the time these sites were formed. \" ( some argue early human hands changed little over millions of years. )",

        "summary": "Harambe the gorilla is becoming the most talked-about animal since cecil the lion — and his death is just as controversial. On tuesday, police and prosecutors confirmed that the shooting at the cincinnati zoo is being investigated, and they haven't ruled out criminal charges against the parents of the boy who fell into the gorilla exhibit on saturday, the cincinnati enquirer reports. Police now say the boy is 3 years old, not 4 as earlier reported. The us department of agriculture is also investigating the incident. A roundup of coverage: jane goodall wrote to the zoo's director to express her sympathies, time reports. \" it looked as though the gorilla was putting an arm round the child, \" the world-renowned expert wrote in an email made public by her foundation. In a facebook post, former gorilla handler amanda o'donoughue explains why she believes the zoo did the right thing, and why she thinks the gorilla was not trying to protect the boy, as it appears to goodall. The cincinnati enquirer speaks to jerry stones at the gladys porter zoo in brownsville, texas, who looked after harambe for the first 15 years of his life. The \" fun-loving and intelligent \" gorilla \" was like one of my sons, \" stones says. \" he was beautiful and a true character — so mischievous and not aggressive. \" he says that since he wasn't there, he isn't going to comment on the controversy, but he has set up the harambe fund to help harambe's critically endangered species. The stop animal exploitation now animal rights group requested a usda investigation, reports cnn. The group cited previous usda reports from the zoo, including a report from march this year detailing the escape of two polar bears into a service hallway. The new york times reports that donald trump spoke about the killing on tuesday, saying it was a \" very tough call \" for the zoo. They probably had no choice, he said, but \" it was amazing because there were moments with the gorilla, the way he held that child, it was almost like a mother holding a baby. \" in an opinion piece at the guardian, ijeoma oluo says there should be no \" parent-shaming \" over the zoo incident, because it could happen to any mother. Small children \" have an innate sense of curiosity matched with the inability to comprehend danger, \" she writes. \" add to that small size, surprisingly quick movement, and a creativity forgotten in adulthood, and you have a recipe for never-ending possible disaster. \"",

Per the new york times, the agency said the proposal would come this week as part of a more aggressive stance against the tobacco. It's unclear how long it would take for such a plan to take effect and tobacco companies could drag out the process by challenging a ban. While regulators under previous administrations have considered similar moves, president trump's current fda commissioner, scott gottlieb, has made the reduction of smoking-related disease a priority. Menthol cigarettes have been identified by some experts as an even greater health risk than non-flavored cigarettes because the minty compound makes smoking feel less harsh and increases the potential for addiction. Gottlieb has not commented on the issue. As bloomberg notes, news of the potential ban sent stocks of marlboro maker altria group inc. Falling on friday. Shares of british american tobacco, which makes newport cigarettes, also took a nosedive, falling more on friday than in the last four years.

Doing so would be a step toward eliminating or tightly limiting use of the popular cigarette flavor, something the fda has been considering for some time.

Instead, the justices will face lower-profile but still consequential legal questions that may allow them to find ways to bridge the usual ideological divides.

        "summary": "The details about the kidnapping and safe recovery of a wisconsin infant are firming up, with the baby's 31-year-old aunt in custody. Incredibly, it now appears that 5-day-old kayden powell was left outside for more than 24 hours in frigid temperatures, swaddled in blankets inside a plastic storage container. He's fine. The kidnapping: police say kristen smith of denver, who is the step-sister of the baby's mother, faked her own pregnancy, told people she had given birth, and drove to beloit, wis., where newborn kayden powell was home from the hospital, reports the milwaukee journal sentinel. She stayed overnight with the family but left about 2am thursday with kayden, say police. The arrest: when mom brianna marshall discovered he was gone at 4: 30 am, suspicion immediately fell on smith. Police spoke to her by cell phone about an hour later, and she agreed to pull off i-80 at a gas station in west branch, iowa, about 200 miles away. Authorities allege she abandoned the baby at another gas station on the same street before being taken into custody. Prosthetic belly: smith denied taking kayden, and police found baby clothes and a prosthetic belly in her car, reports the chicago tribune. At one point, she told police that kayden and his parents were going to come live with her in denver. Her facebook account and cell phone showed she had made fake pregnancy and birth announcements. Police took her into custody, but still didn't know where kayden was. Amazing discovery: the baby remained missing for another day, until the police chief in west branch looked inside a plastic bin behind the second gas station about 10: 15am yesterday. \" you could have knocked me over with a feather, \" chief mike horihan tells the gazette of cedar rapids. Police say smith admitted to the abduction after kayden was found and charged her with kidnapping. Chilling detail: the baby's great-uncle, who owns the home where kayden was staying with his parents, tells ap that he found a paring knife by the empty bassinet the next morning. \" i could have woke up to a bloody mess, \" he says.",

The pictures teresa seely posted on facebook tuesday show her son andrew with eyes swollen shut after the incident at alpha chi rho, an off-campus fraternity at central michigan university. \" he could have died, \" his father tells cbs news. The alleged prankster tells wdiv in detroit that he didn't know andrew had an allergy and says the stunt was \" just college students being kids. \" seely's father isn't buying it, saying his son had made a point to tell the frat of his allergy and even wore a medical bracelet. A professor took the teen to a campus health clinic, where he recovered, say his parents. The incident occurred in october, but seely's parents learned of it only this week and reported it immediately to police and campus authorities. \"obviously this is very concerning and we take these things very seriously, \" says a school official. The frat isn't recognized by the school, having been given the boot in 2011 because of hazing. The national fraternity also says the cmu chapter is operating unofficially. Members offered to pay for seely's medical bills and said they never meant for him to get hurt. On thursday, they turned away fox32news and said they'd contacted an attorney. Seely, meanwhile, has since transferred to another college. \"we thought we were sending our child off to school in a safe environment, \" teresa seely tells the detroit free press, \" and obviously that wasn't the case. \"",

            "Cfsan/office of food additive safety april 20, 2007 fda has completed its review concerning the long-term carcinogenicity study of aspartame entitled, \" long-term carcinogenicity bioassays to evaluate the potential biological effects, in particular carcinogenic, of aspartame administered in feed to sprague-dawley rats, \" conducted by the european ramazzini foundation ( erf ), located in bologna, italy. Fda reviewed the study data made available to them by erf and finds that it does not support erf's conclusion that aspartame is a carcinogen. Additionally, these data do not provide evidence to alter fda's conclusion that the use of aspartame is safe. Aspartame was first approved in the united states in 1981 and is one of the most widely used artificial sweeteners. When metabolized by the body, aspartame is broken down into two common amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, and a third substance, methanol. These three substances are available in similar or greater amounts from eating common foods. Upon first learning of the erf study results, fda requested the data from erf to evaluate the findings. On february 28, 2006, the agency received only a portion of the study data requested. In june 2006, fda asked erf to provide the remainder of the study data initially requested and also offered to review pathology slides from the study. Erf did not submit additional data to fda and did not agree to fda's review of the pathology slides. Fda could not conduct a complete and definitive review of the study because erf did not provide the full study data. Based on the available data, however, we have identified significant shortcomings in the design, conduct, reporting, and interpretation of this study. Fda finds that the reliability and interpretation of the study outcome is compromised by these shortcomings and uncontrolled variables, such as the presence of infection in the test animals. Additionally, the data that were provided to fda do not appear to support the aspartame-related findings reported by erf. Based on our review, pathological changes were incidental and appeared spontaneously in the study animals, and none of the histopathological changes reported appear to be related to treatment with aspartame. Fda believes that additional insight on the study findings could be provided by an internationally-sponsored pathology working group examination of appropriate tissue slides from the study. Considering results from the large number of studies on aspartame",

According to the ap, those dozens of newly reported assets could be worth between $ 10.6 million and $ 51 million. Kushner was required to divulge all of his assets when he joined the white house as an adviser. A lawyer advising kushner says updating a financial disclosure is above board and kushner has \" followed each of the required steps \" as he moves from private to public work. Documents regarding ivanka trump's assets were also released friday. They show she was paid up to $ 5 million from her businesses during three months in the spring — around the time she took a white house position and said she would distance herself from those businesses. All told, the documents show kushner and trump have business assets worth up to $ 761 million, the new york times reports. Ethics experts warn their \" extraordinary wealth \" could make conflicts of interest much more difficult to avoid. The documents show kushner resigned from 266 corporate positions and trump resigned from 292 in order to take their government positions.",

While pushing a huge \" testicle, \" reports kens5. It's not quite as odd as it sounds. Cantley, 31, is a testicular cancer survivor, and he's rolling the 6-foot inflatable ball across the country in order to raise awareness for a disease that is the no. 1 cancer for males ages 15 to 34. If caught early, it has as high as a 96 % survival rate. A 2013 men's health profile introduced the man who goes by the name \" mr. Ballsy \": as it explains, cantley's left testicle ballooned to the size of an orange in 2009; he was diagnosed with stage iii testicular cancer. He had the testicle and some lymph nodes removed, but found a lack of open discussion about what he could expect, sexually, as a survivor. That led the nova scotia native on a journey across canada to raise awareness and start a conversation. In terms of his us quest, ksbw reports he departed santa monica on sept. 4, and he's in new orleans today. ( he pushes for six to eight hours a day, reports today.com, and drives at night. ) he's hoping to raise $ 15,000 for the testicular cancer foundation, as well as make it to nyc with a little help: \" my goal is to get across the country not by any money. I want people to come and ( say ), ' i ' ll book a hotel room, i ' ll take you out to lunch, i ' ll fill up your gas tank. '... I want those physical connections. \" follow his quest at ballpush.org.",

        "summary": "Fish are getting hooked on plastic that's making them \" smaller, slower, and more stupid, \" say researchers behind a new study at science. Scientists have long suspected that microplastics are dangerous, but \" that has been very hard to determine until now, and that's why this is such a big paper, \" a scientist not involved with the study tells the bbc. Swedish researchers compared two tanks full of european perch: one with clean water, and one with high concentrations of polystyrene, a plastic pollutant. In the clean water, 96 % of eggs hatched, with half surviving their first 24 hours. In the other tank, just 81 % of eggs hatched — revealing smaller, less physically active fish, per the washington post — and all were eaten by predators in their first day. Not only that, they also favored plastic as a food source in the same way that some humans favor fast food. \" they all had access to zooplankton and yet they decided to just eat plastic, \" the lead author says. \" it seems to be a chemical or physical cue that the plastic has. \" the fish \" are basically fooled into thinking it's a high-energy resource that they need to eat a lot of. \" as a result, they stuff themselves but wind up with little or no energy. This could explain why juvenile perch and pike have been dying at increased rates in the baltic sea over the past 20 years. Researchers say they've recently found similar responses in pike, flounder, and coral reef damselfish exposed to microplastics, reports reuters. If plastic has the same impact on all fish, it could have \" profound effects \" on ecosystems, they add. ( oysters are in danger, too. )",

Somehow the mercedes got shifted in neutral and started rolling down the sloping driveway toward a group of kiera's siblings and friends, nbc san diego reports. Kiera sprung into action, pushing a 2-year-old girl out of the way before being hit by mercedes herself. Kiera was transported to an area hospital, where she died from her injuries. \" a child died heroically, \" a california highway patrol officer tells fox. \" she sacrificed herself for another small child. \" those were sentiments echoed by the mother of the 2-year-old kiera saved. \"she is truly a hero.

Researchers found that at a \" mild to moderate \" level of dehydration — the loss of fluid equal to 2 % of their body weight — athletes experienced problems with attention and decision-making, reuters reports. And those problems got worse as the level of dehydration got worse. In particular, tasks that require motor coordination and executive function suffered; the latter includes tasks like map reading, mental math, and proofreading, among others. \" we've known that physical performance suffers at a threshold of 2 % of body mass... So the question was, what happens in the brain with the same amount of loss, which is pretty common with people who are active or work outside in the heat, \" says study co-author mindy millard-stafford. Earlier research on how dehydration impacts cognitive functioning utilized small numbers of subjects and yielded mixed results; this study is a meta-analysis, combining data from 33 studies involving a total of 413 adult subjects. It confirms what researchers long believed, according to a professor who was not involved with the study: \" the more dehydrated you are the less sharp you are. \" so how easy is it to lose 2 % of your body weight in fluid? another professor tells npr hiking at moderate intensity for just one hour during the summer heat could get a person there or close to it; running hard in the heat could get you there in just 30 minutes. \" most people don't realize how high their sweat rate is in the heat, \" he says. Fatigue, muscle weakness, decreased urine output or dark-gold urine, and confusion are all signs you need to drink more fluid. The current recommendation is that women take in about 91 ounces of water a day and men 125 ounces, though that includes all sources ( including food and beverages other than water ).",
