Scientists at the university's slac national accelerator laboratory used x-rays to reveal the closing aria from the 1797 opera medee that composer luigi cherubini had scrubbed over in charcoal. ( critics had complained the piece was too long, according to music legend. ) the scientists used powerful rays from a device called a synchrotron to zero in on the iron ( from the ink used by cherubini ) and zinc ( from the musical staffs printed on the paper ) hidden beneath the charcoal, explains phys.org and wired. \" it's similar to a dot matrix printer, \" says one researcher. \" whenever we saw iron we would put a little digital red ink blot down, and whenever we saw zinc we'd put a little green dot down. \" the newly illuminated notes were then transferred to a computer screen. \" it is indescribable, \" says the berlin music scholar who suggested the experiment. You can listen for yourself to the recovered music here.",

        "summary": "Bill o'reilly's fox news days are over, and he thinks it's a sad sign of the times. In a statement issued after fox announced that it was parting ways with the top-rated host amid sexual harassment allegations, o'reilly said he was proud to have led \" one of the most successful news programs in history, \" but he found it \" tremendously disheartening \" to part ways due to \" completely unfounded claims. \" \" but that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today, \" said the o'reilly factor host. A roundup of coverage: quartz breaks down what it calls 35 million reasons for firing o'reilly: an ad boycott from at least 80 companies that spent an estimated $ 35 million advertising on his show last year. Sources tell politico that the mood among fox staffers is relief and surprise mixed with anger that it took so long for o'reilly to be fired. The sources say o'reilly was very unpopular among staffers compared to colleagues like sean hannity. \" there won't be anyone shedding tears about his departure, \" one insider says. Fox has done too little, too late in getting rid of a \" serial harasser \" who should have been fired long ago, christine emba writes in an op-ed at the washington post. \" the decision was based on profit, plain and simple, \" she writes. \" if keeping on a serial harasser had seemed more lucrative than letting him go, they would have done so. \" adweek notes that the o'reilly factor was not only the no. 1 cable news show in the first quarter of this year, it delivered the most-watched quarter in cable news history. Sources tell vanity fair that o'reilly could be in for a payout in the neighborhood of $ 40 million, similar to what roger ailes received after his departure in similar circumstances next year. The same sources say more women plan to come forward and other fox anchors could soon follow o'reilly and ailes out the door. The new york daily news reports that two \" powerful \" and \" progressive \" women played a key role in o'reilly's exit: sarah and kathryn murdoch, the wives of fox execs lachlan and james murdoch — and the daughters-in-law of rupert murdoch. Mediaite reports that after o'reilly's firing, usa today columnist kirsten powers said ailes had defended the host when she complained about him thanking her for her \" blonde-ness. \" \" and then roger said 'you know bill.

The treasure hunt is \" out of control, \" the 84-year-old author and retired art dealer tells koat, predicting that 50,000 people from all over the world will join the hunt this summer. Fenn, whose clues were presented in a poem, says he buried the treasure five years ago and nobody has found it yet, although a few have come as close as 200 feet from the spot, which he says is wet and is higher than 5,000 feet above sea level. Most of the searchers have been looking in new mexico — where the state tourist board calls the search \" the gift that keeps on giving, \" per krqe — but fenn says people are also looking in montana and wyoming. What they're precisely hunting for: a 10-inch-by-10-inch box that fenn says holds 265 gold coins ( including american eagles and double eagles ) and gold nuggets, plus \" lots of rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds and other things. \" the former fighter pilot says he came up with the idea after he was diagnosed with what was thought to be terminal cancer back in 1988, abc news reports, and for him, the hunt's goal has already been achieved. \" i wanted the monetary value to be a consideration for those who are looking for it, but mostly my motive was to get kids off the couch and away from their texting machines and out in the mountains, \" he tells koat. \" i would love if somebody found it tomorrow.

So here's what people are saying less than 24 hours before apple unveils its new iphone 7: the biggest news circling around the new iphone is its lack of a headphone jack, opting instead for wireless headphones or headphones that plug into the charging port, reports the wall street journal, which also notes apple has caused a stir with port changes in the past. And business insider has a rumor that apple won't even be using traditional bluetooth technology for its new wireless iphone headphones but is instead developing its own in-house tech. Macrumors reports on tidbits from ming-chi kuo, an analyst with a \" very solid track record \" predicting apple products. He thinks the iphone 7 will include five color options, better water resistance, two rear camera lenses, and more. Meanwhile, mashable looks at 12 rumors swirling around the iphone 7 and ranks them from most to least likely. The longest-shot features include a larger size, wireless charging, and a non-clicking home button. But fortune reports not everyone is excited for a new iphone. With few major changes to the iphone's looks expected, wall street analysts are predicting lackluster sales. Cnet counters that consumers shouldn't care what the new iphone looks like for a very obvious reason: they're going to cover it with a case anyway. Finally, bgr notes that apple very rarely announces just one product during its events. It believes the tech company could reveal some other stuff wednesday, including a new macbook pro and the apple watch 2.",

We ' ll just give you the wall. \" the clock starts as soon as you touch the burrito — which the owner says contains about 25,000 calories — and competitors are disqualified if they take any bathroom breaks or there's \" discharge [ of ] bodily fluids of any kind \" ( including running noses or eyes ), food &amp; wine notes; the eatery also says it isn't responsible if contenders get sick or die. Owner victor robey, who tells the park slope stoop that he was inspired by shows like the travel channel's man v. Food, suggests downing the mandatory ghost pepper margarita at the end, noting the pepper is like the \" cherry on top. \" if you're in the area and try ( and likely fail ) this challenge, don't feel too bad: renowned eating champ joey chestnut broke the world burrito-eating record in may, and even he could scarf down just 14 pounds — though he was given only 10 minutes, per kusa.

During a test run outside tokyo today, central japan railway pushed a seven-car maglev train to 374mph, topping its own world record of 366mph set on thursday. The guardian reports some 49 railway employees were on board as the train traveled above 600kph, or 373mph, for 10.8 seconds and covered 1.1 miles in that time. The company expects the lo series train, scheduled to speed 175 miles from tokyo to nagoya in 40 minutes by 2027, to travel at a slower operational speed of about 315mph, the bbc reports. But even that pace would break records: the top speed for a commercial maglev train is 268mph, set in china, cnn reports. \" the ride was comfortable and stable, \" the head of the maglev test center says. \" we would like to continue analyzing data and make use of it in designing the cars and other equipment. \" the line from tokyo to nagoya is expected to cost at least $ 46 billion — with a connection to osaka in 2045 adding $ 30 billion to the bill — but japan hopes other countries will see the trains as worth the investment, bloomberg reports. Prime minister shinzo abe will make an official visit to the us on sunday and is expected to make his case for such a train from new york to washington. Bloomberg notes a 2,600-mile trip from new york to san francisco could take just seven hours on a maglev train, though, at the current rate, the cost could hit $ 690 billion.",

That's because when she opened her mouth, newborn alyssa showed off her two front teeth — the bottom ones. The doctor \" said in her 25-year career this is the second time she's ever seen it, \" bailey tells ozarksfirst.com. The rare condition is known as natal teeth, which, according to nih's national library of medicine, occur in just one in every 2,000 to 3,000 births. They are always present at birth, as opposed to neonatal teeth, which can develop within 30 days of birth. They can be related to medical conditions such as growth hormone deficiencies or cleft palates, but typically — and in alyssa's case — they are not. According to a study in the journal pediatrics, both natal teeth and neonatal teeth have \" for centuries... Been associated with diverse superstitions among many different ethnic groups \"; another study notes that in malaysia, for example, they're seen as a good omen, while in china, they're considered a bad omen. The teeth are often removed shortly after birth, as they're usually quite loose, with little root structure, and can fall out and choke the baby. Alyssa's parents instead plan to keep a close eye on hers until they eventually fall out, they say, adding that doctors \" said [ they're ] just going to grow with the rest of her teeth. \" natal teeth can also cause sores on the infant's tongue — and can, not surprisingly, be uncomfortable for the mom while breastfeeding. \" a whole lot of people have asked me,'does it hurt?

Instead, they can only taste sourness and saltiness, the bbc reports. That sets them apart from other birds, most of which lack the ability to taste sweetness but can still pick up on the other basic tastes. Teams of researchers made their findings in investigating penguin genomes; it would seem, says one scientist, that \" umami and bitter tastes were lost in the common ancestor of all penguins, \" the guardian reports. Before you start pitying penguins, however, know that all this may not bother them much, since they swallow fish whole, researchers note. Still, it came as a surprise: \" penguins eat fish, so you would guess that they need the umami receptor genes, but for some reason they don't have them, \" researcher jianzhi zhang says in a statement, via time. It's possible that the weather has something to do with it: in cold temperatures, sweet, umami, and bitter tastes become hard to detect. Perhaps, then, penguins should just start wearing sweaters.

A genetic study suggests the flightless birds lost three of the five basic tastes long ago in evolution. Taste is critical for survival in most animals, but may not matter in the penguin, which swallows fish whole, say researchers in china and the us. Many other birds are unable to taste sweet things, but they do have receptors for detecting bitter and umami ( or meaty ) flavours. The discovery was made when researchers decoding penguin genomes found some of the taste genes were missing. Their behaviour of swallowing food whole, and their tongue structure and function, suggest that penguins need no taste perception prof jianzhi zhang, university of michigan a closer look at the dna of penguins revealed that all species lack functioning genes for the receptors of sweet, umami, and bitter tastes. \" based on genetic data, penguins are believed to have sour and salty tastes, but have lost sweet, umami, and bitter tastes, \" lead researcher prof jianzhi zhang, of the university of michigan, us, and wuhan university, china, told the bbc.

            "Image copyright marcel mochet/getty image caption a colony of king penguins in the antarctic penguins can taste only sour and salty food, scientists have discovered. A genetic study suggests the flightless birds lost three of the five basic tastes long ago in evolution. Taste is critical for survival in most animals, but may not matter in the penguin, which swallows fish whole, say researchers in china and the us. Many other birds are unable to taste sweet things, but they do have receptors for detecting bitter and umami ( or meaty ) flavours. The discovery was made when researchers decoding penguin genomes found some of the taste genes were missing. Their behaviour of swallowing food whole, and their tongue structure and function, suggest that penguins need no taste perception prof jianzhi zhang, university of michigan a closer look at the dna of penguins revealed that all species lack functioning genes for the receptors of sweet, umami, and bitter tastes. \" based on genetic data, penguins are believed to have sour and salty tastes, but have lost sweet, umami, and bitter tastes, \" lead researcher prof jianzhi zhang, of the university of michigan, us, and wuhan university, china, told the bbc. The umami taste gives food the strong, savoury flavour associated with meat. Lacking this sense is surprising for a carnivorous animal",
            "Penguins no longer taste their food the way most of the animal kingdom does, according to a new study. According to the researchers, vertebrates usually have five tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami. But after studying the genetic sequencing of adelie and emperor penguins, analyzing penguin tissue, and comparing the birds genomes to 14 other non-penguin bird species, the researchers discovered that penguins have lost all but the salty and sour tastes. \"penguins eat fish, so you would guess that they need the umami receptor genes, but for some reason they don't have them, \" said study author jianzhi zhang, a professor at the university of michigan department of ecology and evolutionary biology in a statement. \"these findings are surprising and puzzling, and we do not have a good explanation for them. But we have a few ideas. \" the researchers believe that perhaps over 20 million years ago, the freezing climates of the arctic somehow interfered with the penguins ' ability to taste. The researchers of the new study, published in the journal current biology, were tipped off to the lack of taste among penguins when they were contacted by a genomics institute in china called bgi which had originally sequenced the genomes of the adelie and emperor penguins and couldn't find their taste genes.

One such american, young-earth creationist andrew snelling, is suing the national park service for not letting him remove rocks from the canyon to study, reports the atlantic. Snelling holds a phd in geology, has given lectures and guided biblical-themed rafting tours through the park. He cites first amendment rights to free speech and religious freedom, fifth amendment rights to due process and equal protection, the 2000 religious freedom restoration act, and president trump's executive order in may to protect religious freedoms from \" undue interference by the federal government. \" nps rejected his 2013 request to collect 50 to 60 fist-sized rocks, reports the phoenix new times, saying all research in the park is restricted, especially if it involves removing any material. One park officer also noted that the type of rock he wanted to study can be found outside the park. Meanwhile, three mainstream geologists asked to peer review snelling's request denounced the work as scientifically invalid, though some argue that snelling should be allowed to proceed so his work can be argued on its merits. \" i just expect to have fair treatment, \" he says. Others argue that scientists like snelling are the ones being inflexible in the face of evidence that contradicts their beliefs. Nps declined to comment.

The game, which cnn points out could be described as \" nothing but a mashup of the ouija board and [ the ] ' bloody mary ' [ game ], \" involves summoning a supposed mexican demon by placing two pencils in the form of a cross on a piece of paper and writing \" yes \" and \" no \" in the alternating squares. Players then ask, \" charlie, charlie, are you here? \" ( or some variant, like \" charlie, charlie, can we play? \" ); if a pencil rolls toward a \" yes, \" players must then ask charlie some more specific questions and see how he/she/it responds. The game has produced a plethora of videos and tweets of those partaking, ostensibly spooked by the presence of charlie, described as both a group of mexican demons or a single spooky entity ( some say it's a child who committed suicide; others, a \" demonic mexican man with black and red eyes, \" per the independent ). Kfor has compiled a decent number of these photos and freakouts. But bbc mundo reporter maria elena navez says there's no demon known as \" charlie \" in mexican mythology, pointing out out that gods in old-time mexican myths would have had names like tlaltecuhtli or tezcatlipoca. \" if this legend began after the spanish conquest, i ' m sure it would've been called ' carlitos ' ( charlie in spanish ), \" she tells the bbc. So why do the pencils move? gravity and the \" awkward positioning of some pencils, \" the independent explains. ( some mexican priests spend their time battling an \" infestation of demons. \" )",

        "summary": "At the cutting edge of medical science, stem cell therapy holds tremendous potential. But it's still relatively new, and it still needs to be studied vigorously for safety and efficacy as it pertains to a wide range of health issues. Two dramatically different new reports further highlight the need for more research and perhaps regulation, npr reports. In the first, published in the new england journal of medicine, researchers report on three elderly women who had stem cells derived from fat tissue injected directly into their eyes at a for-profit clinic in florida in an attempt to treat macular degeneration. They each paid $ 5,000 for the unproven approach, meant to treat the most common cause of blindness in the elderly; instead, they went blind. One doctor warns that if something \" sounds too good to be true, \" it \" may even be horrible. \" in stark contrast, a study out of japan, also published in the new england journal of medicine, reports on the promise of induced pluripotent stem cells ( ips cells ), which can be made using any cell in the body to create cells that resemble embryonic stem cells. Japanese researchers converted these stem cells into retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) cells, which macular degeneration destroys, injected them into one eye of a patient, and found that the progression of the disease stopped altogether — a \" really remarkable medical advance, \" an outside researcher says. Other trials using ipe cells to treat diseases like parkinson's will soon be underway, reports science magazine, though a japanese researcher cautions that diseases aren't likely to fully reverse: \" regenerative medicine is not going to cure patients in the way they hope. \" ( stem cells may help to halt multiple sclerosis, too. )",

        "summary": "Some rare good news in the fight against plastic pollution: scientists working with a plastic-eating microbe discovered in japan two years ago accidentally created a mutant enzyme that sounds like an environmentalist's dream, the guardian reports. The enzyme breaks down the pet — polyethylene terephthalate — used in plastic bottles even more efficiently than the original microbe, which had evolved to eat the waste it encountered around an osaka recycling plant. Researchers, who inadvertently improved the enzyme while investigating how it evolved, say the tweaks enable it to begin digesting plastic more quickly. It now takes just a few days to start breaking down plastic, and researchers say more tweaks could make the process super-fast, reducing both plastic waste and the need to create more plastic. \" what we are hoping to do is use this enzyme to turn this plastic back into its original components, so we can literally recycle it back to plastic, \" says lead researcher john mcgeehan at the university of portsmouth. \" it means we won't need to dig up any more oil and, fundamentally, it should reduce the amount of plastic in the environment. \" experts not involved in the research say it sounds extremely promising, though it may be a while before the enzyme can be used as a large-scale solution to plastic pollution, reports the australian broadcasting corporation. \" enzymes are non-toxic, biodegradable, and can be produced in large amounts by microorganisms, \" notes rmit university chemistry expert oliver jones.

The anchorage daily news reports that jurors on thursday ordered alice rogoff to pay more than $ 850,000 to tony hopfinger. Rogoff purchased a majority stake in the alaska dispatch website from hopfinger in 2009.

But back to the napkin, on which rogoff wrote in april 2014: \" i agree to pay tony $ 100k at end of each calendar year ( beginning ' 14 ) for 10 years, \" meaning $ 1 million total. Hopfinger sued rogoff, claiming she failed to pay him $ 100,000 annually for 10 years as promised; she only paid him $ 100,000 in 2015. Rogoff's attorney argued that terms were stated to commit hopfinger to work for a decade and that he deserved nothing when he moved to chicago in 2015, per the daily news. But the jury, which deliberated for roughly nine hours, found that \" the actual promise was for his shares, \" says hopfinger's lawyer.

A spokesman for the alliance says the huge russian force seen in satellite images \" can move very quickly \" if ordered to, though it's not clear whether it will, the wall street journal reports. \" threat is capability and intent, \" the spokesman says. \" undoubtedly there is capability here. We are unsure of the russian intent. \" more: russia says the images nato unveiled yesterday show military exercises from last summer, but nato says this is \" deliberate misinformation \" from moscow. The images are from late march and early april, nato says — and there is no sign of any military exercises taking place. The troops are \" not training, but ready for combat, \" nato's chief says. Whatever moscow's intent, nato warns that the tens of thousands of troops across the border are already having a destabilizing effect on ukraine, the guardian finds. \" these masked guys would not be taking over government buildings if there were not 40,000 soldiers just across the border, \" a senior nato official says. In eastern ukraine, where the 48-hour deadline for separatists to leave government buildings is rapidly approaching, acting prime minister arseniy yatsenyuk will visit the city of donetsk today in an attempt to defuse tensions, the bbc reports. Pro-russia activists have declared the city a \" people's republic. \" the dispute over ukraine's gas bill is also heating up, reports reuters. Russia recently hiked the price of natural gas it sells to ukraine by 40 %, and vladimir putin warns that the supply may soon be cut off if kiev doesn't cough up $ 2.2 billion to settle its bill — and that the move could affect gas deliveries to european union countries.

Gay men, it seems, are partial to facial hair and branded clothing, \" like to wear tight clothes to show off their six-pack abs, \" and frequent the gym not only to work out but to watch other men work out. Lesbians, on the other hand, are always hugging each other, holding hands, and saying bad things about men. Got it? as you might expect, the list is being ridiculed far and wide and might be funnier if not for one thing: homosexuality is illegal in malaysia and punishable by an old colonial law of up to 20 years in prison, notes the washington post. Advocates are worried the list may set off anti-gay violence in a nation known for it. Last year, for instance, an 18-year-old student was burned to death by classmates who suspected him of being gay. \"if you really want to educate society then explain to them the traits of a pedophile, a molester, a murderer, a kidnapper, people who actually endanger the lives of others, \" says one of the nation's biggest social media stars, arwind kumar, in a youtube video. \" how the hell does a gay person endanger your life? \" ( also last year, disney had to pull beauty and the beast from malaysia over a \" gay moment. \" )",

            "Among the things the malaysian newspaper sinar harian saw fit to print in the past week: a story about a pricey government plan to prevent coastal erosion, an article on a proposed soccer match between the malaysian and ukrainian national teams, and a handy, foldable guide to detecting the homosexuals in our midst. Gay men, the newspaper's bulleted list noted, \"like to wear tight clothes to show off their six-pack abs, \" according to a translation by the guardian. They go to the gym to work on said abs, but also to ogle other men. They also apparently \"adore beards, mustaches and [ name-brand ] clothes. \" lesbians, on the other hand, \"enjoy hugging one another and holding hands \" and can be spotted by alert readers because they \"hate men and enjoy belittling them. \" the newspaper's news-you-can-use piece was widely mocked as it reverberated across the world on monday, but it also sparked an outcry among lgbt advocates and set off another ripple of fear among malaysians who don't happen to be straight.

        "summary": "After 35 years of intense scholarly debate — and probably some name calling — scientists have agreed to compromise: both a giant asteroid and massive volcanic eruptions were responsible for killing off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Time reports this agreement comes after researchers used a new technique to more precisely date 700 rock samples from india's deccan traps. They discovered a series of volcanic eruptions there — the largest on earth in 60 million years — happened within 50,000 years of an asteroid the size of manhattan slamming into mexico, according to reuters. Those two events would have combined to fill the atmosphere with dust, ash, and fumes, causing the climate change that killed 75 % of all species on earth. Fifty-thousand years apart may sound like it's pushing the boundary of claiming two things happened at the same time, but that's not the case with geologic time. \" within measurement error, they're simultaneous, \" volcanologist loÿc vanderkluysen tells reuters. The deccan traps were already erupting before the asteroid hit, but the impact of the space rock appears to have intensified them. In the 420,000 years following impact, the traps created enough lava to cover the united states in a 600-foot-deep layer, according to time. \" in their wake would have come 4,000 centuries of changing climate, ocean acidification, and acid rains, \" vanderkluysen tells reuters.

They could very likely be there: two air india flights crashed on the mountain, one in 1950 and one in 1966. And for the first time, he's found \" significant human remains. \" on thursday roche discovered a hand and upper portion of a leg. The remains are being examined; stephane bozon of the gendarmerie expects they belong to two different passengers. The 1950 crash killed 48 people; 16 years later, 117 were killed when an air india boeing 707 en route from bombay to new york crashed near the summit. An accident report concluded in part that the pilot \" who, under the mistaken impression that he had passed the ridge leading to the summit and was still at a flight level which afforded sufficient safety clearance over the top of mont blanc, continued his descent, \" crashing into the mountain. A bbc report quotes a mountain guide who went to the scene afterward: \" everything was completely pulverized. Nothing was identifiable except for a few letters and packets. \" ( a receding glacier revealed a couple frozen for 75 years. )",

            "Ending weeks of political speculation, marco rubio announced wednesday he has changed his mind and will run for re-election to the u.s. Senate, reversing his pledge to return to private life after his presidential campaign collapsed three months ago. His decision could give republicans an edge in one of the most competitive senate races in the country — and keep rubio in the public eye ahead of the next presidential election in 2020. Rubio cited a sense of duty to try to remain in congress under either president donald trump or president hillary clinton, two candidates he considers mediocre. \"no matter who's elected president, there's reason to worry. If it's hillary clinton, you know we're going to have four more years of the same failed economic policies, four more years of the same failed foreign policy, \" he told the miami herald. \"the prospect of a trump presidency is also worrisome to me in many ways. \" $ 20 for 365 days of unlimited digital access last chance to take advantage of our best offer of the year! act now! rubio has said he ' ll vote for trump.

        "summary": "The secret to why indian cuisine has such a distinctive taste is a little more complicated than knowing how much curry or tamarind to drop in. It all has to do with flavor compounds — and how indian dishes take the opposite approach from western dishes toward them. In the west, recipes often pair ingredients that share flavors, explains the mit technology review. But indian recipes combine ingredients that have little or no such overlap, according to research out of the indian institute for technology in jodhpur. Researchers crunched data on thousands of recipes, analyzed the interplay of chemical compounds among the ingredients, and found the surprising lack of flavor overlap. ( figuring out which foods share flavor compounds is a science unto itself, but you can get a sense of it here. ) \"each of the spices is uniquely placed in its recipe to shape the flavor-sharing pattern with [ the ] rest of the ingredients, and is sensitive to replacement even with other spices, \" the researchers write. If a dish has cayenne, for example, it won't have another ingredient with a similar flavor. A blogger at vice puts it this way: \" each spice serves a very specific role in the dish it inhabits, from the warm sweetness of ginger to the slight bitterness of tamarind to the zingy freshness of cilantro, \" and a typical indian dish may have a dozen or so of these herbs and spices that play off each other. All of this is happening on the \" molecular level, \" notes the washington post, which offers this takeaway: \" combining ingredients with like flavors is a useful ( and often delicious ) strategy, but it might be a somewhat misleading rule of thumb. Indian cuisine, after all, is cherished globally, and yet hinges on a decidedly different ingredient pairing logic. \" ( read why your waiter probably doesn't want you to order dessert. )",

            "Julia child famously said that fat carries flavor, but perhaps instead we should give thanks to 4-methylpentanoic acid. Unique combinations of such chemical compounds give foods their characteristic flavors. Science-minded chefs have gone so far as to suggest that seemingly incongruous ingredients — chocolate and blue cheese, for example — will taste great together as long as they have enough flavor compounds in common. Scientists recently put this hypothesis to the test by creating a flavor map, a variant of which we have reproduced here. Lines connect foods that have components in common; thick lines mean many components are shared. By comparing the flavor network with various recipe databases, the researchers conclude that chefs do tend to pair ingredients with shared flavor compounds — but only in western cuisine. Dishes from a database of recipes from east asia tend to combine ingredients with few overlapping flavors.",

Returned from fraught negotiations in brussels, president nicos anastasiades said late on monday the 10-billion euro ( $ 13 billion ) rescue plan agreed there in the early hours of the morning was \" painful \" but essential to avoid economic meltdown. He agreed to close down the second-largest bank, cyprus popular, and inflict heavy losses on big depositors, many of them russian, after cyprus's outsize financial sector ran into trouble when",
            "Lessons of cyprus demonstrators in nicosia were unhappy about the plans, but should the rest of europe be happier? the deal hammered out for cyprus last night isn't \" fair \". Angry cypriots are right about that. In important respects, cyprus has not received the same treatment as other bailed-out eurozone economies. That is partly because cyprus and its banks are an extreme case, but it is also a matter of timing. The brutal truth is that the cypriots held out too long. Rightly or wrongly, european officials and the imf think markets are confident enough now to take a lesson in \" creditor responsibility \". If cyprus had gone for help"

        "summary": "On a day in 2010, two south african mothers each gave birth to a girl at a johannesburg-area hospital — but they unknowingly took the other's child home after nurses mistakenly switched them. The error came to light last year, when one of the mothers sued her former partner for child support. A dna test done as part of the claim revealed the girl wasn't the man's baby — nor was she the woman's daughter. Now, one woman wants her biological child back; the other doesn't want to switch. The decision will be up to the north gauteng high court, and reuters reports that a court-appointed expert today sided with the mother who wants to keep the child she's been raising for four years. As reuters explains, the court requested that the university of pretoria's centre for child law make a recommendation as to what would be best for the children, as south african law gives that a good deal of weight. After interviewing the mothers and fathers and clinically assessing the girls, the center's director advised that \" the children should stay with the parents who have raised them and should also be permitted to have contact with their biological parents. \" the girls have already met their biological mothers, who have attended counseling sessions together. But the guardian in may reported that after one mother \" became unhappy with the process \" she found a lawyer to take her case. Says the lawyer, \" she said there are resemblances to herself. She conveyed to me that it was traumatic. \" no date has been set regarding a final determination. Reuters earlier reported that the hospital has given no explanation for the mix-up.

The roots: israel accuses iran of taking advantage of the chaos in syria to try to create what israeli defense minister avigdor lieberman calls a \" forward base against israel \" along israel's northern border, per the ap. In a speech to soldiers ahead of the latest strikes, he said, \"we are facing a new reality — the lebanese army, in cooperation with hezbollah, the syrian army, the [ shia ] militias in syria and above them iran — are all becoming a single front against the state of israel. \"",

The current inhabitant of the oval office has a 42 % approval rating among all americans, and the post has to go back to dwight eisenhower to find another president with a lower such rating at this point in the game. His disapproval numbers are also stratospheric at 59 %; the previous high was bill clinton, who also had a bruising first 100 days, at 39 %. The post notes that trump's predecessor's approval rating was 69 % at this stage, disapproval at 26 %. Fox news, though, finds the silver lining, with a staggering 96 % of people who voted for trump saying they'd do it again, while only 2 % said they'd change their minds. And the president's approval rating is starkly different among trump voters ( 94 % like the job he's doing ) and among republicans ( 84 % ). Trump also beats clinton's start in the percentage who say he's gotten either a great deal or a good amount done: 42 % to 37 %, respectively. And trump again edges clinton among those who feel campaign promises are being kept, 44 % to 42 %. Another chink in trump's armor: only 38 % of respondents said he was honest, compared to 74 % for obama and 62 % for george w. Bush. The complete poll is here.

Jared chance's parents — including a father who worked as an illinois police officer for 25 years, per wwmt — could face the same fate if convicted on charges that they hid knowledge of their son's alleged efforts to \" cut ashley young's body into multiple pieces, \" per police statements. Chance, 29, was the last person seen with the kalamazoo woman, aged 30 or 31, at a grand rapids pub on nov. 29, according to a facebook page about young's disappearance, per mlive. He was arrested on charges of mutilating a body and concealing a death on dec. 2, when young's torso was found beneath a tarp in the shared basement of his grand rapids rental unit, reports the holland sentinel, describing other body parts as found in chance's apartment. A day earlier, chance told his parents he cut up young's body \" and hid some of those pieces, \" according to an affidavit. Despite appearing for a police interview on dec. 6, james and barbara chance \" failed to inform the proper authorities of ashley young's death and dismemberment... With the intent to aid the offender in avoiding or escaping detection, arrest, trial, and punishment, \" the complaint says. James, 76, is accused of lying to prosecutors about when the couple, their son, and a fourth person departed grand rapids for holland, where chance's parents live. Per wwmt, barbara, 63, allegedly made false statements about the last time she'd spoken to her son. Each were charged wednesday with one count of perjury and one count of accessory to murder after the fact. No one has yet been charged in young's killing.

        "summary": "Got milk? then you may have a better chance of winning a nobel prize, according to a letter published in practical neurology. In the letter, two neurologists speculate about a study last year that linked a nation's chocolate consumption to its nobel-prize stockpile. But what if it's really milk and milk products that make people brainier, not chocolate per se? after all, swedes drink more milk per person than any other country ( 750 lbs ) and have the most nobel laureates per 10 million citizens ( 33 ), reports science daily. And the swiss boast quite a few nobels ( 32 ) while downing a lot of cow juice every year ( 660 lbs ). Not to mention that china has the fewest nobel winners and drinks the least amount of milk ( 55 lbs ). But the letter's authors aren't sure whether milk makes people smarter or just reflects a better education system in general. Milk does have vitamin d, however, which could make people brainier. \" so to improve your chances of winning nobel prizes you should not only eat more chocolate but perhaps drink milk too: or strive for synergy with hot chocolate, \" the authors conclude.",

            "Nations that consume a lot of milk and milk products also tend to have a lot of nobel laureates among their populations, suggest the authors of a letter, published in practical neurology. Research published last year in the new england journal of medicine reported a strong association between a nation's chocolate consumption and nobel laureate prowess, speculating that the flavonoid content of chocolate was behind the boost in brain power. This got the letter authors thinking. As chocolate is often combined with milk, could it be the amount of milk/milk products consumed per head that fuels nobel prize success? they looked at the 2007 data from the food and agriculture organization on per capita milk consumption in 22 countries as well as the information provided by the author of the chocolate theory, and found a significant association. Sweden has the most nobel laureates per 10 million of its population ( 33 ). Although, it hosts the nobel committee, which some might argue could introduce an element of bias; it also consumes the most milk per head of the population, getting through 340kg every year. And switzerland, which knocks back 300kg of the white stuff every year, has a nobel haul of similar proportions ( 32 ). At the other end of the scale, china has the lowest number of nobel laureates in its population. But it also has the lowest milk consumption of the countries studied -- at around 25kg a year. There does seem to be a ceiling effect, however, note the authors, with no discernible impact beyond an annual per capita consumption of 350kg, as finland's nobel haul seems to attest. Is milk consumption therefore simply a reflection of a strong educational system, or do nobel prize winners celebrate by drinking it, query the authors? but there is a plausible biological explanation for the link: milk is rich in vitamin d, and this may boost brain power, the evidence suggests. \" so to improve your chances of winning nobel prizes you should not only eat more chocolate but perhaps drink milk too: or strive for synergy with hot chocolate, \" conclude the authors, who highlight their conflicts of interest, which include a tendency to take milk with cereal and coffee, and to eat chocolate whenever the opportunity arises."

        "summary": "More details are emerging on micah johnson, who is now believed to be the lone shooter in the attack that killed five police officers thursday night. The 25-year-old former army reservist was sent home from afghanistan in 2014 after being accused of sexually harassing a female soldier, the ap reports. Bradford glendening, the military lawyer who represented him, says the woman sought a protective order to keep johnson away from her and her family. The army sent johnson stateside, recommending an \" other than honorable discharge. \" \" in his case, it was apparently so egregious, it was not just the act itself, \" glendening says. \" i ' m sure that this guy was the black sheep of his unit. \" he says johnson was set to be removed from the army in september 2014 because of the incident, but inexplicably got an honorable discharge months later. In other developments: johnson had no criminal history, according to authorities. Local court records show his parents were divorced in 1996. He was believed to have shared a two-story tan brick home in mesquite, a dallas suburb, with family members. He graduated from john horn high school in mesquite, where he was a rotc member, school district officials say. The military says that for six years starting in 2009, johnson served in the army reserve as a private first class with a specialty in carpentry and masonry. Friends say johnson didn't seem interested in politics, but his facebook page suggests otherwise: he liked an assortment of black militant groups, his profile photo showed him wearing a dashiki and raising his fist over the words \" black power, \" and his cover shot carried the red, black and green pan-african flag. One of the groups johnson liked on facebook, the african american defense league, posted a message earlier in the week encouraging violence against police in response to the killing in louisiana. Another group he liked was the new black panther party, whose leaders have \" long expressed virulently anti-white and anti-semitic opinions, \" according to the southern poverty law center. Johnson's facebook page also contained information on public enemy member professor griff, a fierce critic of police violence who rejected any link to the dallas shootings. \" ' no mr white officer i do not train snipers to kill cops. ' \" he tweeted. A family friend who knows johnson's mother through church says johnson was a changed man when he came back from afghanistan. \" he was withdrawn, didn't want to talk to people anymore, didn't believe in god anymore, \" 62-year-old myrtle booker tells the dallas morning news.

Prosecutors in chicago say 24-year-old austin jones, a pop singer who has nearly 550,000 subscribers on his youtube channel, persuaded two underage female fans to send him sexually explicit videos. According to the chicago tribune, the criminal complaint unsealed tuesday alleges the singer encouraged one 14-year-old fan last month to send a video of herself dancing in an explicit manner. In an august 2016 facebook chat jones allegedly told the second girl, also 14, to \"prove \" she was his biggest fan. According to the criminal complaint the girl sent jones 25 videos, including eight in which she exposed her genitals; the other girl sent 15, including 10 of her exposing herself, authorities say. The chicago sun-times reports jones was arrested monday after landing at o ' hare international airport; he had apparently been on an international tour. He was detained and taken into custody by customs and border patrol and homeland security investigations, per e!, at which time, according to officials, he admitted requesting and receiving videos from the victims. This isn't the first time jones has been in hot water for inappropriate interactions with young fans. According to the new york daily news, the singer released a video two years ago on youtube apologizing for asking girls to send videos of themselves \"twerking. \" jones is now facing two felony counts of production of child pornography, each of which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years.",

The couch caught fire, as did the amateur exterminator, and the jan. 3 blaze ultimately destroyed about four units in the eight-floor st antoine gardens apartments. The man — an unnamed 30-year-old, per fox 2 — was able to get down to the lobby, per the free press, and asked a witness to pray with him. \" he was melting, \" the witness says. \" i was scared. He was screaming. \" residents tell the free press that the building is infested with bedbugs. Despite exterminators coming twice a month, the man who started the fire had been complaining of the pests for four months, a resident says. In response to the fire, residents say management, which declined to talk to reporters, turned away the red cross ( which later provided cots and blankets ) and instead passed out pizza, coffee, and donuts. Many residents remain in the building despite the damage. \" it's extremely disappointing, \" says one.

Yahoo reports the 45 % discount lowers the cost of prime, which bestows free two-day delivery, to $ 5.99 for anyone with an ebt card, which is used for food stamps and other government assistance. Qualifying people will also get the first 30 days of prime for free, according to npr. Approximately 60 % of american households already have a prime membership, business insider reports. But most of those memberships are found in upper income brackets, where membership is reaching saturation. On the other hand, some 45 million low-income americans are now eligible for a discounted prime membership. Industry insiders reacted with skepticism to amazon's announcement. After all, low-income americans don't shop online as much and have limited internet access. But retail consultant doug stephens says even a small amount of new customers can pay off for amazon through loyalty. \" prime is the gateway drug for the heroin that is amazon, \" he says. One amazon investor agrees, saying discounted prime membership will get low-income people used to buying online. Even better: it will eat into walmart's customer base. Nearly $ 1 out of every $ 5 in food stamps was spent at walmart in 2016. For its part, walmart has been actively trying to steal amazon customers, recently experimenting with employees delivering orders at the end of their shift.",

Celeste monforton, a professor of occupational health, requested federal injury reports for tyson foods for the first nine months of 2015, buzzfeed reports. What she found is the stuff of nightmares. According to monforton's blog, 17 amputations were reported at 10 tyson meat processing plants during those months. One arkansas employee lost the tip of a finger to an \" impeller. \" an employee in nebraska lost three fingers to a \" skinner. \" and one poor missouri employee lost both hands to an \" auger. \" \" the names of these tools tell just part of the story of why these amputations occurred, \" monforton writes. \" their names, however, provide more than an inkling about the physical demands of these jobs. \" monforton decided to look into the injuries because of a new occupational health and safety agency rule that went into effect at the start of 2015, iowa public radio reports. It requires companies to report all work-related amputations or hospitalizations within 24 hours. Experts have long considered osha data on injuries within the meat industry to be underreported by up to 70 % for a variety of reasons. Employers were in charge of reporting the data, osha didn't verify it, workers were punished for reporting injuries, and so on. And the problem is likely even worse than what monforton's numbers show. Ten states with tyson factories have their own osha programs and weren't included in the tally, not to mention the factories of other major meat producers.

Reilly and morrison have declined to comment for this story.

Democratic party, told the public radio station wfpl that shawn reilly and curtis morrison of progress kentucky bragged to him about recording the meeting, which was held feb. 2 at a newly opened mcconnell campaign office in louisville, ky. In one of the recordings, which were obtained by mother jones, an aide to mcconnell can be heard discussing ashley judd's history with depression and how it might be exploited in next year's campaign. Shortly after wfpl broke the story on thursday afternoon, conway told fox news channel's megyn kelly that he didn't want the actions by reilly and morrison to inflict damage on democrats in kentucky. \" the only reason that i came forward with what i knew was i was trying to protect the democratic party, \" conway said. \" i believe in our party's values, and i was doing what i thought was best for the party because i did not want their bad behavior, their poor mistakes — i shouldn"

        "summary": "A new study involving pigs and baboons could mean big news for humans downs the road. Researchers successfully implanted pig hearts into baboons, and two of the recipients lived for six months before being euthanized, reports scientific american. Writing in nature, the researchers from germany, sweden, and switzerland call the development a \" milestone \" for cross-species heart transplants, or cardiac xenotransplantation. A pig-to-baboon heart transplant had previously worked for 57 days, though that was just in a single case, per the guardian. The development further raises the possibility that pig hearts could someday work in humans, perhaps putting an end to donor waiting lists, though much research is needed before that could happen. One hurdle scientists would have to overcome: ensuring that pig hearts didn't transmit pig viruses into humans, explains nature in a separate article on the development. In the study, the scientists used pig hearts genetically modified to be more like baboon hearts ( and thus, human hearts, too ). They experimented with different methods of preserving the hearts and preparing them for transplant, and found success in the last group of five. One baboon had to be euthanized almost immediately, but the other four survived in good health through the experiment's three-month duration. At that point, two were euthanized, but scientists extended the experiment for the others. One lived 182 days and the other 195 before they, too, were euthanized, which scientific american explains was \" an action required under the study protocol. \" ( also this week: the first birth after a uterus transplant from a deceased donor. )",

        "summary": "Whale watchers off the coast of washington saw a welcome sight last week — a killer whale nicknamed \" granny \" who is believed to be an astonishing 105 years old, reports the san francisco chronicle. Granny's more formal name among scientists who have studied her for decades is j2, and a post at the orca network uses both names in the original post about her sighting: \" j2 granny ( oldest southern resident orca ) looking gorgeous. She and j27 spent more time out of the water than in it! \" the link includes multiple photos of her leaping from the water. Female orcas typically live about 50 years, notes a post at the noaa, but a rare few have been been known to reach 100. Granny appears to be in this category, or at least close to it. As the chronicle explains, researchers who first spotted her in 1971 pegged her age at 60. The orca network tells kiro-tv that the margin of error is 12 years, meaning she could be a youthful 90. Given the playful new images, she's doing pretty well for a creature who, if the older figure is correct, entered the ocean around the same time as the titanic and made it through two world wars, notes the charlotte observer. Why, she's even the honorary mayor of eastsound, washington, and you can read her june \" mayoral address \" here.

        "summary": "With a hillary clinton victory looking increasingly imminent, the outlook is getting rosier for a democratic senate as well, according to the cook political report. Marketwatch reports that 24 republican senate seats are being decided this election. Democrats need to pick up four of those to set up a 50/50 split in the senate with a vice president tim kaine as the tie-breaker. Thanks to a downward trend that started with the release of donald trump's access hollywood tape, the cook political report now predicts democrats will pick up anywhere between five and seven seats. The most likely are in illinois, wisconsin, and pennsylvania, according to politico. Clinton leads in the polls in all but two states where senate races are seen as toss-ups, and historically one party takes the lion's share of those during presidential elections. Despite the fact that republicans are likely to keep control of the house, a democratic senate could be huge for a president clinton, marketwatch argues. House republicans might decide it's time to try compromising after losing a sixth popular vote in the past seven presidential elections, not to mention trying to undo some of the damage to the brand done by trump. Clinton also worked well with republicans while in the senate. On the other side of the aisle, republican senate candidates are trying to get \" casual republicans \" to the polls with a \" don't-give-clinton-a-blank-check message. \" it's a strategy that could work, but with early voting already underway in 27 states, time is running out.",

She got out of her car and jumped on the man's back, and police are hailing her bravery. The trouble began when the officer saw drug paraphernalia inside the car of 28-year-old thomas bennett during a traffic stop, per police. Bennett allegedly became aggressive while the officer tried to handcuff him; police say bennett used the officer's own baton to hit the officer in the head, and was trying to grab the gun from the officer's holster. Williams-tillman called 911 first, then jumped into the fray, per a baton rouge pd facebook post. Williams-tillman \" made a big difference, \" says a baton rouge police spokesperson, acknowledging that things could have ended differently had the woman not stopped to help.

The girl was last seen walking to school on oct. 5, but police don't think she ever made it there; over the weekend, they found her backpack and water bottle in a town six miles away. The body was found last night near one of several abandoned mining shacks in the pattridge park open space, according to kdvr. Police refused to say if it was connected to the case at all, or even whether it was a child. Police have said, however, that they're looking into a possible connection to the abduction and assault of an 11-year-old monday in wyoming, 500 miles north.

The largest of the exercises, practicing civilian evacuation and sheltering procedures, involved 40 million people, and some bomb shelters are even getting upgrades. But does russia actually expect to start a nuclear war with the us? commentators are largely dismissive, saying the exercises are nothing more than posturing from russian president vladimir putin. Posturing or not, it's beginning to look a lot like a new cold war, the journal notes, with us and russian forces engaged in a proxy war in syria and russian nuclear missiles moving into striking range of european capitals. Meanwhile, abc news reports that russian state television has been busy stirring up anti-american sentiment and warning the populace to prepare for all eventualities. One recent russian news report stated: \" if it should one day happen, every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is. It's best to find out now. \" the main trigger point at the moment appears to be the conflict in syria, where russia is providing significant military aid to the forces of embattled dictator bashar al-assad, whom the us fiercely opposes. So far, the us and russia have avoided direct military engagement in syria.",
