        "summary": "The world's oldest parliament will soon be debating europe's first ban on circumcising male children for non-medical reasons — a tradition campaigners call \" male genital mutilation. \" the bill before iceland's parliament proposes a six-year prison sentence for anybody removing part or all of a child's sexual organs, the bbc reports. Supporters say circumcising young boys violates their rights, while opponents — including jewish and muslim leaders, as well as cardinal reinhard marx, president of the catholic church in the european union — argue that it violates the religious freedom of the country's small muslim and jewish communities, believed to number around 1,500 and 250 people, respectively. The religious leaders say the ban could make jews and muslims feel \" unwelcome \" in iceland. The bill — which says boys shouldn't be circumcised for religious or cultural reasons until they're old enough to decide for themselves — was proposed by silja dogg gunnarsdottir of the progressive party, the guardian reports. She says she decided to introduce the bill after realizing the country had banned female genital mutilation without addressing male circumcision. \" if we have laws banning circumcision for girls, then we should do so for boys, \" she says. \" we are talking about children's rights, not about freedom of belief. Everyone has the right to believe in what they want, but the rights of children come above the right to belief. \" danish doctors recommended in 2016 that nobody under 18 be circumcised, but the country stopped short of a ban.

        "summary": "Genetic research is paving the way to a \" new era \" in psychiatry, a researcher says, and that includes a different way of looking at schizophrenia: it's not one disease, but rather eight different ones, divided by their genetic profiles, a study suggests. Researchers reviewed genetic data from 4,200 people with schizophrenia alongside the dna of some 3,800 people without the disease. In the study, hearing voices was linked to one genetic profile, while confused speech was tied to another, usa today reports. Previous research seeking a single gene behind schizophrenia has been relatively fruitless, says an expert; instead, it's combinations of genes that are at play, as in poker — and \" there are some very bad hands out there. \" these combinations were associated with what in some cases was a very high risk of the disease, some 70 % to 100 %, the economic times reports via pti. A typical person has about a 1 % chance of suffering from schizophrenia, but genetics can help predict an individual's odds of developing the disease. Then, it may be possible to take early action to prevent its onset, researchers say. ( it turns out that schizophrenia is also linked to pot smoking. )",

The finding sets the stage for scientists to develop better ways to diagnose and treat schizophrenia, a mental illness that can be devastating when not adequately managed, says c. Robert cloninger, co-author of the study published monday in the american journal of psychiatry. \" we are really opening a new era of psychiatric diagnosis, \" says cloninger, professor of psychiatry and genetics at the washington university school of medicine in st. Louis. Cloninger says he hopes his work will \" allow for the development of a personalized diagnosis, opening the door to treating the cause, rather than just the symptoms, of schizophrenia. \" clonginger and colleagues found that certain genetic profiles matched particular symptoms. While people with one genetic cluster have odd and disorganized speech – what is sometimes called \" word salad \" – people with another genetic profile hear voices, according to the study, funded by the national institutes of health.

The finding could be a first step toward improved diagnosis and treatment for the debilitating psychiatric illness, said researchers at washington university school of medicine in st louis. About 80 per cent of the risk for schizophrenia is known to be inherited, but scientists have struggled to identify specific genes for the condition. Researchers in the new study analysed genetic influences on more than 4,000 people with schizophrenia and identified distinct gene clusters that contribute to eight different classes of schizophrenia. C robert cloninger, one of the study's senior investigators, and his colleagues matched precise dna variations in people with and without schizophrenia to symptoms in individual patients. In all, the researchers analysed nearly 700,000 sites within the genome where a single unit of dna is changed, often referred to as a single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ). They looked at snps in 4,200 people with schizophrenia and 3,800 healthy controls, learning how individual genetic variations interacted with each other to produce the illness. In some patients with hallucinations or delusions, for example, the researchers matched distinct genetic features to patients'symptoms, demonstrating that specific genetic variations interacted to create a 95 per cent certainty of schizophrenia.

( photo: photodisc ) new research shows that schizophrenia is not a single disease, but a group of eight distinct disorders, each caused by changes in clusters of genes that lead to different sets of symptoms. The finding sets the stage for scientists to develop better ways to diagnose and treat schizophrenia, a mental illness that can be devastating when not adequately managed, says c. Robert cloninger, co-author of the study published monday in the american journal of psychiatry. \" we are really opening a new era of psychiatric diagnosis, \" says cloninger, professor of psychiatry and genetics at the washington university school of medicine in st. Louis. Cloninger says he hopes his work will \" allow for the development of a personalized diagnosis, opening the door to treating the cause, rather than just the symptoms, of schizophrenia. \" clonginger and colleagues found that certain genetic profiles matched particular symptoms. While people with one genetic cluster have odd and disorganized speech – what is sometimes called \" word salad \" – people with another genetic profile hear voices, according to the study, funded by the national institutes of health.

            "Washington: schizophrenia is not a single disease but a group of eight genetically distinct disorders, each with its own set of symptoms, scientists have found. The finding could be a first step toward improved diagnosis and treatment for the debilitating psychiatric illness, said researchers at washington university school of medicine in st louis. About 80 per cent of the risk for schizophrenia is known to be inherited, but scientists have struggled to identify specific genes for the condition. Researchers in the new study analysed genetic influences on more than 4,000 people with schizophrenia and identified distinct gene clusters that contribute to eight different classes of schizophrenia. C robert cloninger, one of the study's senior investigators, and his colleagues matched precise dna variations in people with and without schizophrenia to symptoms in individual patients. In all, the researchers analysed nearly 700,000 sites within the genome where a single unit of dna is changed, often referred to as a single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ). They looked at snps in 4,200 people with schizophrenia and 3,800 healthy controls, learning how individual genetic variations interacted with each other to produce the illness. In some patients with hallucinations or delusions, for example, the researchers matched distinct genetic features to patients'symptoms, demonstrating that specific genetic variations interacted to create a 95 per cent certainty of schizophrenia.

            "The hungarian government is at it again, this time stirring up trouble with the claims conference over compensation for holocaust survivors. As reported by jta and others, the hungarian ministry of public administration and justice claims that the organization overseeing dispersal of funds for survivors distributed funds improperly and didn't report expenditures. Hungary wants $ 12.1 million returned and won't offer any more reparations funds until they receive it. Claims conference executive vice president greg schneider told jta that this was the first time in the organization's 62 years of operation \"that a country has reneged when it came time to pay. We hope that intervention at the highest level in hungary will resolve this issue for hungarian survivors who need help. \" the claims conference has put forth a document detailing all recipients of funds, including how much each received. The group further states that the hungarian government has failed to transfer $ 5.6 million as required under a previous agreement and that transfers stopped after the fidesz party came to office in 2010. This is only the latest ugly incident for hungary and its ruling party, which many commentators have accused of showing fascist leanings.

Or more precisely, the retired fbi agent was working for a small team of cia analysts who apparently didn't fill in their superiors about what they were doing, which amounted to running unauthorized spy operations overseas, according to the two stories.

In one sent before his iran trip, he asked about getting paid, and she told him to deal with her, not the cia's contract office. \"keep talk about the additional money among us girls, \" she wrote. Jablonski has since left the agency and could face criminal charges, says the post. As for levinson, now 65, the last proof that he was alive came nearly three years ago. The best guess is that iran is either holding him or knows where he is.

Chess may not have the national spotlight athletics does, but these days, the money behind it is nothing to sniff at.

Susan polgar didn't get the deal — but webster, the st. Louis school where she now works ( and to which she took her entire team ), says it spends $ 635,000 per year on chess, not including scholarships for players. And this is at a school that doesn't give athletic scholarships, the washington post notes. The university of texas-dallas, another big player, last year spent some $ 691,000, including scholarships, it says. These figures don't faze the professor behind the chess program at the university of maryland baltimore county, a frequent winner of chess's own final four. \" it is the level of funding you need these days to have a really top-notch chess program, \" he says. Indeed, since polgar came on, webster recently won its second title in two years, the st. Louis post-dispatch reports.

West filed a loss claim with the insurers two days after his hospitalization, but the lawsuit states that since then, the insurers haven't provided \" anything approaching a coherent explanation \" for why they haven't paid the claim — or, in fact, offered any guarantees they ever will, the hollywood reporter reports. West's personal doctor offered a sworn statement to the insurers that west suffered a \" debilitating medical condition \" that prevented him from touring, and the lawsuit claims that diagnosis was backed up by another doctor handpicked by the insurers. Regardless of the doctors'statements, insurers are hunting \" for some contrived excuse not to pay \" west, including his marijuana use, according to the lawsuit, which also alleges the insurers leaked \" privileged, private, and personal information \" about west to the media. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing. \" lloyd's companies enjoy collecting bounteous premiums; they don't enjoy paying claims, no matter how legitimate, \" the suit notes.",

As it recounts, cavanagh has 1,497 valid credit cards, adding up to $ 1.7 million in available credit. The wild stats don't end there: his custom wallet, the world's longest, stretches 250 feet, weighs 38 pounds, and can hold only 800 of his many cards, not that he carries them around: the los angeles times reported in a 2004 profile that all but one ( which he uses and pays off in full in each month, giving him nearly perfect credit ) are kept in a safe-deposit box. Cavanagh's card collection started as \" silly bet \" with a friend nearly half a century ago. Whoever collected the most cards by the end of the year would win a dinner. The final score: 143-138 in cavanagh's favor. With credit cards from gas stations, airlines, and an ice cream store, cavanagh says he's only been denied credit once, by the now-defunct jj newberry co., which said he had too much credit already. To maintain his title ( which he's held since 1971, per abc news ), cavanagh has to keep amassing cards. If a card isn't valid any more, he doesn't count it as part of his collection. Cavanagh isn't the only collector of plastic. The american credit card collectors society was formed in 1994 and holds regular conventions.

Scientists from botanic gardens conservation international in the uk spent two years compiling the database, relying on information from 500 published sources and from local experts around the world, reports npr. In an article in the journal of sustainable forestry, they note that it's the first overview of all known tree species by scientific name. The database will be \" hugely useful for us in prioritizing which ones we need to do conservation action on and which ones we need to do assessments to find out what their status is, \" says bgci exec paul smith. Among their findings: brazil is home to the highest number of species at 8,715, and 58 % of trees grow in just one nation, making them vulnerable if whatever country that happens to be is lax on protection. Also, 10,000 species are threatened with extinction — with examples such as karomia gigas in tanzania, which were over-harvested to the point of being down to a total of six last year, reports the bbc. The list will be used to help the global tree assessment assess the conservation status of each tree species by 2020. The effort comes on the heels of a 2015 study finding that there are probably more than 3 trillion individual trees around the world, notes the smithsonian. Researchers estimate that 12,000 species exist in the amazon basin and that 4,000 in that area have yet to be discovered. ( the taliban recently called on afghans to plant more trees. )",

He noted some military and provisional ballots are still being counted and suggested he ' ll concede only with \" certification by the secretary of state. \" yet the republican might also be looking beyond the election, to the future. Noting it's unlikely moore will leave politics, the ap reports he could make his third bid for governor in 2018 — or perhaps revive his campaign against jones in an effort to nab his senate seat in 2020. Either option could prove difficult for moore, who faces sexual misconduct allegations from eight women and \" has now lost more statewide races than he's won in alabama, \" per the ap. Republican strategist john stipanovich has referred to moore as \" a terrible candidate, \" per the hill, and jonathan bernstein at the denver post notes that \" republicans aren't going to put up a bad candidate every time, \" especially with such a slim majority in the senate. \" you need good candidates to win in senate races, \" republican sen. Ron johnson said in response to moore's loss tuesday. \" alabamians didn't want somebody who dated 14-year-old girls. \" the ap notes moore might also return to the foundation for moral law, a group he founded with the aim \" to restore the knowledge of god in law and government. \"",

That's why, in a feb. 28 letter to the japanese newspaper mainichi shimbun, one man says his wife became \" glum and anxious \" when she found out she was with child, as it wasn't her \" turn \" at the child care center she works at in aichi prefecture, per the telegraph. The director at his wife's workplace, the man writes, had set up marriage and pregnancy \" shifts \" for employees, and it was an \" unspoken rule \" that workers who were more senior got first dibs on diaper duty. And so when the man and his wife went together to reveal the pregnancy and apologize, his wife was \" chided \" for acting so \" selfishly. \" this isn't an uncommon phenomenon in japan; there's even a term for it: matahara, or \" maternity harassment, \" and it's apparently a big issue. A 2015 government survey noted half of all japanese working women were harassed when they became pregnant, with 20 % losing their jobs altogether. The reasoning behind the taking-turns mandate often has to do with a dearth of workers in certain industries, per usa today. The telegraph cites a 26-year-old woman in the cosmetics industry who was told she'd have to wait till she was 35 or so to have a child; she says she and other female colleagues were given childbirth schedules, along with a warning that \" selfish behavior will be subject to punishment. \" in this most recent case, however, the rule-breaking woman has the public on her side ( her husband's letter elicited much support ), as well as her husband. His letter cites the \" respect \" he has for his wife, and that \" the conditions of those working to nurture and care for children are evidence of a backward country, \" per the telegraph.",

A national institute for occupational safety and health report published in the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine indicates that black lung, caused by breathing in too much coal dust, is likely back on the rise because miners still remain too exposed, dust composition has become more toxic, or — most disturbingly — coal companies haven't been exercising due diligence in adhering to safety regulations, vocativ reports. The 900 % rate increase over the past 15 years is even more distressing in the light of tighter regulations ( introduced in august, according to a may ap story ) to protect miners and stave off the disease — one ohio coal operator even sued the federal government over the strict measures, saying the administration should concentrate on high-incidence areas when it comes to black lung and not punish the entire industry.

It happened at the new store located at one bellevue place around 9 a.m. Metro animal care and control said the raid came after they received information, photos and videos of \" what appeared to be inadequate care for injured animals at the petsmart location in bellevue. \" animal control officers confiscated six animals from the store - a guinea pig, mice and hamsters. All six animals were taken to a local vet to be checked out. Peta alleges managers at the bellevue store were \" observed repeatedly refusing to provide sick, injured and dying animals with veterinary care in order to ' keep costs down'so they would receive bonuses. \" peta also claims a nashville supervisor was recorded instructing staff not to tell customers that petsmart buys animals from sun pet ltd., a warehouse in atlanta that was put on probation by the georgia department of agriculture after a peta investigation in 2010. A petsmart employee, who has worked for the company for several years, told news 2 off-camera she completely refutes the allegations made by peta. She said she's never seen animals abused or mistreated when they're sick. She told news 2 if animals get sick, the staff cares for them. District attorney glenn funk '",

        "summary": "The tsa is reportedly mulling over a proposal to eliminate screenings at some airports, which would mark a major departure from the pricey, time intensive and often headache-inducing security measures put in place post-911. Cnn reported wednesday that the move would lift the requirement at 150 small and some medium-sized airports that serve aircraft with capacities no larger than 60 passengers. Per documents obtained by cnn, travelers from the affected airports who travel to larger hubs would be subject to screenings upon arrival. The move would also save serious federal cash in the range of $ 150 million a year, according to the documents, freeing up more money for security measures where experts feel they're more needed. While anonymous tsa officials told cnn they fear the change would increase security risks, the report said it could cause only a \" small ( non-zero ) undesirable increase in risk related to additional adversary opportunity. \" in other news with the potential to make the trip through security a little easier, the ap has reported that multiple major airports are testing 3-d imagers that could allow travelers to leave liquids and laptops in their carry-on bags. Per bloomberg, tsa plans to have the scanners, whose ct technology is akin to what's used in medicine, in more than 145 in airports by october 2019.",

Airports of new three-dimensional x-ray scanners that may someday allow passengers to bring liquids into their bags.

It plans to have more than 145 in airports by october 2019, along with 16 at federal test facilities. Instead of the existing x-ray machines that snap images from two angles, the new scanners have a spinning x-ray that takes hundreds of images in seconds. That gives security agents a 3-d image of a bag's contents with far higher fidelity, making it easier to spot weapons or explosives. \"use of ct technology substantially improves tsa's threat detection capability at the checkpoint, \" agency administrator david pekoske said in the release. While images of carry-on bags will continue to be evaluated by tsa screeners, companies are trying to develop computerized systems that automatically detect suspicious items to lower the risk of human error.

            "Rebel fighters hold only isolated pockets of oil town after forces loyal to libyan leader attack by air, land and sea. Forces loyal to muammar gaddafi, the libyan leader, have launched a large-scale offensive, beginning with new air strikes on the eastern oil-producing towns of ras lanuf and brega. Rebel forces were reported to be retreating from ras lanuf, the site of a key oil installation. They lost control of the pockets of residential parts of the town that they had been clinging to by friday morning, sources told al jazeera. Yet they retained control of the strategically-important oil refineries in the town's port, ibrahim said, the deputy director of the hospital in nearby ajdabiya, told the associated press. Live blog ibrahim al-alwani, a rebel fighter, said he and comrades still in ras lanuf had seen government troops in the town centre. \" i saw maybe 150 men and three tanks, \" he told reuters on friday morning. \" i can hear clashes. \" the government troops had landed by boat near the fadeel hotel in ras lanuf on friday, a spokesperson told reuters. \" four boats carrying 40 to 50 men each landed there. We are fighting them right now, \" mohammed al-mughrabi said. Foreign journalists faced significant hurdles on getting information out of ras lanuf, but libyan state television aired",
            "Revolt like an egyptian anti-qaddafi rebels retreat, u.s. Takes steps to further involvement after days of fighting, anti-qaddafi rebels have begun retreating from the libyan port city of ras lanuf. Low on ammunition and artillery, a caravan of hundreds of opposition rebels began an eastward journey toward benghazi today. But all may not be lost. This week, france became the first country to recognize the rebels as a legitimate governing force, and french president nicolas sarkozy said that he would begin \" targeted operations \" to defend civilians with international approval.

Per the bbc and the guardian, leo varadkar will become the nation's first gay taoiseach, or head of government, as well as the country's youngest ever pm at the age of 38, after he was voted in as head of the government's leading fine gael party on friday. Varadkar took in 60 % of the votes over his rival, housing minister simon coveney, to earn the right to take over for outgoing pm enda kenny, who announced he was leaving his post last month. \" if my election shows anything, it's that prejudice has no hold in this republic, \" varadkar said after his victory was announced friday evening. Varadkar's father, a doctor from mumbai, met his mother, an irish nurse, when they both worked at an english hospital in the ' 60s. That gives varadkar, also a doctor, yet another first: the first prime minister to come from an ethnic minority background. He came out as gay in 2015, but while his status as the first gay pm is making headlines, gay rights groups are pleased that most of the attention he received during the campaign was mainly focused on his platforms. \" it's really significant that both his party and the media in ireland focused on his policies, rather than him simply being a gay man who wants to lead the country, \" the editor of dublin's gay community news tells the guardian.

During the shooting, he was allegedly carrying a semiautomatic 9mm pistol and an ar-15 assault rifle, reports nbc washington. Authorities are investigating whether alexis was working as a defense contractor or a civilian employee of the navy, and whether he was assigned to the navy yard, reports the post, but authorities believe he got in using someone else's id card. Cbs reports that the id belonged to one rollie chance, who has been on administrative leave since october. Chance says he does not know alexis.

Sixteen years later, tragedy struck the nelson family again when caitlin, a student at connecticut's sacred heart university, died after apparently choking during a pancake-eating contest, the hartford courant reports. Per the connecticut post, nelson had eaten four or five pancakes during the march 30 event when she started shaking uncontrollably and collapsed. Police say she spit out some pieces of pancake but was still choking; officers were not able to successfully use the heimlich maneuver but did physically remove food from nelson's throat and performed cpr. Nelson was initially said to be in critical but stable condition and was transferred to a new york hospital friday, but died sunday. Nelson, who was from new jersey, also had multiple food allergies, but officials do not believe those contributed to her death. An autopsy report and official cause of death have not yet been released. All police will confirm is that she died from complications related to the event, which was put on by the campus's greek life department. \" it's a tragic event that started out as something fun, \" a police rep tells cbs new york. Nelson, reported as either 20 or 21 years old, was majoring in social work and often volunteered in support of trauma victims. A source tells the new york daily news the contest was part of a charity event. \" to die for a charity eating pancakes after the dad went down is terribly sad, \" the source says.

The hollywood reporter notes that john goodman's character, dan ( roseanne's husband on the show ), will also be depicted as a trump supporter, but it's unclear where the rest of the conner family will stand when the show debuts on march 27 after being off the air for 21 years, though usa today notes one of the early episodes features \" family members arguing for and against \" trump. The 65-year-old barr, who's often caused a stir on twitter with her political beliefs, noted the \" polarization \" today within american families, saying that to loathe someone over their vote is \" not american. \" showrunner bruce helford, meanwhile, says that abc caters mostly to a liberal audience that is higher up the socioeconomic ladder and that showcasing a working-class family's issues \" would heal things. \" barr insisted she's \" not a trump apologist \" in real life and that \" he says a lot of crazy s ---, \" though she admitted her kids have taken her twitter password from her as the show's debut nears. She said she wants to see an end to \" hatriotism \" in the us and even addresses rumors of an oprah 2020 run. \" i love oprah like everybody else, \" she noted, but \" i think i'd be a better president than oprah … probably even president trump. \"",

While few really hated oz the great and powerful, few loved it either, and most concluding james franco was a poor choice for the lead. Here's what people are saying: the movie makes \" an honest effort to capture the family-movie spirit of old hollywood, \" writes alex o ' hehir at salon. But it winds up feeling like \" a lumbering, bloated spectacle, \" with no real point and a badly miscast lead in franco. \" i can tell he made all sorts of acting-school decisions about this character, but i don't think we needed his introspective, discount-brando act when it came to playing the wizard of freakin ' oz. \" ty burr at the boston globe was not transported. \" the landscapes have the craggy, familiar ' awesomeness ' of every other computer-generated fantasy film these days, \" he gripes. The film does have a great ending, but that just makes you realize that the men behind the curtain/camera \" are more interested in building a new machine than in taking us over the rainbow and bringing us back home. \" in franco and raimi \" you have two determined ironists tackling a fable of utter sincerity, \" muses peter howell at the toronto star. Raimi plays it straight, which is both a good and bad thing. \" you could easily see this playing as part of a double bill with the wizard of oz, even if the effects in raimi's film often look cheesier. \" mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle gives the film high marks — his only criticism is that it's too long, and \" the individual scenes are so good that … it's hard to say what exactly should be cut. \" fans of the original especially will appreciate it. \" appreciate, \" he stresses. \" enjoy.

        "summary": "Have an appetite for onions? your body could be benefitting in ways scientists are just beginning to understand. In the latest study on what may well be a superfood, scientists at the university of guelph in ontario, canada, report in the journal food research international that red onions in particular boast an ability to disrupt cancer cell communication and promote a generally poor environment for cancer cells, \" which inhibits growth. \" the team was looking specifically at colon cancer, but they found that the onion cells are just as good at killing breast cancer cells. The trick, reports huffpost, will be to extract the key ingredient, dose it just right, and use it medicinally. That key ingredient is quercetin, a flavonoid already known for its cancer-fighting properties. This study finds that onions in general have unusually high levels of quercetin compared to other foods, and that ontario onions in particular have high levels of the compound compared to onions grown elsewhere. But red onions also boast high levels of anthocyanin, a plant pigment that help make quercetin molecules better scavengers. ( because anthocyanin helps make foods colorful, it makes sense to the researchers that red onions, which are so dark, have the greatest cancer-fighting potential. ) it's unclear whether red onions from outside of ontario will be as effective, but time reports the researchers think it's likely, and plan to start clinical trials. ( onions also help reduce the risk of heart disease. )",

She faced criticism for saying she was an immigrant from colombia who struggled financially growing up when she was actually born in florida and had hundreds of thousands of dollars in a trust fund. Her victory came on a night when primary voters also took their revenge on a splinter group of democratic state senators who broke with the party to join a group that supported republican control of the chamber.

The early release was due to prosecutors recently discovering that state law doesn't permit an inmate to serve more than one year at a state jail ( as opposed to a prison ), leading a judge to modify miller's sentence from two years to one, variety reports. The judge also took into account the fact that miller's lawyers — who the hollywood reporter says tried to get him out twice before — and the da's office had struck a \" two-for-one \" agreement of possible early release for good behavior before miller entered his plea last year. Miller, who had pleaded guilty to criminal trespassing and involuntary manslaughter in the death of sarah jones, will continue his 10-year probation, which includes a mandate saying he can't direct a film or otherwise have any supervisory role overseeing safety in a film production. On feb. 20, 2014, jones was working on the set of the gregg allman biopic, filming a scene on train tracks in wayne county, ga., when she was struck by a train and killed, per the reporter; eight others were injured, variety notes. The movie production company had reportedly been denied access to the tracks and shot there anyway, leading to miller becoming the first known filmmaker to be convicted and jailed for an on-set death. Jones ' parents tell variety they initially agreed to the plea deal placing miller in jail instead of prison due to his health and say they never would have agreed to it if they had known he'd be released after one year. \" we don't mean to inflict more pain to mr. Miller's family, \" jones ' father, richard jones, said in court wednesday. \" it's about making the film industry a better, safer place. \" others expressed their outrage more forcefully. \" it's a complete miscarriage of justice and merely a slap on the wrist, \" one of jones ' former colleagues tells the reporter. \" one year in jail is hardly accountability. \"",

        "summary": "As britain mourns the 22 people killed in monday night's attack on an ariana grande concert in manchester, authorities are scouring the record of alleged suicide bomber salman abedi. Isis has claimed credit for the attack, though sources tell nbc that the 22-year-old manchester resident of libyan descent also had ties to al-qaeda and had received terrorist training overseas. Bernard collomb, france's new interior minister, said tuesday that abedi had \" proven \" ties to isis and was apparently radicalized after a trip that included libya and syria. In other developments: police in manchester made three more arrests in connection with the attack early wednesday, the telegraph reports. A 23-year-old man was arrested tuesday. Amid the uk's highest terror alert level in more than a decade, the changing of the guard ceremony at buckingham palace has been canceled because officers have been deployed elsewhere, authorities say. British home secretary amber rudd said wednesday that security forces knew abedi \" up to a point, \" the ap reports. She said the security alert level will remain critical until more is known about potential accomplices and other plots. Health officials say that at least 20 people wounded in the attack are receiving critical care, and some of them suffered \" horrific injuries, \" the washington post reports. Surgeon mounir hakimi has been treating attack victims and he says the injuries resemble those he saw while volunteering in syria. \" missiles fired in syria involve lots of shrapnel in them, nails and debris, but in syria on a much higher scale, \" he tells the guardian. He says his colleagues have treated shrapnel injuries as well as crush wounds that may have been caused in the panic after the explosion. Entertainment companies have been reviewing security procedures since the attack, though the bomber struck in a foyer outside of manchester arena instead of inside the venue, where security was tighter, the new york times reports. Promoters say they believe the extra security measures might drive up ticket costs, but neither price hikes nor fear of further attacks will badly damage the concert business. The manchester evening news reports that more victims were identified wednesday, including two mothers from oldham who were killed as they waited outside the concert for their 15-year-old daughters.",

Sture bergwall — better known to most in sweden as thomas quick, a combination of his mother's maiden name ( quick ) and the first name of the 14-year-old boy he confessed was his first murder victim — has claimed credit for roughly 30 murders, and was between 1994 and 2001 convicted for eight. He confessed to raping children, and cannibalizing at least one victim. But a court ordered the 63-year-old freed for one simple reason: he made all of it up. Bergwall decided to become a fake monster in 1991 to avoid being released from a psychiatric ward, time explains. He combed its library for famous unsolved murders and claimed credit for them, saying he'd been driven to the deeds by repressed childhood trauma. He often got case details wrong, but those errors were brushed aside as evidence of just how painful his repressed memories were. He finally came clean to a swedish filmmaker in 2008, according to this in-depth gq profile, but he's been kept in the mental institution while awaiting word on whether it was safe to release him.

        "summary": "Researchers just announced the discovery of radio signals from beyond our galaxy that are behaving in strange ways. Fast radio bursts — or frbs — are very rare, very quick blasts of radio waves originating billions of light years away, popular science explains. It's unclear where exactly in the universe they're coming from and what's causing them. Since the first one was discovered in 2007, scientists have found only 17 total, and none of them ever repeat, the verge reports. At least that's what everyone thought. According to a paper published this week in nature, researchers at cornell university have found evidence of frbs that do just that. Scientists used to think frbs were caused by \" cataclysmic events, \" such as neutron stars colliding with each other and exploding. Repeating frbs means that can't be the case. \" this research shows for the first time that there can be multiple frbs from the same place in the sky, \" researcher shami chatterjee says in a press release. \" whatever produces the frb can't be destroyed by the burst, because otherwise, what would produce the next pulse? \" and the mystery deepens: \" we're showing that whatever battery drives frbs, it can recharge in minutes, \" astronomy professor james cordes says. \" the energy of the event becomes very problematic. \" researchers hope to next pinpoint where the frbs are coming from in order to figure out what they're coming from, and they ' ll be helped by three massive radio telescopes that start operating next year. ( speaking of space mysteries: \" alien megastructures \" have scientists baffled. )",

Per the ap, lorde, the only woman nominated for album of the year, didn't perform ( but males who weren't nominees did ); there were no women up for record of the year; and ed sheeran took home honors for best pop solo performance as the only male in that category. Recording academy president neil portnow's take when he was asked about this apparent disparity backstage: \" it has to begin with women who have the creativity in their hearts and their souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, who want to be producers, who want to be part of the industry on an executive level, to step up. \" women artists did step up after his remarks, but mainly to criticize him. Perhaps the most vocal, per mashable, was pink, who penned an \" eviscerating \" open letter. \" women in music don't need to'step up ' — women in music have been stepping since the beginning of time, \" she noted in a handwritten missive on twitter. \" they've been killing it. \" her rebuttal to portnow was lauded by other female powerhouses, including katy perry, who tweeted: \" another powerful woman, leading by example. We all have a responsibility to call out the absurd lack of equality everywhere we see it. \" and, per the guardian, sheryl crow, who pined for a return to categories broken down by gender. \" who will young girls be inspired by to pick up a guitar and rock when most every category is filled with men? \" she posted online. \" i ' m not sure it is about women needing to'step up ', ( as said by the male in charge ). \"",

        "summary": "Great news for anyone in the market for a prohibitively expensive, largely useless status symbol: sharp is releasing the first commercially available 8k tv next month. The bbc reports the 85-inch set — which comes with a $ 133,000 price tag — has a resolution 16 times better than a regular hd tv, creating images so detailed they appear 3d. ( hey, finally a chance for three-dimensional characters on the walking dead. ) sharp's 8k tv boasts 104 pixels per inch and requires four hdmi cables simultaneously to reach its full, high-definition capabilities. But you can pretty much ignore all that, because 8k content is nearly nonexistent. Cnbc reports japan isn't planning to broadcast anything in 8k until the 2020 tokyo olympics. And most companies are just now getting around to discussing 4k content to use with so-called ultra-hd tvs. The united kingdom broadcast a single soccer match in 4k this year, and companies like lg and samsung are only in the early stages of partnering with streaming services and movie studios to create 4k content for their ultra-hd tvs and blu-ray players. According to the bbc, experts believe 8k tvs like sharp's will mostly be used as digital billboards or with keyhole cameras during surgeries. Regardless, consumers can start purchasing their $ 133,000 paperweights oct. 30.",

And since premature babies have a higher risk of suffering from asthma, learning disabilities, and developmental problems, you may want to avoid getting pregnant during that particular month. Why may? the authors think it's because the third trimester arrives right around flu season; the flu is known to contribute to early delivery, time reports. In general, the study found babies conceived in the first half of the year spent less time in the womb, but may was the worst month, the los angeles times reports. The study also found that infants conceived in the summer were heavier than other infants — just about a third of an ounce heavier, but that's significant for a baby. Previous studies have also found differences between babies born in different seasons, but those studies highlighted factors like the mother's socioeconomic status. This study compared siblings in order to neutralize factors like that, and found that no matter what your socioeconomic status, certain months are just more \" unfavorable \" in which to get pregnant.",

After mexico lost to brazil 2-0 in their round of 16 world cup game monday, coach juan carlos osario blamed \" fake fouls \" for breaking up the flow of play and made it clear he thought neymar had been feigning injury in an attempt to influence referees, the guardian reports. \" this is a strong sport, a man's sport and i think there shouldn't be so much acting, \" he said. Neymar was accused of similar behavior in brazil's games earlier in the tournament. When mexico's miguel layun put his foot on top of neymar's shin after the brazilian had taken another dive, neymar decide to \" unleash that now-famous scream, then follow it up with a writhing, contorting, pounding-the-turf response worthy of hollywood, \" writes martin rogers at usa today, calling the player an \" embarrassment \" despite his undeniably great talent. \" i've seen people get shot that take it better than this clown. What a talent; what a waste, \" tweeted british lawmaker johnny mercer.

But the logical side of me is more scared of the idea of a woman elected senator that is unfamiliar with the first amendment... — alaska is fascinating because it will either confirm or deny sarah palin's reign as kingmaker. If i were putting money down on it in vegas, my bet would be with lisa murkowski with the write-in win. If she does win, look for sarah palin to blame all media and, more than likely, a memorable concession speech from joe miller. It's obvious that [ obama's ] administration still thinks he is just a rock star and can somehow get by continuing to act as such. — in the tight and hugely expensive california race, i predict a win for the former ceo of ebay. I actually see meg whitman as one of the next great republican leaders. Her wealth and small campaign gaffes have strayed from the focus of this woman's success, but i see her winning tomorrow and then becoming a strong and effective national leader.

While prevailing opinion holds that the gop will take over the house of representatives, there are some dissenters among national politicians. The senate outlook is even more messy, but it is generally accepted that republicans face a steeper climb to take back the upper chamber."

Tournament highlight arrives courtesy of northern iowa's paul jesperson, whose heave as time expired gave the 11th-seeded panthers the upset win over no. 6 texas. The game was tied with three seconds remaining by texas's isaiah taylor, whose jumper appeared to force overtime. But northern iowa scrambled to get the ball in — declining to use its last timeout — and jesperson found the ball in his hands. He banked the game-winning 3-pointer in from just about half-court to win it, 75-72. Thus ended a fantastic game in oklahoma city that featured multiple lead changes in the final minutes. It was an uncomfortable matchup for the longhorns. The panthers, who do not have a starter taller than 6 feet 9 inches tall, like to spread the floor, work the shot clock down, and open up driving lanes to the hoop. Northern iowa led by as much as 16 in the first half after going on a 23-2 run. Texas responded by opening the second half on a 17-3 run.

Several days later, it watched additional partial eclipses caused by phobos and deimos, the red planet's other minuscule satellite ( though images from these last two celestial events are not available yet ). Scientists will use these photos to nail down the orbits of phobos and deimos precisely, and to determine how much they have changed over the last few years, researchers said. This information, in turn, could yield key insights about the interior of mars, which remains largely mysterious. \" we can't go inside mars, but we can use these to tell how much mars is deformed when the moons go by,",
            "On mars, a partial eclipse of the sun isn't quite as rare as on earth. So nasa's mars curiosity rover is snapping hundreds of pictures of the spectacle for the folks back home to ooh and aah over. This wednesday, sept. 19, 2012 photo provided by nasa shows a rock about 8 feet ( 2.5 meters ) in front of the curiosity rover on mars. The rock is about 10 inches ( 25 centimeters ) tall and 16 inches ( 40... ( associated press ) in this thursday, sept. 13, 2012 photo made available by nasa, the martian moon phobos grazes the sun's disk as seen by the curiosity rover. Mars has two moons moving fast around the red planet, making... ( associated press ) two moons zip around the red planet and they're closer and faster than our lumbering moon, so eclipses are more common. Scientists say there's even somewhat of an eclipse season on mars, and it's that time of year when those martian moons take turns taking bites of the sun. Curiosity turned its cameras skyward to watch the action in three different eclipses, starting last week and continuing wednesday, when a moon partially slipped between mars and the sun. The rover has been beaming back a stream of photos of the martian landscape since"
