        "summary": "If there's anywhere you ' ll see a punk rocker with a \" multicolored mohawk, \" new york city would be the place. But the mandarin duck that's been hanging out in central park since mid-october is another story entirely. The new york times reports the creature with brilliantly hued plumage was first spotted oct. 10 and has since gone viral, with spectators all vying for pictures of an animal usually seen only in east asia. For now, the duck's origins remain a mystery: none of the city's zoos have this type of duck missing from the roster, and it's illegal in nyc to keep a duck as a pet. That means the duck perhaps escaped from, say, an owner in new jersey and made its way to the city, or maybe the owner itself got sick of the duck and unceremoniously left it and ran. Either way, the duck has been a huge hit. \" it's just an incredible gift to new york, \" one birder tells cbs new york. Avian experts believe that based on its feeding habits — it likes bugs and vegetation skimmed from the water's surface — the duck should be able to survive just fine in the big apple, and park officials say they're just going to let it be unless it becomes injured. It already appears to have made friends with the park's mallards. Read more on how a pair of eager birders tried ( and ultimately succeeded ) to coax the duck to come closer for pictures, including with a hot pretzel from a nearby cart and, yes, quacking.

            "On tuesday afternoon, mr. Barrett, 54, returned to the pond to check on the mandarin duck. Carrying binoculars, mr. Barrett, who works as an investor and computer scientist when he's not birding, circled the shore trying to spot the glamorous creature. After many minutes of fruitless searching, he spotted the duck nestled near a rock across the pond, on the eastern shore of the hallett nature sanctuary. Joined by a fellow birder on a lunch break from her day job, mr. Barrett began to strategize how he'd coax the duck from the other side, which was thick with trees and shadows in the late afternoon. \"we need to be enterprising, \" he said. First, the pair of birders tried to entice him. Mr. Barrett purchased a salted soft pretzel from a cart in the park, ripping off tiny pieces and tossing them off the shore. No luck. The second birder, sandra critelli, muttered that she needed to get back to the office soon. \"but that damn duck! \" she said. As his next option, mr. Barrett tried to chase the duck away from its nook on the distant side of the pond. After walking around the pond to the forested nature sanctuary, mr. Barrett climbed around trees and over branches to reach the shore. Then, he began to quack. Yes, quack. And soon, a small group of ducks began to swim out of the shadows. Mr. Barrett sprinted over the bridge and back to the other side of the pond. By the time he got there, the mandarin duck was already basking in the sun with his mallard friends, posing for awe-struck onlookers with cameras."

        "summary": "That vilma grunwald's letter even exists is extraordinary. She penned it in the minutes before she was gassed at auschwitz, addressed it to her husband, and handed it to a nazi guard who did the improbable — delivered it to the man, who was also imprisoned at the camp. The washington post reports she accompanied her eldest child, a 16-year-old named john who limped, to the gas chambers. The indianapolis star has the story of the july 11, 1944, letter, which has for the last four years resided at the united states holocaust memorial museum. \" i ' m always reluctant to say it's the only such document ever created, \" says the museum's chief acquisitions curator, \" but to the best of our knowledge \" it is the only surviving letter written at the concentration camp prior to a gassing. Grunwald's son, misa ( who now goes by frank and lives northeast of indianapolis ) learned of the letter as an 11-year-old in 1946 but did not read it until after his father's 1967 death. Frank tells the star that what he found most moving was the 11-sentence letter's tone: free of anger or resentment, and focused only on him and his father. It reads in part: \" the famous trucks are already here and we are waiting for it to begin.... You — my only and dearest one, do not blame yourself for what happened, it was our destiny. We did what we could.... Take care of the little golden boy and don't spoil him too much with your love. Both of you — stay healthy, my dear ones. I will be thinking of you and misa.

It was nothing less than mind-boggling, writes rich cohen at vanity fair. \" it felt less like a crime than a prank, what you might do to your brother if you were all-powerful and he had a lot of syrup. \" but as his long feature explains, it was indeed serious business, and at the heart of the strange tale is a group he likens to the opec of the syrup world: the federation of quebec maple syrup producers. Quebec makes 72 % of the world's maple syrup, and the federation keeps an \" ironfisted \" control over the precious stuff, he writes. How precious? at $ 1,300 a barrel, maple syrup is worth roughly 26 times more than oil. And while the federation's policies have kept prices high, they also may have led to what the piece calls \" one of the greatest agricultural crimes in all of history. \" critics liken the group not just to opec but, as one rogue producer puts it, to \" the mafia. \" the federation keeps prices stable by maintaining a gigantic reserve of maple syrup and thus controlling supply. It was this reserve that thieves began stealing from in a months-long scheme. They'd remove barrels of syrup from a warehouse, siphon out the syrup, replace it with water, then replace the barrel. A warehouse worker finally noticed something was amiss in july of that year, and international headlines ensued. ( the reputed ringleader was found guilty last month. ) the full story has more details on the heist and the great detective work that followed, along with a primer on the world of syrup that includes this nugget: while quebec makes 72 % of maple syrup, the us has far more maple trees, meaning that \" if the americans ever make the push to self-sufficiency, french canada is cooked. \" read it here.",

The resulting investigation by quebec provincial police led to the arrests of 26 people. On saturday, richard vallières was found guilty of theft, fraud and trafficking stolen goods. During his trial in quebec superior court, he said that he had filled the barrels with water. But he also insisted that he hadn't wanted to.

If this nation was not founded on the free flow of syrup, it should have been. And now, as anyone with kids can tell you, the price of syrup has remained stable and high; it's more expensive than oil. Is it arab sheikhs who did this, russian oligarchs? no. It's canadians, who, organized into an ironfisted cartel, have established a stranglehold on that honey-flavored elixir. In short, fpaq — the federation of quebec maple syrup producers — is opec. Formed in 1966, the federation was tasked with taking a business in which few could make a decent living — the price went north to south with the quality of the yield, which went north to south with the quality of the spring — and turning it into a respectable trade. This was accomplished in the classic way: quotas, rules. You control supply, you control price. You limit supply, you raise price. Because quebec makes 72 percent of the world's maple syrup, it"

Wwl-tv arrived at that number after making a public records request to the current coroner, who did not agree to be interviewed. The data comes from autopsy reports — reports that contain only a few identifying details, like the location of the body and what it was clad in or carried. One unknown black male wore black nike tennis shoes and a black necklace with a wooden african pendant. An unknown female was wearing a yellow metal earring with the letters \" rmj \" on it and a single curler in her hair. State health officials say the department spent more than $ 3 million trying to reunite families with the remains of the dead; the federal government ended up covering only $ 2.2 million of that, and there's no more money for further testing, says dr. Louis cataldie, who helmed the disaster mortuary operational response team that helped id the bodies. The condition of the bodies rendered fingerprints largely \" useless, \" and so \" we would take dna from family members and relatives and try and match the family tree, \" he says of his work. \" that's real hard to do when you've got people displaced to texas and you're trying to get their dna. \" former orleans parish coroner frank minyard's take: \" it's ludicrous in this day and age to have people unidentified. \" ( ten years on, these are 10 standout reads about katrina. )",

The report to be released friday by mathematica policy research said the school's students made more progress than similar children attending traditional...",
            "It's common to hear that teachers should be paid better — more like doctors and lawyers. In 2009, the equity project, a charter school in new york decided to try it: they would pay all their teachers $ 125,000 per year with the possibility of an additional bonus. The typical teacher in new york with five years ' experience makes between $ 64,000 and $ 76,000. The charter school, known as tep, would pay much more. But in exchange, teachers, who are not unionized, would accept additional responsibilities, and the school would keep a close eye on their work. Four years later, students at tep score better on state tests than similar students elsewhere. The differences were particularly pronounced in math, according to a study from mathematica policy research released in october. ( the study was funded by the gates foundation. ) after four years at the school, students had learned as much math as they would have in 5.6 years elsewhere: ( mathematica policy research ) the gains erased 78 percent of the achievement gap between hispanic students and whites in the eighth grade. The results are important",
            "The equity project charter school opened in the washington heights neighborhood of manhattan five years ago, with a fairly simple concept: get rid of extra administrative positions and pay teachers a lot of money — a base salary of $ 125,000 plus benefits and potential bonuses after two years of teaching.

            "A small new york city charter school opened five years ago with an attention-grabbing premise: paying teachers $ 125,000 salaries would lure ace faculty and help poor children learn. A new study of the middle school, called the equity project, suggests that the experiment is working. The report to be released friday by mathematica policy research said the school's students made more progress than similar children attending traditional...",
            "It's common to hear that teachers should be paid better — more like doctors and lawyers. In 2009, the equity project, a charter school in new york decided to try it: they would pay all their teachers $ 125,000 per year with the possibility of an additional bonus. The typical teacher in new york with five years ' experience makes between $ 64,000 and $ 76,000. The charter school, known as tep, would pay much more. But in exchange, teachers, who are not unionized, would accept additional responsibilities, and the school would keep a close eye on their work. Four years later, students at tep score better on state tests than similar students elsewhere. The differences were particularly pronounced in math, according to a study from mathematica policy research released in october. ( the study was funded by the gates foundation. ) after four years at the school, students had learned as much math as they would have in 5.6 years elsewhere: ( mathematica policy research ) the gains erased 78 percent of the achievement gap between hispanic students and whites in the eighth grade. The results are important",
            "The equity project charter school opened in the washington heights neighborhood of manhattan five years ago, with a fairly simple concept: get rid of extra administrative positions and pay teachers a lot of money — a base salary of $ 125,000 plus benefits and potential bonuses after two years of teaching. ( a new york city public school teacher with five years of experience, by comparison, makes between $ 64,009 and $ 75,796. ) even the principal would earn less than the teachers to ensure that the school would be able to rely only on public funding, other than the cost of the school facility and its technology system.

The bbc reports that the chinese daredevil, known for posting videos of himself at the top of tall buildings scaled without safety devices, is confirmed to have died in a fall from a 62-story building in changsha on nov. 8. The south china morning post describes the 26-year-old's life-ending stunt as a somewhat selfless act, saying wu was undertaking the \" rooftopping \" challenge in hopes of winning $ 15,000 in prize money in order to pay for his sick mother's medical treatment, and also to fund a wedding with a woman that his step-uncle says he planned to propose to after the challenge was complete. The telegraph's explanation of the money is that wu, who had 1 million followers, was trying to secure it by filming himself promoting an unspecified sponsor. Shanghaiist reports the building was 862 feet tall. The telegraph describes the more than 300 videos he posted as showing stomach-turning feats like him doing pull-ups from treacherous heights. Indeed, per the daily mail, video shows wu doing pull-ups atop the huayuan international centre and then falling; he reportedly plummeted 45 feet to a terrace where a window cleaner later discovered his body. The telegraph quotes a post from his girlfriend made friday: \" today is december 8th. It makes me think of november 8th, the day you left us and left this world. \" ( a daredevil who did the unthinkable at everest also lost his life in november. )",

Democrats are calling for kushner's white house security clearance to be pulled, the hill reports. \" the fbi's russia investigation reached trump's backyard, and now it's in his house, \" dnc deputy communications director adrienne watson said in a statement. \" kushner's security clearance should be suspended until the fbi's findings are complete. \" investigators are also looking into possible financial crimes, according to the telegraph, though the justice department isn't providing details. \" i can't confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of investigations or subjects of investigations, \" spokesperson sarah isgur flores said. While much is still unclear, there will be plenty of people saying \" i told you so \" if corruption allegations involving kushner surface, according to aaron blake at the washington post. Trump's hiring of a family member for a senior white house role was strongly criticized, and \" as any expert on corrupt authoritarian regimes throughout history will tell you, those regimes ' wrongdoing will often run through family members with official titles, \" he writes. In a separate development linked to the russia investigation, house oversight committee chief rep. Jason chaffetz said he wants to review former fbi director james comey's contacts with the white house and justice department going all the way back to 2013, the ap reports. He told acting fbi director andrew mccabe that he wants to \" better understand \" comey's interactions with the white house. Chaffetz announced his surprise resignation last week, and republicans are pushing to have him replaced by somebody who will be in office for longer.",

        "summary": "Nasa engineers have dreamed up and built a new device that could help rescuers save lots more lives after earthquakes or other disasters: it's essentially a radar gun that detects heartbeats under heaps of concrete and steel, reports red orbit. The finder device is portable at 20 pounds, and its microwaves penetrate rubble to pick up on the slightest of movements — even the breathing of an unconscious victim. But it's also smart enough to distinguish the breathing of a human from say, a rat, according to nasa's jet propulsion lab, which developed the device with the department of homeland security. The la times explains the process: \" unlike the rubble, the victim is actually moving rhythmically. The chest rises and falls as the victim breathes, and moves from heartbeats — and the head moves as the veins on the scalp fill and empty out. \" that movement \" creates slight differences in timing when the waves bounce back, which the device can pick up. \" tests this week in virginia at a simulated disaster area went well, reports national geographic, though it quotes one specialist as saying the device needs to provide information faster. After more tweaks, the finder is expected to be on the market next spring or summer for about $ 10,000. Another potential use cited by jpl: finding a kid lost in the woods.

How far back its origins stretch is less known, but it's believed to be about 1,300 years old and hail from upper egypt ( it's written in egypt's coptic language ). Now, two australian professors have pored over its 20 pages, and describe it as \" the handbook of a ritual practitioner. \" in their own book, a coptic handbook of ritual power, malcolm choat and iain gardner explain just what they deciphered: invocations and 27 spells designed \" to cure demonic possession, various ailments, the effects of magic, or to bring success in love and business, \" per their publisher. Livescience shares the codex's prescription for controlling someone: utter magic words over two nails, which should then be nailed \" into his doorpost, one on the right side ( and ) one on the left. \" the codex also offers a treatment for the bacterial infection \" black jaundice. \" as for who would have made use of the book, choat tells livescience that's unclear. \" it is my sense that there were ritual practitioners outside the ranks of the clergy and monks, but exactly who they were is shielded from us by the fact that people didn't really want to be labeled as a ' magician, ' \" he says.

In areas like the highlands of colombia and ethiopia, people have never been exposed to malaria, making them especially vulnerable to the spread of the disease. \" we have estimated that, based on the distribution of malaria with altitude, a 1c rise in temperature could lead to an additional three million cases in under-15-year-olds per year, \" one of the researchers warns.

But climate isn't the only factor at work in its spread, with the biggest advances in malaria control coming alongside efforts to combat poverty, time notes.",

They believe that temperature rises in the future could result in millions of additional cases in some areas. The research is published in the journal science. Prof mercedes pascual, from the university of michigan in the us, who carried out the research, said: \" the impact in terms of increasing the risk of exposure to disease is very large. \" vulnerable to disease areas at higher altitudes have traditionally provided a haven from this devastating disease.

It's not for nothing that 19th century british colonists would build hill stations in malaria-prone countries like india, to escape both heat and disease. So it's not surprising either that scientists have been trying to find out for years whether climate change might expand the range of malaria, putting millions of people who live in tropical highlands at risk. Warmer temperatures should mean more malaria, but in recent years the number of cases has actually fallen dramatically, largely because of renewed efforts to fight the disease. But now a new study in science makes a strong case that as the climate warms, malaria will indeed be on the march, expanding its range to previously safe high-altitude territory, putting even more pressure on prevention campaigns — and if those fail"

California lottery officials project the jackpot to be around $ 400 million, just two months after the mega millions game produced a $ 648-million jackpot, and about five months since powerball last produced a $ 400-million jackpot. The bigger jackpots are drawing more players and excitement to the california lottery after years of decline. The turnaround is due to changes made to the lottery in 2010, when revenues were falling. The changes brought bigger prizes, but they also altered the formula for how much revenue schools receive. California joined powerball last april and since then, enormous jackpots have become more common. About a month after the state joined the game, a powerball jackpot climbed to about $ 600 million, setting a record for the game. Officials say that with powerball's $ 2 tickets, jackpots in that game can rise faster with fewer tickets sold than in a game like mega millions, which costs $ 1 per play. The odds of winning wednesday's big powerball prize are about 1 in 175 million, according to the multi-state lottery assn. For saturday's drawing, california sold more than 151,000 winning tickets for smaller prizes ranging from $ 3 to $ 5,937, according to",

But the uk's supreme court has dealt her a harsh blow, unanimously ruling that just because she's unhappy in the union doesn't mean she can end it, the guardian reports. The 68-year-old has been mulling a divorce from 80-year-old husband hugh owens since 2012, claiming he has behaved unreasonably, but he refuses to agree to the split, saying that any issues in their marriage are because she had an affair or is simply \" bored. \" per the bbc, uk law decrees a divorce can only be granted without a spouse's ok in cases of adultery, desertion, or \" unreasonable behavior \"; if those aren't the case, a divorce will be granted only after the spouses live apart for five years. That means tini owens, who moved out of their shared home in february 2015, will have to wait until 2020 to sever all legal ties, unless hugh owens changes his mind. A family court judge turned down her divorce request in 2016, a decision that an appeals court panel agreed with last year. The supreme court judges say their decision was made with reluctance — one said she agreed to the ruling with \" no enthusiasm whatsoever \" — but that it's up to parliament to change the law to allow no-fault divorces so people can get out of \" wretchedly unhappy marriages. \" tini owens ' lawyer says she's \" devastated \" by the ruling and \" cannot move forward with her life. \" the owenses have two adult children.

        "summary": "The family of jonathon ferrell, the unarmed man shot dead by a police officer after crashing his car in north carolina in september, filed a wrongful death lawsuit this week. They say autopsy results show most of the 10 police bullets were shot downward, suggesting ferrell, 24, was on the ground or on his knees when he was killed by officer randall kerrick. In addition to monetary damages, the lawsuit is also seeking a subpoena forcing police to turn over records including the dash-cam video of the incident, a lawyer for the family tells nbc news. Meanwhile, the attorney general is seeking an indictment against kerrick, who is on unpaid leave and has been charged with voluntary manslaughter, and the charges will go before a grand jury a week from today, the charlotte observer reports. It's still not entirely clear what happened after ferrell walked to a nearby house after the crash looking for help. He knocked and a woman answered, assuming it was her husband, then saw ferrell, closed the door, and called 911 to report a break-in. Police say ferrell ran toward the three officers who responded and that one of the officers attempted to use a taser, which didn't connect, before ferrell was shot. But the wrongful death suit accuses kerrick of missteps including not identifying himself, approaching ferrell with his gun drawn and \" using stealth and surprise, \" and not seeing that ferrell was trying to comply with his orders. The family's lawyer suspects ferrell was simply walking \" briskly \" to police because he was glad they were there to help, cnn reports.",

Knight warrior, real name roger hayhurst, below, has hung up his cape for the time being being to focus on his new radio show. Roger says a street attack triggered his decision to scale down his crimefighting, although he will be tempted back into costume for charity appearances. But superheroes like superman or spider-man have inspired his decision to pursue his dream of becoming a broadcast journalist. Roger first hit the headlines in july 2011, and soon attracted the country's attention for his antics patrolling the streets of swinton, breaking up fights and tackling anti-social behaviour. The publicity caught 'knight maiden'rebecca wall's attention, and, after the 18-year-old wooed him with letters the two got engaged and they now live together at roger's mum's house in swinton. But both have scaled back their crime-fighting activities after roger was attacked in september. The couple now host a show on salford city radio. Roger, 20, said: \"we were recognised when we were walking through clifton and some lads started punching me. My face was all swollen. \"after that i still dress up and occasionally patrol, but now i mainly dress up for charity appearances. Rebecca has got rid of her costume now. \" roger and rebecca host the two-hour haywell show every friday afternoon, taking a funny look at what's going on in salford. He said: \"we've been doing the show for about five weeks now and it's going really well. \"it's a comedy sketch show, we do lots of features. \" roger is now considering making broadcasting a full time job – following in the footsteps of other media-savvy caped crusaders, including journalist-turned-blogger superman and photographer spider-­man. Listen to the haywell show every friday from 1pm to 3pm on salford city radio, 94.4fm, and follow them on twitter @thehaywellshow."

It's a different story with mars, where the car could become what one scientist calls a \" biothreat. \" the tesla, in a large orbit around the sun, is unlikely to get too close to mars in the distant future, and if it does, it ' ll likely burn up in mars ' atmosphere. But purdue university scientists say that even traces of the vehicle could contaminate or wipe out indigenous life on the red planet, should it exist. That's because, unlike spacecraft intended to land on celestial bodies, the tesla did not undergo careful sterilization overseen by nasa's office of planetary protection. With new atlas pointing out the car was driven on public roads, scientists are calling it \" the largest load of earthly bacteria to ever enter space. \" \" even if they radiated the outside, the engine would be dirty, \" researcher jay melosh says in a release. \" cars aren't assembled clean. And even then, there's a big difference between clean and sterile. \" life in space, with its extreme temperatures, low pressure, and cosmic radiation, will help kill some earthly bacteria. But some could lay dormant for millennia. Noting her office had little involvement in the launch of the tesla, planetary protection officer lisa pratt tells space news that future commercial space missions will present similar problems, as it's \" virtually impossible for a commercial mission to meet \" current sterilization requirements for spacecraft. \" we have to figure out how to work closely, how to move forward in a collaborative posture so we don't have another red roadster up there in orbit. \" ( scientists are also annoyed by a fake star. )",

They know very well the fate that pastor coots suffered could be suffered by any of them who does this during a service. \" in fact, the man who originated the practice in tennessee a century ago, pastor george hensley, himself died of a snakebite. It's one of 92 deaths attributed to snakebites during worships as counted by one study, and experts says coots'death will do little to cool worshipers to the practice, which is illegal in tennessee and kentucky. Quite the opposite, \" they will continue, and praise jamie coots as a martyr who died for his faith, \" says university of tennessee at chattanooga professor ralph hood, per the guardian. Still, coots'son, cody, did tell wkyt he expected his father to survive the bite — as he had on eight previous occasions.",

        "summary": "Getting yourself or your kids to eat more veggies could be as easy as coming up with a tempting name for your dish. According to psychology researchers at stanford, people are more likely to chow down on vegetables if they have an \" indulgent \" name, like \" sizzlin ' beans \" as opposed to plain old \" beans. \" diners are \" motivated by taste, \" but labels affect \" how tasty and filling we think food will be, \" study author bradley turnwald tells the bbc. To discover whether they could get people to eat more vegetables simply by changing the label, turnwald and colleagues spent a month and a half serving up veggies in a university cafeteria, per a release. Some dishes got a basic label like \" carrots. \" others got a label like \" twisted citrus-glazed carrots. \" the veggies were always prepared the same way. But researchers found those with \" indulgent \" labels were by far the best sellers, with 25 % more people choosing them than veggies with a basic label. In a sign that consumers view healthy food as less tasty, the \" indulgent \" veggies were also gobbled up by 35 % more people than ate veggies with healthy-positive labeling ( \" smart-choice vitamin c citrus carrots \" ) and 41 % more people than ate veggies with healthy-restrictive labeling ( \" carrots with sugar-free citrus dressing \" ). A greater amount of indulgent veggies was also eaten, reports time. Turnwald's conclusion: labeling can sway us, but \" emphasizing health can actually discourage diners from choosing healthy options. \" ( what food is paired with veggies also matters. )",

        "summary": "\" there was this widespread assumption that if you put your child in a private school that they were in safer space. \" that's the reaction of a professor who consulted on a new independent report into sexual abuse at nyc's elite horace mann school — an investigation that found worse abuse than previously thought, per the wall street journal. The report released yesterday by the horace mann action coalition, a nonprofit alumni group, says the probe found 64 students were victimized by 22 staff members from the 1960s through the 1990s, per the washington post. Abusers included teachers, coaches, department heads, a school chaplain, and even a headmaster, though a coalition rep says \" there was no broad conspiracy, \" rather, \" lots of small cowardly decisions. \" the bronx da originally cited only 25 victims and 12 employees in a 2013 report, the journal notes. The school ( which, the post notes, has posted letters about the ongoing scandal on its website ) says it cooperated with earlier investigations, as well as apologized and reached settlements with some victims, per the journal. But the attorney overseeing the new report says horace mann denied her access to the school's archives and employees, the new york daily news reports. The report also says that the school pressured ex-students into accepting settlements, threatened retaliation for abuse reports, and didn't forward those claims to the police. \" this report does make us feel we've been believed, \" says one alleged victim, \" and it uncovers as much of the truth as could be uncovered given the obstacles that the school has put in the way. \"",

        "summary": "If you can \" drink hells any amount of whiskey without getting drunk, \" you're an ernest hemingway drunk — and you're in good company. That's the finding of university of missouri researchers who broke down the types of drunks into four distinct categories in a study published in the addiction research &amp; theory journal. Scientists surveyed 187 pairs of undergraduate \" drinking buddies \" from a midwestern university about their sober and intoxicated states. The findings: the subjects were either a hemingway, mary poppins, nutty professor, or mr. Hyde drunk. The largest group: the hemingways, which represented about 42 % of the subjects. These subjects reported experiencing the smallest decrease in organizational and intellectual skills and are \" drinkers who tend not to undergo drastic character changes or experience harms \" ( meaning you probably won't have to worry about getting kicked out of a bar if you're a hemingway ). Per the guardian, about 23 % could be called mr. Hyde — or ms. Hyde, since more than half of the subjects who fell into this category were women — meaning they became \" particularly less responsible, less intellectual, and more hostile when under the influence of alcohol. \" one-fifth earned the honor of being labeled the nutty professor, meaning they were more introverted before imbibing and became much more gregarious and uninhibited afterward. The mary poppinses, which made up about 15 % of the pool, are \" particularly agreeable \" after drinking — in other words, the happy, \" sweet \" drunks who don't cause any trouble. So what was the point of the study, other than having names to attribute to friends while bar-hopping? the researchers say it could lead to customization of alcohol intervention programs based on personality type, time notes.

And in the world of sneakers, that's a big problem: \" the us is 40 % of the world's sneaker market and 100 % of the world's sneaker culture, \" an analyst tells the wall street journal. The no. 2 sports brand in the world is now trying to get off the sidelines in the us, where, in the 1970s, it was the star player. It was recently surpassed in the us by under armour; neither firm has caught up to nike, which surpassed adidas years ago, the journal reported in january. The new effort is largely in the hands of mark king, the president of north american operations since june. When it comes to sportswear, coolness is key, the journal notes, and that means nabbing celebrity support. King has received the ok from germany to sponsor as many as 500 pro football and baseball players in the us over the next few years, and he's also signed deals with arizona state university and the university of miami. Meanwhile, adidas has been working with a celebrity who's not from the sports world: one kanye west, whose yeezy boost shoes sold out in their first run. They're far from his only adidas product, as his nsfw lookbook demonstrates, mtv news reports. And in a first, us product branding will be created mostly in the us, king notes, and that could be a big help: \" if your upper management is in germany, and they don't know flatbush from harlem from virginia, \" says a retailer, \" it's hard to have that information percolate back up to the top. \" ( as for nike, its famous slogan has a somewhat disturbing origin. )",

            "Yeezy season isn't even close to being done yet. Kanye might have showed his debut adidas collection a month ago, but the talking points keep rolling out. First came the price points, now comes the lookbook — if you can even call it a lookbook. It's more of an artbook tbh — a 53-page artbook — though kanye is using the term \"season zine. \" if this is how kanye brands a single collection, can you imagine what he ' ll do when he relaunches his namesake line? well, probably not, because whatever it is has no precedent. Just like this. Aside from being groundbreaking in its length, the book is a refreshing continuation of kanye's show: there's a lot of diversity among the models, in every sense — especially when it comes to body shapes. And, well, you can't miss that because there is a lot of nudity. Obviously, kanye is on team #freethenipple. Some of the nude shots don't even contain any of the adidas pieces, they just add to the overall vibe of the collection's very minimal feel. But there are also plenty of closeups of the actual clothes, which is much appreciated since it was hard to catch the details in presentation. Plus, there were ample distractions. When you see these clothes and accessories on zoom though, you can see just how much thought went into each of them, especially with the outerwear. The detail shots almost maybe even justify the steep pricing? the biggest surprise of the book, though, has to be that kanye makes a cameo on page 44, modeling a new windbreaker that looks like the perfect thing to throw in your bag ( though it probably costs more than your whole look right now ). Seriously though, kanye should really consider binding this lookbook and selling it as a coffee table book. It'd be the perfect conversation starter to just have laying around.",

Kmov reports the church's windows were broken and chairs were overturned. \" we rebuild, \" says lee. \" we do not stop. \" more: protesters outraged by the grand jury decision in the michael brown case took to the streets of cities across america for a second night last night after a day that saw dozens of rallies. One of the largest protests was in new york city, where thousands of people chanting slogans including \" black lives matter! \" brought traffic in manhattan and other parts of the city to a halt, reports the new york daily news. There were also large protests in cities including oakland, calif., portland, ore., and los angeles, where protesters stopped traffic on the us 110 freeway and police made dozens of arrests, mostly for disorderly conduct, reports the la times. In ferguson itself, where police were supported by thousands of national guard troops, the night was a lot calmer than monday night, reports the ap, although police still used tear gas to disperse protesters, a squad car was torched, and at least 44 people were arrested, mostly for failure to disperse.",

The boston-based institute for justice and democracy in haiti, which is preparing the lawsuit, already tried to get the un to pay compensation to victims and their families in 2011, reports reuters, but an independent un panel at the time found the origin of the disease was inconclusive. However, other studies have linked the outbreak to un peacekeepers from nepal, suggesting they carried a distinct strain of the disease, which leaked into haitian water supplies through a bad sanitation system, the new york times reports. \" we are asking for the judge to find the united nations liable, \" says an ijdh spokeswomen. \" it has violated its legal obligations through reckless actions that brought cholera to haiti. \" the suit will be filed at a us district court in new york today, though it's unclear whether the court will actually accept it — one legal expert tells the times the un is generally immune from domestic lawsuits.",

Now zeman and colleagues at the university of exeter medical school are reporting in the journal cortex that the condition could affect as many as 2.5 % of the population. They're calling it \" aphantasia, \" though zeman insists in an interview with the bbc that it is not a disorder but rather a \" variability of human experience \" where most of us \" spend our lives with imagery hovering somewhere in the mind's eye, which we inspect from time to time. \" says one man of his childhood insomnia: \" i couldn't see any sheep jumping over fences, there was nothing to count. \" others with the condition can't visualize the faces of their friends and family. The newly described condition is something that affects some people from birth, which is different from the experience first described by zeman in discover about a patient who lost the ability to visualize after a heart procedure. In patients with congenital aphantasia, zeman says that a network of regions distributed throughout the brain but implicated in visualization may function differently, not from a traumatic event but from birth. Similarly, people can be born with hyperaphantasia, or the ability to visualize in acute detail. To better understand the neurological underpinnings of this range of visual experiences, zeman is working on a year-long project — the eye's mind — that involves artist susan aldworth, art historian john onians, and philosopher fiona macpherson.

Sadly, other researchers say this particular video won't advance the field because the frame-rate is poor; real experiments analyze the 10-20 milliseconds in which injuries occur. So koerth-baker delves deeper into injury biomechanics, starting with john stapp, an air force flight surgeon who endured a sudden stop in a rocket sled at 46.2 g's of force in 1954. He broke nearly all the capillaries in his eyes, ejection site reports, but his work helped the air force design pilot ejector-seats.

Computed tomographic images of the resulting facial injury are presented for correlation with data and calculations. To our knowledge, such an analysis of an actual recorded trauma has not been reported in the literature. Materials and methods: a video recording of the accident was split into frames and analyzed using an image editing program. Measurements of velocity and angle of impact were obtained from this analysis, and the force of impact and impulse were calculated using the inverse dynamic method with connected rigid body segments. These results were then correlated with the actual fracture pattern found on computed tomographic imaging of the subject's face. Results: there was an impact velocity of 6.25 m/s, impact angles of 14 and 6.3 degrees of neck extension and axial rotation, respectively, an impact force of 1910.4 n, and an impulse"

            "Introduction: this study aimed to use video analysis techniques to determine the velocity, impact force, angle of impact, and impulse to fracture involved in a video-recorded bicycle accident resulting in facial fractures. Computed tomographic images of the resulting facial injury are presented for correlation with data and calculations. To our knowledge, such an analysis of an actual recorded trauma has not been reported in the literature. Materials and methods: a video recording of the accident was split into frames and analyzed using an image editing program. Measurements of velocity and angle of impact were obtained from this analysis, and the force of impact and impulse were calculated using the inverse dynamic method with connected rigid body segments. These results were then correlated with the actual fracture pattern found on computed tomographic imaging of the subject's face. Results: there was an impact velocity of 6.25 m/s, impact angles of 14 and 6.3 degrees of neck extension and axial rotation, respectively, an impact force of 1910.4 n, and an impulse"

The markings on the bones of the 45-foot ichthyosaurs at the park, along with the larger than expected number of broken ribs and the bones ' \" very odd configuration, \" led mcmenamin to believe that the ichthyosaurs had likely been killed then carried to a single lair, likely by an octopus-type creature that had either drowned them or twisted their necks.

The corpse of christopher shale was discovered the same day the sunday mail printed an embarrassing memo by him saying that people saw little reason to join the conservatives. Shale, 56, was the conservative party chairman in cameron's district. In his memo, he attributed the fall in party membership to people's suspicions that if they get involved, \" we ' ll beg and steal from them, and they're right. \" it's not yet clear if shale died of a heart attack or committed suicide, according to various press reports. Cameron called shale a \" close and valued friend. \" a \" big rock in my life has suddenly been rolled away, \" he said.

That makes intel the first big us tech company to tout that claim, the ap notes, amid concerns that the purchase of such minerals would only increase the conflict in the drc.

        "summary": "Just one alcoholic drink per day — even a teeny one — may not bode well for women on the breast cancer front, reports the washington post. That's the conclusion of a large-scale review by the american institute for cancer research and the world cancer research fund that took a closer look at 119 studies involving more than 12 million women globally, and the impact of nutrition, diet, and physical activity on breast cancer risk. Although a typical alcoholic beverage contains 14 grams of alcohol, the report finds that even a small glass of wine, beer, or spirits ( one with as little as 10 grams of alcohol ) is tied to a 5 % increased cancer risk in pre-menopausal women and 9 % in post-menopausal women, indicating there may be \" no level of alcohol use that is completely safe \" when it comes to breast cancer, ann mctiernan, one of the study's lead authors, tells the post. Some good news: researchers also found exercise plays a role in one's risk level — specifically, \" vigorous \" exercise on a regular basis cut the risk of breast cancer for both pre-menopausal women ( a 17 % reduction ) and post-menopausal women ( a 10 % cut ). So what if you like to throw one back but also often hit the gym? mctiernan notes alcohol increases estrogen levels, which has been tied to breast cancer risk, and that exercise can tamp those levels down — though that doesn't necessarily mean it will cancel out alcohol's effects. Although a healthy lifestyle doesn't offer complete assurance that cancer will stay away — mctiernan compares it to wearing a seatbelt, per the post — the aicr estimates that a third of us breast cancer cases could be avoided if women kept to a healthy weight, exercised regularly, and didn't drink.

Since purchasing it from a new york gallery in 1935, the nelson-atkins museum of art has operated under the assumption that the 15-by-10-inch, 500-year-old oil-on-wood painting was simply created by bosch's workshop. But that changed when a team of bosch experts came to look at it in september as part of their attempt to catalog all of bosch's work in time for the 500th anniversary of his death this year, according to the new york times. Those experts left the missouri museum believing the temptation of st. Anthony can be \" ascribed to bosch with confidence, \" the ap reports. The panel is believed to be part of a larger work, possibly part of a wing of a dismantled triptych. \" i ' m stoked, \" rima girnius, a nelson-atkins associate curator, tells the star. The experts used infrared photography and reflectography to look at layers of work that had been erased or painted over while comparing its motifs and brush work, on a microscopic level, to other bosch works. In fact, they're so confident they've uncovered a lost bosch that the temptation of st. Anthony went on display in bosch's hometown in the netherlands on monday. \"it's the same painting, and all of a sudden you see it with more affection, \" nelson-atkins director julián zugazagoitia tells the times.

            "' s-hertogenbosch, the netherlands — a small 16th-century oil on panel largely kept in storage at a kansas city, mo., museum is a work by the dutch renaissance master hieronymus bosch, researchers here said on monday, a finding that, if accepted by other scholars, would add to the tiny list of about 25 recognized bosch paintings in the world. The painting, \"the temptation of st. Anthony, \" dated 1500-1510, had previously been attributed to the workshop of bosch or to a follower of bosch, known for his comic and surreal images of heaven and hell and the earthly moral purgatory in between. The new attribution is based on studies of underdrawings, a comparison of motifs and details on a microscopic level with similar ones in undisputed bosch paintings, and an analysis of bosch's brush work. Taken together, the evidence indicates that \"st. Anthony \" is in bosch's \"handwriting, \" said experts from the bosch research and conservation project, a six-year, $ 3.3 million effort"

As of a week ago, the president-elect said he had attended, at most, three. Moore joins the chorus of those who see this as a deal-breaker, and he explains why in a facebook post titled, \" donald trump is gonna get us killed. \" moore provides a history lesson: while vacationing in texas, george w. Bush was handed the daily briefing on august 6, 2001. Writes moore: \" he glanced at it, set it aside and then went fishing for the rest of the day. \" the briefing's headline: \" bin laden determined to strike inside us. \" inside it referenced the use of planes. Bush ended his vacation four weeks later, writes moore. \" in the fifth week, bin laden attacked the us with planes. \" \" it's one thing to have a president who was asleep at the wheel, \" he continues. \" but, my friends, it's a whole other thing to now have a president-elect who refuses to even get behind the wheel! \" in moore's view, trump's \" utter neglect of duty \" will result in the loss of american lives. Moore isn't the only one commenting on the topic.

But boehner first wants reid to show his hand by actually passing something. The three top leaders in congress met privately wednesday evening, but they came away no closer to a deal. At the meeting, boehner said he wouldn't negotiate with reid and that the senate majority leader would have to work out a payroll tax plan with mcconnell, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. Text size - + reset boehner's position is \"he can't cut a deal with reid. If he did, our guys would go nuts, \" according to a republican source.

Whether reid and mcconnell can cut a bipartisan deal — that can also pass the republican-led house within days — will be the key question facing the leaders thursday as they struggle to pass a payroll tax holiday, extend jobless benefits and approve more than $ 1 trillion in federal spending before adjourning for the holidays.

A study in the marine mammal science journal says that the once-endangered mammal, which can be found from alaska all the way down to costa rica, has bounced back to \" sustainable levels, \" with around 2,200 of the creatures now swimming in the pacific surf right off the west coast, reports the bbc. That growth spurt is due to meticulous conservation efforts — but also because the russians aren't harpooning enormous numbers of them anymore. An estimated 346,000 california blue whales were harpooned before the practice was banned in 1966; between 1905 and 1971, about 3,400 were killed in the pacific, mostly by russian whalers. Despite the ban, russians kept at it illegally until 1971 — and as soon as they stopped, \" the population has been recovering steadily, \" a university of washington researcher tells nbc news via email. One major issue that still plagues blue whales: they keep getting smashed by ships, especially near california. Some groups estimate about 11 are hit each year, although scientists believe there would have to be an \" elevenfold increase in vessels \" before there's even a chance of the blue-whale population dipping to dangerously low levels. Meanwhile, they remain the largest animals on earth, notes national geographic. ( sorry, dreadnoughtus. ) read how many calories a blue whale consumes in one gulp.",

She needed 60 votes to overcome a filibuster but came up with only 55. And the hill points out that this wasn't exactly a party-line vote: eleven republicans voted for the measure, including ted cruz, rand paul, and mitch mcconnell. But 10 democrats voted against it, including claire mccaskill and carl levin, reports politico. Under gillibrand's bill, military commanders would no longer be the ones to decide whether to prosecute cases from within the ranks. Instead, military lawyers would make the call. \" the people who don't trust the chain of the command are the victims, \" said gillibrand during debate.

Among other things, she has raised her stature in the senate considerably, writes ed o ' keefe. Gillibrand promised to bring up the proposal again and said she is confident it will pass the second time around.",
