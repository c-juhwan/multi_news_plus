You can surely expect another: critics have given the christopher mcquarrie-directed film a 98 % rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: \" mission: impossible - fallout knocks itself out to keep you awake and entertained. The result is a film that won't make a dent in cinema history but … is impossible to resist, \" writes rex reed at the new york observer. He refers to henry cavill as laughable — not in a good way — but praises \" the eternally youthful \" cruise. \" with the star behind the wheel, there is never so much as a stripped gear or a flat tire. \" though the flick is probably longer than it needs to be, \" it's hard not to admire just how much spark this long-running fuse still has left in it, \" is brian lowry's take at cnn. After more than two decades as ethan hunt, cruise remains \" perfectly good \" in this \" slickly assembled, well-oiled adrenaline rush, \" which includes a few action sequences that are \" pretty dazzling. \" \" fallout throws off hope-diamond levels of grandeur \" and \" may be the best mission: impossible movie since the first, \" according to stephanie zacharek at time. Rebecca ferguson's ilsa faust is \" a foxy-smart presence. \" but \" cruise is an unhinged stickman, outrunning the devil, the aging process, time itself, \" she writes. \" he will outrun us all. \" the script ( \" fantastic \" ), cast ( \" uniformly strong \" ) and plot ( \" timeless and current in the way that it plays with loyalty and identity \" ) left brian tallerico impressed, too. This is \" one of the best movies of the year \" with \" roughly seven of the 10 best action sequences of the year, \" and will leave you \" ready to take on the world, \" he writes at rogerebert.com.",

However, it appears the white house is giving ground on its initial defiance about exemptions. Trump trade adviser peter navarro told the fox business network wednesday night that canada and mexico would be exempted, at least initially, reports the new york times. Whether they remain exempt would depend how much they bend in the current renegotiation of nafta. Earlier wednesday, white house spokesperson sarah huckabee sanders suggested other nations could be exempt, too — decisions would be made \" case by case \" and \" country by country, \" she said, per the ap. Opponents and proponents of the tariffs continued to lobby furiously for their respective positions wednesday, and that was expected to continue into thursday, making any predictions about specifics impossible. In fact, it's even possible that the signing ceremony will be pushed back to friday given the legal logistics involved, reports reuters. In one of wednesday's more notable developments, more than 107 house republicans signed a letter urging trump to reconsider the tariffs \" to avoid unintended negative consequences to the us economy and its workers. \" meanwhile, economic adviser gary cohn, who is resigning after losing the fight to block the tariffs, spent wednesday trying to secure exemptions for several countries, reports the wall street journal. The tariffs would go into effect 15 to 30 days after trump signs off.",

The researchers did it with only a thick blend of nutrients that mimic the womb, they report in the journal nature cell biology. Because rudimentary cell development takes place at the 14-day mark, more than a dozen countries including the us and uk restrict embryo research after that point. As nature puts it: \" after this time, the logic goes, a unique individual comes into being. \" given how difficult it is to observe this early but critical formation of life in the mother, scientists are largely in the dark about just what sort of cellular and molecular activity is taking place, reports the telegraph. \" it is a most enigmatic and mysterious period of our development which we have never had any access to, \" says the lead author. The vast majority of pregnancies that fail are the result of improper implantation, so learning exactly what happens in this stage is critical to improving viability. Implantation is also when \" many developmental defects can become acquired, \" she continues, \" but until now, it has been impossible to study this in human embryos. \" \" it's a big deal, \" reports vice's motherboard, which notes that by being able to observe how embryos change around day 14, \" when the embryo becomes a self-organizing ball of cells destined to become a baby, \" we could better understand not just development but fertility and disabilities. But critics worry about testing embryos beyond 14 days. \" pro-life means you protect human life, \" one ethicist tells the telegraph. \" there's no protection being in a petri dish being experimented on. \" ( a us panel recommends approving three-parent ivf. )",

Chairman johnathon montgomery said: \" the council intends to bring together invited participants with a range of perspectives on embryo research in order to evaluate whether, after 25 years, there may be persuasive reasons to review this legal limit, or whether the reasons for its introduction remain sound. \" the two week limit was first established in the warnock report which was published in 1984, and concluded that it was ethical to conduct research on human embryos until day 14 of their development. It was enshrined in law in the 1991 human fertilisation and embryology act. But until now the legal restriction has been largely theoretical as no one had the technical means to keep embryos alive in the laboratory beyond a week. In a paper published in the journal nature, cambridge university showed that it is possible to force the embryo to attach to a culture material, and begin dividing into groups of cells which will eventually form the foetus, placenta and yolk sac, just like in the womb.

In fact, it's possible that these embryos might even have kept growing past two weeks, if the scientists did not have to terminate them for ethical reasons. One of the most crucial, yet poorly understood, phases of life is the time from when a seven-day-old embryo burrows into the wall of a woman's uterus — a stage of development called implantation — and the moment, seven more days later, when the embryo becomes a self-organizing ball of cells destined to become a baby. This is when problems with pregnancy, or the first appearance of developmental disorders, can occur. But it's a black box that's very hard to study, as it's too early to see much on an ultrasound, for example.

The washington post lists the places worldwide that have been experiencing never-before-recorded heat over the past week, caused by heat pressure or heat domes across the northern hemisphere. In north america, record temps have been notched in denver ( it tied its all-time high of 105 degrees ), burlington, vt. ( marking its highest \" low \" temperature of 80 degrees ), and montreal, which saw its highest temperature ever with a 97.9-degree reading. Eurasia and europe also haven't been able to escape the sweltering; in the uk and ireland, it's been so hot that roads and roofs are melting, per the weather channel. While it's not surprising that july will smash some weather records, so many places experiencing them at once suggests something bigger. \" so many rare milestones being set or tied worldwide does point to the influence of a warming world, given that the link between heat waves and climate change is robust, \" says andrew freedman, science editor for axios.

The british dance council is considering a proposal that would ban same-sex couples from mainstream competitions, instead creating same-sex-only categories, the guardian reports.

The proposed rule would recognize partnerships as \" one man and one lady … unless otherwise stated. \" the council's president says that so far he's heard more support for the change than opposition. People are \" disgruntled, \" he says, because \" two men are physically stronger: for example, you wouldn't have two men playing in the mixed doubles at wimbledon. \" but the current same-sex women's senior champ tells the bbc that physical strength isn't a major factor in dancing: \" if it was the case we'd see the top competitors being big, strong couples and actually the opposite seems to be true. \"",

The bdc denied it was banning same-sex couples from competing, but said it wanted to \" regulate the situation \". However one dancer accused the bdc of \" condoning discriminatory behaviour \". Bdc president bryan allen said the proposal came after complaints some mixed-sex dancers were \" unfairly disadvantaged \" in competitions against all-male couples who are physically stronger. He told the bbc the rule was not intended to prevent same-sex couple from competing, but would allow organisers to host mixed-sex only competitions if they wished, in addition to the same-sex only contests currently held. \" if this was passed there'd be very few, if any, competitions just for mixed sex couples - however it would establish equality, \" he told bbc radio 4's today programme.

            "Image copyright afp image caption the british dance council says a rule change ' would establish equality ' a proposal which could prevent same-sex dance partners from competing against mixed-sex couples has caused a row in the world of ballroom dancing. The british dance council ( bdc ) is to debate a rule change which would define a partnership as being \" one man and one lady... Unless otherwise stated \". The bdc denied it was banning same-sex couples from competing, but said it wanted to \" regulate the situation \". However one dancer accused the bdc of \" condoning discriminatory behaviour \". Bdc president bryan allen said the proposal came after complaints some mixed-sex dancers were \" unfairly disadvantaged \" in competitions against all-male couples who are physically stronger. He told the bbc the rule was not intended to prevent same-sex couple from competing, but would allow organisers to host mixed-sex only competitions if they wished, in addition to the same-sex only contests currently held. \" if this was passed there'd be very few, if any, competitions just for mixed sex couples - however it would establish equality, \" he told bbc radio 4's today programme.

Price, who has helped draft several house bills to repeal and replace obamacare, was an early and enthusiastic trump supporter. At a rally a week before the election, he said trump would deliver a \" real health solution, \" telling the crowd: \" the things that we all believe about health care — we want a system that is affordable for everybody, that is accessible for everybody, that is of the highest quality and provides choices for patients — all of those things have been destroyed by obamacare. \" the ap notes that in remarks last week, price insisted that republicans could keep obamacare elements like protection for people with pre-existing conditions but still get rid of elements like penalties for people who refuse to get coverage.",

According to a press release, vaporized rock from the impact would have fallen back to earth, igniting global wildfires and sending 15 billion tons of soot into the atmosphere, blocking out the sun. \" it would have been about as dark as a moonlit night, \" co-author owen toon says. It also would have effectively stopped photosynthesis for more than 18 months. Those months of darkness help explain how the asteroid impact killed off more than 75 % of earth's species — including some that could have hidden from the immediate devastation underground or underwater, new atlas reports. For one, the lack of photosynthesis would have killed off phytoplankton, the basis of the food chain in the ocean. For another, all that soot caused global temperatures over land to drop 50 degrees. According to seeker, it took seven years for temperatures to return to normal. The soot also damaged the ozone layer, allowing in harmful ultraviolet light. Researchers say their computer model could be used to predict the effects of nuclear war, which would similarly send mass amounts of soot into the atmosphere.

        "summary": "A new twist in the disappearance of jamal khashoggi: american officials knew months ago that saudi arabia was plotting against the journalist, sources tell the washington post. The sources say us intelligence intercepts discovered a plan to lure khashoggi, a critic of the saudi monarchy, back to the kingdom from his home in virginia and detain him. The operation was ordered by crown prince mohammed bin salman, the sources say. Several of khashoggi's friends tell the post that saudi officials had called him repeatedly in recent months to offer him protection — and a government job — if he returned to his homeland, but he said he \" didn't trust them one bit. \" turkish authorities believe khashoggi was murdered by saudi agents during a visit to the kingdom's istanbul consulate on oct. 2. President trump vowed wednesday that he would \" get to the bottom \" of the case, the bbc reports. \" we cannot let this happen to reporters, to anybody, \" he said. But he said blocking us arms sales to saudi arabia, a move some lawmakers are calling for, could be a step too far, the ap reports. \" i think that would be hurting us, \" trump said. \" we have jobs, we have a lot of things happening in this country... And frankly i think that that would be a very, very tough pill to swallow for our country. \" a bipartisan group of senators urged trump to impose sanctions on anybody found responsible for the disappearance. Gop sen. Bob corker, chair of the senate foreign relations committee, said \" everything points to \" saudi involvement. ( an apple watch could potentially reveal what happened to khashoggi. )",

The deans claim loftin created a'toxic environment through threat, fear and intimidation. ' \" ' it is imperative to take immediate action to begin the process of resolving the issues and improving the environment,'they wrote. \""

Coming in twice a week for six weeks, the volunteers, all over age 60, were instructed to bike for 6-second bursts of high intensity on an exercise bike, then rest for at least one minute. The bursts gradually increased until, by the end of the trial, they were doing 10 of them per session, for a full minute of total exercise, reports the daily mail. The result? a 9 % reduction in blood pressure, an increased ability to get oxygen to their muscles, and an easier go at day-to-day activities like walking the dog, the bbc reports. \" the broad message is that you're never too old, too frail, too ill to benefit from exercise, as long as it's carefully chosen, \" the honorary secretary of the british geriatrics society says, adding that he'd like to see the research done on people in their 80s and 90s. The researchers say that this is the first time this type of high-intensity training has been studied in seniors, and they're already planning larger trials. Perhaps counterintuitively, these bursts of effort could be safer for the heart than a reduced yet prolonged strain, one researcher explains.

            "Photograph by robyn beck/afp/getty images. I confess that when lady gaga began talking about her commitment to stop bullying, i was skeptical. She first spoke out after the suicide of 14-year-old jamey rodemeyer, who killed himself after he was teased about being gay. ( before taking his life, he'd posted on facebook a gaga lyric, \"don't forget me when i come crying to heaven's door. \" ) gaga's response to jamey's death on twitter started with an understandable swell of emotion. \"the past days i've spent reflecting, crying, and yelling. I have so much anger. It is hard to feel love when cruelty takes someones life, \" she wrote, linking to the \"it gets better \" video jamey made before he died. Then gaga latched onto a bad idea: \"bullying must become illegal, \" she tweeted. \"it is a hate crime. \" emily bazelon emily bazelon is a staff writer at the new york times magazine and the author of sticks and stones.

Meet woseribre senebkay, who ruled from about 1650bc to 1600bc, reports livescience. The penn researchers had to piece together his skeleton after eons of tomb robbers had their way with the site, but they think senebkay lived into his mid- to late-40s and stood about 5-foot-10. With the discovery of a new pharaoh comes an official new dynasty, dubbed the abydos dynasty after the archeological site where the tomb was found. Researchers stumbled upon it while investigating a nearby tomb of an earlier pharaoh named sobekhotep. In fact, it seems that senebkay did some tomb-raiding of his own — he reused sobekhotep's cedar chest. \"it suggests that the king had economic challenges, which has to do with the period of struggle and fragmentation of kingdom, \" penn's josef wegner tells nbc news.

Dry weather and fungal disease are partly to blame, but there's another cause: \" demand for chocolate is great, \" an expert told bloomberg last year. \" a lot of the world population is moving to the middle class and will have more money to spend, in particular in emerging markets and asia. \" yes, the chinese are eating twice as much chocolate as 10 years ago, and dark chocolate, which uses much more cocoa than regular chocolate bars, is growing more popular. This has forced up cocoa prices by more than 60 % over the past two years. It has also inspired innovation, like trees that can produce up to 700 % more cocoa than their traditional counterparts. But this breed of tree — which is also resistant to a devastating fungus called witches ' broom — comes with far less flavor, making chocolate \" as tasteless as today's store-bought tomatoes, yet another food, along with chicken and strawberries, that went from flavorful to forgettable on the road to plenitude, \" writes mark schatzker at bloomberg. Still, experts say that some african growers are producing chocolate with actual flavor. Hopefully, \" better-tasting beans will command higher prices, incentivizing quality, not just quantity, \" writes schatzker. ( read about a chocolate-maker named isis that changed its name. )",

        "summary": "Two american scientists are none too pleased with china's plan for a critter called the pika: to mass-poison the furry little guy. The animal ( which inspired the popular pokemon character pikachu ) digs huge burrow-networks across the qinghai-tibetan plateau in northwest china, the independent reports. Officials have apparently spent more than $ 100 million over 50 years poisoning huge swaths of land trying to kill off the pika, saying it damages grasslands. But the us researchers, andrew smith and maxwell wilson, argue that pikas benefit the ecosystem. In the journal ambio, they say pika burrows make great homes for birds that often disappear when pikas are poisoned and the burrows collapse, scientific american reports. Pika burrows also improve water infiltration, lowering the odds of surface flooding, especially in monsoon season, the authors say. What's more, killing pikas can leave local carnivores hungry and in turn affect human populations. So why are the chinese doing it, and calling pikas \" rats \" in the china daily? a 2006 report co-written by smith likens the case to americans poisoning black-tailed prairie dogs, creatures that also aid grassland diversity. The authors blame various problems, including an old belief that the \" pests \" degrade land and local officials who are under great pressure to act. \" scientists must take the next step of reaching out to policy makers, \" the article says, or \" the value of our work for society will continue to be ignored. \" ( read about a rare gray wolf mistakenly shot in utah. )",

Luke's university health network say marijuana users are twice as likely to suffer a rare \" stunning \" of the heart linked to stress, known as stress cardiomyopathy or takotsubo, compared to non-users, reports healthday news. The condition — in which the heart is temporarily weakened, causing dizziness and chest pain — also appears to have more severe effects among marijuana users. Though marijuana users with takotsubo averaged 44 years of age, about 2.4 % went into cardiac arrest, compared to 0.8 % of non-users with the condition, with an average age of 66, reports live science. Some 2.4 % of marijuana users also needed an implanted defibrillator, compared to 0.6 % of non-users, researchers say. The findings — which have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal — were presented sunday at the american heart association's annual meeting, where some remained unconvinced. \" i think they're extending conclusions that go beyond the data, \" says an aha rep, noting researchers focused on just 210 marijuana users with takotsubo, or 0.6 % of all us patients who experienced the condition between 2003 and 2011. Of alarm to researchers, however, was that marijuana users with takotsubo were mostly young men who had fewer risk factors for takotsubo than average patients, usually older women, reports cnn. Study author amitoj singh says thc in marijuana may interact with stress hormones to cause takotsubo, though that hasn't been proven. Either way, \" marijuana does not appear to be entirely safe, \" he says. ( pot might also affect your iq. )",

        "summary": "Fast-forward 18 years and it shouldn't be too hard for children born out of britain's national sperm bank to identity their biological father. The year-old sperm bank, created to address a major sperm shortage in the uk, has just nine registered donors with the first samples set to be delivered next year, chief executive laura witjens tells the guardian. The shortage isn't necessarily tied to a lack of interest, though a 2005 law allowing kids born from donated sperm to contact their donor may be a deterrent for some. \" if 100 guys inquire, 10 will come through for screenings and maybe one becomes a donor, \" witjens says. Potential donors have to visit a clinic twice a week for up to four months, and can't masturbate or have sex for two days prior to each visit, leaving three days a week for fun stuff. Then only 10 % to 20 % have sperm robust enough to survive being frozen and thawed, reports the bbc. Enter a superman-themed publicity campaign that appeals to male pride, adopting some of the promotional tactics of denmark's sperm banks. \" they proudly say, this is the viking invasion, exports from denmark are beer, lego, and sperm. It's a source of pride, \" witjens says, though her campaign may not be quite as bold as she aims to keep donor-conceived children in mind. Whereas in denmark, donors can father up to 200 children, witjens says the british donors — typically young men with flexible jobs who earn a little over $ 50 per session — will father 10 children. After the superman campaign, one in november will urge men to give an \" alternative christmas gift, \" witjens says. \" i want to get to a stage where there is an abundance of donors, \" she adds. \" we can have enough in three to five years. We just need the push. \" meanwhile, sperm imports to the uk, mainly from the us and denmark, are growing each year.",

It's to be added to a list of confirmed or highly likely avian extinctions along with seven others based on an assessment by birdlife international; the complete list can be seen in this press release. \" extinctions are continuing and accelerating, \" but \" we hope this study will inspire a redoubling of efforts to prevent other extinctions, \" says chief scientist stuart butchart, who points the finger at deforestation; five of the eight extinctions reported in biological conservation were in south america. \" our evidence shows there is a growing wave of extinctions washing over the continent driven by habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, drainage and logging, \" says butchart. Four of the five south american extinctions happened in brazil. The alagoas foliage-gleaner, a small forest bird, vanished from a heavily logged section of the country in 2011, while the cryptic treehunter disappeared in 2007 after northeastern forests were cut down. Per the guardian, there's no chance of recovering either species — half of the eight species listed should be considered extinct, the other half \" possibly extinct, \" which researchers say means they have \" almost certainly \" vanished completely from the wild — though captive populations of spix's macaw are being bred to enter the wild.

        "summary": "No, a giant cat has not been clawing at the surface of mars, though it might look like that. According to scientists, \" scratch marks \" or linear gullies on the martian plains of hellas planitia were caused not by life forms but by dry ice — in fact, levitating dry ice. It's not magic: during mars ' winter, carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere turns solid and is imbedded in the red planet's soil. During summer, the reverse process takes place. The deposits break apart and slide over dune slopes, levitating in the process as the dry ice in contact with the warm sediment turns back to gas, per a release. This results in the gullies, which were spotted by the mars reconnaissance orbiter in a 1,400-mile-wide crater deeper than the grand canyon, reports cnet. To figure this out, scientists from trinity college dublin put a martian-like soil sample under low pressures and temperatures in the lab to mimic mars ' atmospheric conditions, then added water, they explain scientific reports. The water immediately evaporated and, for a few seconds, caused soil it had contacted to levitate, reports new scientist. On mars, where gravity is weaker, researchers believe the effect could last for up to a minute, plenty of time for an ice block to \" levitate and maneuver downslope, in a similar manner to how pucks glide on an ice-hockey table, carving a channel in its wake, \" says study author lauren mckeown. The block eventually disappears \" without a trace other than the roughly circular depression beneath it. \" ( mars also has what looks to be a bullet hole. )",

            "Researchers based millions of kilometres from mars have unveiled new evidence for how contemporary features are formed on the red planet. Their innovative lab-based experiments on carbon dioxide ( co2 ) sublimation - the process by which a substance changes from a solid to a gas without an intermediate liquid phase - suggest the same process is responsible for altering the appearance of sand dunes on mars. The research was led by a trinity college dublin team comprising phd candidate in the school of natural sciences, lauren mc keown, and dr mary bourke, along with professor jim mcelwaine of durham university.

            "Researchers based millions of kilometres from mars have unveiled new evidence for how contemporary features are formed on the red planet. Their innovative lab-based experiments on carbon dioxide ( co2 ) sublimation - the process by which a substance changes from a solid to a gas without an intermediate liquid phase - suggest the same process is responsible for altering the appearance of sand dunes on mars. The research was led by a trinity college dublin team comprising phd candidate in the school of natural sciences, lauren mc keown, and dr mary bourke, along with professor jim mcelwaine of durham university. Their work, which describes phenomena unlike anything seen on earth, has just been published in the nature journal scientific reports.

He ( along with a colleague and documentarian ) were to enter snowden's hotel and ask for directions; if snowden felt comfortable, he would walk past them carrying a rubik's cube — and that's exactly how it happened. Bloomberg dug extensively through snowden's background and found little to suggest he would become one of the biggest whistleblowers in us history. Snowden, whose father retired from the coast guard a few years ago, never finished high school and spent a few years living alone in a maryland condo where neighbors described him as \" serious \" and \" studious. \" snowden was apparently a ron paul supporter, but the feeling is mutual. On piers morgan live, paul last night said snowden has \" done a great service \" — and deserves a thank-you letter from president obama. \" the president ran on transparency, we're getting a lot of transparency now. \" what snowden will likely get instead: charged, and soon. Two officials tell abc news the justice department is hustling to file criminal charges and try to get snowden back on us soil. Snowden's exposé is also causing international headaches for obama, the guardian reports.

Cuspert is said to have converted to islam in 2010 after a serious car accident and became known for praising osama bin laden and appearing in isis promotional videos. Greene pleaded guilty to making false statements involving international terrorism and served two years in a reduced sentence after cooperating with authorities, cnn notes, adding that details of that cooperation are \" shrouded in court-ordered secrecy. \" greene was released from prison in august 2016 and now works as a hotel lounge hostess.

The department's civil-rights investigation found that the majority of the police shootings in albuquerque over the last few years were unjustified and that encounters between police and mentally ill people too often result in unnecessary violence, reports the wall street journal. There have been 23 fatal police shootings in the city over the last four years and nine in 2010 alone — one more than happened in new york city that year. The report comes after numerous controversial incidents involving the city's police force, including the fatal shooting of a homeless man last month, which sparked an angry protest against police shootings. \"what we found was a pattern or practice of systemic deficiencies that have pervaded the albuquerque police department for many years, \" a justice department spokeswoman told reporters, saying the force suffers from \" inadequate oversight, inadequate investigation of incidents of force, inadequate training of officers to ensure they understand what is permissible or not. \" a new deputy police chief will be hired to implement the report's recommendations, which include major revisions to use-of-force policies, psychological screening of new recruits, and clearer procedures on dealing with mentally ill people, the new york times reports.",

As wjbf reported in july, a whistleblower — a former deputy in the coroner's office — alerted the fbi to tuten's alleged illegal activities. A joint federal and state investigation ensued, leading to tuten's arrest in 2013, the chronicle reported in may.

She also writes she tried to kill herself by taking sleeping pills while married to him. She says she's since found love with husband erwin bach, whom she married in 2013, and that she's \" happier than i've ever been in my life. \" despite that, turner seems at peace with her own eventual departure from earth, a buddhist-influenced resignation she says evolved after she reportedly suffered a stroke in 2013 or 2014, followed by kidney failure and a cancer diagnosis in january 2016. The bbc notes she's even signed up with a group that advocates for assisted suicide. \" death is not a problem for me, \" she says. \" i really don't mind leaving. \" ( turner reveals her husband donated a kidney to her. )",

In a 2-1 decision — the los angeles times reports it was split between republican-appointed judges and a democrat-appointed judge — the court ruled the government must release the teen known only as jane doe to a sponsor by 5pm oct. 31, at which point she is free to get a legal abortion. However both the judges and the teen's lawyers admit it will be hard, if not impossible, to find a government-approved sponsor by the deadline, according to the washington post. If a sponsor can't be found, jane doe's case will return to court. Judges seemed reluctant to make a sweeping ruling on immigrant rights under such a tight time constraint. Jane doe, who has been trying to get an abortion since last month, is 15 weeks pregnant. Texas, where the teen is being held, bans abortions after 20 weeks. The aclu, which is representing jane doe, argues the government is violating her constitutional right to an abortion. The government argues that while the teen may have that right, the government is under no obligation to \" facilitate \" her abortion. ( a judge pointed out the government does facilitate abortions for adult women in immigration detention or federal prison. ) the government's office of refugee resettlement is now being overseen by e. Scott lloyd, who has a history of antiabortion activism and who court papers show has been personally trying to convince teens in shelters not to get abortions.",

Oxnard police assistant chief jason benites says jose alejandro sanchez-ramirez, 54, was \" disoriented, \" \" unsettled, \" and \" very distressed \" when officers caught up with him around 45 minutes after the crash, ktla reports. Police say sanchez-ramirez, who was taken to the hospital for observation and is cooperating with the investigation, was trying to turn his pickup truck onto a street before the crash at 5: 40am but pulled onto the tracks instead and became stuck, the los angeles times reports. It's not clear how long the truck, which was pulling a trailer with tools in it, was stuck on the tracks. \" it's not his fault, \" the driver's wife tells the times. She says he got out of the truck when he couldn't restart the engine and saw the train approaching. Investigators are trying to determine whether sanchez-ramirez was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to ktla. And while benites notes that \" given the circumstances, it's unusual that a person would go 1.6 miles away from an accident, \" he said \" it's safe to say it was not a deliberate act. \" four of the 30 people hospitalized after the accident are in critical condition, including the train's engineer, who suffered injuries to his lungs and heart, but metrolink officials say the accident would have been much worse if the system hadn't invested in passenger cars designed to absorb impact, the ap reports.",

When 25-year-old kendrick murry died from a head injury in september 2015, his mother learned he was an organ donor and ensured a kidney was given to the pastor at her mississippi church, who was battling end-stage renal failure, reports wdam. But unbeknownst to murry, her own cousin had been waiting for a heart transplant for nearly two years. Murry tells wdam she would see clintoria johnson at family events with tubes on her nose, but \" i didn't know what she needed. I really didn't know what was wrong. \" shortly after kendrick's death, however, johnson received a 25-year-old heart and relatives started to suspect that it was kendrick's. \" they were like, ' you know clintoria went to the hospital, and i ' m kind of thinking that's kendrick, ' \" murry says. To find out, \" i was told i had to write a letter and sign a release. It took me awhile to get to that point, but i said for mother's day, that's what i wanted to know, \" she says. Johnson agreed to find out the name of her donor and the news arrived just a day before kendrick's birthday. It confirmed what the family had suspected: his heart had gone to johnson. \" i was hollering and screaming … it just came at a perfect time, \" says murry. \" it was like that was his birthday gift, but to me. It was a pretty good mother's day. \" murry and johnson have since grown much closer. \" i call her my son sometimes, my daughter, \" says murry. \" it means a lot to me, \" adds johnson. \" i ' m just happy [ the heart is ] in the family. \"",

Transperth spokesman david hynes said the man was boarding at the tail end of peak hour, but the train was still fairly busy. \" he stood in the doorway and as he was sort of taking up his position there, one leg slipped outside the door, slipped outside the gap, and he was stuck, \" he said. \" we alerted the driver, made sure the train didn't move. \" then our staff who were there at the time got the passengers, and there were lots of them, off the train, and organised them to sort of rock, tilt the train backwards away from the platform so they were able to get him out and rescue him. \" mr hynes said the train was stationary when the man slipped. An ambulance was called but the man was not taken to hospital. It is believed he did not sustain serious injuries. Mr hynes said it was not a problem caused by overcrowding. He praised the actions of staff and passengers who assisted in freeing the man. \" everyone sort of pitched in, \" he said. \" it was people power that saved someone from possibly quite serious injury. \" topics: accidents, stirling-6021 first posted",

A federal jury on tuesday took all of 45 minutes to convict the 50-year-old resident of suburban chicago of criminal contempt for telling tall tales about a weight-loss \" cure, \" reports the chicago tribune. In the late-night ads, trudeau pushed his best-selling book, the weight loss cure they don't want you to know about, and said it would show people how to lose weight and still eat whatever they want. The problem is that the book actually recommended a spartan diet of 500 calories a day, along with prescription hormones. It wasn't the book's claims at issue, explains ap, but whether trudeau's ad was misleading about its content. \" if he had said what was truly in the book, he would have sold a lot fewer books, \" said a prosecutor in his closing argument. \" that's why he chose to lie about it. \" trudeau's attorney said prosecutors just didn't understand advertising. Jurors sided with prosecutors, and trudeau was immediately taken into custody. Potential jail time is unclear, but the sun-times previously reported that trudeau could get locked up for life.

Quebec's national assembly passed bill 62 on wednesday, and while the law banning facial coverings doesn't specifically mention burqas or niqabs, those have certainly been the main point of debate, according to reuters. Cbc reports the law applies to both public workers — teachers, doctors, and more — and people receiving public services — including, potentially, public transit riders. A 21-year-old woman who wears a niqab says the ban will force her to stay home instead going to the library or hanging out at the mall with friends because she doesn't have a car. \" it will just block me from the rest of the world, \" she says. The ban will take effect in july. Quebec premier philippe couillard says the law is about \" identification and safety. \" \" we are in a free and democratic society, \" he says. \" you speak to me, i should see your face, and you should see mine. It's as simple as that. \" but critics say the law unfairly targets muslim women and is simply an attempt to gain votes ahead of next year's elections. The national council of canadian muslims calls it \" ugly identity politics, \" and the council's ihsaan gardee says it's \" a made-up solution to an invented problem. \" a 2016 survey found just 3 % of muslim women in canada wear a niqab. Meanwhile, hate crimes against canadian muslims are on the rise, and six people were killed in a shooting at a mosque in quebec city last january.

Sean berkey encountered the bear on the east end of rover's run trail at 5: 30 a.m. As he headed to work at the alaska native medical center, where the 45-year-old works as a pediatric pharmacist. He had crossed a wooden bridge when he surprised the sow, who had a cub with her. Berkey stopped his bike, and the bear charged. He momentarily used his bike as a shield, said bruce bartley, a spokesman for the alaska department of fish and game. Berkey played dead _ the accepted practice when attacked by a brown bear _ and then tried to get away, but the sow came after him again, so again berkey played dead. \" the bear swatted him and bit him once, \" bartley said, describing the injuries as \" fairly minor. \" berkey eventually got back on his bike and rode to the hospital where he was met by a police officer, said anita shell, an anchorage police department spokeswoman.

An anchorage man commuting to work on his bicycle was attacked by a brown bear in far north bicentennial park on tuesday morning. Sean berkey, 45, was clawed and possibly bitten but was not severely injured by the bear, which was likely protecting its cub, according to the state department of fish and game. He was able to bike about three miles to the alaska native medical center on tudor road for treatment, said fish and game spokesman rick sinnott. The attack occurred on rover's run, a two-mile stretch of trail along the south fork campbell creek that has become a source of tension between state biologists and the city, which manages the park. The state wants it shut down for the summer, but the city has resisted. \" it's up to the people who use these areas to use good judgment, \" said anchorage mayor dan sullivan. \" we don't close down our facilities because we happen to live in an area that has some potential dangers. \" berkey was on his regular commute through the park from his hillside home to the medical center, where he is a pediatric pharmacist, when the attack happened at 5: 30 a.m. Beside the creek.

Npr reports 28-year-old environmental researcher lei yang was killed in may after police allegedly caught him paying for sex at a foot massage parlor. Police originally said lei resisted arrest and suffered a heart attack, but an autopsy showed that was a lie; lei choked to death on his own vomit, according to the washington post. During a six-month investigation, prosecutors determined police stepped on lei's face and neck and put him in a chokehold, failed to get him medical treatment quickly, claimed all video footage of the incident was lost or damaged, and tried obstruct the investigation. But on dec. 23, prosecutors announced they wouldn't be filing charges against police, the sydney morning herald reports. \" the circumstances of the criminality were slight and they were able to acknowledge and repent their crimes, \" prosecutors said. Despite chinese censors quickly moving to squash online discussion of the case, thousands of graduates from lei's alma mater and other top scholars are signing petitions to reverse the decision. \" if a human being doesn't even have the most basic right — the right to life — and the country doesn't protect that right, why can't we use the word 'evil'to describe such a country? \" the post quotes one graduate as saying. Experts say the lei yang case has \" destroyed the middle class'trust \" in the government because now they \" fear it could happen to them next. \"",

The national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) estimates that there are only about 450 north atlantic right whales left after 17 were reported dead this year, according to phys.org. And the news of such high mortality was exacerbated by a low number in births in 2017. Per the guardian, there are only about 100 breeding female whales active in the species, making the fear of extinction all the more real. \" you do have to use the extinction word, because that's where the trend lines say they are, \" says john bullard, noaa's northeast regional administrator. \" that's something we can't let happen. \" along with the low number of breeding females, a study published in endangered species research suggests that entrapment in fishing lines spikes stress levels in males, reducing their ability to reproduce. Co-author of the study elizabeth burgess says her colleagues are seeking solutions with the fishing community. ( noaa temporarily suspended its rescue operations this summer after a right whale struck and killed the rescuer untangling it from fishing lines. ) collisions with ships is another major cause of right whale death, and a study in nature reports that the whales are seeking food outside protected areas. The problem will likely worsen, it states, \"as water temperatures continue to rise, forcing movements towards both favorable oceanographic conditions and food sources elsewhere. \"",

            "This study on acoustic presence of narws demonstrates this species ' high mobility and broad geographic range. It also shows that the habitats narws frequent can change over time and that they are often distributed widely across their entire range. Previous understanding of narw movements assumed the majority of the population migrated between the calving grounds in winter months and northern feeding grounds in summer months, where visual survey effort was therefore concentrated27,46. Little was known about the whereabouts of whales that did not frequent these habitats, or the exact timing and location of other important areas. This study demonstrates nearly continuous year-round narw presence across their entire habitat range, particularly north of cape hatteras, suggesting that not all of the population undergoes a consistent annual migration. It is possible that the non-migrating whales could be mobile individuals occupying broader areas throughout the year, like some subspecies of blue whales in the antarctic47, or individuals",

Some $ 59.5 million of that will go toward refunds to the 335,000-plus consumers who were affected; the remainder is in fines. Part of the problem was an account protection product, notes the ap. Consumers were led to believe protection would last two years, when in fact it was often no more than three months. Additionally many consumers were billed even though they never completed enrollment. Amex says that the affected programs — which included identity protect, account protector, and lost wallet protector — have already been canceled, and that it \" continues to conduct internal reviews designed to identify issues, correct them and ensure that its products and practices meet a high standard of quality. \" richard cordray, cfpb's director, meanwhile, warns that companies \" should be on notice of this issue. \"",

Under the demographics unit, later renamed the zone assessment unit, plainclothes officers would infiltrate muslim gathering places to learn what they could. The new york times offers a snapshot: \" detectives were told to chat up the employees at muslim-owned businesses and ' gauge sentiment ' about america and foreign policy. Through maps and photographs, the police noted where albanian men played chess in the afternoon, where egyptians watched soccer and where south asians played cricket. \" after the ap broke the story in 2011, civil rights groups pressured the city to end the program, which never generated a single crime lead. Arab-american groups complained that the only thing it accomplished was to sow distrust between its members and police. The program had been largely inactive since mayor bill de blasio took office this year, and today he announced that it was done for good. \"our administration has promised the people of new york a police force that keeps our city safe, but that is also respectful and fair, \" said the mayor.

Marking a dramatic change of course for the department, police commissioner bill bratton agreed to disband the largely inactive demographics unit, which was started in 2003 in response to the 9/11 terror attacks. The unit was intended to root out threats by identifying pockets of islamic radicalization and locations where potential terrorists might gather. The covert program sent plainclothes officers into restaurants, mosques and just about anywhere else muslims gathered, to eavesdrop on people's conversations and gauge people's feeling toward the united states. The unit worked in secret until 2011, when the associated press published an expose chronicling the nypd's exploits in muslim neighborhoods, causing a rift between the department and minority communities. \"our administration has promised the people of new york a police force that keeps our city safe, but that is also respectful and fair, \" mayor de blasio said in a statement. \"this reform is a critical step forward in easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve, so that our cops and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys. \"",
