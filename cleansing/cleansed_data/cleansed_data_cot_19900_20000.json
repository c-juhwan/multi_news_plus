From there, stewart attacked newt gingrich's attempt to \"hook up with the new generation, \" as cnn's john king put it, by using twitter and youtube to announce his presidential candidacy. Stewart warned newt: \"this whole twitter thing is not going to work for you, because you're not cool. You're what might be known to your generation as a square. \" meanwhile, bill o'reilly defended fox news in response to stewart's takedown of the network on wednesday, saying that the organization doesn't mind common's \" style. \" \" what we object to is that common is sticking up for two convicted police killers. It is incredible that the white house would honor a man who has that on his resume. \" glenn beck weighed in, too, suggesting that common's white house invitation \"clearly indicates \" that the president is \"anti-cop. \"",

            "Jon stewart, in the humble opinion of this writer ( and judging by the facebook response this post got, many, many other people as well ) pretty much obliterated the silly controversy over the guests michelle obama invited to her poetry party last night. So, the \"scandal \" must be over now, right? i mean, stewart showed clips proving that fox news hosts had both misunderstood the lyrics of the rapper common and had defended artists singing worse lyrics. Besides, common and ( fellow target ) jill scott performed last night without incident. How could anyone possibly continue this debate? well, if you're glenn beck, you could spend the first 10 minutes of your show repeating everything sean hannity's said all week. Sigh. Well, give the guy a break. He's been out of town. After summarizing common's connections to radical leftists and bill ayers ( of course ), beck admitted that he hadn't listened to any of the rapper's catalog and that he may be wonderful. He then went to the heart of the matter: president obama doesn't like police officers. Why else would he allow common to read a poem at the white house? \"the president's actions clearly",

But this much is clear: liberals are livid that president obama even raised the possibility of touching them, reports the los angeles times. Two examples from today: sen. Bernie sanders reminded all that then-candidate obama rebuffed john mccain's proposal to hit social security. \" the american people expect the president to keep his word, \" said sanders. Moveon.org, meanwhile, warned that obama would have trouble drumming up volunteers for his 2012 run if he didn't keep that promise. Negotiators better not dismiss such opposition, writes nate silver at the new york times. The debt deal vote is a rare instance in the 112th congress in which the liberal vote could sway the outcome. John boehner will have trouble enough getting a majority of republicans to approve any deal. By silver's reckoning, he also will need at least 12 of the 80 or so members of the liberal congressional progressive caucus to go along. That makes a big deal on entitlement programs unlikely. In this case, \" the views of liberal democrats are far more than a token issue. \"",

A tow company employee was marking vehicles for auction when the dog jumped up on the dashboard, according to danny rotert, spokesman for kansas city municipal government. Tow lot employees called police, who came out and unlocked the vehicle. No one knows how kia survived, but it is believed that she picked through leftover mcdonalds trash, but tow lot employees didnt see any sign of water. City officials are investigating the circumstances surrounding the case. Everyone at the tow lot is upset, and no one intended to neglect a dog, rotert said. its a pretty miraculous story,  rotert said, adding that everyone is relieved the dog will go to a foster home. Veterinarian billie deam, who owns and operates the animal clinic of boardwalk square in kansas city, north, said that while its possible, its unlikely for a puppy to survive such an ordeal. without an appreciable amount of water, its pretty miraculous for a puppy to survive three weeks in a car,  she said.

Twenty-eight republicans voted yes. The bill would permit treasury to borrow normally for another 13 months; the senate is expected to pass it tomorrow. Here's a look at how it's being played: new york times: \" it effectively ended a three-year, tea party-fueled era when a series of budget showdowns raised the threat of debt defaults and government shutdowns, rattled economic confidence and brought serious scrutiny from an international community questioning washington's ability to govern. \" wall street journal: it's \" a tactical retreat by republicans stymied by their internal divisions. \" the hill: \" boehner's decision drew heavy criticism from conservative groups, many of whom said boehner needs to be replaced. Many noted that the so-called ' boehner rule ' now appears dead — that was the informal name for boehner's effort to extract spending cuts in exchange for debt ceiling hikes. \" politico: \" it's also a clear sign of the house republican conference's inability to move beyond fiscal fights and lays in plain view the leadership's inability — or unwillingness — to corral votes for their priorities. \"",

It describes the \" intended raffle [ as ] the sole initiative of a professional hunter who has dedicated his career to conservation and the better understanding of wildlife \" and clarifies that the conservancy's directors had no involvement. The post goes on to note that lions had been wiped out in the area by cattle ranchers when the conservancy was established in 1994; the conservancy \" now boasts one of zimbabwe's largest lion populations, with close to 500 lions, at one of the highest densities in africa. \" ( last month, 2 lions from a world-famous pride died after eating a poisoned cow carcass. )",

The suit alleges 48-year-old singer, who has directed such hits as the usual suspects and a number of x-men movies, met up with michael egan at a number of house parties in california and hawaii starting in the late 1990s. \" the parties were typically sordid and featured sexual contact between adult males and the many teenage boys who were present for the parties, \" the lawsuit says, and it accuses singer of plying egan with drugs and alcohol in order to force oral and anal sex on him, reuters reports. The extremely graphic suit also accuses singer of forcing egan to take cocaine and of pushing his head underwater in a pool, according to the hollywood reporter. Egan, now 31, says he was paid at least $ 1,500 per week by former entertainment business exec marc collins-rector, now a registered sex offender. Egan didn't have a clear job, but was sent to these parties and other \" attractive locations. \" he was 17 when, he says, singer assaulted him during two week-long hawaii trips in 1999. Egan claims singer promised him an x-men role, and that he and other men threatened to \" destroy [ egan's ] hopes and dreams of an acting career if he did not keep them happy. \" as for singer, his rep calls the lawsuit \" absurd and defamatory, \" according to cnn. The statement continues, \" it is obvious that this case was filed in an attempt to get publicity at the time when bryan's new movie [ x-men: days of future past ] is about to open in a few weeks. \"",

As of this writing, it is at 1 % on rotten tomatoes, with one positive review out of 71. Here's what people are saying: \" getaway is not a movie, it is a list of traffic violations, \" writes colin covert at the minneapolis star-tribune. In theory it could have been \" a stupidly awesome live-action cartoon, \" but that would have required wit or craft. This has neither, nor any plot to speak of. \" the movie's title contains the review: get away. \" \" needless to say, the car does the best acting in the movie, and as for dialogue, i ' ll take the shelby's purring and vrooming over anything the humans come up with, \" quips kyle smith at the new york post. He didn't like the chases, either, calling them \" a meaningless salad of imagery, \" slapped together with frenetic editing \" in an effort to fool you into thinking that something exciting is going on. \" numerous reviewers do mention one sublime, two-minute extended shot, in which the camera holds fast to its position on the front of one car. \" how is it possible that such a spectacle got shoehorned into a movie with no other redeeming qualities? \" asks stephanie merry at the washington post.

But if florida gets its way, the state will stay on daylight saving time... Forever. On tuesday, florida's senate approved the sunshine protection act, which asks congress to allow the state to observe daylight saving time year-round — not just the eight months that is standard in the united states. The bill was approved by the florida house in february and will now go to gov. Rick scott, whose office tells npr only that scott \" will review the bill. \" according to the federal uniform time act of 1966, states may exempt themselves from observing daylight saving time, as hawaii and most of arizona do. But there isn't an option for states to exempt themselves from standard time. So the change florida lawmakers desire is technically a change of time zone.

It took the state senate less than a minute tuesday to pass the \" sunshine protection act. \" there were only two dissenters. ( the house passed it 103-11 on february 14. ) the bill now goes to the desk of gov. Rick scott -- but it's far from a done deal after that, even if the governor approves, a change like this will literally take an act of congress. But if all is approved, floridians -- who ' ll set their clocks ahead one hour this sunday when daylight saving time begins -- won't have to mess with it ever again."

Today, those shares are worth $ 2 million, but gremel isn't enjoying the payoff of his good investment — at least not in the traditional sense. Instead, he's given back. The 98-year-old closet millionaire opted to donate his shares to the illinois audubon society last year so it could purchase 395 acres of property to turn into a wildlife refuge, reports the chicago tribune. The world war ii veteran, who spent 60 years as a boy scout leader, says he wants people to be able to enjoy the splendors of nature and really doesn't need the money himself. After all, gremel, who retired from practicing law at 45, is \" a very simple man \" with few expenses. He drives a 25-year-old car, lives in the family home he grew up in, doesn't have any children, and would rather eat oatmeal and stew than \" fancy foods, \" gremel says. \" you have to do some good in this world, \" he adds. \" that's what money is for. \" on sunday, gremel and several of his former boy scouts were among a crowd of 100 who trekked to the gremel wildlife sanctuary some 100 miles west of chicago to see it named in his honor, per saukvalley.com and usa today. His donation, which hasn't been entirely liquidated, was \" incredibly generous, \" ias ' executive director says. But as a friend puts it, \" the gift that he has given to thousands of kids through scouting and the influence it's had on their lives \" is \" 100 times more valuable. \" ( this woman is giving away almost 1 million acres. )",

        "summary": "Representatives from nearly 200 countries are in paris monday for the start of a two-week conference on climate change. The main goal is to get a deal on keeping global temperatures from rising 2 degrees celsius ( 3.6 degrees fahrenheit ) over pre-industrial levels, reports usa today. Some essential reading: the new york times takes a look at why these talks are different from previous summits — one big reason is the climate deal reached by the us and china last year — and what's at stake if they fail. At slate, eric holthaus cuts through a mountain of jargon to produce a guide to the key players and their goals. Is it a \" treaty \"? the fate in the us of any deal that emerges may hinge on that question, and a primer in the washington post suggests that the white house position ( \" no \" ) will prevail. Politico explains why an unexpected figure — george w. Bush — deserves a lot of credit for any deal that emerges. About that benchmark of 2 degrees celsius: the wall street journal reports that many scientists, even those convinced of a warming planet, think the figure is \" somewhat arbitrary. \" wired does an interesting calculation: just getting all the delegates to the conference will release 575 million pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Will it be worth it? it seems that even incremental progress should negate that. The images of hundreds of people are being projected onto the national assembly building in paris as part of a \" standing march \" project, notes time.

        "summary": "Dogs get jealous just like humans and, apparently, they read facial expressions like we do, too. For the first time, researchers have found evidence that dogs can gauge our emotions based solely on facial expressions — a major find, as no previous study has \" convincingly shown \" that non-human species have that ability, the researchers write in their study, published in current biology. Earlier studies found dogs could identify a face they knew from one they didn't, but the latest research suggests they actually recognize emotions, smithsonian reports. University of vienna researchers began by training 11 pet dogs to distinguish \" picture pairs \" in which 15 people made happy and angry faces, cropped to show either the upper or lower portion of the face. The dogs — including border collies, mixed breeds, a fox terrier, golden retriever, and german shepherd, national geographic reports — chose an option with their nose on a touch screen and were rewarded for correct answers. One group saw only upper photos, the other only lower; some were rewarded for responding to happy faces, and the others to angry. They were then tested on both the other half of the faces used in training, as well as an image of the left half of the face, plus upper and lower images of new faces. They were correct \" more often than would be expected by random chance in every case, \" a press release explains. However, \" we found that dogs for which the happy faces were rewarded learned the discrimination more quickly than dogs for which the angry faces were rewarded, \" write the researchers, perhaps because the dogs had been conditioned to steer clear of angry-looking people. In future trials, the researchers would like to work with puppies, cats, pigs, hand-raised wolves, and dogs with less human contact to see if the ability is learned or congenital.

        "summary": "The final batch of the richard nixon tapes — barring hundreds of hours being kept aside for national security reasons — has been released and while they probably won't change anybody's opinion of the ex-president, they're still a gold mine for history buffs. Some highlights from the tapes, which run from april to july 1973, when they abruptly end as soon as congress learns about nixon's secret taping system: after his first speech on watergate and the resignations of four top officials, nixon was done talking, cnn reports. \" goddammit, i ' m never gonna discuss this son of a bitch watergate thing again. Never, never, never, never, \" he vowed after the april 30, 1973, speech. He would, of course, go on to discuss watergate many more times before his august 1974 resignation. Soon after the watergate speech, nixon received calls of support from no fewer than three future republican presidents, the los angeles times reports, including his own successor, gerald ford. \" we're still behind you out here, and i wanted you to know that you're in our prayers, \" then-california gov. Ronald reagan told him. George hw bush, then chairman of the gop, said, \" i was really proud of you, and my golly, i know it was tough, and i just wanted to tell you that. \" the 340 hours of tape include plenty of discussion about relationships with moscow and beijing, the wall street journal notes. Nixon can be heard saying it is vital that he survive the watergate scandal, because \" who the hell else can talk to brezhnev? \" he calls china \" the critical problem of our age \" and discusses how to deal with \" the ablest people in the world \": \" they're very subtle — and they're not like the russians, who, of course slobber at flattery and all that sort of thing. \" more of nixon's anti-black and anti-jew bigotry is exposed in the tapes and the atlantic rounds it up. In an april 1973 call with henry kissinger about an upcoming soviet summit, nixon said he was all for \" a little anti-semitism \" in the interest of us foreign policy. \" it's about goddamn time that the jew in america realizes he's an american first and a jew second, \" he says. In a june meeting with aide anne armstrong, nixon says black people are incapable of running jamaica — or anywhere else. \" blacks can't run it. Nowhere, and they won't be able to for",

        "summary": "An inventor has developed a possible solution to the recurring problem of kids left in hot cars — and she did so before even graduating from high school. Alissa chavez, 17, came up with the basic idea for her lifesaving contraption for a school science fair, the washington post reports. ( yes, she won. ) it involves an alarm system warning parents when a child has been left in a car seat, no matter what the temperature. The \" hot seat, \" in its latest incarnation, uses a pressure sensor and your car keys. The system monitors a tracker on your keychain, detecting when you're more than 40 feet away from the car. At that point, it checks the pressure sensor to determine whether there's a child still in the car seat — and if there is, alarms sound. Chavez is now raising money to develop an improved prototype, kob reports. Meanwhile, she received a good samaritan award from the mayor of her hometown, albuquerque.

He says it's likely the most detailed target list ever released by the air force. \" it's clear that the plan so dryly laid out by us intelligence would have resulted in death and destruction unlike anything the world had or has ever seen, \" time says of the list. According to rt, the document calls for \" systematic destruction \" and aimed for a 60-megaton bomb — 4,000 times larger than the hiroshima bomb — to get \" significant results. \" a nuclear weapons historian tells the times the us had a \" bomb as you go \" strategy for a potential war with the soviet union. Bombers would fly toward major cities, dropping nuclear bombs on targets as they went. It was thought such a strategy would end the war quickly as deaths skyrocketed into the millions. The national resources defense council's nuclear program director says the destruction of population centers is still \" the heart of ( nuclear ) deterrence \" today.

        "summary": "Meteorologists might be able to predict heat waves on the east coast up to 50 days in advance by keeping an eye on ocean temperatures far, far away. Scientists writing in nature geoscience say they've picked up on a connection: when a particular weather event known as the pacific extreme pattern shows up north of hawaii, it triggers a chain of events that results in oppressive heat in the east in the not-too-distant future, reports ars technica. The researchers noticed the pattern after crunching data from us weather stations going back to 1982, along with corresponding sea surface temperatures. The pep occurs in a particular region near hawaii when colder-than-normal water meets warmer-than-normal water, and its presence means that the risk of a heat wave on the east coast can triple, the scientists write in a news release. \" we found that we could go back as far as seven weeks and still predict an increase in the odds of future heat waves, \" says researcher karen mckinnon of the national center for atmospheric research. \" what's exciting about this is the potential for long-range predictions of individual heat waves that gives society far more notice than current forecasts. \" they plan to start using the data to forecast heat waves in may, reports ap. Ideally, cities would be better able to prepare for potentially deadly stretches, like a particularly brutal one in 2012. What's more, scientists hope to use the insight to find more patterns that can predict other extreme weather events. ( this might have been the weirdest weather moment of 2015. )",

Her expedition officially started on july 24, 2015, and she's trying to break the guinness world record of graham hughes, who accomplished the same feat in four years, 31 days in 2014 at the age of 33. ( the youngest person to visit all of the nations was 24-year-old james asquith, who did it in five years. ) per her website, de pecol notes her travel bug was jump-started in college when she spent time in costa rica. According to her twitter bio, she's now up to 181 countries; she spends two to five days in each. Though she's so far spent about $ 200,000 on her journey, which has included more than 250 flights, much of that has been paid for by sponsors and by bartering for free lodging in exchange for social media posts. But what's the world traveler going to do once she's gone everywhere she could possibly go? she tells traveller she hopes to hole up in a rented cabin in british columbia and reminisce about her most amazing adventure, as well as inspire other people to indulge their wanderlust. ( hope she felt fine in the world's top 10 \" good \" countries. )",

Two other recent examples of endangered species have excited conservationists across the globe. A survey conducted by freeland and panthera recorded a new community of rare indochinese tigers with at least six cubs in eastern thailand, reports the bbc. Conservationists estimate that 250 tigers in this subspecies remain and credit anti-poaching efforts in thailand for the rise in new populations. For the first time in decades, evidence of two panther kittens was recorded north of the caloosahatchee river in florida, says national geographic.

Legendary trumpet player hugh masekela energized south africa's anti-apartheid struggle with \" mandela ( bring him back home ). \" now iran's pro-democracy campaign has its own rallying cry, courtesy of an exiled duo who've reworked pink floyd's 1979 hit \" another brick in the wall ( part ii ) \" into an anti-ayatollah anthem.the video for the track -- performed by blurred vision, two brothers whose parents fled iran for canada in the mid- ' 80s -- has been watched more than 140,000 times on youtube and notched up millions of views on other sites. Shot on a tight budget by iranian director babak payami, the video splices together footage of the band and clips of pro-government militia beating demonstrators after last summer's disputed presidential election. The song itself is a persian-influenced take on the pink floyd original, which climbs to the shouted chorus: \" hey ayatollah, leave those kids alone! toronto-based musicians sepp, 28, and sohl, 35 -- the pair refuses to give out their surname over fears that relatives in iran could be put in danger -- say they've received e-mails from fans inside the islamic republic, who play the track as a protest against the regime's brutality. \" sohl translated an e-mail from an iranian kid the other week that caused tears to run down his face, \" singer and guitarist sepp told aol news. \" this kid was essentially saying, ' you are now our voice, and if you guys stop we ' ll have no one to speak for us, so keep going. ' it just sent shivers down my spine knowing someone so young could be feeling so hopeless in their own nation. \" the brothers say they never set out to create an underground iranian hit. \" we weren't really focused on whether the song would reach iran when we went into the studio last fall, \" sepp explained. \" we recorded it a couple of months after the election, just when the media was starting to pull",
            "Read about it! by gardenreader this is a great song - it has much more meaning when you read the background on the two iranian brothers who recorded this - it is on aol.news - goggle blurred vision and/or pink floyd the wall - perhaps hey ayatollah - and you should find the article. Also, it would be great to let people know that the proceeds are going to amnesty international. There is also a music video on you tube. Please support this people!"

        "summary": "More woes on the streets of new york: a rabbi and outspoken advocate for victims of sex abuse was injured in an apparent chemical attack as he was walking in williamsburg yesterday, reports the new york times. Rabbi nuchem rosenberg runs a website and hotline that make public accusations of abuse within his satmar hasidic community. In an interview from the hospital where he was treated, he said a man he knew came up behind him, tapped him on the shoulder, and said \" whoops \" as he threw a cup of what may have been bleach in his face. Rosenberg was treated for chemical burns around his eye as well as a corneal abrasion, but is expected to make a full recovery. The attack came just a day after nechemya weberman was convicted of sexually abusing a young girl. Many in their shared community believe he's innocent, and rosenberg says the conviction may have partly triggered the attack, though an nypd rep has said there's no evidence of that.",

        "summary": "Police are hoping that new sketches of a woman known only as \" tiger lady \" will help solve a cold case that has gone unsolved for 23 years, the star-ledger reports. The woman's partly decomposed body was discovered beside i-80 in knowlton township, nj, on oct. 26, 1991, stripped of clothes and jewelry and with a tattoo of a bengal tiger on her left calf. Police believed that the crudely drawn, 7-inch tattoo — which was likely inked by an amateur, upi reports — would help identify the victim, believed to be aged 17 to 19. But the teen's decomposition made things harder by hiding her face and disguising how she died. So police sent out images of the tattoo along with sketches of her face based on computerized skull scans, the new york times reported at the time. Yet it never led to a suspect, nor was the woman ever identified. Now police are hoping better-quality sketches and the power of facebook will lead to a break in the case: \" we can reach a half million people or more through social media, \" say troopers in a post on the social media site. \" please like and share this post. Someone knows something. \" perhaps \" tiger lady \" was murdered by serial killer joel rifkin, who would ultimately be found guilty of killing nine women and was suspected in at least 17 homicides, police said back in 1993. Either way, her death was one of three unsolved killings of females in warren county from 1982 to 1997, and one of several murders involving bodies dumped by an interstate. \" the interstates system is a continuous, highly anonymous corridor that gives a killer a convenient avenue to get a body out of the area where he killed it, \" a police lieutenant said at the time.

It helps that she has badass fighting skills. Oh, and superpowers. Here's what critics are saying about dc comics ' long-awaited wonder woman, which has a 93 % positive rating at rottten tomatoes: thanks to \" a mostly cheerful light touch \" from director patty jenkins, wonder woman restores the \" escapist fun \" that's been missing from dc comics movies since christopher reeve was superman, colin covert writes at the minneapolis star tribune. It has \" campy charm. \" at the same time, it \" blazes an amusing proto-feminist path, \" he writes. On the downside, it \" lacks a compelling supervillain \" and is somewhat bewildering. The special effects are \" uninspiring \" and the action \" slightly jerky, \" but wonder woman is still \" a cut above nearly all the superhero movies \" of the past few summers, writes stephanie zacharek at time. She credits gal gadot, who is \" simply marvelous \" as a heroine both sweet and strong, though connie nielsen's \" regal presence … elevates even the tiniest role \" as queen hippolyta. It's one of dc comics ' best movies yet, according to kelly lawler. Slamming together action, romance, comedy, war, and history, it \" throws out the now very tired superhero movie formula \" and \" makes you feel good while you watch it, \" she writes at usa today. \" gadot and [ chris ] pine have fantastic chemistry, \" she adds, but gadot is \" electric \" on her own. And without the clutter of some other superhero action scenes, hers truly shine. As moira macdonald puts it, wonder woman is \" everything fans and moviegoers would want it to be: smart, swift, sometimes funny, occasionally dazzling and surprisingly soulful. \" jenkins manages to lay the foundation for a franchise while \" creating a movie that stands alone, she writes at the seattle times. But this is still gadot's show. In \" projecting both endless strength and quiet vulnerability, \" she makes wonder woman all her own.",

For starters, the five russian suspects who were being held in boston and virginia were abruptly transferred to new york city to join the five others, reports the bbc. Meanwhile, high-ranking officials from moscow and washington met secretly. All this follows earlier news from the family of russian physicist igor sutyagin, who's imprisoned on charges of spying for the us. They say he's been moved to moscow in preparation for a swap. Russian officials have been contacting the spy suspects in the us to ask whether they'd be open to such a transfer, reports the wall street journal. ( it also notes that today's formal unveiling of charges does not charge the 10 with espionage but with the lesser crime of being unregistered foreign agents. )",

        "summary": "When newly vegan indiana software engineer goose wohlt heard his wife talk last year about a video of two french women whipping up a chocolate mousse using the liquid typically tossed from a can of chickpeas, he decided to try a meringue. And it worked. Almost overnight the discovery became a culinary sensation for vegans — bon appetit calls it a \" silver bullet \" egg substitute; food52 is salivating over the chance to test it on macaroons and souffles, and in what can only be described as a profile of an ingredient, the new york times calls it \" magic. \" wohlt even helped generate a trendy new name for the bean juice: aquafaba, which combines the latin words for \" water \" and \" bean. \" and the act of substituting is simple: a tablespoon for a yolk, two for a white, and three for a whole egg. Aquafaba works in a way that no other egg alternative has, but the science is still out on why. Harold mcgee, author of the book on food and cooking, tells the times that the key seems to be its blend of protein ( though it's got a tenth of the protein in an egg ) and dissolved starch, which helps to slow down the collapsing of foam. Home cooks and high-profile chefs alike are now experimenting with the ingredient, whipping up their own creations to largely positive praise. Condiment maker sir kensington's is even rolling out a new vegan mayonnaise using aquafaba that it calls fabanaise. And while it doesn't appear to bring much nutritional value to the table, it is plant-based and could help reduce food waste given the stuff has until recently been largely dumped down the drain.

After two years of making do without a hairdresser, the isolated northern canadian town of norman wells in the northwest territories – population 800 – is going public with their plight in the hope of attracting a coiffeur. \"it's been a long struggle for us, \" said nicky richards, the economic development officer leading the recruitment effort for this town that sits near the southern edge of the arctic circle. \"we just don't have anyone. It's something that people down south don't even ever think about because they don't have to worry about it. \" many residents have had to turn to family members to cut their hair or attempt to do it themselves. \"we're trying to figure out ways to maintain ourselves, \" said richards, who regularly gives the same buzz cut to her husband, a friend and her boss. \"i ' m not a hairdresser by any set of means, but i do have a set of clippers and that's what i use, \" she told the guardian.

It's a unique, small-town problem, something people in norman wells say they took for granted when they had a permanent hairstylist. Richards says she's going public with their plight, in hopes of attracting the right person, and improving local'dos. \" we have a couple of shaggy people around here for sure, \" she says. \" i cut my boss's hair all the time.

Nor did jamie madley envision scullion reaching adulthood until his 18th birthday, when he fulfilled his dream of flying a plane. She was only trying to protect herself: at just four months old, scullion was diagnosed with the rapid aging condition progeria, better known as \" benjamin button disease, \" and predicted to live only until his 13th birthday, though \" i just don't think about all of that, \" he said in 2014. The canadian man beat the odds before awaking sunday with a rapid heart rate, reports the cbc. He died later that day at a hospital, exactly 20 years after his initial diagnosis, as the second-oldest progeria patient in the world, reports global news. Scullion — who met nsync as a 4-year-old — suffered two strokes as a child and more recently had a heart attack. He also battled arthritis and, like many progeria patients, had a low body weight, though he credited his involvement in a clinical trial for the drug lonafarnib with helping him maintain an appetite. Madley said the drug also reversed the hardening of his arteries, per ctv news. \" he lived his life to the fullest and he loved every minute, \" she says. His death \" just makes us want to work all that harder, \" adds audrey gordon of the progeria research foundation, whose nephew died of the condition in 2014. She describes scullion as having \" great strength \" and \" a great sense of humor. \" ( a progeria patient dubbed the \" 100-year-old teen \" died last year. )",

            "The chinese stock market behaves differently from most other big markets in the world in normal times. During a big selloff, things can get really weird. Photo: getty images. Chinese shares made their biggest daily gain in six years thursday, a tentative step toward restoring confidence in beijing's suite of measures to rescue its stock market. The shanghai composite rose 5.8 % to 3709.33, after losses in eight of the previous 10 trading days. The smaller shenzhen market rose 3.8 %. Still, both indexes have lost around a third of their value in the past month. The small-cap chinext board, which has shed some 38 % from its june highs, rose 3 %....",
            "Beijing/shanghai beijing's increasingly frantic attempts to stem a stock market rout were finally rewarded as chinese shares bounced around 6 percent on thursday, but the costs of heavy-handed state intervention are likely to weigh on the market for a long time.

Bad politics. I love puerto rico! \" trump is calling into question how the study by george washington university calculated the number. Gwu researchers looked at the six months after hurricane maria, from september 2017 to february 2018, and found 2,975 \" excess deaths \" when compared to a typical period, explains the washington post. Lack of access to medical care, along with shortages of water and power, were seen as contributing to the higher number. Trump also raised the issue on wednesday, boasting of his administration's \" incredible, unsung success \" in its response to maria — a sentiment that territory officials disagreed with.

            "To a mother, the details of this story are horrifying. A nine year old boy is fighting for his life tonight after driving a car full of underage children down a rural scott county road. He wrecked the car, killing two of the young passengers. \" everybody is hurt by this, \" said lexie payne, a neighbor. Three year old braydon traxler and 13 year old justin harrell died after being ejected when the car they were in slammed into a light pole, snapping it in half. Payne says this is a shocking nightmare. Payne says, \" little braydon, oh my gosh, he's such a little character, \" said payne. \" he's surely going to be missed. \" the wreck happened late friday night in scott county's close knit hillsboro community. Nine year old ty ' jun thigpen, known to many as nemo, took his mother's car keys, got behind the wheel of the car and the other three children got in the mercury with him. Thigpen saw blue lights and tried to avoid the mississippi highway patrol's safety check point. Sgt. Andy west says that's when troopers tried to stop the car. \" one of the officers from mississippi highway patrol attempted to make contact with the vehicle, catch up to the vehicle and stop the vehicle to see what the reason was for eluding the check point, \" said sgt. Andy west. \" in the course of him catching up to the vehicle the vehicle ran off the road and overturned. Unfortunately two children lost their lives as a result of the accident. \" the 13 year old victim's twin sister breckon harrell was in the car, and survived the impact. She was taken to an area hospital and family says has since been released with minor injuries. As for the nine year old driver, ty ' jun, he remains listed in critical condition and is fighting for his life. \" my condolences go out to the family, \" said payne.

To be fair, it's often quite difficult to tell. That's not only because of bias in coverage or because the internet has largely wiped away the compartmentalization of the traditional paper, but because reporters now regularly give their opinions on tv, write \"analysis \" pieces, and make their ideological preferences clear on social media.

Per the seattle times, tahlequah dropped her offspring's decomposing body after going to great lengths to hold onto the calf for 17 days, during which she's estimated to have traveled some 1,000 miles. \" she looks vigorous and healthy, \" ken balcomb with the center for whale research, told the seattle times in an email. Tahlequah is a member of the j pod, which is part of a critically endangered population of orcas off the northwest coast known as southern-resident killer whales. While balcomb considers tahlequah's ordeal now over, she and the other orcas in the area are far from out of the woods. Another member of tahlequah's pod, dubbed j50, was considered near death as recently as last week. The 3.5-year-old female's condition is believed to be so grim that scientists are working out how to attempt the first ever feeding of live salmon to a wild killer whale. Brad hanson, a wildlife biologist with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, is spearheading the effort, which he hopes can both feed j50 and provide her with medication to fight what scientists fear is a serious infection. Per the ap, j50 is one of only 75 southern resident killer whales left and her loss could mean even fewer orcas are produced down the line. The region's orca population is believed to suffer most notably from low populations of their most important prey, chinook salmon.",

        "summary": "A shipwreck off the coast of japan serves as evidence that no navy can defeat mother nature. Archaeologists spotted the wreck off the island of takashima in southern japan and say it belongs to one of two attempted mongol invasions from the 13th century, archaeology reports. Running 65 feet long by 20 feet wide, the ship still carries old ironware and chinese ceramics that establish its connection to the mongol fleets, researchers said last week. Both of the mongol attacks were repulsed by devastating storms called \" divine wind \" or \" kamikaze \" typhoons; in the second invasion, in 1281, some 140,000 mongol fighters arrived on roughly 4,400 ships and battled samurai in northern kyushu, the telegraph reported a few years ago. But when the mongols re-boarded the boats, possibly seeking shelter in kyushu's coves, a typhoon wiped them out. Not surprisingly, evidence of the 1281 invasion has already turned up on the island. Another wreck, a warship with a 50-foot keel, was located in 2011 with weapons on board; it was the \" first near-complete pre-medieval wooden ship \" found in the country, per the telegraph. Until then, only anchor stones and cannonballs had turned up. Among the specific artifacts identified in the latest find, which was spotted roughly 650 feet off the coast: ironware, a glaze pottery vase, roof tiles, and a white porcelain bowl, asahi shimbun reports. Now japanese researchers say they may have spotted three more wrecks from the mongol attacks. ( see how archaeologists found the grave of \" sleeping beauty. \" )",

In a 5-4 ruling, the justices blocked key provisions of a california law requiring the clinics to inform patients about low-cost abortions provided elsewhere, reports the los angeles times. While the court did not strike down all of the law, it returned the case to lower courts, with clarence thomas writing in his majority opinion that challengers were \" likely to succeed. \" he concluded that forcing the clinics to talk to patients about abortions probably violates their free-speech rights, reports the ap. \" california cannot co-opt the licensed facilities to deliver its message for it, \" thomas wrote. Chief justice john roberts joined him, along with anthony kennedy, samuel alito, and neil gorsuch. The law went into effect in 2016 after lawmakers raised concerns that the anti-abortion pregnancy centers were using \" intentionally deceptive advertising and counseling practices, \" per the lat. The law was two-pronged, explains npr. If a center was unlicensed, it had to make that fact prominently known, including in signs and advertising. If the center was licensed but did not provide abortions, it had to post signs saying that the procedures were provided by the state. While the law affects only california clinics, the court ruling could have ramifications in other states. However, as usa today notes, that might actually be good news for those who support the right to have an abortion. For example, the ruling could possibly be used to strike down laws in conservative states requiring women to have ultrasounds before an abortion.",

Usa today anti-abortion activists gathered outside the supreme court tuesday as the court issued its decision in a california case involving pregnancy centers. ( photo: jim lo scalzo, epa-efe ) washington -- the supreme court on tuesday dealt a major blow to a california law requiring anti-abortion pregnancy centers to inform women about publicly funded abortion and contraception services. The 5-4 ruling by justice clarence thomas, with the court's conservatives in the majority, said the law \" likely \" violates the first amendment as a form of compelled speech. \" licensed clinics must provide a government-drafted script about",

Supreme court has reversed a lower court decision upholding a california law requiring anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers to more fully disclose what they are. The case pitted the right to know against the right of free speech. On one side are self-identified \" crisis pregnancy centers \" that seek to prevent abortions and on the other side is the state of california, which enacted a 2015 law to ensure that these centers do not intentionally or unintentionally mislead the women who walk through their doors. In a 5-4 ruling, the court said the centers are likely to succeed in their",
            "The national institute of family and life advocates, which represents 110 \"non-profit, pro-life pregnancy centers \" in california, sued and sought to block the disclosure law. But a federal judge in san diego and the 9th circuit court of appeals in san francisco refused to do so. Judge dorothy nelson of the 9th circuit said the state has ample authority to regulate \"professional speech \" to protect the welfare of patients. Moreover, the required disclosure, she said, does not \"encourage, suggest or imply \" that women should consider or choose abortion."

The lava breached the property overnight and was within 200 yards of the nearest well, said david mace, a spokesman for the federal emergency management agency. Asked about safety hazards, he replied: \" i think it's safe to say authorities have been concerned about the flow of lava onto the plant property since the eruption started. \" a plant spokesman, mike kaleikini, told the news agency hawaii news now that the lava was as close as 130 feet from wells. He said there was no indication of the release of the poisonous gas hydrogen sulfide, the greatest fear should lava hit the wells. \" as long as conditions are safe, we will have personnel on site. Primary concern is sulfur dioxide from the eruption and lava coming on site. We monitor for hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide on a continuous basis, \" kaleikini said. Steve brantley of the hawaiian volcano observatory, said the flow seemed to have halted sunday morning after moving slowly into the proximity of the well overnight. Lava had previously crossed onto an older part of the property, according to officials. But it's now on 40 acres of the plant that are operational. Officials earlier this month carted away 50,000 gallons of potentially toxic gas away from the site, which lies on the southeast flank of the volcano, nestled between residential neighborhoods. They also capped the 11 wells at the property to try to prevent a breach. Lava-filled fissures have torn apart chunks of the southeastern side of the big island over the past three weeks as kilauea has become more active.",

One, discovered in 1872, pre-dated the bible and told its own ark story. Now a tablet has arrived at the british museum that actually describes how to build the ark, according to irving finkel, who works at the museum's middle east department. The palm-sized tablet dates back to 1900-1700bc, is written in semitic babylonian, and has exactly 60 lines of text, writes finkel in the telegraph. It also explains that the ark built by artra-hasis — a noah-like figure who took instructions from the god enki — was completely round. \" draw out the boat that you will make, \" artra-hasis is told, \" on a circular plan. \" that contradicts our usual ark image but does makes sense, because ancient mesopotamian round boats — called coracles — were hard to sink and hard to steer, but who needs steering during a world-wide flood? the boat was made of coiled, waterproofed rope with a base area of 38,750 square feet, about an acre in all, according to the tablet — which then reads, \" and the wild animal[ s of the st ] ep[ pe ], two each, two by two. \" ( read about a modern-day replica of noah's ark. )",

Visas, according to a former senior department official. \" during that time period immigration officials were not allowed to use or review social media as part of the screening process, \" john cohen, a former acting under-secretary at dhs for intelligence and analysis. Cohen is now a national security consultant for abc news. One current and one former senior counter-terrorism official confirmed cohen's account about the refusal of dhs to change its policy about the public social media posts of all foreign applicants, which prevented review of malik's purported radicalization on social media online. \"as more details have been learned about the two terrorists responsible for the horrific"

But the veteran of three wars was reportedly asked to leave the redwood retirement residence after he couldn't keep his room as clean as staff wanted him to and couldn't afford the $ 1,500 cleaning fee they charged for someone else to do it. He ended up living first in local motels, then in a nearby homeless shelter. \" watching him walk into an environment that no older person should ever have to be in … was wrenching my heart, \" says a senior advocate who has been helping farrell. Last week, though, a stranger who heard his story helped farrell get into another assisted living facility. A statement from redwood's parent company indicates that the veteran was told in february that his apartment was a health hazard, and that he had started to act aggressively. But farrell himself thinks there may have been an additional impetus behind his eviction: his constant ukulele playing. \" management continually suppressed my talents, \" he tells kpix 5. \" management would stop me and say … 'go back to your room!

In a statement, the boy's family thanked the public for the \" prayers and thoughtful messages they have received during this difficult time. \" after the rescue in new harmony, jason was airlifted to a hospital. \" the father said jason's situation has been an example to their family that ' god hears and answers prayers, ' \" the sheriff's office said, per deseret news. The office said jason has been responding to questions from family members and hospital staff. Sgt. Aaron thompson, the officer who pulled the boy from the pond, says he \" just made the decision \" to go in the water. He was treated for cuts and hypothermia. Sheriff cory pulsipher tells the spectrum that thompson is a hero. \" a lot of people would probably like to think they would have dived in too, but how many actually would have? \" the sheriff says. \" he hates having the spotlight on him, but he's a hero. \"",

        "summary": "Pig organs have long been eyed as transplant options for humans, as the organs are about the same size and pigs are plentiful, but it's been challenging to overcome the human immune system's possible rejection of such organs. Now, in what one medical expert tells the new york times could be a \" real game changer, \" researchers from egenesis, a spinoff of harvard university, have scrubbed dozens of viruses from pig dna to create genetically modified piglets that may one day serve as organ donors for humans. The bbc reports on the study in the journal science, noting this \" exciting and promising first step \" toward xenotransplantation, in which organs are transplanted between different species. \" we know we have an audacious vision of a world with no shortage of organs … but that is also our motivation, \" says study co-author luhan yang. The researchers isolated 25 porcine endogenous retroviruses, or \" pervs, \" in pig dna that could potentially infect humans, then used a gene-editing program called crispr to eliminate those viruses. They next implanted that genetic material into pig eggs, and 37 piglets were born. \" these are the first perv-free pigs, \" yang says. Study co-author george church says the first pig-to-human transplants could take place within two years, though issues remain. The times documents those, including other problems that lead to organ rejection, ethical concerns ( including animal welfare ), and religious objections. Still, a gene-editing expert not affiliated with the study notes about 22 people a day die awaiting a transplant and \" if you could help them with a pig organ, wouldn't that be wonderful? \" ( scientists have been working on the pig-human problem for a while. )",

The newspaper's the counted project, an interactive database that the guardian says uses both reporting and confirmed crowdsourced info, indicates 500 people have already died at the hands of police in 2015, after two black men in new york and cincinnati were shot this week. These numbers are more than double the latest rate compiled by the fbi ( 461 in 2013 ), which manages a \" voluntary \" reporting system where police agencies can send in numbers of \" justified homicides. \" in those first 500 deaths, 49.6 % of the individuals were white, 28.2 % were black, and 14.8 % were hispanic/latino. Only 4.8 % were women. How that stacks up against america's makeup: as of the 2013 census, we were 62.6 % white, 13.2 % black, and 17.1 % hispanic/latino. And there's a definite imbalance among those who were unarmed: per the paper's stats, 30.5 % of black people were unarmed, while just 16.1 % of white people were ( the unarmed total is 108 of the 500 ). The executive director of amnesty international usa told the guardian earlier this month that the \" startling \" disparity between unarmed blacks and unarmed whites shows we need to \" get to the bottom of why you're twice as likely to be shot if you're an unarmed black male. \" you can explore the database and learn more about the dead here.",

Cue the new york post's predictably juicy-sounding \" exclusive \" ( \" sexxx ed \" ), in which outraged parents express their belief that, as one says, \" people like that should not be allowed to be anywhere near children. \" the really odd thing, as new york magazine and jezebel note, is that petro has actually been quite open about her past for a while now, penning at least three essays about it in the past few years and even appearing in a video to talk about it. Really, none of her students \"googled their teacher to read about her sexploits \" before this? wonders chris rovzar.

            "As potential jurors enter courtroom 11d at the regional justice center for a robbery trial on monday, they will not see the teardrop tattooed just below defendant bayzle morgan's right eye. They will not see the swastika within a clover under the 24-year-old's left eye. Nor will they see the words \"most wanted \" across his forehead. The \"baby nazi \" tattoo on his neck will be hidden, as will the iron cross on the back of his bald head, along with two more white supremacist tattoos where his eyebrows should be.

But clark county district judge richard scotti, worried the tattoos morgan wears won't allow him a fair trial on a robbery charge, has ordered that he be allowed to wear makeup in court to cover up the skin etchings. This is judicial correctness that makes political correctness seem quaint. Will bright red lipstick go best with his complexion? how about a little blush to make morgan, who faces the death penalty in a separate murder case, seem sweeter? and don't forget the mascara to highlight his lovely eyes.

Adolf hitler invaded poland on sept. 1, 1939, jump-starting world war ii, and although clare hollingworth's telegraph story on those troops didn't cite her by name ( articles often didn't have bylines back then ), it was her reporting coup.

Her reporting work took her all over the world, including to conflicts in vietnam, the middle east, and china. She even came close to death in 1946 when she was just yards away from a bomb blast in jerusalem that killed almost 100 people. She nabbed the james cameron award for journalism in 1994, as well as other reporting honors. She's survived by a stepdaughter, hilary, as well as a niece, jennifer, and a nephew, richard.

        "summary": "Ohio takes a relatively aggressive approach to purging its rolls of voters, and the supreme court on monday declared it's perfectly legal to do so. Under ohio law, people who skip voting in two consecutive elections and then ignore various mailings from the state are removed from registration rolls, reports the columbus dispatch. Groups including the aclu challenged the practice, but the supreme court's five conservative justices sided with ohio. \" the only question before us is whether it violates federal law, \" wrote samuel alito, referring to the 1993 voter registration act. \" it does not. \" the court's four more liberal justices dissented. As the new york times explains, federal law forbids removing people from registration rolls because of a failure to vote, but it gives state officials leeway to drop voters who they think have moved. Sonia sotomayor wrote in her dissent that the 1993 law was intended to guard against the disenfranchising of \" low-income and minority voters, \" and monday's decision supports \" the very purging that congress expressly sought to protect against, \" per the ap. Alito, however, said people had plenty of opportunity to make sure their names weren't removed. \" combined with the two years of nonvoting before notice is sent, that makes a total of six years of nonvoting before removal, \" he wrote. The case involved an akron man who voted in the 2008 presidential race but skipped 2012, along with the 2010 and 2014 midterms. When he tried to vote in a 2015 marijuana ballot initiative, he was out of luck. In the 2016 presidential vote, about 7,500 people discovered the same, the aclu found. That would not have been enough to tip ohio to hillary clinton, notes the dispatch.",

If he's right, atiyah wins even more acclaim — plus a $ 1 million prize. But before the bubbly is cracked, the 89-year-old has to convince fellow mathematicians of his feat, and they sound very skeptical. The details: the announcement: in a speech in germany monday, the retired university of edinburgh mathematician said he had found a \" simple proof \" of the problem. \"nobody believes any proof of the riemann hypothesis because it is so difficult, \" he said, per live science. \" nobody has proved it, so why should anybody prove it now? unless, of course, you have a totally new idea. \" atiyah says he does. The actual problem: the hypothesis, put forth by mathematician bernhard riemann in 1859, involves the distribution of prime numbers — hence its nickname of \" the riddle of the primes. \" riemann thought he figured out a pattern, and his formula works for the first 10 trillion solutions. Impressive, but that still means it's \" unsolved, \" per the clay mathematics institute, which gets into the mathematical nitty gritty. Anyone who can prove the hypothesis to infinity will collect a $ 1 million millennium prize award from the institute.",

The hiring of clerks isn't necessarily a surefire way to make predictions about justices, observes a post at new york. But it notes that ruth bader ginsburg, who wouldn't want president trump to name her successor, has her clerks selected through 2020.",
