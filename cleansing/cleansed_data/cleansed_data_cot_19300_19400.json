It's also an acronym for international house of prayer, a church that started praying on sept. 19, 1999, and hasn't stopped. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, live music is playing and the church is packed — even at 3am one recent morning, more than 100 people were worshiping as an 11-member rock band played, the los angeles times reports. People visit from as far away as south korea; recently, 27 us states and mexico were represented in the parking lot — around midnight. Ihop is part of the fast-growing perpetual prayer movement, and believes prayer is \" spiritual warfare \" against demons that have a hold on parts of society. It draws from a movement that outsiders call \" dominionism, \" which seeks influence over areas seen as devil-infiltrated, including business, media, and government. The idea is controversial, and has led to some concern over the church's influence — it played a central part in rick perry's recent prayer meeting — but the founding pastor laughs off such concerns. \" like we're going to take over bill gates, \" he says. \" c ' mon people, get a grip. \" ( and yes...

A twitter thread revealed the agency has laid off lulu, a recruit in its k9 training program tasked with detecting explosives. Lulu, described in her cia profile as being a \" hyper and silly \" black lab with an \" easygoing sweetness, \" started \" to show signs that she wasn't interested in detecting explosive odors \" not long after she started training. The agency explains that dogs in this program often have an off day ( or two ), but that trainers can often figure out what's wrong — maybe the pup just needs extra playtime or rest, or there's a minor medical issue — and help the dog bounce back. But for lulu, it wasn't temporary. \" even when motivated w food &amp; play, she was clearly no longer enjoying herself, \" the agency tweeted, noting they stopped lulu's training for her physical and mental health. But if lulu was suffering from existential ennui on the job, she's apparently not now. A post on the cia site explains that when a canine leaves the k9 training program, the dog's handler can choose to adopt the pup. And that's exactly what happened in the case of lulu, who now appears to be living her best life frolicking with her handler's children, \" sniffing out rabbits and squirrels in the backyard, \" and whiling away the hours with \" harry, \" who appears to be another black lab.

Shockingly, only one of the 27 died, though it took three doses of noloxone to revive one person. Huntington — a city of 50,000 — typically sees 18 to 20 overdoses per week. Police chief joe ciccarelli calls monday's rash of overdoses \" remarkable. \" police believe the overdoses were due to a batch of heroin laced with something else, wsaz reports. \" when something like this hits the streets, it draws like flies to sugar, \" ciccarelli says. Most of the overdoses occurred within a mile of each other, with seven happening in one location. While police suspect the heroin was laced with fentanyl, they won't be sure for months. It will take about 10 weeks to get toxicology reports back. According to the cdc, west virginia had the highest rate of overdose deaths in the us in 2014.",

Investigators found intimate links between the cell behind the brussels attacks and the group that killed 130 in paris, reports the ap. Sunday's statement confirms that the raids and arrests in the week leading up to the brussels attacks — including the capture of key paris fugitive salah abdeslam — pushed the killers to action. Belgian authorities detained four men in brussels raids friday who were charged with participating in \" terrorist murders \" and \" activities of a terrorist group \" in relation to the brussels attacks. One, mohamed abrini, has also been charged in the paris attacks. Abrini has been identified as the \" man in the hat \" spotted with the two bombers who blew themselves up at brussels airport. Surveillance footage has also placed him in the convoy with attackers headed to paris ahead of the nov. 13 massacre. Abrini was a childhood friend of salah and brahim abdeslam, both suspects in the paris attacks, and had ties to abdelhamid abbaoud, the paris ringleader who died in a raid shortly after. Brahim abdeslam blew himself up in paris while salah abdeslam was arrested in brussels on march 18 — four days before the attacks there — after a four-month manhunt. Abrini's fingerprints and dna were not only in a renault used in the paris attacks but also in a brussels apartment used by the airport bombers. Abrini was also believed to have traveled to syria, where his younger brother died in 2014.",

        "summary": "Scientists scanning and mapping the giza pyramids say they've discovered that the great pyramid of giza, the oldest of the world's seven wonders, is a bit lopsided. And really, just a bit. The pyramid's exact size has stumped experts for centuries, as the \" more than 21 acres of hard, white casing stones \" that originally covered it were removed long ago. Reporting in the most recent issue of the newsletter \" aeragram, \" which chronicles the work of the ancient egypt research associates, engineer glen dash says that by using a new measuring approach that involved finding any surviving remnants of the casing in order to determine where the original edge was, his team found the east side of the pyramid to be a maximum of 5.55 inches shorter than the west side. The question that most intrigues him, however, isn't how the egyptians who designed and built the pyramid got it wrong 4,500 years ago, but how they got it so close to perfect. \" we can only speculate as to how the egyptians could have laid out these lines with such precision using only the tools they had, \" dash writes. He tells live science his working hypothesis is that the egyptians laid out their design on a grid, noting that the great pyramid is oriented only slightly away from the cardinal directions ( its north-south axis runs 3 minutes 54 seconds west of due north, while its east-west axis runs 3 minutes 51 seconds north of due east ) — an amount that's \" tiny, but similar, \" atlas obscura points out.

        "summary": "Us central command says airstrikes in iraq and syria have killed at least 64 civilians during the past year, more than doubling the number of civilian deaths since renewed operations began in 2014, reports the washington post. On wednesday, the department of defense released an official statement describing the review process and providing a list of deadly airstrikes. The figure of 64 is in addition to the government's previous estimate of 55, bringing the official number of civilians killed since 2014 to 119. Human rights groups say the actual figure is higher. \" sometimes civilians bear the brunt of military action, \" said centcom spokesman col. John j. Thomas. \" but we do all we can to minimize those occurrences, even at the cost of sometimes missing the chance to strike valid targets in real time. \" the military undertook its review of the air campaign after rights groups accused the us of a low count over the summer. As pressure built, centcom re-examined 257 airstrikes and determined that at least 31 resulted in accidental collateral damage, reports the new york times.",

A survey using electrical resistance technology has not only confirmed the existence of a tunnel running out the southern end of the teotihuacan's 140-foot-tall pyramid of the moon, but also uncovered a chamber connected to it, reports fox news. Possibly used by the toltec peoples for funerals and other rituals, the hidden room is 26 feet beneath the pre-aztec pyramid 30 miles northeast of mexico city and stretches some 50 feet across. Like the tunnel, however, it has yet to be explored. As human remains, necklaces, and other apparent offerings were found inside the pyramid in the 1980s, \" it is not difficult to think that something similar could be found in the subsoil, \" archaeologist verónica ortega says in a release, translated from spanish, per science alert. It's also believed a second tunnel awaits discovery. Archaeologists think its entrance may lie to the east of the pyramid, and they began searching that area earlier this month. The tunnel system as a whole is likely tied to a belief in the underworld: ortega previously noted the discovery of funerary items would show the pyramid functioned, at least in part, \" to emulate the underworld. \" ( tunnels beneath a mayan pyramid served a different purpose. )",

        "summary": "She had a doctor's note, but disney didn't budge. Cbs news and the miami herald report 22-year-old emily jackson of st. Louis and her family of 10 showed up last week in miami to board the disney magic cruise ship, but there was a problem: jackson is 25 weeks pregnant, and disney's policy bars women 24 weeks or more from sailing. Even though jackson's group got onto the ship and on line to check in, her gestational status raised eyebrows with crew members as she filled out paperwork — and she was told she couldn't go on the cruise, a disney rep says, per kmov. Jackson says her doctor cleared her to sail, but disney cites \" health and safety reasons \" for not allowing women over the 24-week limit and notes on its site that \" neither a doctor's medical statement nor a waiver of liability will be accepted. \" it adds that other cruise lines have similar mandates in place. Jackson says she's not mad about the policy, but about how she and her family were treated afterward, per the new york post. She says a security guard with an ar-15 intimidated her family, and that they had to wait outdoors in the sweltering miami heat while their luggage was retrieved. \" they used guns to escort my children and i off, \" she tweeted friday, along with a video showing snippets of her family in the aftermath. A disney rep explains port guards are miami-dade cops whose gear happens to include semi-automatic rifles. Jackson said disney is giving refunds for the cruise, but not for the plane tickets she and her family bought to get there — leading to a \" terrible disney experience, \" per cbs. She's also experiencing a bit of guilt. \" i felt so bad because i felt like it was my fault that everybody couldn't go, \" she tells kmov.

        "summary": "The trump administration is looking to dismantle obama-era rules that made it more difficult to hunt on federal lands, including through the banning of bacon, honey, and doughnuts as bear bait. The 2015 rule also barred the use of dogs to hunt bears, spotlights to shoot bear cubs in dens, motorboats to hunt swimming caribou, and trapping of gray wolves and pups during the denning season, report reuters and cnn. The alaska professional hunters association argues \" this was a case of the federal government overstepping and trying to usurp the state's authority to manage its wildlife, \" per the bbc. And the national park service apparently agrees, proposing monday to reinstate the \" harvest practices that are otherwise permitted by the state of alaska \" after an environmental assessment is carried out. While the public has until july 23 to comment on the proposal, environmentalists are already voicing their opposition. It's \" outrageous \" that interior secretary ryan zinke — who keeps a taxidermied bear in his office, per nbc news — has directed a \" return to these shameful and unethical practices, \" the national parks conservation association says. A lawyer for the humane society even argues the \" misguided attempt to increase trophy hunting opportunities \" is unlawful, nbc notes. Use of bear bait was first allowed in alaska in 2005 in an effort to boost populations of prey animals, like moose. The nps under the obama administration considered the method unsafe and at odds with a natural predator-prey dynamic. Under the new plan, alaska's department of fish and game would decide which hunting methods to permit, per reuters.",

Reuters/dominick reuter philadelphia accident investigators will interview survivors of a construction crew on tuesday to determine why a backhoe occupied the same track as an amtrak train that slammed into the heavy equipment, killing two people and sending 35 others to hospital. Sunday's accident in the philadelphia suburb of chester occurred about 20 miles ( 30 km ) south of another deadly amtrak derailment in may that killed eight people and injured 43. Passengers described feeling a jolt and then seeing a fireball. National transportation safety board investigator ryan frigo told reporters on monday that experts have reviewed video taken from the front of the train that captured the impact and have recovered amtrak's audio recordings.

        "summary": "A ferrari crash in china that happened back in march is getting fresh attention now that it turns out it could have an impact on the country's political leadership transition. The crash was insane even without any political tie-in: the black ferrari 458 spider — purchased for nearly $ 1 million — was going so fast it split in half upon impact with a bridge in beijing at 4am; reports conflict on whether the young man driving was killed on impact; with him in the car were two women, both of whom were seriously injured; and all three were in various states of undress — meaning, as one website run by a chinese émigré spells out, that they may have been \" engaged in sex games \" at the time. Then, reports emerged that information about the crash had been quickly deleted, and signs of a cover-up began to emerge. This weekend, a chinese newspaper reported that the driver was ling gu, the 23-year-old son of ling jihua — who just so happens to be the closest adviser to departing chinese president hu jintao. Or at least he was: also this weekend, the elder ling was demoted, apparently as a consequence of the crash and the possible cover-up. Ling may have wanted to cover up the crash because of the questions it would raise about how the son of a communist party official was able to afford such a pricey car, not to mention questions about the passengers — who were reportedly tibetans. Now, the big question is how this will affect what was supposed to be a perfectly choreographed transition from hu to the next president, xi jinping. Time and the new york times have more on that; business insider has a good roundup of coverage of the crash.",

Police say michelle carter egged on friend conrad roy to kill himself — even when he seemed to change his mind at the last minute — because she wanted the sympathy and attention of others, reports the sun chronicle of attleboro, mass. The 18-year-old has been charged with involuntary manslaughter. Roy's text messages show he was in contact with carter right up until he died of carbon monoxide poisoning in his truck in a kmart parking lot. The toughest detail of all: prosecutors say carter told roy to get back in his truck when he had second thoughts. She was texting him at the same time she was texting other friends expressing worry that he was missing. The boston globe has one example: \"i ' m losing all hope that he's even alive, \" she texted a friend. Then she texted roy, \"let me know when you're gonna do it. \" two months after his death, police say that carter texted a friend to say that she had ordered him back into his truck. \"i knew he would do it all over again the next day, and i couldn't have him live the way he was living anymore, \" she wrote. \"i couldn't do it. I wouldn't let him. \" an attorney for carter tells the standard-times of new bedford that prosecutors are \" cherry picking \" texts to present a misleading narrative. Roy, 18, suffered from depression and had attempted suicide before. \" it was his voluntary decision, \" says the attorney. \" it was not caused by michelle carter. \" in one of his final texts to her, roy wrote, \" i love you, btw. \" ( in california, a mother is suing target over her son's suicide. )",

        "summary": "It feels like something out of a sci-fi movie — a luxury car that can drive itself 550 miles, from silicon valley to las vegas. But this is not a movie: over two days, an audi a7 sportback ( nicknamed \" jack \" ) made the trip with little human help, its journey aided by gps and radar sensors that feed data to an onboard computer. This system ensures the car changes lanes, overtakes vehicles, and accelerates, steers, and brakes safely, cnet explains. The car isn't completely independent, though — the autopilot only works up to 70mph and doesn't function in urban areas, reports popular mechanics. When a human needs to take the wheel, the car lets off a warning; if there's no response, it pulls over to the shoulder and comes to a stop with flashers on. Jack's journey was completed last night, according to business insider. However, there's bound to be debate about this \" piloted driving \" technology breeding even more inattentive drivers, notes cnbc, and state regulators need to get on board before such cars become mainstream. But industry insiders say the public is ready. \" why not? if it can make driving on the highway safer and pay attention if you're not, a lot of people will find that appealing, \" one tells cnbc. And that's the point — to \" make driving safer, \" an audi engineer says. The a7's solo trip is part of the 2015 international consumer electronics show. You can see its journey on twitter @audi and the hashtag #drivingnotdriving.",

A neighbor called police after she found gir, a 30-year-old american miniature horse, lying in her yard in clackamas county last month. Police say a deputy fatally shot the horse after deciding it had been hit by a car, had two broken legs, and was unable to stand, according to katu — but owners crista and adam fitzgerald sent it to a veterinary lab for a second opinion and discovered it was in good health apart from arthritis and didn't have any broken bones. \" it wasn't that gir couldn't stand up, it was probably that he didn't want to, \" adam fitzgerald tells the portland tribune. \" he was a stubborn horse. We were late getting out to the barn that day, and he didn't get his pain medication. \" police say the deputy called his supervisor and a veterinarian before deciding to euthanize the horse, but the vet tells katu that the officer rejected his offer of assistance and said he would \" take care of the problem on his own. \" authorities also say the deputy called the humane society first, but the oregon humane society says it never got a call. \" this whole situation is messed up, \" fitzgerald tells the tribune, saying that since there are thousands of horses in the area, police should have more training in handling these situations. Gir, he says, \" was a well-loved pony, a member of the family, \" and had been passed down from his older daughter to his younger daughter. Thursday, the county sheriff apologized to the family, admitted a mistake had been made, and said his office is \" exploring ways to make this as right as we can, \" komo reports.

He was 92. Kelly started out in an artistic us army unit in france during world war ii, designing camouflage patterns and creating fake tanks to deceive the germans about the size of allied forces, npr reports. After the war, he returned to paris to study art under the gi bill, creating what vulture calls a \" uniquely american study of abstraction, form, and color \" despite his distance from us contemporaries. In the ' 50s, he returned to new york, where art historian sarah rich tells npr he was put off by the \" corny expressionism and epic self-importance \" of other leading abstract painters. Kelly told the new york times in 1996 that he started out painting things like patterns seen on sidewalk grates before moving to purely abstract paintings. \" i wondered, ' can i make a painting with just five panels of color in a row? ' \" he said. \" i loved it, but i didn't think the world would. They'd think, ' it's not enough. ' \" his reputation grew over the decades as his style continued to evolve, and his paintings and sculptures can now be found in almost every major museum of modern art, npr notes. He also created many public installations over the years, including a stirring installation at the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington. ( this year, we also lost a beloved fantasy author and an opera singer nicknamed \" god's tenor. \" )",

Kim is an ex-spy chief who was personally sanctioned by the us after the sony hack and the 2010 torpedoing of a south korean warship that killed 46 on board. This development may be part of what the wall street journal calls the \" mad dash \" to revive the summit, which also included postponing a new round of sanctions against the north, per a us official. Kim yong chol's visit would also follow the surprise meeting over the weekend between kim jong un and south korean leader moon jae-in, who apparently discussed the us-north korea summit.

They are michigan department of health and human services director nick lyon — the highest-ranking official to be charged in the water crisis so far, per the detroit news — former flint emergency manager darnell earley, former city of flint water department manager howard croft, plus michigan department of environmental quality's drinking water chief liane shekter-smith and water supervisor stephen busch. Twelve people died after the city's water supply was changed to the flint river in april 2014 and there was an outbreak of legionnaires'disease. Prosecutors allege that lyon knew about the outbreak by at least jan. 28, 2015, yet did not make the news public until a year later; he is charged with causing the dec. 13, 2015, death of robert skidmore. All of the involuntary manslaughter charges are linked to skidmore's death; the 85-year-old died after many cases of legionnaires'disease had been diagnosed, but the public still had not been notified of the outbreak. Lyon is also charged with misconduct in office for allegedly telling an official to halt an analysis that would have helped figure out what caused the outbreak, the detroit free press reports. Also wednesday, chief medical executive dr. Eden wells was charged with obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer; she is accused of giving false testimony to a special agent, lying to a peace officer about when she knew of the outbreak, and threatening to withhold funding for the flint area community health and environment partnership if it did not stop investigating the outbreak. Flint residents are still advised to use a filter if they plan to drink the city's tap water, and many use bottled water instead, which is distributed for free in the city.",

The fact is, the us is embarrassingly behind on the issue. But a few policy changes could make a big difference: paid sick and family leave should be required by law. We're the only developed country in the world that doesn't require paid maternity leave. Nor do we have laws covering time off to care for the elderly, or for our own sick days. Let's require employers to provide paid vacation days. Again, we're pretty much the only developed country that doesn't mandate them. British workers get five weeks; germans a month. Time off can actually increase productivity, helping workers refresh. We need universal, affordable public daycare for our kids, preventing a false choice between bringing home cash and raising children. In-office daycare facilities are a good start.

It was an era when many were doing fieldwork and not rocket science, thus a near-constant low-level buzz wasn't considered particularly damaging. But being americans, we took things too far, going from an annual average consumption of 5.8 gallons of pure alcohol per person in 1790 to 7.1 gallons in 1830 ( consider that modern americans tipple 2.3 gallons a year ), which eventually triggered prohibition. The exhibit also features a section on alcohol and the presidency, notes dcist, from fdr's penchant for taking a break from running the nation with a decidedly strong cocktail to betty ford's struggles with alcoholism.

Pierre konowaloff in 2008 learned that \" night cafe, \" a vincent van gogh painting worth $ 200 million, had for almost five decades been hanging in a gallery at yale university. Before that, it was in the hands stephen clark, heir to the singer sewing machine fortune, who in 1933 bought it from the soviets and bequeathed it to yale. How the soviets acquired it lay at the heart of his court case, which reached its end on monday. Konowaloff's great-grandfather was a wealthy russian whose travels to paris facilitated the acquisition of an art collection that gained \" worldwide renown, \" as the washington post puts it. In december 1918, bolshevik secret police took it all. Konowaloff wanted the van gogh back and has been challenging yale for years, without success. Bloomberg explains the legal barrier: a new york federal appeals court pointed to the \" act of state \" doctrine, which basically means american courts won't \" second-guess \" a foreign government's decision to seize its citizens ' property. The moscow times reports the doctrine was applied to this case, even though the us government didn't acknowledge vladimir lenin's government; recognition of the soviets came in 1933, when the painting was sold to clark. In his petition to the supreme court, konowaloff changed gears, now arguing yale's ownership was \" derived from a theft, \" this stemming from his legal team's inability to find a record proving the van gogh's legal sale to clark. The supreme court turned away the appeal without comment. ( is another woman's smile behind the mona lisa's smile? )",

Supreme court turned away an appeal from a man who says the bolsheviks seized the painting from his great-grandfather after the 1917 soviet revolution. Pierre konowaloff has been trying to recoup \"the night café \" since he learned in 2008 that it was hanging in the yale art gallery. His great-grandfather, ivan morozov, had the painting for 10 years before the bolshevik secret police occupied his house and seized his art collection in 1918. The soviet government sold the painting in 1933 to stephen clark, a new york resident and heir to the singer manufacturing co. Fortune, and he bequeathed it to yale in 1960. In siding with yale, a federal appeals court in new york cited the \"act of state \" doctrine, under which u.s. Courts generally won't second-guess a property seizure by a foreign government. The appeals court earlier ruled against konowaloff in a similar dispute with the metropolitan museum of art in new york over a paul cezanne painting. The case is konowaloff v. Yale, 15-921.",

It is a legal battle that drags up soviet nationalization policies, allegations of black market dealings and international property rights. Now, it could also involve the supreme court. The claim has been brought by the heir to one of pre-revolutionary russia's greatest art collectors. At the heart of the legal battle is vincent van gogh's \"the night café, \" a vibrant depiction of vagrants and prostitutes killing time in a french dive bar.

            "Yale university can keep a vincent van gogh masterpiece after the u.s. Supreme court turned away an appeal from a man who says the bolsheviks seized the painting from his great-grandfather after the 1917 soviet revolution. Pierre konowaloff has been trying to recoup \"the night café \" since he learned in 2008 that it was hanging in the yale art gallery. His great-grandfather, ivan morozov, had the painting for 10 years before the bolshevik secret police occupied his house and seized his art collection in 1918. The soviet government sold the painting in 1933 to stephen clark, a new york resident and heir to the singer manufacturing co. Fortune, and he bequeathed it to yale in 1960. In siding with yale, a federal appeals court in new york cited the \"act of state \" doctrine, under which u.s. Courts generally won't second-guess a property seizure by a foreign government. The appeals court earlier ruled against konowaloff in a similar dispute with the metropolitan museum of art in new york over a paul cezanne painting. The case is konowaloff v. Yale, 15-921.",
            "Yale university art gallery \"the night cafe \" by van gogh depicts vagrants and prostitutes. It has been in the possession of the yale university art gallery since 1961. It is a legal battle that drags up soviet nationalization policies, allegations of black market dealings and international property rights. Now, it could also involve the supreme court. The claim has been brought by the heir to one of pre-revolutionary russia's greatest art collectors. At the heart of the legal battle is vincent van gogh's \"the night café, \" a vibrant depiction of vagrants and prostitutes killing time in a french dive bar.

The lifetime ban wouldn't necessarily stick, and sources say the mlb is trying to avoid the hassle of an inevitable appeal by a-rod, whose lawyers have previously said they will fight any discipline. The suspension deal being considered could be close to a full season.

If he is disciplined under the joint drug agreement, his penalty is put on hold until after an arbitrator's ruling. But a source says the mlb may instead attempt to punish him under the labor contract, which would prevent him from playing. That threat might be enough to force his team to agree to a settlement, the details of which could be announced as soon as today.",

Two of the teens from greenwich, conn., were in an inner tube being pulled by the other two teens in a boat on the long island sound. According to some reports, the two girls apparently fell out of the tube and as the boat circled back to retrieve them, they were somehow struck by the propeller, the new york times reports. Others, including the greenwich time, say the boat stopped suddenly and the tube didn't. \" what exactly the maneuvers were, i couldn't tell you at this point, \" a police lieutenant tells abc 7. \" the girls were dislodged from the tube, and unfortunately, they became entangled in the prop of the vessel. \" the two uninjured girls pulled their friends into the boat, and emergency workers met them when they docked at a nearby yacht club. \" our launch driver heard the screams, so he went out to investigate and found the girls in the water, \" says the club's commodore. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. \" sabrina had to pull her friend's dead body out of the water, \" says the father of one of the girls, age 15, who was in the boat. \" this would've been tough for a combat soldier, you know? these are teenaged girls. \" neither of the victims has yet been named by police; the girl who survived had surgery for an injured leg and seems to be \" doing well, \" according to the lieutenant. No charges have been filed, though police are still investigating; they say alcohol was not a factor, wfsb reports. \" it was a beautiful day — perfect conditions, \" says the town's harbor master. \" then out of the blue, something horrific happened. \" ( in florida, a 15-year-old girl received a traumatic brain injury in a freak \" sumo suit \" accident. )",

        "summary": "\" it's so cute \" is not a typical reaction upon finding a 50,000-year-old dead animal, yet it's hard to argue with paleontologist grant zazula's assessment. With pristine muscle, skin, and fur, the complete mummified wolf pup, believed to have died around eight weeks old, looks as though it's resting. In a sense, it had been until it was unearthed in yukon, canada, in the summer of 2016. It was actually the second such discovery by gold miners near dawson city. A month earlier, on property owned by gold rush star tony beets, the well-preserved front half of a caribou calf was discovered in an area home to an 80,000-year-old ash bed, left behind from ice age volcanoes. With both specimens carbon-dated to more than 50,000 years ago, \" we think this is some of the oldest mummified soft tissue in the entire world, \" zazula tells the cbc. The \" spectacular \" pup is also thought to be the only mummified ice age wolf ever found, according to a release. \" it's got the cute little paws and tail and the curled upper lip showing its teeth, \" zazula tells the canadian press. \" once in a while we find remains of ice-age voles or squirrels, \" he adds. \" this is very, very rare. \" looking for clues about the animals'diets and ancient environment, researchers plan to do genetic testing on the \" world-class \" specimens, which have \" garnered a great deal of international scientific interest, \" per the release. But the public can study them, too. Accepted by the canadian conservation institute, the remains will be displayed in dawson city until the end of september. They will then be moved to yukon's capital of whitehorse for viewing. ( in utah, property owners found an ice age-era horse. )",

Turkey has floated the idea of a \" safe zone \" to be set up for civilians under foreign protection as fighting has intensified in a 17-month-old uprising against president bashar al-assad. Up to 5,000 refugees a day have been crossing into turkey over the past two weeks while the pace of refugees arriving at a camp in northern jordan has doubled, heralding what could be a much bigger movement there, the u.n. Refugee agency said. Although there is no sign divided world powers are ready to back a buffer and no-fly zone, as rebels and aid organizations would like, u.n. Security council foreign ministers are expected to discuss the idea at a meeting on thursday. While turkey could in theory create a buffer zone itself, it has said it is reluctant to go it alone. Already hosting more than 80,000 refugees, turkey has warned it could run out of space if the number goes above 100,000. \" we are already looking at potentially up to 200,000 and are working with the turkish government to make the necessary plans, \" sybella wilkes, spokeswoman of the u.n.

These trapped lactic acids would kill the fish in minutes were it not for an evolutionary trait that allows them to convert the acids into alcohol, which is then released through their gills. And the alcohol levels recorded in the fish go higher the longer the freezing conditions hold. Paper co-author michael berenbrink says the fish can obtain blood alcohol levels that exceed the driving limit in european countries like scotland. \" so they are really ' under the influence ', \" he quips. Per the bbc, the researchers did a side experiment for fun to see how long it would take for the fish to expel enough alcohol to make a drink. \" if you put them in a beer glass and closed them off, it would take 200 days to get it up to 4 %, \" says berenbrink. But this doesn't make a case for fish becoming our new drinking companions. \" i don't want to encourage anyone to put their goldfish into a fridge, \" berenbrink told gizmodo.

        "summary": "This may not surprise those familiar with the decidedly nsfw honey badger: when a group of biologists at the university of utah set out to study the behaviors of scavengers in the great basin desert, they scattered the carcasses of seven calves in utah's grassy mountains and figured their camera traps were about to document vultures and other avian predators, reports phys.org. A week later, researcher evan buechley went out to check the carcasses in person and was disappointed to discover that one was missing altogether. He figured a mountain lion or coyote had run off with it. \" oh well, we've lost one after a week, \" he says he thought. Then he noticed the earth where he'd left the calf was disturbed, downloaded the camera's footage, and was amazed to discover that a badger had spent five days completely burying the 50-pound carcass. As the researchers report in the journal west north american naturalist, the badger spent two weeks intermittently stopping by to check on his prize and feast. Burying the calf achieved two goals: it kept it away from other scavengers while preserving it. Some footage shows the badger sitting lazily on top of the burrow. \" not to anthropomorphize too much, but he looks like a really, really happy badger, rolling in the dirt and living the high life, \" buechley says. There is one account of a related mustelid ( think weasels, wolverines, and martens ) burying a black bear carcass under branches, but this is the first time a badger has been seen burying a creature well over its own weight, though another badger in the same study attempted to do the same. Not only is it an \" industrious \" feat, per gizmodo, but a reminder how little is known about the \" enigmatic \" badger, as one of the researchers puts it.

The guardian reports what seems to be the most definitive update on his whereabouts, and it's pretty vague: \" it is thought he is now in a safe house, \" writes ewen macaskill. No word on where that \" safe house \" is located, but bloomberg picks up a report from a hong kong paper whose sources say the immigration department has no record of him leaving the city. A further sign he's still in the city: another hong kong-based paper today reported that snowden is attempting to solicit help from human rights organizations and lawyers in the city, though the hong kong human rights monitor says it has had no contact with him. Perhaps why he's seeking legal help: should the doj charge snowden as expected, time explains he could then make an asylum claim ( absent such charges, he can't file such a claim until his 90-day tourist visa expires in mid-august ). But things could get much more complicated from there thanks to the \" one country, two systems \" reality of china-hong kong. Time explains how beijing could get involved in the legal maneuvering.",

Authorities say he is among the biggest sexual predators in british history, adds the bbc. Police say 450 victims, most of them children at the time of the abuse, have come forward. Savile committed at least 214 offenses, including 34 rapes, over some 50 years. They occurred from 1955 to 2009, but most took place when savile was in his 40s. The number is expected to rise. Locations of the crimes included 14 hospitals, a cancer hospice, schools, and a facility for troubled girls. Police say savile traded on his fame and sought the most vulnerable victims. The youngest was an 8-year-old boy, but most were between 13 and 16. \" he could do anything he wanted, \" said detective supt.

Authorities said all three were murdered there, though they did not say how, and that the tree-trimmer, matthew hoffman, gave investigators information through his attorneys that led them to the bodies in woods in central ohio. \" the tragedy today is just devastating, \" said knox county prosecutor john thatcher. \" the results aren't what we wanted them to be. \" knox county sheriff david barber said part of the tree had to be cut away to remove the remains. \" the tree was hollow to a point, \" the sheriff said, adding it would be speculation to understand how the remains were put into the tree.

What amazed them in particular was that the ancient water wasn't trapped in rock: it was free-flowing — gallons of it. \" it's very much bubbling right up out at you, \" says team co-leader barbara sherwood lollar, per gizmodo. The team reported its findings in nature and last week to the american geophysical union. A chemical analysis of the gases revealed the water's age, and that it contains about eight times the salt of seawater. If sipped, it \" would taste absolutely disgusting, \" warr tells the cbc. In an intriguing twist, researchers say the prehistoric spring is part of an \" interconnected fluid system \" deep in the earth. When the earlier water was found in 2013, lollar called it \" a whole new hydrosphere on the planet, \" per the national post. Study of the microbes in the water could reveal clues to life 2 billion years ago on earth and other planets with similar water pockets such as mars. \" this continues to open up our idea of how much of this planet is habitable, \" lollar tells the globe and mail. \"and it speaks to the habitability of mars as well. \" ( these rocks are 3.7 billion years old. )",

For reasons not specified in the lawsuit, the wedding did not occur, even though bzura had posted on instagram just a week before the nuptials were supposed to take place, \" i can't wait to be your nagging and annoying jewish wife. You mean everything to me. \" on nov. 3, moss asked in a letter to bzura that the ring be returned, the new york post reports. She \" has willfully and maliciously refused, \" per the lawsuit moss then filed. Moss, who runs a pipe supply company, and bzura, an advertising professional, started dating in june 2012 and cohabitated for more than three years on the east side. They got engaged on nov. 7, 2015, which is when the square emerald-cut diamond engagement ring came into play. Moss's lawsuit calls for its return, or for bzura to pay him its cash value plus interest. The suit also calls for the court to determine additional punitive damages. As yahoo news reports, new york is a \" no-fault \" state when it comes to such matters, which likely means bzura will be required to return the ring even if she's not the one who called off the engagement.

        "summary": "Wolves killed 19 elk — 17 of them calves — in one night in what wyoming officials are calling a \" sport killing, \" usa today reports. \" they went crazy and just took down each elk and moved on to the next, \" the game and fish department's john lund says. Killing that many elk in one night is unusual for area wolves, who typically stick to one or two kills per night. According to the casper star-tribune, the carcasses of the elk herd were found at a feeding ground tuesday. Lund tells cnn officials are concerned because wolves usually eat their kills or at least come back to feed later. The carcasses have been left out incase the wolves do eventually come back, but that's unlikely as humans have now touched the carcasses. Ken mills, a biologist with the game and fish department, tells the star-tribune sport killings can be triggered by an increased vulnerability in prey, due to anything from snow to disease. \"they're like a person living day to day, getting enough to survive. When prey is vulnerable, they don't have that mechanism to stop, \" mills says. \"killing is how they survive. If someone is barely making it day to day and they walk into a buffet, they're going to eat like it's a buffet. \" lund estimates about 7 % of the area's 1,100 elk have been killed this winter — well above normal. That will likely have an impact on hunting season, but the state's hands are tied. Wolves, which are federally protected, can be legally killed if they're attacking livestock but not wild game.",

        "summary": "Dogfighting and cockfighting are illegal in the us, but until wednesday, coyotes could be shot dead for a belt buckle in california. Animal activists are celebrating the ruling by the california fish and game commission against wildlife-killing contests that offer prizes, said to be the first such ban in the country, the ap reports. According to the mandate, no one can shoot dead a coyote, fox, bobcat, or other predator for any kind of reward, though people can still shoot these animals as part of a regular hunting routine. \" contest kills \" involve competitors vying for cash or other prizes and \" treat these living animals as disposable game pieces, \" says the humane society. Many ranchers disagree: they blame the majority of their livestock deaths on coyotes, which the california cattlemen's association says number 700,000 in that state alone, per the san francisco chronicle. Encouraging such competitive hunts simply helps them manage the population, the ranchers contend. But conservationists say that management plan doesn't have science to back it up: when coyote pack leaders ( usually the only males that mate ) are killed, all the other males that don't usually breed step up to the plate and cause exponential population growth. Add that fact to the accidental killing of migrating wolves in the area ( wolves are often mistaken for coyotes ) and a game warden who was injured during a fox-and-coyote hunt on valentine's day to make the activity unconscionable to activists. \" killing coyotes or any wild animal as part of a contest or tournament is ethically indefensible, ecologically reckless, and counter to sound science, \" the executive director of project coyote tells the chronicle.",

        "summary": "A 75-year-old widow in tough financial straits reached out to nasa about selling a speck of moon rock her late husband had given her. Joann davis then became the target of a sting operation at a denny's that a federal appeals court suggested thursday was outrageous overkill. The lead agent \" organized a sting operation involving six armed officers to forcibly seize a lucite paperweight containing a moon rock the size of a rice grain from an elderly grandmother, \" wrote judge sidney thomas of the 9th us circuit court of appeals in the decision allowing davis to sue, per the los angeles times. One awful detail from the 2011 incident: the agents refused davis'request to use the bathroom, and she urinated in her pants during the two-hour ordeal at the restaurant in lake elsinore, calif. Agents also forcibly restrained her second husband, who had accompanied her to the supposed sale. Davis ' first husband, robert, worked as an apollo 11 engineer, and he saved a paperweight with moon material and another with a bit of the heat shield. He died in 1986, and years later davis found herself raising grandchildren in her 70s following her daughter's death and her son's illness. She called nasa about selling the mementos. Instead of informing her that selling moon material was illegal, investigators ordered the sting, reports the san francisco chronicle. A federal prosecutor later opted not to press charges. In this week's ruling, the judges said davis made a case that the detention violated her constitutional right regarding unreasonable seizure. She is suing agent norman conley, who \" had no law enforcement interest in detaining davis for two hours while she stood wearing urine-soaked pants in a restaurant's parking lot during the lunch rush, \" wrote thomas.

Why? \" answer: \" because i don't love you anymore. \" that's just one example of the heartbreaking and heartbreakingly awkward posts shared on the latest tumblr craze: the last message received, reports mashable. Curated by 15-year-old emily trunko, the tumblr serves as a way for people to share final texts sent from exes, former besties, and love ones who've passed away. Emily, who also runs a tumblr where people post anonymous letters, says the last message blossomed out of her fascination \" with glimpses into the lives of other people, \" per buzzfeed. \" i thought that the last message sent before a breakup or before someone passed away would be really poignant. \" she was right. One user posts the last words from her grandmother, who she says died hours later during heart surgery: \" don't worry. I ' ll be ok. Love you more, \" per hello giggles. A text from a 22-year-old who was later hit by a drunk driver reads: \" i ' m not gonna drive drunk. I promise. I ' ll talk to you later, love. \" the last message isn't entirely depressing, though. People also use it as a place to vent. After sharing a last text from his or her apparently less-than-admirable father, one user writes, \" you aren't a father. You are a poor excuse for a man and a human being. \" emily says the tumblr has inspired her to communicate with others differently. \" every message i send to them could be the last one i ever exchange, and every message i receive could be the last one i receive, \" she says.

The blowback came from far and wide after the league's announcement, with critics arguing that rice's light suspension illustrated a lack of respect for women in general and for victims of domestic violence in particular. But the outcry had another ripple effect. It made targets of female media members who voiced their opinions on twitter. While the nfl's treatment of rice demonstrated a lack of justice, common sense and compassion, the week since his suspension has underscored one truth as starkly as ever: on social media, women in the sports news business",

The earth itself, after all, is 4.5 billion years old, the sydney morning herald notes. \" nothing in science goes without being questioned, \" geochemist john valley tells npr. Now, however, his team has proven the crystals ' age is correct — in other words, they're the oldest earth-formed materials ever found. Researchers dated the crystals, which need magnification to be seen, by investigating how much of the uranium within them had turned into lead. But that standard dating method wasn't enough to convince some fellow scientists. Doubters pointed out that as time went by, lead atoms could have shifted around inside the crystal, potentially resulting in inaccurate readings. So the experts turned to a process called atom-probe tomography, which allowed them to map out specific atoms, npr reports. The study showed that, in fact, the atoms hadn't moved much. Now, \" we've proved that the chemical record inside these zircons is trustworthy, \" valley tells livescience. The findings indicate that the earth may have been able to host life earlier than had been believed: \" there is no reason why life could not have existed on earth 4.3 billion years ago, \" valley says.",
