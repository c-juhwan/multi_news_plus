The country's 50 nuclear reactors were shut down after the disaster and only two have reopened since, but prime minister shinzo abe is continuing his push to restart them after safety checks, the bbc reports. At fukushima, thousands of workers are still decontaminating and decommissioning the plant, a process expected to take up to 40 years.",

A putin spokesman told a russian radio station that the president is fine, just extremely busy, and his handshake is still firm enough to \" break hands, \" the guardian reports. After the story broke, reuters notes, russian state tv aired what it claims is footage of putin at his residence today, looking \" in no way different from usual. \" \" there is absolutely no reason for any doubts about the state of his health, \" a kremlin spokesman tells the ap. \" his health is really perfect, everything is ok with him, and he's working in accordance with his traditionally overloaded working schedule. \" some speculate that putin is recovering from plastic surgery, while others say that putin is feuding with security services over the murder of boris nemtsov, according to amanda taub at vox, who argues that the real sickness seems to be in the russian state, where power has become very centralized around putin with no clear successor.

The calbuco volcano erupted yesterday for the first time in almost 43 years, spurring the evacuation of 1,500 people who live in the nearby town of ensenada; the capital of santiago sits 620 miles away. Al jazeera reports a second eruption followed the first, and observes that the ash cloud turned a stunning shade of red at sunset; reuters adds that lightning bolts intermittently flashed through it. Of chile's 90 active volcanoes, the 6,500-foot calbuco makes the top three in terms of danger, but this unexpected eruption seems not to have brought calamity: no hot rocks or lava had been seen by late yesterday, and no injuries or missing persons were reported. Still, the government is reacting: water is being taken to the area in case resources get contaminated by ash, and police and military officers had been deployed to ensure safety and help with evacuations. \" for us it was a surprise, \" says alejandro verges, regional emergency director of the los lagos region where the eruption took place.

The volcano, which last had a major eruption in 1961, has belched a spectacular plume of ash and smoke around 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) into the sky near the popular tourist town of puerto varas, some 1,000 kilometers ( 625 miles ) south of santiago. Calbuco erupted twice over the last 24 hours and has now paused, but it remains unstable and could erupt again, experts said. Winds have already carried part of the ash cloud to the city of chillan, some 400 kilometers south of santiago, and could reach the capital by the end of the day, said government meteorologist arnoldo zuniga.

            "Beirut eight rebel fighters have been crucified in syria by the islamic state in iraq and the levant ( isil ) because they were considered too moderate, a monitoring group said on sunday. The syrian observatory for human rights, which relies on contacts on the ground in syria, said the men were crucified on saturday in aleppo province. It added that their corpses were still on view. The observatory said clashes between rival islamist groups in syria had killed around 7,000 people since january, as militants from isil try to strengthen their grip on territory. The infighting has complicated the insurgency and drawn in foreign fighters. Isil, a radical al qaeda offshoot group, has captured areas on both sides of the iraqi-syrian border after seizing the iraqi city of mosul on june 10 and sweeping towards baghdad. In syria, isil has battled with groups such as the nusra front, al qaeda's official syrian wing, in the uprising against president bashar al-assad which started with pro-democracy protests but has descended into civil war. The observatory, an anti-assad group which tracks the violence, said the vast majority were killed in explosions, including car bombings and suicide attacks. It monitored the infighting in seven provinces. It said isil had executed the eight men in aleppo province for belonging to more moderate groups. The men were crucified in the town",

            "Beirut eight rebel fighters have been crucified in syria by the islamic state in iraq and the levant ( isil ) because they were considered too moderate, a monitoring group said on sunday. The syrian observatory for human rights, which relies on contacts on the ground in syria, said the men were crucified on saturday in aleppo province. It added that their corpses were still on view. The observatory said clashes between rival islamist groups in syria had killed around 7,000 people since january, as militants from isil try to strengthen their grip on territory. The infighting has complicated the insurgency and drawn in foreign fighters. Isil, a radical al qaeda offshoot group, has captured areas on both sides of the iraqi-syrian border after seizing the iraqi city of mosul on june 10 and sweeping towards baghdad. In syria, isil has battled with groups such as the nusra front, al qaeda's official syrian wing, in the uprising against president bashar al-assad which started with pro-democracy protests but has descended into civil war. The observatory, an anti-assad group which tracks the violence, said the vast majority were killed in explosions, including car bombings and suicide attacks. It monitored the infighting in seven provinces. It said isil had executed the eight men in aleppo province for belonging to more moderate groups. The men were crucified in the town",

De ' andre harris tells the los angeles times that around five white nationalist marchers singled him out from other counter-protesters and chased him into a parking garage, where they beat him with poles. The garage was near the city's police department, and harris says a group of officers yards away did not try to stop the violence. \" they were trying to kill me out there, \" harris says. \" the police didn't budge, and i was getting beat to a pulp. \" harris, who is black, says he had written anti-kkk and anti-police messages on a towel around his neck. Harris, a 20-year-old charlottesville resident who works as an assistant special education teacher, says he needed eight staples in his head after the attack and also has a broken wrist and a chipped tooth. He says he was saved by friends who came to his aid. Photographer zach d. Roberts says one police officer also eventually helped, preventing attackers from following harris into a stairwell. Harris says his mother is considering a lawsuit — and he still doesn't understand why the rally was allowed to take place. \" i think for them to be allowed to come here and protest is really crazy. How do you expect the kkk to come to your city to protest, and them not be violent? \" he tells the root.",

But a theory floated by rachel maddow last night on msnbc is getting plenty of buzz today as an alternative. The real target, she suggests, might have been the leader of new jersey's democrats in the senate, loretta weinberg, who, yes, represents fort lee. Why? it all stems from a nasty feud between christie and state democrats over judicial appointments. This nastiness started in 2010 — when christie ticked off democrats by taking the unprecedented step of not reappointing a state supreme court justice — but flash forward to aug. 12, 2013. Knowing that democrats were going to exact revenge by tanking his reappointment of a gop judge, christie withdrew the judge's name and called a news conference to blast democrats. He was seething. As maddow points out, the notorious \" time for some traffic in fort lee \" message went out early the next morning. Was weinberg the target? \"until someone who knows the actual truth about this speaks, it remains a wide-open question, \" said maddow. Mediaite finds the theory \" plausible, \" while brad friedman at salon writes that it's \" smart, good reporting, might make more'sense ' out of this entire matter, and is certainly worthy of further inquiry. \" either way, be sure to check out the coming new yorker cover of christie playing in traffic.",

        "summary": "Toyota's scion brand has been \" euthanized, \" as jalopnik puts it, with the car manufacturer announcing wednesday the division will be killed, per a toyota press release. The brand will be phased out, and existing models — including the my17, fr-s sports car, ia sedan, im hatchback, and c-hr concept car — will be folded into the toyota lineup. The tc sports coupe will cease production entirely in august. \" this isn't a step backward for scion; it's a leap forward for toyota, \" says james lentz, toyota motor north america's ceo and one of scion's founders. Jalopnik notes the timing seems a \" bit strange, \" since two new scion models are right now cruising into dealerships, but lentz suggests the company simply did everything it wanted to do with the scion, which started off as its own brand in 2003. \" our goal was to make toyota and our dealers stronger by learning how to better attract and engage young customers … [ and ] that's exactly what we have accomplished, \" he says. Usa today notes that goal was indeed achieved — in some respects. The average age of a scion purchaser was 36 — which the wall street journal notes is almost 20 years younger than the average new car-buyer — and 70 % of scion buyers had never bought a toyota before. But the brand was hampered by design problems and a limited number of models, among other issues, and sales started dropping after its 2006 peak: for comparison purposes, cnet points out that 56,000 scions were sold in all of 2015 — which equals about two months ' worth of camry sales. \" i just think the product was never really as compelling as it could have been or should have been, \" a kelley blue book analyst says. No ( publicly admitted ) regrets from toyota, though. \" scion has allowed us to fast-track ideas that would have been challenging to test through the toyota network, \" lentz says.

( associated press ) file - in this july 13, 1985 file photo, led zeppelin bandmates, singer robert plant, left, and guitarist jimmy page, reunite to perform for the live aid famine relief concert at jfk stadium in philadelphia. A u.s. Appeals court on friday, sept. 28, 2018, ordered a new trial in a lawsuit accusing led... ( associated press ) san francisco ( ap ) — a u.s. Appeals court on friday ordered a new trial in a lawsuit accusing led zeppelin of copying an obscure 1960s instrumental for the intro to its classic 1971 rock anthem \" stairway to heaven. \" a federal court jury in los angeles two years ago found led zeppelin did not steal the famous riff from the song \" taurus \" by the band spirit. But a three-judge panel of the 9th u.s. Circuit court of appeals in san francisco ruled unanimously that the lower court judge provided erroneous jury instructions that misled jurors about copyright law central to the suit. It sent the case back to the court for another trial. A phone message left with an attorney for led zeppelin, peter anderson, was not immediately returned. Michael skidmore, a trustee for the estate of late spirit guitarist randy wolfe, filed the lawsuit against led zeppelin in 2015. Jurors returned their verdict for led zeppelin after a five-day trial at which band members jimmy page and robert plant testified. Page says he wrote the music and plant has claimed the lyrics, saying \" stairway \" was an original. In several hours of often-animated and amusing testimony, they described the craft behind one of rock's best-known songs. The jury found \" stairway to heaven \" and \" taurus \" were not substantially similar, according to the 9th circuit ruling. But it also said u.s. District judge r. Gary klausner failed to advise jurors that while individual elements of a song such as its notes or scale may not qualify for copyright protection, a combination of those elements may if it is sufficiently original, 9th circuit judge richard paez said. Wesley lewis, an attorney who handles copyright cases at the firm, haynes and boone, said that was an important copyright principle that could prompt jurors to think differently about the case. Klausner also wrongly told jurors that copyright does not protect chromatic scales, arpeggios or short sequences of three notes, the"

        "summary": "Major media outlets are identifying the slain gunman in the dallas attack as 25-year-old micah xavier johnson of mesquite, texas, near dallas. He told authorities in negotiations that he was an army veteran, unaffiliated with any group, and out to kill officers and white people after the recent spate of police shootings. Since then, the army has confirmed that johnson served a tour of duty in afghanistan as a soldier, reports the ap. The stories identifying him quote anonymous law enforcement authorities, and outlets including kxas-tv, the washington post, the los angeles times, and abc have the same name. ( a post at heavy.com has photos of a man believed to be johnson. ) cnn, meanwhile, reports that he's not believed to have a criminal record or ties to terror groups. Police were surrounding his home friday morning, and a neighbor tells cnn that johnson lived with his mother and mostly kept to himself. What remains unclear is whether only one gunman did the shooting that left five officers dead. While johnson was killed by a police robotic device, three other suspects remain in custody but are reportedly not cooperating with the investigation. Dallas police initially identified another man as a suspect and tweeted his photo, only to learn he was innocent. He was questioned and released.",

His widow, taya kyle, showed up nra world shooting champion bruce piatt at a charity shootout in pflugerville, texas, over the weekend, hitting 100 % of her shots on 29 targets using trackingpoint precision-guided firearms. Piatt was apparently at a disadvantage using military-grade rifles carried by us troops in combat and hit just 59 % of his shots amid explosions and simulated gunfire, per khou. Kyle tells fox news her late husband spoke with the creators of trackingpoint \" about what goes into making a shot at such long distances with such precision \" back in 2009. His insights helped shape the technology in trackpoint's weapons that \" does all the computations for you. \" kyle, who describes herself as \" absolutely a novice marksman, \" says she trained for a week with a former marine who taught her proper breathing techniques and how to take offhand, kneeling, and sitting shots. In one particularly impressive move, kyle poked her weapon and hands through a hole in a wall and shot blindly. However, she was wearing glasses that showed the view out the gun's scope. \" i could see what the scope was seeing, line up the shot, find the target, and take that shot without exposing any more of my body or face, \" she says. After the event — which raised $ 1 million for the chris kyle frog foundation, per the washington times — kyle said she was \" passionate about getting the trackingpoint guns into our warriors ' hands … they are willing to give their lives for us; the least we can do is give them our very best in that fight. \"",

Prosecutors believe that suspect john charlton murdered and dismembered the nurse in her renton, wash., home after they had been on a date last friday and then drove her vehicle to seattle, where he dumped her body parts in the recycling bin of a homeowner with no connection to the case, the seattle post-intelligencer reports. Charlton, who is being held on suspicion of murder, told police that he had been dating lyne for around a month, nbc reports. He has admitted they went out together on friday night, but says he got blackout drunk and slept on a sidewalk after lyne drove him to seattle. When he was arrested monday, police noticed bruises on his forehead and injuries to his face, chest, and left hand. According to court documents seen by the seattle times, lyne's ex-husband called her mother after he went to drop their three daughters off and discovered she wasn't home. The mother contacted charlton after discovering his number on lyne's phone, and he claimed he thought she was with her kids. Investigators found a 15-inch pruning saw along with blood and bits of flesh in lyne's bathroom, according to court documents. They also found a near-empty of box of trash bags identical to the ones the body parts were wrapped in. Investigators say charlton, 37, has an extensive criminal history in several states, including a 2006 carjacking in utah, for which he served 21 months in prison. Cbs reports that police say they are now investigating whether the suspect, who met lyne online, could be linked to other murders.",

        "summary": "If you're a fan of noshing on pistachios, news out of california might be more than a little depressing. It's harvest time, and early reports suggest that this year's crop might be down as much as 70 %, reports western farm press. The main problem seems to be last year's mild winter, which prevented the trees from getting their necessary \" chilling hours, \" explains npr. As a result, many of the normal-looking pistachios falling from trees turn out to be hollow, void of any nutty meat inside. Typically, such \" blanking \" affects 5 % to 10 % of a crop, but some orchards in the san joaquin valley are reporting that more than half of their nuts are hollow. Those in lower elevations in the valley are faring better. Trees in arizona also are doing fine, but given npr's estimate that california accounts for 99 % of the nation's pistachio orchards, the overall crop is bound to be down significantly. Other factors are at play, notably the drought and erratic blooming that is lengthening the harvest season at no small expense.

The man who became known as db cooper famously hijacked a northwest orient passenger jet on thanksgiving eve in 1971 only to vanish forever, presumably having parachuted off the plane with $ 200,000 given to him by the fbi when the plane briefly touched down in seattle. Cooper left behind a clip-on tie, and the group, citizen sleuths, which was put together by the seattle fbi, has been analyzing particles found on that tie. Among those particles: rare earth elements, which, the lead researcher says, are \" used in very narrow fields, for very specific things. \" in 1971, one of the few places they were being used was boeing, as part of the super sonic transport plane it was developing at the time. That has led researchers to wonder whether cooper was a boeing employee or contractor, possibly \" an engineer or a manager in one of the plants \" who would have worn a tie to work. The team is now asking for help from members of the public, like people who may have worked in the aerospace industry around that time. Researchers are publishing a running list of particles found on the tie, and are asking anyone with knowledge to weigh in on what the materials could have been used for.",

What's not immediately clear, per the new york times, is whether congress could actually reach a compromise, how the six-month delay would work, or what would happen to people who have work permits or whose permits expire during the six months. The president, who has been grappling with the issue for months, has been known to change his mind and could still shift course. The plan was reported by politico on sunday evening. The obama-era daca program has given nearly 800,000 young immigrants a reprieve from deportation and the ability to work legally. The move would come as the white house faces a tuesday deadline set by gop state officials threatening to sue the administration if trump did not end the program. It also would come as trump digs in on his base as he finds himself with poll numbers at near-record lows. During his campaign, trump slammed daca as illegal \" amnesty \" and vowed to eliminate it the day he took office. But since his election, trump has wavered, at one point telling the ap that those covered could \" rest easy. \" in february, he said the topic was \" a very, very difficult subject for me, i will tell you.

Under a change that comes as part of a rules package for the 115th congress, which will be sworn in tuesday, the non-partisan office of congressional ethics will be put under the control of the house ethics committee, which is run by house lawmakers, giving them the final say in investigating allegations of their own misconduct, pbs reports. The watchdog, which will be renamed the office of congressional complaint review under the proposal, will no longer be able to receive anonymous tips or make its investigations public. The oce was created in 2008 after a series of scandals, including the one that sent corrupt gop lobbyist jack abramoff to prison. House speaker paul ryan was among those warning against the proposal, which was adopted by a vote of 119 to 74. Politico reports that lawmakers from both parties had complained that the oce had been too aggressive in its investigations, and the effort to defang it was led by republicans who had been investigated by the body. The proposal, which congress will vote on on tuesday afternoon, was criticized by other watchdog groups, as well as democrats. \" the republicans claim they want to'drain the swamp, ' but the night before the new congress gets sworn in, the house gop has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions, \" house minority leader nancy pelosi said in a statement. \" evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new republican congress. \"",

According to the denver post, more than two-dozen survivors and parents of those killed sued the theater chain for not hiring armed guards, not having enough security cameras, and generally failing to protect theater-goers from shooter james holmes. An arapahoe county jury ruled against the victims last month, clearing the way for cinemark to seek reimbursement for $ 699,187 in legal costs. A judge still has to approve that amount, and asking for the money may be a play on cinemark's part to keep the victims from appealing the ruling. Another group of victims suing cinemark in federal court had its case dismissed friday by a judge who put the blame for the shooting squarely on holmes, the aurora sentinel reports. Cinemark, the third largest theater chain in the country, will also be able to seek reimbursement for legal fees in that case, though it hasn't yet.",

A group of \" stir crazy \" friends ventured out of a shelter in sarasota on sunday to find sarasota bay emptied of water that was pulled into irma's eyewall, reports the los angeles times. That's not all the friends noticed. Walking along hundreds of yards of new shoreline, they came upon two manatees stranded \" deep in mud, \" including one that wasn't moving, reports fox 13. \" we called every service we could think of, but no one answered, \" one member of the group writes on facebook. Yet \" we couldn't just let those manatees die out there, \" tony faradini-campos tells the sarasota herald-tribune. So they turned to social media. Faradini-campos says he and his friends posted photos of the manatees online and the story \" just blew up. \" wildlife officials and two manatee county sheriff's deputies eventually responded and helped move the manatees onto tarps so they could be dragged to deep water. It was an \" absolutely amazing \" rescue and \" shows what people can do when they come together, \" says faradini-campos. It was also incredibly dangerous: in a tweet sunday, the national hurricane center warned people to \" move away from the water \" because the passing of hurricane irma meant the wind direction would change from offshore to onshore, \" causing water levels along the southwest coast of florida to rapidly rise in a matter of minutes, \" per cnn.",

The fbi and secret service got involved in the probe, and an online petition went up calling for maischak's firing for \" inciting violence. \" in a written statement to the bee last week, maischak apologized for the \" cathartic \" tweet, which he said wasn't meant to spur violence and was \" the end point of a dark train of thought \" from his \" despair over the actions of the present us government. \" he said he didn't think anyone other than a few people who knew him well would ever read his remarks and that he has taken down his twitter account so no one sees his comments as \" encouragement to act violently or unlawfully. \" usa today notes the spotlight is once again on academia viewed as \" elitist \" by some. \" [ this is ] why universities across the country are now viewed with disdain by average, salt-of-the-earth americans, \" the breitbart article read.

But it's way too soon to panic, counters steve kornacki at salon. Ignore the \" anecdotal \" grumblings about her senate campaign for a moment and consider that she's doing way better than expected in \" measurable metrics \" such as polling and raising money. The race is still a dead heat, after all. Brown is a formidable candidate given his widespread popularity in the state, especially among independents and conservative democrats, which helps explain why several big names declined to take him on. This was never going to be a slam-dunk, and warren may yet fail to deliver. \" but for now, it's unfair to say that warren is flailing, or even underperforming, \" writes kornacki.

Dr. Farid fata was today sentenced to 45 years in prison for what us district judge paul borman described as a \" a huge, horrific series of criminal acts \" that allowed the detroit cancer doctor to reap $ 17.6 million in fraudulent billings. He told healthy patients they had cancer and then treated them for that supposed ailment; others were under- or over-treated, reports the free press, which cites one patient subjected to five years of chemo versus the typical six months. The detroit news reports both the prosecution and defense agreed that some 553 people may have been improperly treated by the 50-year-old. Fata sobbed in court, and offered an apology: \" i misused my talents... Because of power and greed. I stand before you ashamed of my actions... It all went wrong. I pray for redemption.... I ask the court for mercy. \" borman — who the ap reports \" heard stories of brittle bones and fried organs \" from survivors this week — could have sentenced the doctor to 30 years to life. Us attorney barbara mcquade expressed disappointment, emphasizing that \" nothing short of a life sentence was appropriate in this case, \" though she noted that \" for a defendant who is 50 years old, that is close to a life sentence. \" the federal system does not offer parole, so other than the potential for a minimal adjustment for good behavior, the news notes fata will serve his time.

        "summary": "The us and five middle eastern allies have begun airstrikes against isis in syria, with the military reporting 22 airstrikes in the country — though they didn't all target isis. Who else was in our crosshairs? the answer to that, and more: did syria get a heads-up? it says it did. The syrian foreign ministry said in a statement that the us informed damascus ' envoy to the un that strikes would be launched against isis in raqqa. In the past, syrian officials have insisted that any strikes against isis in the country should come only via coordination with damascus, but us officials have ruled out direct coordination with bashar al-assad's government. Why raqqa? it's isis ' \" de facto capital, \" writes terrence mccoy for the washington post. Militants took the northern city in january and now essentially govern it. \" there's a tax system, a school system, a court system, bakeries, mosques — and paychecks arrive on time.... [ it ] symbolizes everything the islamic state hopes to achieve across the region: a functioning, militarized theocracy, \" writes mccoy. That makes it an \" attractive target. \" and there's a dark side to the orderliness. From a un report: \" executions in public spaces have become a common spectacle on fridays. Public squares have become the scene of amputations, lashings, and mock crucifixions. \" what did the effort consist of? uss arleigh burke and uss philippine sea fired 47 tomahawk missiles; air force fighter jets, armed drones, and allied aircraft also participated. Jordan, the united arab emirates, bahrain, qatar, and saudi arabia were part of the effort. The wall street journal reports that some of their planes flanked those of the us and sees their involvement as key, in that it detracts from \" the appearance of a unilateral us attack on syrian territory. \" what did we hit? per cnn, training compounds, headquarters, storage facilities, supply trucks, armed vehicles, and isis militants, though the number of isis fighters killed wasn't given by the pentagon. What did we target beyond isis? the \" khorasan group, \" which the journal describes as a smaller group that's actually a bigger threat to the west. A defense official told the paper that intelligence indicates the group was in the \" advanced stages \" of planning an attack against a target in the us or europe. Abc news reports the us, with no assistance from our allies, carried out eight strikes against them; the remaining 14 were against isis. So are we done? no.",

The book criticizes schools and other key institutions for primarily accommodating extroverts and such individuals ' \"need for lots of stimulation. \" much to introverts'relief, it also seeks to raise awareness about the personality type, particularly among those who've struggled to understand it. It seems that such efforts have, for the most part, struggled to effect much change in the educational world. The way in which certain instructional trends — education buzzwords like \"collaborative learning \" and \"project-based learning \" and \"flipped classrooms \" — are applied often neglect the needs of introverts. In fact, these trends could mean that classroom environments that embrace extroverted behavior — through dynamic and social learning activities — are being promoted now more than ever.

Though 60 were inside the now-decimated facility when the blaze began, 23 were evacuated, officials say. Among the dead was a nurse trying to rescue patients, the new york times reports. Thus far, officials say just 22 bodies have been found, rt adds. The cause of the fire — now extinguished, cnn reports — is the subject of a criminal investigation; it's not the first blaze at a russian psychiatric facility this year, ria novosti notes. The oksochi psychoneurological institution, one of many such facilities in russia, housed elderly people needing care as well as people with mental illnesses. The 19th-century building, made mostly from wood, has long prompted official warnings, the ap notes. The fire reportedly began in the men's ward of the building; a witness told local television that a man had been smoking in bed. \" medical personnel saw a patient who was shrouded in flames... It's possible that he was smoking in bed and the mattress caught fire, \" a regional governor said, via interfax and nbc news. Prosecutors say the man, who was rescued, may have intended to start the fire.",

            "Spotify sent the world a reminder this morning: it is the dominant force worldwide in paid-subscription-based streaming music. The swedish company announced that it has reached 10 million users who pay around $ 10 a month for unlimited access to music, up from 6 million last march. The most-streamed artist in the history of the service is the us rapper eminem, the service announced, and the most-streamed song is last year's \"wake me up, \" by swedish dj and music producer avicii, which has been streamed 235 million times. Spotify's 10 million paying users make the service about 100 times the size of beats music, based on recent media reports.

The documents provide what nbc news calls the most detailed timeline so far of the dec. 8 death of caal, who was picked up by us authorities along with her father and a large group of migrants on dec. 6 near new mexico's antelope wells port of entry, and the release comes as her family is calling for an investigation into her death, usa today reports. Official autopsy results are still pending. The group was detained around 9: 15pm, according to a timeline from cnn. It was around 5am on dec. 7, as the girl and her father were preparing to board a bus that would take them to a border patrol station 90 miles away, that caal's father told authorities his daughter was sick and vomiting. Agents arranged for an ambulance to meet the bus at the station, but by the time the bus arrived there, caal said his daughter was not breathing. \" at this point her temperature was 105.9 degrees, \" dhs says. Border patrol emergency medical technicians revived the girl twice; she was ultimately flown via helicopter to a children's hospital, where she died at 12: 35am on dec. 8 with her father at her side. Dhs says the initial indication from the hospital is that the girl died of \" sepsis shock \"; per mayo clinic, sepsis is a complication of an infection, and if left untreated, it can progress to septic shock — which can be fatal. When they were first detained, caal's father signed a form saying both he and his daughter were healthy, but the girl's family has taken issue with that form, noting that it was in english — a language her father does not speak or read.

That didn't happen this winter, and a predicted warm and wet spring isn't going to help anything. The national pest management association recently released its bug barometer, which predicts unusually plentiful ticks and mosquitoes in most of the country ( the pacific northwest will be spared those pests but could see an increased ant problem ). A wet spring could also send cockroaches scurrying for shelter in people's homes in the southwest, cbs sacramento reports. According to outside magazine, one of the biggest worries is an explosion of lyme disease-carrying ticks in the northeast just in time for hiking season on the appalachian trail. And climate change could mean this is all just the start of a new normal. \" the conditions are changing, \" an entomologist at the cornell institute for climate smart solutions tells popsci. \" it's just not the way it used to be. \" ( heads up: this mosquito-fighting tactic doesn't work. )",

Over the past year, 17 dead animals have been found around the canadian city. It started with skinned and headless coyotes and a stabbed and partially skinned goose left outside the humane society's front door, reports the canadian press. But lately domestic animals — including a skinned and headless bunny and a mutilated cat — have been found in public places. The most recent discovery came last friday, when a skinned dog missing its head and several organs was found outside a beer store, reports the london free press. Like the other animals, the dog appeared to have been mutilated with a scalpel and deliberately left in a public spot. All the animals were drained of blood and expertly cleaned, and most were left in poses ( including snakes ). Authorities say it's unclear if the animals were dead before the mutilation began. Police are now investigating, but criminology professor and former police officer michael arntfield believes the crime spree could stretch back more than two years, when he says he received a tip that an individual was adopting pets from the humane society simply to torture and kill them; he says he notified police. \" this is not a prank, \" says arntfield. This is \" a prepatory behavior that will inevitably escalate to more sophisticated forms of offending, up to and including human victims. \" ( someone previously burned dogs in la. )",

It was the latest in a series of similar disturbing incidents in which dead animals were found in public places around the city, according to the london humane society's executive director judy foster. Over the last year, foster said, there have been at least eight incidents involving 17 dead animals, including a skinned and beheaded bunny found on the western university campus, a mutilated cat found in a park, six dead coyotes — two of them headless and skinned — placed in a pose in three different locations, and seven dead snakes left in a strange pose. A stabbed and partially skinned goose was dropped off at the humane society's front door, she said. \" it doesn't make me feel better knowing there is such great similarities between all of these and the disturbing part is you don't know when the animals died — at the start, halfway through or as a result of what was done to it, \" foster said.",

When his episodes first started in 2007, just after he started university, his déjà vu sometimes lasted just a few minutes at a time. But those episodes got worse, and by 2010, he was no longer able to watch tv, listen to the radio, or read because of persistent feelings of having \" encountered the content before. \" he also dropped out of school. His case was written up last month in the journal of medical case reports, and the report notes that unlike many patients ( such as those with dementia ) who experience chronic déjà vu, this man \" is fully aware of the false nature of his \" and had no memory problems. He's also not subject to any of the neurological conditions ( like temporal lobe epilepsy ) typically associated with déjà vu. \" rather than simply the unsettling feelings of familiarity which are normally associated with déjà vu, our subject complained that it felt like he was actually retrieving previous experiences from memory, not just finding them familiar, \" says report author dr. Christine wells. Wells believes this could be the first-ever case of anxiety causing persistent déjà vu: the man had a history of anxiety, particularly in regards to contamination ( he's a frequent hand washer ) and that anxiety got worse when he started university. Perhaps anxiety caused \" mistimed neuronal firing in the brain, which causes more déjà vu and in turn brings about more anxiety, \" wells tells the telegraph.

Anxiety and low mood led him to take a break from university, and he then began experiencing déjà vu. His recollection of these early episodes was that they would last for minutes, but could also be extremely prolonged. For example, while on holiday in a destination that he had previously visited he reported feeling as though he had become 'trapped in a time loop '.

Routine electroencephalogram ( eeg ) and magnetic resonance imaging were performed at a centre with experience in the diagnosis of epilepsy and were both normal.

Here's one, per the wall street journal: that beginning the shift in retirement age to 67 by 2022 be delayed until october. Though the washington post reports tsipras kept in place \" most of the added belt-tightening provisions he previously dismissed, \" it puts the chances of a deal as \" dim. \" indeed, german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was clear that no deal was imminent, at least not before sunday's greek referendum; angela merkel echoed that. Creditors have fiercely opposed the referendum, and they're not alone. The council of europe, an independent body that monitors elections and human rights, told the ap that any such referendum would fall short of international standards. Though it has no enforcement capacity, the declaration of its chief, thorbjorn jagland, is seen as a major blow to the government's plan. Such standards call for at least two weeks ' notice to allow for discussion, a clear question to be put to voters, and international observers invited to monitor the vote. Jagland spoke of problems with all three requirements. Greek officials hinted that any deal with creditors could cause the referendum to be canceled.

In a new study in molecular biology and evolution, cornell university researchers explain that people who come from a line of mostly plant eaters likely carry a gene mutation used to help compensate for a lack of essential fatty acids from meat or fish. The problem is that those who have the mutation — about 70 % of south asians, 53 % of africans, 29 % of east asians, 17 % of europeans, and 18 % of americans, per australia network news — can actually hurt their bodies with a fatty acid overload, particularly if their diet is heavy in things like meat and sunflower oil, reports the australian. The result is an increased risk of heart disease, colon cancer, and chronically high inflammation. Researchers identified the mutation in the fads2 gene when comparing 234 people from pune, india, where populations have historically eaten a plant-based diet, with 311 meat eaters from kansas. Some 68 % of the indians had two copies of a sequence of dna used to regulate genes fads1 and fads2 — which make long-chain polyunsaturated fats like omega-3 and omega-6, used for brain development and to curb inflammation — compared to just 18 % of the americans, reports metro. While the gene came in useful generations ago, \" changes in the dietary omega-6 to omega-3 balance may contribute to the increase in chronic disease seen in some developing countries, \" researchers say in a release. People with south asian and southern african ancestry are particularly prone to high inflammation. ( this population produces very little fatty acid. )",

By using data from the 1000 genomes project, researchers found evidence that the vegetarian diet over many generations may have driven the higher frequency of a mutation in the indian population. The mutation ( called rs66698963 and found in the fads2 gene ) is an insertion or deletion of a sequence of dna that regulates the expression of two genes, fads1 and fads2.

This week, iowa congressman bruce braley wins the distinction of being named the \" worst candidate \" of the midterms by the fix blog at the washington post. The reason wasn't policy, either. No, the democrat lost to republican joni ernst through \" sheer force of personality, \" writes chris cillizza. The biggest flub came early in the campaign when he was caught on tape referring to popular sen. Chuck grassley as \" a farmer from iowa without a law degree. \" insulting farmers in a farm state was not a wise move. Nor was missing 75 % of veterans-related hearings at a time when the va scandal was prominent, or his angry reaction to neighbors whose chickens wandered onto his vacation property. Simply put, voters just \" didn't like \" him, writes cillizza.

It's a familiar speech for longtime santorum-watchers, and it popped up a bit on the web last week before drudge's posting. It's a piece of information that will be used to fill in the blanks on santorum for a nation of voters that knows him mostly for old culture war headlines and little else, and at a time when he's surging in polls as the last real mitt romney alternative standing in the gop field. Per abc news, the full quotes came in a speech in which santorum said that the issue of denying communion to politicians supporting abortion rights related to a \" spiritual war: \" \"while",
            "Rick santorum was sitting at the center of the drudge report's homepage tuesday afternoon looking like a religious nut. \" santorum's satan warning, \" the headline screamed, under a black-and-white photo of the candidate standing behind a lectern with a cross on it. The conservative blogger drives mad crazy traffic, and he's using it to attack the biggest threat to his reported ally, mitt romney. This isn't the first time drudge has gone nuclear on a republican who threatened romney's candidacy. Drudge is making santorum look like the scary mom from carrie, pulling up several santorum quotes from 2008. Those include \" satan is attacking the great institutions of america, using those great vices of pride, vanity, and sensuality as the root to attack all of the strong plants that has so deeply rooted in the american tradition, \" as well as \""

Now, one of his most recognizable paintings could fetch nearly three times as much, reports cnn. In november, \" portrait of an artist ( pool with two figures ) \" — one of a dozen hockney paintings featuring swimming pools, per architectural digest — is expected to become the most valuable artwork by a living artist sold at auction. Christie's has set an estimate of $ 80 million, which would dwarf the $ 58.4 million auction price for jeff koons ' \" balloon dog ( orange ), \" sold in 2013, per the guardian. The 81-year-old hockney's 1972 painting is \" one of the great masterpieces of the modern era, \" says christie's rep alex rotter. The painting depicts a man looking down at a swimmer, believed to represent hockney's former lover, peter schlesinger. It \" encapsulates the essence of the idealized poolside landscape, and the tremendous complexity that exists within human relationships, \" rotter says. Wrote tim adams at the guardian, \" hockney appears to be dramatizing the distance between subject and object. \" owned by british billionaire joe lewis, the painting will go on display in hong kong, london, and los angeles, before hitting the auction block in new york on nov. 15, reports bloomberg.",

Sotomayor thinks the court blew it in allowing the university of michigan to ban racial preferences in admissions, and she drew on her own history as a bronx high school student from a poor family who got into princeton with such help. Her 58-page dissent ended up being three times ' longer than anthony kennedy's controlling opinion, notes scotusblog. In it, she singled out for criticsm a famous line from chief justice john roberts in 2007: \" the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race, \" he wrote. Sotomayor called the sentiment \" out of touch with reality, \" reports talking points memo. \"this refusal to accept the stark reality that race matters is regrettable, \" she wrote. \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination. \" sotomayor, joined in her dissent by ruth bader ginsburg, accused her colleagues of trying to \" wish away \" racial inequality. Roberts didn't let it go unchallenged. In a short concurring opinion, he wrote that \" it is not ' out of touch with reality'to conclude that racial preferences may themselves have the debilitating effect of reinforcing precisely that doubt, and — if so — that the preferences do more harm than good. \" he added: \" people can disagree in good faith on this issue, but it similarly does more harm than good to question the openness and candor of those on either side of the debate. \"",

The massacre's history didn't help much either: at the time, all 913 victims were taken to a mortuary at dover air force base and readied for burial, but at least initially, delaware wouldn't let them be cremated. The victims were leaders or followers of the peoples temple religious cult in guyana, and died in what the daily mail calls \" the single largest loss of american civilian life \" before 9/11.",

The country's lawmakers have approved a plan to grant citizenship to sephardic jews who can prove a strong connection to the country through surname, language, or direct descent from the heavily persecuted population of portuguese jews that once numbered in the tens of thousands, the bbc reports. \" we wish it had never happened, \" says a lawmaker involved in drafting the legislation, describing the country's treatment of jews as a stain on its history. \" given that it did happen, and that it can be put right, we thought we ought to do so. \" the citizenship plan follows earlier moves to try to right the historical wrong, the ap reports. In 1988, then-president mario soares apologized for the portuguese inquisition, during which tens of thousands of forced converts from judaism were burnt at the stake. In 2008, a monument was erected in lisbon outside a church where the massacre of around 2,000 jews began in 1506. In spain, where jews were just as heavily persecuted, a similar plan was approved in 2013. Jewish leaders in portugal, who will be involved in vetting applicants, say the portuguese plan is simpler than the spanish one and it will take around four months for candidates to be approved.",

The royal navy ship was commissioned in early december, and the issue surfaced during sea trials.

Though one naval officer allows that it's an embarrassing development, \" in reality [ it's ] no big deal. You expect to take some water in when you're operating a warship at sea. \" the press association describes the aircraft carrier, the first of a new generation of them for the uk, as \" the biggest and most powerful \" the country has built; it's expected to have a 50-year working life. The telegraph has the defense secretary's characterization of the ship: \" the most magnificent aircraft carrier in the world....

        "summary": "As the bbc puts it, \" this is exactly the kind of incident that many have feared since russia launched its air operations in syria. \" that assessment comes after turkish fighter jets shot down a russian warplane tuesday, claiming it had violated turkey's airspace and ignored multiple warnings, reports the new york times. Russia denied that its plane ever left syrian territory. So far, the reaction from moscow has been relatively restrained, notes ap. A spokesperson for the kremlin says it's too early to determine how this might affect relations between the two countries until all the details are sussed out. Russia's foreign minister was scheduled to travel to turkey on wednesday. More: video footage of the incident showed a warplane on fire before crashing on a hill after two crew members deployed their parachutes. Reuters reports that activists say the plane crashed in a mountainous part of syria's latakia province, where government forces have been fighting insurgents. A syrian rebel group says one pilot died. The fate of the other is unclear. A turkish military statement said the plane entered turkish airspace over the town of yayladagi, in hatay province. \" two f-16 planes on aerial patrol duty in the area intervened against the plane in question in accordance with the rules of engagement at 9: 24am, \" the statement said, adding that the plane had been warned 10 times in the space of five minutes. Russian authorities say the plane was one of dozens flying sorties as part of the country's bombing campaign in syria, reports the washington post, which notes that since turkey is a nato member, the downing of the jet is bound to increase friction between moscow and the west. It's the first time since the 1950s that a nato member has downed a russian or soviet aircraft, notes reuters.",

Twelve hours after the collapse, rescuers pulled myra plekam, 61, from the debris. She was awake and talking; now she's in the hospital in critical condition, the philadelphia inquirer reports. Meanwhile, more background details are emerging: the contractor behind the demolition had a criminal record, having pleaded guilty to a fake insurance claim in 2009. Griffin campbell claimed to have been a passenger in a car accident in 2005; he got a payout of more than $ 22,000, the inquirer reports. He was also arrested for aggravated assault in 2007, but was found not guilty. Campbell filed for bankruptcy this year with $ 221,000 in liabilities. In other news: the company that owns the building, stb investments corp., is run by richard basciano, who holds \" many seedy properties, \" the inquirer notes, and has been called \" the undisputed king of times square porn. \" no official cause has yet emerged for the collapse, but locals said something seemed fishy about the demolition: workers didn't have hard hats, and they were working in the dark, equipped with sledgehammers and flashlights. According to nearby carpenters, the wall that collapsed lacked adequate bracing, the philadelphia daily news reports.

The plan could work well for t-mobile, since for customers, \" it's a pretty low-risk thing to do, \" an analyst tells the times. \" switch to t-mobile, get a bunch of money for your devices, and then switch back if you don't like it. \" indeed, at&t has taken note of the offer and made one of its own specifically for t-mobile customers looking to switch carriers. \" what we are going to do is force the industry to get healthier, \" says t-mobile's ceo.

So argue critics who give by the sea — written and directed by jolie — a dismal 23 % approval rating on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: by the sea — centering on a writer who drinks and a former stage star who pops pills — \" is awfully pretty and mostly dreadful, \" writes richard roeper at the chicago sun-times. Jolie \" delivers some of the more uninspired work of her career, \" he notes. \" pitt has a few choice moments, but like everyone else in this film, he's sunk by the words he has to say and the long, long, long stretches where nothing much of anything happens. \" at one point, the pair finds a peephole in their hotel suite, which they use to spy on newlyweds next door. The problem is that \" the camera is in the wrong room, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. He says that even the film's automobiles have an \" emotional charge \" that \" far exceeds that of the beautiful people at the center of the negligible action. \" this \" reminded me of those long, bleak stretches of march in new england, when it seems as if winter will never end. \" \" this is no eyes wide shut — it's barely jersey girl, \" writes barry hertz, comparing by the sea to other real-life couples ' on-screen experiments. \" what the pitts failed to realize during production is that there is more to those beloved european art-house films than pretty scenery and stylish wardrobes, \" he writes at the globe and mail. The result is \" two of the more languid hours you ' ll ever spend inside a theater. \" the film teases \" a mysterious family tragedy which isn't nearly as mysterious as the movie hopes it is, \" but that's only one fault, writes stephen whitty at the newark star-ledger. \" there's little real drama here. Just one shot after another of jolie lying on a chaise lounge. … it's like the saddest lingerie catalog ever. \" by the sea just \" doesn't have a strong point, or even carefully delineated characters.

Race co-founder sir robin knox-johnston said something went wrong with a new type of tether the race was using. \" whether it is a type failure or a one-off failure — we won't know that until it has been examined, \" he said. Competitors have since been asked to use both clips on their tethers as an additional safety feature. Speirs was given a burial at sea sunday, race organizers said in a statement. \" as requested by simon's family, who were fully aware and came together to follow it at the same time back home, it was a christian service, and the rest of the clipper race fleet also joined them in solidarity as it was carried out, \" the statement said.

            "The death toll in a mudslide that buried much of a rural washington state community last month rose to 36 on wednesday after medical examiners extricated one more body from the rubble. A rain-soaked hillside collapsed without warning above the north fork of the stillaguamish river on march 22, unleashing a torrent of mud that engulfed some three dozen homes on the outskirts of the tiny community of oso. Of the 36 people confirmed dead, 32 have been positively identified including a 58-year-old man on wednesday, snohomish county officials said in a statement. The death toll had stood at 35 on tuesday. Recovery crews were still searching for another 10 missing people, including two children, down from 11 on monday. Efforts have been hampered by rain, which has created treacherous conditions and raised the risk of further slides and flash floods. President barack obama will stop in oso on april 22 and plans to view the devastation and meet with families of those affected by the disaster, as well as first responders and recovery workers. No one has been pulled alive from the rubble since the landslide, when at least eight people were injured but survived. Rescue teams have since found no signs of life.

        "summary": "Things got dramatic in the wee hours last night in the senate, the result being that the patriot act — and, specifically, the government's ability to collect bulk surveillance — is now \" on life support, \" reports politico. Once again, rand paul is at the center of things, with paul saying his stance against the surveillance is a fight for civil liberties and critics like john mccain accusing him of fundraising theatrics, reports the washington post. As things stand now, key parts of the patriot act are set to expire on june 1. The senate has gone into recess, but majority leader mitch mcconnell is bringing everybody back on may 31 for a rare sunday session to try to figure out a last-minute fix. \"this is a high-threat period, \" said mcconnell, who maintains that even a brief lapse in the act is a threat to national security. All this became necessary when the senate last night blocked a house compromise measure called the usa freedom act that would curb the surveillance programs. ( under the bill, the nsa would no longer collect metadata but could still gain access to it from phone companies. ) when that failed, mcconnell tried to extend the expiring patriot act provisions by one week, then four days, then two days, and then one day. All the extensions were rejected, one by one, thanks to paul and help from democratic senators ron wyden and martin heinrich. The upshot is that it's now \" almost a sure bet that portions of the patriot act \" will expire at least temporarily, reports the hill, which notes that the house is in recess through the end of may.",

The mother of five, born in haiti, has spent that last 20 years cleaning the fontainebleau resort in miami beach, fla., commuting up to four hours a day by bus, reports the miami herald. Touched by her story, mentioned in a herald article last may, drake decided she needed a break. After receiving a mysterious phone call, paret finished her shift last tuesday and headed to fontainebleau's spa for a massage, then to chef michael mina's restaurant stripsteak. She had no idea who was footing the bill until a car whisked her to saks fifth avenue, where drake and pittsburgh steelers wide receiver antonio brown surprised her, per people. Along with two other women, paret was told she could grab whatever she wanted within 45 minutes. Among her picks: a $ 6,000 gold and diamond necklace, a $ 2,000 valentino bag, and an $ 800 pair of shoes. Other florida residents got spoiled, too. As part of filming for the music video for single \" god's plan, \" drake donated $ 25,000 to a miami high school, gave a $ 50,000 scholarship to a university of miami student, spent $ 50,000 to cover groceries for supermarket shoppers, and donated $ 50,000 to a homeless shelter, whose 130 female inhabitants also received $ 150 target gift cards, per the herald and billboard. \" there's nothing like seeing people experience a joyful moment when you can tell they need it the most, \" drake wrote on instagram following the donations, adding the past few days \" were the best i have had in a very long time. \"",
