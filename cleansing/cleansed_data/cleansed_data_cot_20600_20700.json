Later, it emerged a second police officer is being treated for minor symptoms, including skin irritation, after contact with an object believed to have had \" secondary contamination \" from the nerve agent, reports the telegraph.

The two remain in critical but stable condition at a hospital in salisbury. As part of a court decision thursday to allow their blood to be tested for traces of chemical weapons by inspectors, it was revealed the pair are \" heavily sedated \" and may have suffered permanent brain damage; \" medical tests indicate that their mental capacity might be compromised to an unknown and so far unascertained degree \" and \" the precise effect of their exposure on their long-term health remains unclear. \" at present, skripal is \" unable to communicate in any way \" and yulia is \" unable to communicate in any meaningful way, \" court documents read, per abc news.

So the berlin teen chose to create a symbol — the hijab, or headscarf — that has ignited a debate in europe and beyond about religious freedom, multiculturalism, and women's rights. \"i wanted something to represent me, alongside the millions of women who wear the headscarf every day, \" alhumedhi tells the washington post. The teen, originally from saudi arabia, wrote to apple but got no response, reports the new york times. She then sent a short pitch to the unicode consortium, the non-profit that approves new emojis, and a member of one of its subcommittees helped her flesh it out, complete with a design. \" roughly 550 million muslim women on this earth pride themselves on wearing the hijab, \" the proposal says. \" with this enormous number of people, not a single space on the keyboard is reserved for them. \" alhumedhi tells the bbc that \" emjois are everywhere \" and \" people want to be acknowledged … and recognized, especially in the tech world. \" controversy has raged in countries such as france — where the burkini controversy dominated the summer's news — as to whether muslim dress symbolizes the oppression of women and should be limited. Alhumedi took issue with that view on tuesday in a reddit forum. \" might seem baffling, but when i wear the headscarf i actually feel liberated because i ' m in control of what i want to cover, \" she wrote.

Her proposal, which now has the support of one of reddit's co-founders, was promoted tuesday afternoon in an \"ask me anything \" on the platform. Particularly for teenagers like alhumedhi, emoji now are way more than just a fun decoration for digital conversations among friends. They are, increasingly, the conversation themselves. \"it's the",

Although she has never been harassed for covering her hair, she has seen people give her some hard stares. All the more reason, she figured, to try to have it included on her keyboard. \"we need to be represented with the amount of diversity, the amount of difference in this world, \" she said.

Identical twins nick and devin coats of louisiana were together diagnosed with stage four cirrhosis of the liver early last year — the cause was a genetic mutation, per the family's gofundme page — but had to wait for their conditions to worsen before they could be put on a liver transplant list, their mother tells abc news. While nick waited, however, he developed a rare cancer, hepatic angiosarcoma, and began chemotherapy, which prevented him from getting a new liver, as devin did this past january. Devin was reluctant to take the liver, wanting his brother to have it instead, but nick wasn't well enough, margi says. By february, doctors believed he'd recovered, but the cancer was then found to have metastasized. \" it was an inoperable condition at that point, \" margi tells people. Nick died sunday. Devin \" will look for nick and the realization will hit him hard, \" margi writes on facebook. She's sharing the twins'story in the hope of inspiring future organ donors. A reported 20 people die each day waiting for an organ, and margi believes that if nick could have gotten one upon his liver cirrhosis diagnosis, the cancer would never have developed. \" you have to get sick enough in order to get better and it shouldn't be that way, \" she says. \" when you go in the ground, you're in the ground. Extend your loved one's life in somebody else. \" ( these good samaritan twins met with tragedy. )",

In stage one, attendants marked the bedrock of the cave floor with an oval, covered the surfaces with mud, and added limestone and other sediments, reports live science. Stages two and three saw the lining of the pit with limestone blocks and the addition of a variety of the artifacts detailed above. Stage four involved placing the corpse in a squatting position with tortoise shells beneath her head and pelvis, and then dozens more thrown in for good measure, likely the result of a funereal feast. In stage five, the participants cleaned up after themselves, filling the grave with garbage from the feast, while the sixth stage topped it all off with the placement of a triangular block of limestone to seal the grave. Ancient origins reports that the event demonstrates social complexity in the natufian period that would be amplified in the neolithic period to follow.

The wall street journal reports the now-fda-approved deflazacort will be offered by marathon pharmaceuticals for $ 89,000 or so a year, up to 70 times its cost outside the us; marathon cfo babar ghias tells the washington post the net price will be $ 54,000 after rebates and discounts. Some who rely on it to treat duchenne muscular dystrophy — an incurable disease most often affecting boys and typically leading to death by one's 30s — are afraid they won't be able to afford it if insurance won't pay for it or if deductibles are too high. The drug, which ghias tells the journal will be sold under the brand emflaza starting in march, is a steroid that helps mitigate muscle weakness and cut inflammation, per an fda release. Emflaza is also said to cause fewer side effects than prednisone, a non-fda-approved drug often prescribed for dmd, per reuters. Marathon had to invest money in new trials before the fda would approve us sales. And, like other pharma companies that scoop up \" orphan drugs \" — meds used for diseases that don't affect more than 200,000 people nationwide — marathon says the high cost is justified because of the money it has poured into r&d. A massachusetts woman who's been buying the drug for her son for $ 1,600 a year from a uk online pharmacy isn't seeing it the same way, telling the journal she's \" disappointed \" marathon boosted her cost \" by more than $ 87,000 a year. \" because the fda has approved a drug to treat the disease, us consumers won't be legally able to acquire it overseas at the cheaper price anymore.

An article in the journal nature says an 80 % reduction of arctic ozone, noted earlier this year, was caused by cold air hanging around the stratosphere for months longer than usual. But no one knows why it hung around so long. \" that will be studied for years to come, \" one scientist says. Even though it seems counter-intuitive, climate change may be the cause, the new scientist reports. \" climate change warms the surface but cools the stratosphere, \" one scientist explains. A 2007 climate change panel concluded that \" there has been global stratospheric cooling since 1979, \" but the exact cause hasn't been proven. But scientists have documented the ozone-destroying effect of chlorofluorocarbons in the antarctic, which led to their ban in products like refrigerators and fire extinguishers.",

        "summary": "British officials knew in advance that the chinese government was likely preparing to kill student protesters at tiananmen square in 1989 — and their intelligence didn't come at the last minute. Indeed, a telegram sent to margaret thatcher's administration from britain's ambassador to china on may 20, 1989 — the same day chinese leader deng xiaoping declared martial law — quoted deng as saying \" 200 dead could bring 20 years of peace to china. \" sir alan ewen donald was repeating what had been told to a us expert on china, with whom he'd just had lunch, per quartz. He said the pentagon had also concluded that deng saw \" no way to avoid bloodshed \" and had instructed the military \" to do what is necessary to put down the situation. \" \" the implication clearly was that the sacrifice of a number of demonstrators [ sic ] lives now would stabilize the present situation and buy the time needed to complete the reform of china, \" donald wrote. The revelation of the uk's intelligence — which one reporter describes as \" stunning \" — comes from the dec. 30 release of scores of government files from 1989 and 1990, which were previously classified. Two weeks after donald's telegram was sent, the people's liberation army shot and killed hundreds of unarmed students occupying beijing's tiananmen square in protest of recent violence against pro-democracy demonstrators. Prime minister thatcher at the time said she was \" shocked and appalled by the shootings, \" reports the independent. ( china's last tiananmen prisoner just went free. )",

The cops also noted that there was blood in the kitchen, as well as some \" spattered on the wall \" in a bedroom, along with \" a piece of an ear on the ground. \" jde eventually admitted that he and his wife had been arguing over a beer, and that she had been drinking a concoction known as a hairy buffalo before the incident and that \" she gets out of hand when she has those. \" elrod, who appeared intoxicated to the officers, was arrested on charges of first-degree assault, the times notes. Although she denied to police knowing what had happened to her husband's ear, a review of recorded jail phone calls made by elrod to someone she called \" mom \" nailed elrod admitting to biting off jde's ear in the bedroom and asking the woman on the other end to contact jde to make sure he didn't talk to the authorities. ( this happens more than you might think. )",

Cnn offers a little more nuance to that figure, noting that only about 100 ( 16.6 % ) have been \" confirmed \" as returning to \" terrorist activities, \" while another 70 are suspected of doing so. In some cases, that's had dire consequences. The journal details the story of three moroccan militants who wound up forming a vicious militant group in syria, spearheading a major massacre of religious minorities last august. Two have since died, and their deaths brought outpourings of militant grief. \" it's like if a famous singer dies, \" one member of their group said. \" they were in guantanamo, defying america. \" still, cnn notes that the numbers are low compared to the 50-60 % recidivism rate for inmates released from normal us prisons. The specific prisoners swapped for bergdahl were mostly detained early in the afghan war based on their association with the taliban regime, rather than with al-qaeda — though some allegedly had \" directly associated \" with osama bin laden.",

        "summary": "Satellite imagery shows north korea has already begun dismantling its punggye-ri nuclear-test site ahead of a promise to destroy it entirely in front of international journalists. The removal of buildings and rail lines observed by 38 north on may 7 appear in line with kim jong un's promise over the weekend to close the facility between may 23-25. But while some see the move as a positive step toward denuclearization, others see cause for concern. North korea may be \" sanitizing \" the site, removing sensitive information about its nuclear program, before outsiders get access, nonproliferation expert jeffrey lewis tells the wall street journal. As no nuclear experts appear to have been invited to the site's decommissioning, there are also concerns about how its inoperability will be verified. Though north korea says all tunnels at the site will be collapsed in explosions, per the guardian — reuters notes the risk of spreading radioactive debris — experts say it would be easy for the country to dig new tunnels to continue nuclear tests, especially if nuclear material is hidden underground. Raising the possibility that the explosions might be a distraction, the journal points out north korea blew up a cooling tower at a nuclear-enrichment facility for international media in 2008, before going on to conduct five nuclear tests. For now, though, the us appears cautiously optimistic. \" a permanent and irreversible closure that can be inspected and fully accounted for is a key step in the denuclearization of [ north korea ], \" a state department rep tells reuters. \" we look forward to learning additional details. \"",

            "Seoul/washington ( reuters ) - shutting down north korea's nuclear test site is trickier than it might seem. A botched tunnel collapse could spread radioactive debris. Nuclear material might be buried, but accessible enough to be dug up and reused in a weapon. And even if all the testing tunnels are destroyed, north korean engineers could simply dig a new one if they want to conduct another nuclear test. Disarmament experts have raised many such scenarios after north korea said over the weekend that it would use explosives to collapse the tunnels of its punggye-ri nuclear test site next week. Pyongyang has publicly invited international media to witness the destruction, but not technical inspectors, leaving disarmament experts and nuclear scientists wondering how effective the plan is – and whether",

        "summary": "A big change could be in store for what's considered europe's most restrictive nation on abortion. The irish people are voting friday in a referendum that could see the removal of a near-total constitutional ban on abortion, enacted by another referendum 35 years ago with support from the roman catholic church. The vote to repeal or keep the eighth amendment — which views \" the right to life of the unborn \" as equal to that of the mother and therefore prohibits abortion in cases of rape, incest, and fatal fetal abnormalities — is expected to be close. Opinion polls showed \" repeal \" voters slightly ahead but up to 20 % of voters undecided, reports the guardian, noting the votes of thousands of irish expatriates returning home for the referendum \" could be significant. \" prime minister leo varadkar calls the vote a \" once in a generation decision, \" noting it could be another 35 years before abortion is revisited. Should voters choose repeal, a move backed by un human rights committee, the government will introduce legislation allowing unrestricted abortion via pill during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with abortions also permitted until the 23rd week in cases of fatal fetal abnormality or when a woman's health is at risk. Any woman seeking an abortion would need to wait three days after meeting with a doctor, reports the washington post. Currently, some 3,500 irish women travel abroad to get abortions each year, and though seeking or providing an abortion can carry a 14-year prison term, another 2,000 are believed to illegally procure abortion pills. The vote result is expected saturday afternoon.",

The independent experts, from the geneva-based human rights committee, issued their findings after considering a complaint by the woman, am, who was told in november 2011 when she was in the 21st week of pregnancy that her foetus had congenital defects, which meant it would die in the womb or shortly after birth. This meant she had to choose \"between continuing her non-viable pregnancy or travelling to another country while carrying a dying foetus, at personal expense and separated from the support of her family, and to return while not fully recovered, \" the committee said. Am decided to travel to the uk for a termination and returned 12 hours after the procedure as she could not afford to stay longer. The uk hospital did not provide any options regarding the foetus's remains and she had to leave them behind. The ashes were unexpectedly delivered to her three weeks later by courier.

A guardian acting on their behalf has filed a request in miami to have the adoption thrown out. It claims john goodman defrauded the court by not revealing his upcoming trial to the judge who oked the adoption, and says the move took the guardian and kids ' mom by surprise. They apparently didn't learn about the adoption until nearly two months after it was finalized, reports the palm beach post. The guardian and a lawyer also acting for the teens believe that girlfriend heather hutchins will reap nearly $ 9 million from the trust goodman had set up for his children, which contains hundreds of millions of dollars; she can also request $ 5 million from it each year. ( click for one take on whether goodman's move means he's committing incest. )",

Black's law dictionary 776 ( 9th ed. 2009 ) ( emphasis added ). On feb. 10, 2010, palm beach air-conditioning mogul john goodman allegedly ran a stop sign. His bentley convertible struck a hyundai being driven by scott wilson, a 23-year-old civil engineer. Wilson's car landed in a nearby canal where the young man drowned. The near-billionaire then fled the scene. Police say goodman had a blood alcohol content of 0.177, twice the legal limit. Not surprisingly, goodman is being sued by wilson's parents for a great deal of money. ( he also faces criminal charges that could put him in jail for 30 years ). Fortunately for goodman, he had set up a very large trust ( currently worth \"several hundred million dollars \" according to goodman's attorney ) years earlier for the benefit of his two children, with distributions to be disbursed when each child reached the age of 35. West palm beach judge glenn kelley ruled early in the goodman civil lawsuit that the jury could not be told of the large trust's existence because it might encourage jurors to impose a larger verdict against goodman, despite the"

The noise frightened confused residents of playa del rey, marina del rey, venice, and other beach communities, many of whom called authorities to find out what was going on, the los angeles times reports. Some celebrities who live in the area even complained about the fireworks on twitter, hollywood life notes. The coast guard reportedly reviewed the event, and officials say it passed a safety checklist for pyrotechnic displays; the agency also says it didn't require a permit because it took place on a yacht in open water, around a mile from the marina. But some residents say it actually took place within the breakwater or just 100 feet away. As for land-based law enforcement, the la county sheriff's department and fire department knew about the fireworks in advance, but city and county agencies are apparently not responsible for fireworks that occur outside the breakwater. Some locals and officials are upset that every agency appears to be passing the buck, but the sheriff's department is investigating whether any laws were broken.

The new york times says as much today with its top story, on the heels of earlier pieces with a similar sentiment in the wall street journal and the guardian. The gist is that iranian sanctions already in place have begun to take a real toll, and things will tighten even more in july when an eu ban on oil purchases takes effect. Ahead of the talks, iran seems serious about shipping out all its weapons-grade uranium and ceasing the enrichment of any more. There's no guarantee of a breakthrough, of course, and benjamin netanyahu is as pessimistic as ever, notes the christian science monitor. The journal's gerald seib offers a reminder of the stakes: \" if serious diplomacy is going to take root, this month is when it will have to happen.

Vatican city &#124; vatican city ( reuters ) - former pope benedict has denied that he tried to cover up sexual abuse of children by roman catholic priests, in his first direct published comments since he stepped down. The comments - which a victims ' group rejected - were made in an 11-page letter to italian author and mathematician piergiorgio odifreddi, who had written a book about the problems facing the roman catholic church before the pope resigned in february. \" as far as you mentioning the moral abuse of minors by priests, i can only, as you know, acknowledge it with profound consternation. But i never tried to cover up these things, \" said benedict, who now has the title emeritus pope. Excerpts of the letter were published in the rome newspaper la repubblica on tuesday with the former pope's permission. It was believed to be the first time benedict has responded to the sexual abuse accusations in the first person, although the vatican has always said he did much to put an end to sexual abuse of minors by priests and never tried to cover it up. It was also the first time since benedict resigned on february 28"

In it, she recounts the experiences of two members of her group who were captured by the rebels, and the torture, rape and murder they witnessed.

And that excavation process led her to feel grief, regret, and shame. \" grief for the pain i caused others. Grief for the broken young woman i had been before and during my time in dc, and the shame i still felt around that. Grief for having been betrayed first by someone i thought was my friend, and then by a man i thought had cared for me. \" but there's someone else she thinks should be feeling some of those same things. Yes, that would be bill clinton, who this year said in an interview that he does not believe he owes lewinsky a direct apology. \" bill clinton should want to apologize. I ' m less disappointed by him, and more disappointed for him, \" she writes. She also recalls her own apology back in 1999, the year after the scandal, to hillary and chelsea clinton. That's an apology she would offer again if given the opportunity, she writes. \" i would summon up whatever force i needed to again acknowledge to [ hillary clinton ] — sincerely — how very sorry i am. I know i would do this, because i have done it in other difficult situations related to 1998, \" she writes. \" when we are trapped by our inability to evolve, by our inability to empathize humbly and painfully with others, then we remain victims ourselves. \" her full piece here. The clinton affair premieres on a&e sunday. ( hillary clinton recently came under fire for her comments about lewinsky. )",

            "President clinton's past statements come home to roost as independent counsel ken starr sends the republican-led house his referral outlining the grounds for impeachment. House republicans vote to release the \"starr report \" ahead of the mid-term election and its salacious details become fodder for late-night television and mainstream news alike. A group of conservative lawyers known as the \"elves \" are revealed to have been working behind the scenes to bring down the president. After losing seats, house republicans vote to impeach the president, but his ultimate fate lies with the senate. Juanita broaddrick's allegation of rape against clinton that briefly took center stage during his presidency comes into focus again amid hillary clinton's 2016 presidential run, and take on new meaning following the #metoo movement."

            "Courtesy of paramount pictures i first came across google's interest in star trek back in the summer of 2010. A company spokesman wanted to show me the firm's rapidly improving visual search and speech-recognition technology. At the time, those features were available only on android phones, and, back then, android was getting shellacked by the iphone. So when the spokesman told me that he regarded the latest android devices as something like a combination of star trek's tricorder and the uss enterprise's computer, i dismissed it as a gimmick to attract media attention for a struggling brand. Not that he was totally wrong — in 2010, asking your phone to search for something, rather than typing in your query, was pretty cool. It just wasn't star trek-cool. Since then, though, star trek has popped up again and again in my interviews with googlers. Last year, for a piece in which i praised google's voice search for trouncing apple's siri, i spoke to scott huffman, one of the engineering directors on google's search team. When i asked him how he pictured voice search evolving, he too invoked the star trek computer. \"you would ask, 'hey google, where should i have dinner? ' \" he told me. \"and it might say, 'well, you seem to like italian restaurants, so how about this one? ' \" a few weeks ago, i was chatting with tamar yehoshua, director of product management on google's search. \"is there a roadmap for how search will look a few years from now? \" i asked her. \"our vision is the star trek computer, \" she shot back with a smile. \"you can talk to it — it understands you, and it can have a conversation with you. \" still, i didn't really put much stock in these references. After all, google is very likely the nerdiest large company on earth; of course its employees like star trek. Then, in march, amit singhal, who heads google's search rankings team, gave a talk at the south by southwest interactive festival — and star trek took center stage.

            "Courtesy of paramount pictures i first came across google's interest in star trek back in the summer of 2010. A company spokesman wanted to show me the firm's rapidly improving visual search and speech-recognition technology. At the time, those features were available only on android phones, and, back then, android was getting shellacked by the iphone. So when the spokesman told me that he regarded the latest android devices as something like a combination of star trek's tricorder and the uss enterprise's computer, i dismissed it as a gimmick to attract media attention for a struggling brand. Not that he was totally wrong — in 2010, asking your phone to search for something, rather than typing in your query, was pretty cool. It just wasn't star trek-cool. Since then, though, star trek has popped up again and again in my interviews with googlers. Last year, for a piece in which i praised google's voice search for trouncing apple's siri, i spoke to scott huffman, one of the engineering directors on google's search team. When i asked him how he pictured voice search evolving, he too invoked the star trek computer. \"you would ask, 'hey google, where should i have dinner? ' \" he told me. \"and it might say, 'well, you seem to like italian restaurants, so how about this one? ' \" a few weeks ago, i was chatting with tamar yehoshua, director of product management on google's search. \"is there a roadmap for how search will look a few years from now? \" i asked her. \"our vision is the star trek computer, \" she shot back with a smile. \"you can talk to it — it understands you, and it can have a conversation with you. \" still, i didn't really put much stock in these references. After all, google is very likely the nerdiest large company on earth; of course its employees like star trek. Then, in march, amit singhal, who heads google's search rankings team, gave a talk at the south by southwest interactive festival — and star trek took center stage. Singhal told the crowd that the original series was one of his favorite all-time shows, and"

        "summary": "Women trying to start a family who find themselves constantly reaching for a stress ball, take heed: all that extra anxiety may be keeping you from conceiving, afp reports. A study carried out by researchers from the university of louisville and published in the annals of epidemiology journal says that ladies who found it harder to chill out during their peak ovulation time were 40 % less likely to get pregnant than in other less-stressful months — and that women who reported more stress than their counterparts were 45 % less likely to conceive, per a press release. The researchers followed 400 sexually active women no older than 40 through up to 20 of their menstrual cycles or until they conceived, while the subjects kept diaries logging everything from alcohol and caffeine use to how often they had sex and what kind of contraception they used. The subjects also noted their daily stress levels on a scale from one to four — and the researchers found, after controlling for those other factors, that during peak ovulation time ( around day 14 ), women who reported the highest levels of stress registered that drop in fertility, and only during that peak ovulation time. Perhaps not as surprisingly, women who became pregnant experienced a stress spike at the end of the month in which they conceived, with researchers guessing the extra stress was from finding out they were with child or due to the hormone changes in their bodies. Study co-author kira taylor says she hopes the study will prove to be a \" wake-up call, \" both to doctors and patients, that mental wellness is just as important as nutrition and other physical self-care for women trying to get pregnant.

University of louisville school of public health and information sciences epidemiologist kira taylor, ph.d., and her uofl and emory university colleagues, found that women who reported feeling more stressed during their ovulatory window were approximately 40-percent less likely to conceive during that month than other less stressful months. Similarly, women who generally reported feeling more stressed than other women, were about 45-percent less likely to conceive. The results of the study recently published in the journal annals of epidemiology. In the study, 400 women 40-years-old and younger who were sexually active recorded their daily stress levels measured on a scale from one to four ( low to high ). The diaries also contained information regarding menstruation, intercourse, contraception, alcohol, caffeine and smoking.

Yougov, which conducts internet polls about \"politics, public affairs, products, brands and other topics of general interest \", surveyed 1,000 people online on the issue.

As online communication and social media increasingly becomes a part of mainstream society, so too has the way organizations handle cyber-bullying and violent discourse.

Twitter, for example, scans users'tweets for hateful, potentially harmful language and takes countermeasures when it feels like the messages constitute an infringement upon someone's personal safety. It's a system that japanese twitter user @daydreammatcha recently ran afoul of, as the twitter account he was using until just a few days ago, @nemuismywife, was flagged and frozen by the social networking platform after it deemed that he'd been twitter to broadcast death threats as is often the case when social media users get reprimanded, @daydreammatcha claims that twitter's judgment is unfair.

            "New zealand is wild. Just ask this kiwi kayaker, kyle mulinder, who happened to be in \"the wrong place at the wrong time \" to get slapped directly in the face by an octopus wielded by a seal. Yes, you read that right: a seal had an octopus in its mouth in the midst of a battle royale of marine creatures. The seal emerged from the water flailing around with the octopus, which ended up hitting the unsuspecting kayaker in the face while he was out enjoying the great outdoors. \"we were just sitting out in the middle of the ocean and then this huge male seal appeared with an octopus and he was thrashing him about for ages, \" mulinder told yahoo news about the freak encounter with nature.

        "summary": "Here's how cold it is: hell has frozen over. Ok, so we're talking about hell, mich., a small town 60 miles west of detroit where temperatures have dropped as low as -4 degrees ( or -27 when wind chill is considered ), time reports. In fact, at some point yesterday, each one of the 50 states saw freezing temperatures, the ap reports. ( the spot in hawaii where it hit 18 degrees: the top of a dormant volcano. ) needless to say, quite a few temperature records have been shattered. More weather news: cnn has a number of other \" fun \" facts, such as: at least one city in siberia is actually warmer than certain parts of the us right now. And in embarrass, minn., the coldest temperature in the us yesterday ( -35 degrees ) was actually colder than recent readings from... Mars, the bbc reports. Parts of the midwest were colder than the inside of a freezer, and as cold as a winter day on the antarctic coast, at -14. ( antarctica, meanwhile, was warming to the point where ships trapped in ice broke free yesterday. ) authorities attribute 21 deaths since sunday to the cold, including 11 from traffic accidents, five people who collapsed while shoveling snow, and three deaths involving hypothermia. Some good news: airline cancellations are abating, with fewer than 50 flights expected to be canceled tomorrow, cnn reports. And the vaunted polar vortex is on its way out: this week, it will be pushed up into canada. By saturday, cincinnati ( which hit -7 degrees yesterday ) should hit 50 degrees, and new york ( which saw -4 degrees in central park yesterday ) should be over 50 by then. Right now there's a freeze warning in place for gulf coast regions, but by the weekend the highs will hover around 70 degrees. In fact, in much of the us, temperatures will go up about 10 degrees per day, until it gets unseasonably warm. Which is probably a good thing for some, considering how many people have been hurt after throwing boiling water into the outside air to watch it freeze. Another \" dumb-but-amusing cold weather video \" going viral involves a guy launching himself onto a frozen trampoline. In kentucky, it got so cold monday that an escaped inmate turned himself in so he could warm up.",

The company says it settled on the new system after testing it with hundreds of thousands of users last year and discovering that they were 200 % more likely to rate a movie when the choice was just up or down, variety reports. Netflix also says that under the old system, people tended to give serious documentaries five stars and frivolous comedies one star — even though they watched far more of the latter. Netflix also plans to introduce a percentage match score to show users how much the system has calculated a movie will match their taste. \" for example, if you see a title has a 90 % match, that means that based on your viewing habits and patterns, we think you are highly likely to enjoy that title, \" a spokesman tells entertainment weekly. The company says the changes will be rolled out to all users in the months to come — and while the star ratings will disappear from view, the feedback will still be used to help personalize users ' movie selections.

            "Netflix is radically overhauling its user reviews. After years of allowing customers to rank movies on a scale of 1-to-5 stars, the streaming service announced plans to replace that system with a binary \"thumbs up vs. Thumbs down \" rating. Soon one-star ratings will cease to be a thing on netflix — or five-star ratings, for that matter. The new siskel &amp; ebert-ian system was revealed by netflix executive todd yellin at a press briefing at the company's headquarters in los gatos, california on thursday, variety reported and ew confirmed.

            "Netflix is radically overhauling its user reviews. After years of allowing customers to rank movies on a scale of 1-to-5 stars, the streaming service announced plans to replace that system with a binary \"thumbs up vs. Thumbs down \" rating. Soon one-star ratings will cease to be a thing on netflix — or five-star ratings, for that matter.

Citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington, a liberal advocacy group that includes constitutional scholars and former white house ethics lawyers, says trump is in violation of the constitution's emoluments clause, which bans accepting compensation from foreign governments, reports reuters. \" president trump has made his slogan ' america first, ' \" crew director noah bookbinder said in a statement. \" so you would think he would want to strictly follow the constitution's foreign emoluments clause, since it was written to ensure our government officials are thinking of americans first, and not foreign governments. \" the group says that since trump has refused to divest from his businesses, he will be accepting payment from foreign governments when they do things like book rooms at his hotels — and when he negotiates trade deals with countries like china, \" the american people will have no way of knowing whether he will also be thinking about the profits of trump the businessman. \" trump's lawyers argue that the clause was never meant to apply to things like standard hotel bills. Eric trump says the trump organization has already taken steps to address this, including pledging to donate hotel profits from foreign government guests to the treasury. \" this is purely harassment for political gain, and, frankly, i find it very, very sad, \" he tells the new york times. President trump called the lawsuit \" without merit, totally without merit \" after he signed some of his first executive actions monday in the oval office.",

Tweeted stephen fry: \" many gathered here to say goodbye to the hitch. Sitting behind sean penn which makes me a little nervous. I speak 23rd.

As for hitchens ' last words: on his last day, hitchens tried to write something by hand, but could produce only scribbles, so said \" what's the use? \" and fell asleep.

The ceo released a letter tuesday night explaining that apple would challenge what it views as a \" chilling \" demand from the fbi — to create what cook calls a \" backdoor \" to iphone security measures. \" the u.s. Government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create, \" he writes. If the government gets this ability to tap into syed rizwan farook's phone, it could tap into any iphone, says cook. \" the fbi may use different words to describe this tool, but make no mistake: building a version of ios that bypasses security in this way would undeniably create a backdoor, \" writes cook. \" and while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, there is no way to guarantee such control. \" one specific thing the government wants is for apple to disable a feature that wipes a phone's data if an incorrect password is typed 10 times in a row, reports cnet. If that goes away, the fbi could then mount a \" brute force \" attack on the phone by attempting countless passwords until one strikes gold. The electronic frontier foundation is siding with apple, saying the government essentially wants an iphone \" master key \" that could be used over and over, reports the new york times.",

So reports vocativ in an exposé about a product that may have never been in the works — and the marketing teams and fundraisers who were seemingly duped by a shiny gadget. The object at hand is the bioring, a waterproof heart rate monitor and fitness tracker that claimed it would be able to do something medical researchers have not yet achieved: count the calories its wearer consumes, and even differentiate between calories from fat, protein, and carbs. It's something of a holy grail for diet and fitness tracking, and hundreds of people chipped in more than $ 450,000 to the product's indiegogo campaign, which launched last june. Forbes thought it might be \" the next evolution in wearable tech, \" while tech times likened it to having a \" personal trainer at users ' fingertips. \" but the campaign has ended, with an indiegogo message explaining only that it \" violated our terms of use. \" only about $ 200,000 has been returned to backers, and no ring is in sight. It all looks dubious in hindsight. Michael johnson, a co-founder, claimed to have experience as an \" algorithm developer \" at cancer treatment firm elekta, which tells vocativ it has no record of the man's employment. A separate indiegogo page created by scientists and consumer advocates ( it's not selling anything ) flat out calls the bioring a \" scam \" and picks apart the claims one by one. It also accuses indiegogo of being too lax on vetting such products. \" if it seems too good to be true, it probably is, \" they caution. By vocativ's calculations, indiegogo made about $ 23,000 on the elusive ring. ( beware your online holiday shopping. )",

Election monitors say he's got a point. They yesterday revealed a host of alleged irregularities and dirty trickery, including: in cities, where tsvangirai is popular, 82 % of voters were turned away. In rural areas where mugabe has an edge, half that many were. In some areas, village leaders rounded people up, marched them to the polls, and gave them each voting numbers in an apparent attempt to verify who they voted for. Literate people were allegedly forced to pretend they were illiterate so they could have someone \" help \" them vote for mugabe's zanu-pf party. Mugabe's party initially declared victory on twitter, but it has since rescinded the tweet amid a hail of criticism, cbs news reports. A zanu-pf official admitted there had been irregularities, but said the party had tried hard to make zimbabwe \" as conducive as it possibly can [ be ] for an election that is free and fair. \" and, on the bright side, african regional observers praised the vote for being violence-free — unlike the 2008 campaign, which the new york times points out was rife with intimidation. \" this is a huge change, \" one voter said. \" the atmosphere is much freer. \"",

A baby boy, born hiv-positive in milan in december 2009, was given antiretroviral treatment to fight the virus within 12 hours of birth, the washington post reports. The virus quickly became undetectable in his blood. Hiv treatments can cause heart damage and other significant side effects, and so after reading about the apparent cure of a mississippi baby born with hiv, the boy's mother asked doctors to stop the then-3-year-old's treatment. They agreed to do so. In the first week, the child's viral load was undetectable. In the second week, it jumped to 36,840 copies per ml. While antiretrovirals can rid the bloodstream of the virus, they don't attack reservoirs of hiv in organs, which scientists are currently unable to test. Researchers had hoped the boy's early treatment would keep reservoirs from forming, but that now appears to have been a pipe dream. \" just a couple of hours after infection, the virus has already started seeding the organs and hides so therapy cannot eradicate hiv, \" study co-author mario clerici tells the bbc. \" you can treat patients, but you cannot cure them. Right now it is impossible. \" the boy's renewed treatment has again brought the virus to undetectable levels. The mississippi baby's hiv has also returned.

        "summary": "What a loss of sea ice looks like: an estimated 35,000 walruses, crowded on one stretch of alaskan beach. Images taken on saturday via plane as part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's annual marine animal survey capture just that. The enormous grouping of the mammals near the inupiat eskimo village of point lay, about 700 miles northwest of anchorage, is the result of disappearing sea ice, explains a walrus expert with the us geological survey. The area's summer sea ice vanished by mid-september, leaving the walruses with nowhere in the chukchi sea to rest between their dives to the seafloor for food, chadwick jay tells the alaska dispatch news. He says that six of the last eight years have seen this occur. The walruses met trouble on land: us fish and wildlife service observers last week spotted an estimated 50 carcasses on the beach; they suspect the animals may have been killed in a stampede, which can be triggered by a polar bear, human hunter, or low-flying airplane. A necropsy team will head to the area to investigate. And as far as food goes, biologists note that beach areas aren't the best for feeding; the richest food sources are found offshore along the continental shelf. The world wildlife fund had this to say to the ap: \" the walruses are telling us what the polar bears have told us and what many indigenous people have told us in the high arctic, and that is that the arctic environment is changing extremely rapidly and it is time for the rest of the world to take notice and also to take action. \" ( the same phenomenon occurred on a smaller scale last year. )",

The lead researcher from denmark's aarhus university tells the bbc that the switch is much like adjusting a flashlight. If you're looking for your car in a parking lot, \" you could use a narrow beam over a long distance and still see a lot, \" she says. \" but when you're trying to get your keys into the car, you would switch to a wider beam. This is similar to what we see in porpoises. \" the beam is controlled by a fatty structure in the porpoise's head called the melon. \" like some bats, harbor porpoises can broaden their biosonar beam during the terminal phase of attack but, unlike bats, maintain the ability to change beamwidth within this phase, \" the researchers write in the journal elife. The team, which studied harbor porpoises in a semi-enclosed research facility that gave the animals seafloor access, believes other dolphins and whales have the same sonar ability. The lead researcher tells the bbc that the discovery suggests many porpoises end up in fishing nets because of \" attention blindness \" that causes them to ignore potential hazards as they zero in on a fish.

        "summary": "This should boost your hope for a long life, especially if you're a woman: the number of americans living past 100 has spiked by 44 % over the past six years. Centenarian numbers have risen from 15,000 in 1980 and 50,281 in 2000 to 72,197 in 2014, according to a new cdc report. Some 80 % of centenarians in 2014 were women. \" there is certainly a wow factor here, that there are this many people in the united states over 100 years old, \" a demographer tells the new york times. \" not so long ago in our society, this was somewhat rare. \" but the new figures are just \" the very tip of the iceberg, \" he adds, noting baby boomers will soon cause the number of seniors in the country to skyrocket. Centenarians are also living longer — a trend that should continue with baby boomers who've benefited from vaccines, antibiotics, and other medical advancements. The death rate for female centenarians fell 14 % from 2008 to 2014 to 36.5 per 100 women, while the rate for men fell 20 % to 33.2 per 100 men. The rate also declined across all ethnic groups: hispanic centenarians had the lowest death rate of 22.3 per 100 in 2014. Heart disease was the leading cause of death, though alzheimer's deaths spiked 119 % from 2000 to 2014 to claim the second spot. \" people who are physically fit enough to survive over 100 years ultimately succumb to diseases afflicting the mind and cognitive dysfunction, \" an expert says, per live science.",

In other words, \" the risk of dying for centenarians decreased \" over this period, study author dr. Jiaquan xu, of the cdc's national center for health statistics, told live science. The leading causes of death in this age group are also changing. In 2000, the top five causes of death for centenarians were heart disease, stroke, influenza and pneumonia ( the two conditions are grouped together ), cancer and alzheimer's disease. But by 2014, the death rate from alzheimer's for this age group had more than doubled — increasing from 3.8 percent to 8.5 percent — making the progressive brain disease the second leading cause of death for centenarians.

At least 41 people were killed and scores more injured, some of them critically, in a blaze at the sejong hospital in the city of miryang, about 170 miles southeast of seoul, the bbc reports. Officials say the fire started around 7: 30am friday morning in the rear of the hospital's emergency room and was mostly extinguished a few hours later, reuters reports. Local fire chief choi man-woo said around 200 people were evacuated from the hospital. He said all the victims, including some at an adjoining nursing home, are believed to have died from smoke inhalation, not burns. Another 94 survivors were evacuated from the nursing home, choi said. Hospital officials say the victims include many elderly people with breathing problems and people from intensive care units. The ap reports that officials say the death toll includes three members of the hospital staff: an emergency room doctor, a nurse, and a nurse assistant. The cause of the blaze is under investigation. South korean president moon jae-in said he would call an emergency meeting in response to the fire. The disaster, which comes less than a month after a fire in a high-rise fitness center killed 29 people in the city of jecheon, has raised concerns about the country's safety standards, cnn reports.",
