        "summary": "Admissions goofs are nothing new. Learning you've lost your admission in july is another matter. That's the situation with the university of california irvine, which withdrew 499 offers of admission two months before the fall term is to begin. By the los angeles times ' count, that's abnormally high: other uc campuses gave \" recession \" numbers ranging from seven to 150. Per the school, 290 of the reversals were because of transcript issues; the rest were over low senior-year grades. Many of the newly disappointed are accusing the school of fishing for slight or even unsubstantiated reasons to dump would-be freshmen after too many made the choice to enroll. The lat cites numbers that suggest they may not be off base: the uc office of the president says 7,100 students made the decision to enroll, versus a planned freshman class of 6,250. A rep for the school concurs that the admissions office has been cracking down on verifying requirements \" as a result of more students [ having ] accepted admissions to uci than it expected. \" in case after case, the crackdown smells off: one student was told only one of the two required copies of her transcript was mailed; she says they were sent in the same envelope. Another student says he was told his transcript didn't contain a graduation date; he says it did. They're appealing, and they're not the only ones: some 409 — or 82 % — have, with many of the students quoted by the lat and oc register as having 4.0-plus gpas... And having already turned down other schools and scholarships. As of friday, 63 have emerged victorious. The school says the appeals process, which normally takes up to six weeks, has been accelerated.",

        "summary": "The tampa socialite at the heart of the petraeus \" love pentagon \" sex scandal was the co-founder of a cancer charity that does not appear to have been involved in any charity work, the huffington post finds. Jill kelley and her surgeon husband founded the doctor kelley cancer foundation in 2007, stating that it \" shall be operated exclusively to conduct cancer research and to grant wishes to terminally ill adult cancer patients. \" but records reveal that the charity went bust later that year, having spent every penny of the $ 157,284 it started with on expenses like parties, entertainment, and travel. The charity also listed $ 12,807 for office expenses and supplies, and $ 7,854 on utilities and telephones, which is a little on the steep side for a charity that operated out of the couple's mansion, the huffpo notes. But the charity isn't all that's surfaced on kelley: the mansion where kelley and her husband threw lavish parties for military top brass has been in foreclosure since 2010, reports the new york daily news. The couple owes vast sums to banks and credit card companies and has been hit by at least nine lawsuits. Kelley isn't just an unpaid social liaison to nearby macdill air force base, she's an honorary consul of south korea, an embassy official tells foreign policy. \" she assumed this position last august thanks to her good connections and network, \" the korean official says, adding that the position is symbolic and has no official responsibilities. Kelley tried to invoke \" diplomatic protection \" in one of several 911 calls made over the last few days, fox reports. Complaining about trespassers on her property, kelley told the dispatcher, \" i ' m an honorary consul general... I don't know if you want to get diplomatic protection involved as well, because that's against the law to cross my property because, you know, it's inviolable. \" the wall street journal adds that over the summer, kelley became worried about personal information getting aired and tried to get the fbi to drop its investigation into threatening emails paula broadwell sent her. Broadwell, it notes, also sent anonymous emails to military brass bashing kelley.",

Embassy in damascus is shuttered, to find information on tice's \"welfare and whereabouts. \" kirby said officials are in regular contact with families of u.s. Detainees overseas, but that privacy considerations prevented him from saying more about tice. \"we are deeply concerned about the well-being of austin tice, \" kirby said. \"his case has the attention of the highest levels in the u.s. Government and the administration. \" the letter the tices released wednesday bore the names of the slain hostages ' parents – a raw reminder of search efforts that didn't find captives in time. They represented journalists james foley and steven sotloff, and humanitarian aid workers abdul-rahman peter kassig and kayla mueller. The islamic state beheaded foley, sotloff and kassig in gruesome propaganda videos. Mueller, who reportedly was enslaved and assaulted for months by islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi, died in a coalition strike, apparently an inadvertent casualty of the u.s.-led campaign targeting the islamic state's so-called caliphate in iraq and syria.

He said border security surpassed any other issue in importance for him, including trade and the newly reformulated nafta pact known as usmca. Trump also asserted that the caravan of immigrants includes \" many criminals. \" the washington post suggests that trump is especially irked because more immigrant parents than ever are reaching the border with children since the us stopped its policy of family separations over the summer. Border patrol arrested nearly 17,000 family members in september, a record number that's up 80 % from july. Trump has previously said he wants to beef up the military's presence along the border until a wall is in place, and he again faulted democrats on the issue of immigration. \" all democrats fault for weak laws! \" he wrote.

        "summary": "Nicotine. Caffeine. Betel nuts. You may never have heard of them, but nuts from the areca palm are hugely popular as a chewable stimulant: almost a tenth of the global population enjoys them, the bbc reports. A millennia-old tradition, they're the world's fourth-most-popular psychoactive substance, healthline adds. Their effect is similar to that of drinking six cups of coffee, and many workers engaged in lengthy physical tasks chew them to maintain alertness. Trouble is, they're incredibly dangerous. Potentially leading to oral cancer and terrible mouth lesions, they're likely responsible for tens of thousands of early deaths, the bbc notes. In taiwan, about 5,400 men receive oral cancer diagnoses each year; as many as 90 % of them are betel nut chewers. The situation is only made worse by the way betel nuts are often packaged: in what are called quids, which can be made using known carcinogens like tobacco and slaked lime. The latter can generate small abrasions in the mouth that may help the carcinogens get into the body. Despite the dangers, betel nuts are called \" taiwan's chewing gum, \" and about half the country's men aren't aware of the cancer issue, an expert says — even as people like qiu zhen-huang develop holes in their cheeks. Decades after he quit the stuff, he ended up with a golf ball-sized tumor. The fda doesn't consider betel nuts safe, healthline notes, and in recent years, taiwan has been fighting their use — though it remains legal, shanghaiist reports. Free screenings and other programs helped cut men's chewing rates in half two years ago, the bbc notes. ( as for smoking: keep doing it, and there's a 67 % chance you ' ll die from it, a study finds. )",

            "Energy department officials were warned that their plan to help a failing solar company by restructuring its $ 535 million federal loan could violate the law and should be cleared with the justice department, according to newly obtained e-mails from within the obama administration. The e-mails show that energy department officials moved ahead anyway with a new deal that would repay company investors before taxpayers if the company defaulted. The e-mails, which were reviewed by the washington post, show for the first time concerns within the administration about the legality of the energy department's extraordinary efforts to help solyndra, the california solar company that went bankrupt aug. 31. The fbi raided solyndra last month, shortly after it closed its doors. The records provided friday by a government source also show that an energy department stimulus adviser, steve spinner, pushed for solyndra's loan despite having recused himself because his wife's law firm did work for the company"

Bush on an aircraft carrier, writes matthew cooper in the atlantic. This was a community organizer turned war president, \" making a compelling, \" almost kissengerian \" argument that just like with health care we need to spend now to save later, cooper notes. \" the worst major speech of his presidency \" left joan walsh at salon deeply pessimistic about the chances of success in afghanistan. Obama failed to give any convincing reasons why we are escalating the fight in afghanistan now, and didn't seem all that convinced himself, she writes. Obama's \" strangely schizophrenic \" emphasis on the possibly incompatible goals of victory and a speedy withdrawal is unlikely to go down well with either liberals or conservatives, and won't persuade the undecided, writes ross douthat at the new york times. The president barely seemed to mention military strategy, he notes. Obama showed \" a steely resolve \" that had been lacking before, writes richard cohen at the washingon post. The president showed it is possible to urge a nation to war \" using reason and logic, facts and figures — and not by waving the bloody shirt of patriotic fibs, \" cohen notes.",

The unidentified 60-year-old and a female companion were driving to the windidda station cattle ranch near the remote town of wiluna when their car broke down on sunday, police say. The pair camped overnight, hoping to flag down a passing car. When none had come by early monday, the man began the 30-mile trek to windidda with just a \" small container of water, \" the ap reports. He didn't return a day later, so the woman set out after him. She was found yesterday by workers from the nearby wongawol station, who took her to her destination, abc news reports. Her companion had not arrived. Workers began a search and discovered the leonora man's body on the side of the road, a little over a mile from windidda, police say. It isn't clear when he died. Though a coroner has yet to determine the cause of death, police say there are no suspicious circumstances; temperatures reached 106 degrees in wiluna on the day he began his journey. Police are now reminding outback travelers to pack plenty of food and water and to stick by a vehicle if they get lost or are unable to continue as vehicles are far easier to spot from the air than humans, wa today reports.

Beyond that, things get weird — a man babysitting the boy called 911 to report his whereabouts after seeing an amber alert. The key developments: the kidnapping: on tuesday, police say that alyssa chang, 46, and vien nguyen, 65, kidnapped toddler ronnie tran and his mother from their home in des moines, wash. Chang is the girlfriend of the boy's father, and nguyen is his paternal grandmother, reports abc news. The babysitter: after the boy's mother was tasered and tied up in a garage ( she would eventually escape on her own, the seattle times reports ), police say chang brought the boy to her brother's home in renton and innocently asked him to babysit. The brother, john truong, tells komo-tv that he didn't know anything was amiss until the next morning when he saw the amber alert. The surprise: \" i ' m eating my breakfast, i ' m checking my facebook, all of a sudden i see this amber alert for this child, \" he says. \" and it looks like this child in my bed, and i ' m like, ' oh my god! what's going on? ' \" he called police, who soon tracked down his sister and nguyen. Both face felony charges. The bottom line: \" there's a lot of family dynamics involved, \" says a police official. \" as far as why, we can only speculate. \" ( a girl missing 11 years returned to the us wednesday. )",

The ap explains it in layman's terms: \" the device acts like an x-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface. \" scientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth, \" rotten \" sulfuric rock, or water lurks below, which could assist in identifying unstable areas, per wyoming public media. But a press release frames the main quest like so: we know that the water that explodes from yellowstone's geysers \" originates as old precipitation, snow and rain that percolates down into the crust, is heated, and ultimately returns to the surface. \" we know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. \" does it travel down and back up? does it travel laterally? \" asks finn.

Demille, who filmed his epic the ten commandments in the sand dunes on the central california coast in the early 1920s, kcbx reports. Apparently, though, he didn't follow through. Now, archaeologists are using aircraft to get a bird's-eye view of the dunes to unearth more treasures of the movie's set — a giant sphinx was found earlier this year, but plenty more remains from a \" lost city \" that boasted a huge temple, four more of those sphinxes, massive statues, a 750-foot-long wall, and amenities for somewhere between 2,500 and 5,000 people who worked on the film. Demille reportedly called the spot \"perhaps the most unpleasant location in cinema history, \" according to outside. After another flyover in the next few weeks by the company applied earthworks, the search will resume on the ground, archaeologist m. Colleen hamilton tells kcbx. \" we have one historical photograph of the camp itself and we're trying to align that with features that are currently on the ground, \" says hamilton. Doug jenzen of the nonprofit dunes center in guadalupe tells outside that minerals in the sand — \"a natural desiccant \" — have preserved the artifacts remarkably well. However, he says, the sands of the dunes are shifting, leaving the old movie props endangered. \"it's disappearing so fast, \" he says. As for the commandment that demille restore the area after filming: instead, per outside, he supposedly blew it up with dynamite to spite rival directors.

According to his friend at new york university's film school, the remains of a massive egyptian temple, a dozen plaster sphinxes, eight mammoth lions, and four 40-ton statues of ramses ii were all supposedly entombed in the sands 150 some-odd miles north of los angeles. \"it was an absolutely cockamamie story, \" brosnan says. \"i thought he was nuts. \" the ruins weren't authentic egyptian ones, of course. They were the 60-year-old remains of a massive hollywood set — the biggest, most expensive one ever built at the time. The faux egyptian scenery had played the role of the city of the pharaoh in one of hollywood's first true epics, cecil b demille's 1923 film the ten commandments. The set had required more than 1,500 carpenters to build and used over 25,000 pounds of nails. The production nearly ruined demille and his studio. When the shoot wrapped, the tempestuous director supposedly strapped dynamite to the structures and razed the whole set, burying it in the sands near guadalupe, california, to ensure no rival director could benefit from his vision.

Instead of digging, archeologists are first taking to the sky to find these treasures. Flying high above vast mountains of sand on the san luis obispo-santa barbara county line, photographers are snapping detailed pictures of the topography below. Their goal is to to pinpoint a large camp, built specifically for a hollywood movie production of the ten commandments nearly a century ago. In recent years, a sphinx statue was unearthed in the dunes dating back to the same movie directed by cecil b. Demille in the early 1920s. It's currently on display at the dunes center in guadalupe. Now, a company called applied earthworks is helping the center in its search to find even more. M. Colleen hamilton is an archaeologist working on the project and said roughly 25-hundred people lived in the camp for several months during the film's production. \" we have one historical photograph of the camp itself and we're trying to align that with features that are currently on the ground to relocate the location, \" said hamilton.

According to his friend at new york university's film school, the remains of a massive egyptian temple, a dozen plaster sphinxes, eight mammoth lions, and four 40-ton statues of ramses ii were all supposedly entombed in the sands 150 some-odd miles north of los angeles. \"it was an absolutely cockamamie story, \" brosnan says. \"i thought he was nuts. \" the ruins weren't authentic egyptian ones, of course. They were the 60-year-old remains of a massive hollywood set — the biggest, most expensive one ever built at the time. The faux egyptian scenery had played the role of the city of the pharaoh in one of hollywood's first true epics, cecil b demille's 1923 film the ten commandments. The set had required more than 1,500 carpenters to build and used over 25,000 pounds of nails. The production nearly ruined demille and his studio. When the shoot wrapped, the tempestuous director supposedly strapped dynamite to the structures and razed the whole set, burying it in the sands near guadalupe, california, to ensure no rival director could benefit from his vision. Bullshit,",
            "There is a search underway for more artifacts buried deep in the sands of the guadalupe-nipomo dunes. Instead of digging, archeologists are first taking to the sky to find these treasures. Flying high above vast mountains of sand on the san luis obispo-santa barbara county line, photographers are snapping detailed pictures of the topography below. Their goal is to to pinpoint a large camp, built specifically for a hollywood movie production of the ten commandments nearly a century ago. In recent years, a sphinx statue was unearthed in the dunes dating back to the same movie directed by cecil b. Demille in the early 1920s. It's currently on display at the dunes center in guadalupe. Now, a company called applied earthworks is helping the center in its search to find even more. M. Colleen hamilton is an archaeologist working on the project and said roughly 25-hundred people lived in the camp for several months during the film's production. \" we have one historical photograph of the camp itself and we're trying to align that with features that are currently on the ground to relocate the location, \" said hamilton. Hamilton said the studio had a contract to return the area to its natural state once the filming was complete but evidence shows that didn't happen.

Did cindy know caylee had vanished? \" caylee was missing in my heart that day. She wasn't missing physically. I thought i knew where she was at, \" cindy says. \" i wanted casey to know how much she was hurting me. And i thought she was purposely keeping caylee away from me. \" mcgraw also asks both parents about the smell in the trunk of casey's car. What do they believe caused that odor now? \" truthfully, to this day, i don't know, to be honest, \" says cindy. George adds: \" do i want to believe caylee was back there? i don't want to believe it. I ' m going by what the investigators have told me. All i know is that caylee is not with us anymore. I know that. I know that. \" cindy also defends george against the suggestion that he knew of caylee's disappearance. \" george would have never have put us through those six months of not knowing where caylee was if he knew where caylee was, \" she says. \" i watched his heart break every single day. And i watched him as frantic as he was. \" the full interview – for which mcgraw's production company reportedly paid a fee to caylee's fund, not directly to the anthonys – will air tuesday and wednesday on his tv show.for more on casey anthony's true-crime drama, based on people's unparalleled access at key moments of the case, buy people's book outrage, available now at people.com/caseyanthony"

            "Iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad said tuesday that he intends to release two americans who have been jailed on charges of espionage for two years and grant them a \"unilateral pardon. \" \"i am helping to arrange for their release in a couple of days so they will be able to return home, \" ahmadinejad told the washington post in an hour-long interview at his office here. The americans, shane bauer and josh fattal, both 29, were arrested along with another american, sarah shourd, as they hiked along the iran-iraq border in july 2009. Last month, bauer and fattal were sentenced to eight years in prison. Shourd was released in september 2010 on medical and humanitarian grounds after posting $ 500,000 bail. In washington, secretary of state hillary rodham clinton said she was \"encouraged \" by ahmadinejad's comments. There was no immediate reaction from the families of bauer or fattal. The promise to free the hikers could eliminate a key flash point in relations between iran and the united states, although many more remain. It comes just weeks before ahmadinejad is due to visit new york for the annual u.n. General assembly meeting, and it coincides with other conciliatory actions by iran, including a letter to european union officials offering new talks on iran's nuclear program. It was not clear, however, whether iran's diplomatic outreach included the kinds of concessions that western officials say would be necessary to resume talks that broke down in january. In the interview tuesday, ahmadinejad suggested he was open to a resolution of the standoff over the country's uranium-enrichment program, although apparent deals have fallen apart in the past. $ 500,000 bail demanded masoud shafiei, a lawyer representing the hikers, said he had been told by court officials that each of them would have to pay $ 500,000 in bail, as shourd had to do. He said the bond was being demanded because, even though bauer and fattal have been convicted, their case is open to appeal and a final verdict has not been rendered. \"basically if they don't pay their bail, they won't be freed, \" shafiei"

Cracked and the stir round up 15 celebrities with even crazier ( and some of them very painful ) backgrounds: woody harrelson's dad, who walked out on the family in 1968, was a contract killer who probably got away with killing at least two people before going to prison. Then, when he got out early, he was hired to murder a judge, and he went back to prison. Woody tried to get him a retrial, but he died in 2007. Kelsey grammer first lost his mom and grandpa, whom he lived with. Two years later, his dad was shot to death on his front lawn by a crazed taxi driver. Then his younger sister was murdered by a gang of robbers in a red lobster parking lot. Then his two half-brothers died in scuba diving accidents. As if that's not all bad enough, a good friend was killed on 9/11, another good friend was murdered by his own wife, and one of his former wives tried to kill herself and ended up killing their unborn child. Olivia newton-john's parents fled germany when the nazis took over, and her dad ended up getting a job interrogating captured nazi pilots — not over torture, but over dinner and drinks. One of his interrogations led to the capture of deputy fuhrer rudolf hess. He later joined mi5's code-breakers and decoded german messages, including secret battle plans that helped the allies win world war ii. Charlize theron's father was verbally abusive, and while the actress was growing up in south africa, he once came home drunk and started shooting at charlize and her mother. Theron's mom managed to get the gun, and ended up killing her husband. Jack nicholson was born out of wedlock to a 19-year-old aspiring actress, so her parents raised him as their own and he grew up believing his mom was his sister. Leighton meester's parents and her aunt went to prison when the actress was just a baby, after getting busted smuggling 1,200 pounds of marijuana from jamaica. Her aunt ended up escaping prison and got on the us marshals ' 15 most wanted list. Tobey maguire's dad robbed a bank across the street from his house — in broad daylight, without a mask. He was caught, not surprisingly, and went to prison for two years. Cracked's full list here; the stir's here.",

He stresses the government did all it could to free her, including deploying an entire operation \" at significant risk \" to free her and other us hostages. The government did, however, stick to its policy of not paying ransoms to organizations like isis; abc news reports isis demanded $ 6.6 million for her release, and had set an august 2014 deadline for payment. More emerging details: although the government says it has been unable to confirm the cause of mueller's death, per the new york times, isis sent mueller's family three photos of her body, according to two people briefed on the family's correspondence with isis. Two photos reportedly showed mueller in a black muslim hijab that partly covered her face; the third showed her in a traditional white burial shroud. And while the times sources said they saw bruises on mueller's face in the photos, there was no evidence of \" puffiness or other concussive effects associated with a bomb blast, \" though they acknowledge she could have been located in a nearby building or injured by flying debris. The rescue operation referenced by obama took place july 4 in a predawn raid on a raqqa prison by delta force commandos, the los angeles times reports. But the two dozen soldiers were too late: the hostages — who also included james foley and steven sotloff — had apparently been moved a day or two before. \" we never stopped trying to get her, \" a defense official not authorized to speak publicly tells the times. \" we never lost that focus. \" officials yesterday told abc news that mueller may have been \" given over \" to an isis commander, and that forced marriage could have even been involved. \" isis didn't see her as a hostage or a bargaining chip, \" said one.

The department confirmed the investigation to cbs ' 60 minutes, which aired a report sunday on disturbing allegations that at least one woman was drugged and assaulted at the spotted pig, a new york restaurant where batali is an investor and frequent guest. Numerous female employees said they were harassed and grabbed by batali and restaurant owner ken friedman, and one woman said she blacked out after dining with batali and woke up alone in a room on the third floor of the spotted pig building with a badly scratched leg and what appeared to be semen on her skirt. The woman — an employee at batali's babbo restaurant at the time of the alleged 2005 assault — told anderson cooper that when she went to work and asked him what happened the previous night, \" he just was silent, wouldn't talk to me. \" she said she called a crisis hotline but didn't end up filing a police report. Police sources tell the new york daily news that a woman filed a police report after a very similar alleged incident in 2004. The sources say the woman told police she blacked out while drinking with batali in babbo and woke up to find him having sex with her. In a statement, batali said he \" vehemently \" denied the assault allegation aired on 60 minutes, though he added that he is \" sincerely remorseful \" for \" deeply inappropriate \" conduct in the past and he is not attempting a professional comeback.",

        "summary": "\" it opened a great wound inside of me. I pretended it didn't happen. \" so says a nun who claims an italian priest sexually assaulted her while she was confessing to him about 20 years ago in bologna. A new ap investigation finds she's not alone: religious sisters are apparently being abused by bishops and priests in asia, south america, africa, and europe, and usually keeping quiet about the assaults. That changed this week when five nuns appeared on national tv in chile and told their stories of sexual abuse by priests and other nuns, crux reports. It's an older story in africa, where reports have emerged of priests abusing nuns and pressuring them into abortions; a six-year study and follow-up report for the vatican found 29 nuns impregnated at one congregation. The national catholic reporter revealed that study in 2001, but what the church did is unclear. Meanwhile, the vatican remains quiet on the issue and lacks rules to probe and punish abusers, leaving it to local church leaders to take action. \" consecrated women have to be encouraged to speak up when they are molested, \" says a vatican official on the condition of anonymity. \" bishops have to be encouraged to take them seriously, and make sure the priests are punished if guilty. \" but amid #metoo and an ever-widening catholic church abuse scandal, more nuns may be speaking up for themselves. \" i see it as two freedoms: freedom of the weight for a victim, and freedom of a lie and a violation by the priest, \" says the nun allegedly assaulted in bologna. \" i hope this helps other sisters free themselves of this weight. \"",

( earlier reports noted that mayer had grown frustrated with employees who trickled in and left right at 5pm. ) requiring them to show up at the office could restore some enthusiasm — and allow the company to monitor the situation. Indeed, some telecommuters have even started their own companies while working from home on yahoo's dime, the workers say. Some employees might quit, but the company would prefer to lose the dead wood. Meanwhile, at business insider, henry blodget — who works part-time for yahoo — comes to mayer's defense. \" for the past decade, yahoo has been in desperate need of a ceo who is willing to set a high bar and make the tough, unpopular decisions necessary to whip the company back into shape, \" he writes. \" mayer has demonstrated that she is more than capable of doing that. \"",

        "summary": "A new drug for fatal injections is not only hard to find, it takes twice as long to kill people. Us death penalty states like texas, missouri, and louisiana are struggling to find lethal drugs for capital punishment, thanks to a worldwide ethical embargo against pharmaceutical companies selling drugs to us departments of corrections, the guardian reports. So those states are turning from a three-drug cocktail to one drug, pentobarbital — which takes an average of 20 minutes to kill rather than the cocktail's 10. But does the prolonged death equal inhumane treatment of the prisoner? an anesthesiologist says it's hard to know — there isn't enough research yet — but the way states are procuring pentobarbital raises additional questions. Texas, missouri, and louisiana simply asked pharmacies to make the drug ( the new york times slammed such states for entering \" a largely unregulated world \" of pharmaceuticals ). But louisiana is stuck: it couldn't get any pentobarbital to execute child-killer christopher sepulvado on wednesday, the lens reports. Officials could try some other drug combination, as ohio did in executing inmate dennis mcguire last month — but he spent 26 minutes gasping for breath, the ap reports, and his last words were, \" i feel my whole body burning. \"",

The guardian and the new york times explain that the judge found madonna had targeted the wrong person in her legal action: darlene lutz, an art collector who helped madonna build her collection before the two had a falling-out. Madonna claimed her assistants had given her things to lutz, and the judge said madonna should have targeted those assistants rather than lutz.

Reuters/stephen lam a jury cleared kleiner perkins in march of claims it short-circuited former partner ellen pao's career because she is a woman.

        "summary": "New calculations in the cosmos have revealed a surprise: the universe appears to be expanding faster than anyone thought. Using the hubble space telescope, scientists measured the distance to stars in 19 galaxies and concluded that the universe is growing 5 % to 9 % quicker than expected, the researchers say in a press release. For the record, they calculate the rate to be 45.5 miles per second per megaparsec, the latter being the equivalent of 3.26 million light-years. It's surprising, upi reports, because astronomers expected the calculations to jibe with previous ones conducted by nasa and the european space agency. If the new rate is confirmed, it could challenge some basic precepts about how the universe functions and challenge at least part of einstein's theory of relativity, reports the guardian. \" if you really believe our number — and we have shed blood, sweat and tears to get our measurement right and to accurately understand the uncertainties — then it leads to the conclusion that there is a problem with predictions based on measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the leftover glow from the big bang, \" says co-author alex filippenko of berkeley, per the christian science monitor. While 5 % to 9 % may not seem like a big deal, it constitutes a \" major discrepancy \" in this particular case, notes gizmodo. Part of the answer around the discrepancy may lie in the \" mysterious parts of the universe that make up 95 % of everything and don't emit light, such as dark energy, dark matter, and dark radiation, \" says another of the project's researchers.

During that same period, his annual income surged from nearly $ 660,000 in 2007 to $ 1.1 million in 2009 before slipping to $ 923,000 in 2010.

Unlike huckabee and romney, she trails obama in head-to-head polling. Even george w. Bush doesn't approve. Newt gingrich: the ex-house speaker runs strong against obama, and he's won over the tea party base with his constant extreme rhetoric.

The senate this morning handed him the 60 votes he needed, voting 60-37 to end debate on his request for fast-track negotiating authority. It ' ll vote on final passage for fast-track tomorrow, which the new york times sees as \" virtually ensured \" as final passage needs just 51 votes. As earlier reported, 14 democratic senators backed fast track in a late may vote, and 13 did so today. The timeline, per the hill: after the fast-track vote, the senate will vote on a package that includes trade adjustment assistance ( taa ) — a measure that would provide job training and other help to people who lose their jobs because of the trade deal. Democrats have insisted taa be paired with the fast track; some on the other side of the aisle oppose it. The house will then need to vote on it, and both mitch mcconnell and john boehner have pledged to make taa law. As politico puts it, today's vote \" came as democrats wavered on whether to trust \" them to do so.",

        "summary": "You may think you know tonya harding, the us figure skater whose career was ruined when she was associated with an attack on her rival, nancy kerrigan, ahead of the 1994 us figure skating championships. But craig gillespie's i, tonya might convince you otherwise. Presented as a faux documentary, the film starring margot robbie has a 90 % rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: \" i, tonya takes greater risks with the biopic genre than any other in recent memory, and it's remarkable how much of it lands upright. It's the triple axel of based-on-true-story movies, \" writes andrew lapin at npr. Robbie \" magnificently \" embodies harding with \" a childlike sincerity, a lost-soul cluelessness, \" he writes. This, and the film's chaotic mix of personas and styles, \" builds to a satisfying and illuminating portrait of a poor american girl who maybe never stood a chance. \" \" there's something genuinely electric about the narrative's headlong tumble into madness, \" coming from \" a script where the truth was irrefutably stranger than any fiction, \" writes leah greenblatt at entertainment weekly. She found the skating scenes \" thrilling. \" but \" robbie is the real revelation, \" greenblatt writes. \" she's a powerhouse: a scrappy, defiant subversion of the american dream. You won't just find yourself rooting for this crazy kid; you might even fall a little bit in love. \" it's \" a darkly satiric comedy with the tenor of a coen brothers movie \" and \" earns the sort of high marks for creative interpretation that its protagonist complained eluded her, \" writes brian lowry at cnn. But he argues \" the sleight of hand used to realize the skating sequences is visually distracting in places. \" he also says robbie \" struggles \" at the start to truly come across as just 15. And though she recovers to deliver \" a layered and unexpectedly sympathetic portrait, \" allison janney, playing harding's mother, \" pretty nearly steals the show. \" christy lemire is effusive: robbie gives \" the performance of a lifetime, \" conveying \" the requisite swagger of an athlete at the top of her sport \" as well as the \" low sense of self-worth buried underneath. \" as for the film itself, it highlights harding's outsider status from the outset, which \" makes her story relatable beyond the insular world of figure skating, \" lemire writes at rogerebert.com. She concludes by calling i, tonya a \" nearly flawless program \" and \" one of the year",

Yaasmeen castanada, a 19-year-old cal state la sophomore and mother to a 4-month-old, was battling a sore throat on thanksgiving, so she took a friend's antibiotic, reports cnn. She rapidly \" started having a hard time breathing, and she told her mom that her lips were burning, her throat, her eyes, they got so red that she couldn't talk, \" says her aunt. Within 24 hours she was hooked up to a ventilator; she's now at the university of california, irvine, burn center. Her initial diagnosis was known as stevens-johnson syndrome, an allergic reaction that caused her skin's layers to part, resulting in open wounds. \" it can be considered a burn from the inside out, \" a dermatologist tells abc7. But as burn center director dr. Victor joe tells cnn, that disease refers to a condition that affects up to a third of the skin; roughly two-thirds of castanada's skin is affected, and her condition is now called toxic epidermal necrolysis. Though the mortality rate for the diseases can reach as high as 25 %, joe believes she will survive. But he says \" we are particularly concerned because her eyes have been affected. This can cause scarring of the corneas, which could lead to permanent blindness. \" per a gofundme page set up by her family, castanada has had surgeries since friday on the top and bottom portions of her body in which skin was scraped to spur new growth. Joe calls the case \" sobering \" and notes that it's one of about half-a-dozen his unit has seen in the last year. ( last month, a peanut allergy killed a college student. )",

The same amount of bitcoins would be worth around $ 22.5 million now. The currency, which sank to $ 443 a year ago, is up more than 65 % so far this month and has been soaring to record highs, passing $ 2,000 for the first time over the weekend and breaking through the $ 2,100 and $ 2,200 marks on monday, reports cnbc, which notes that a $ 100 investment in bitcoins exactly seven years ago would be worth more than $ 75 million at the $ 2,251 price it reached monday. Analysts say several factors are behind the steep rise in the price of the currency, including political uncertainty worldwide and the ironing out of technical issues. Japan has also given bitcoins a big boost with new legislation allowing retailers to accept the currency. \" the japanese have caught the bitcoin bug and inefficiencies across markets are being exposed, \" cryptocompare founder charles hayter tells business insider. But other \" crypto-currencies, \" including ethereum and ripple, have been rising even faster than bitcoin, leading analysts to warn that a bubble appears to be developing, the bbc reports.",

Plus there's all that inexpensive land. Ukraine's interest in renewables is partly politically motivated given the fragile cease-fire with kremlin-backed rebels near the russian border, not to mention increasing friction with the putin camp over natural gas bills.

        "summary": "Britain's most popular tweeter has apparently quit twitter after being lambasted for comments about women's sexuality. Actor stephen fry tweeted \" bye bye \" to his 1.9 million followers after he claimed he was misquoted in a magazine interview that women don't enjoy sex. According to the interview, the homosexual celebrity, 53, said women obviously aren't interested in sex because they don't seek out casual encounters on the street, reports the telegraph. He said women only have sex because that's \" the price they are willing to pay \" for a relationship. \" if women liked sex as much as men, there would be straight cruising areas in the way there are gay cruising areas, \" the magazine attitude quotes him as saying. \" women would go and hang around in churchyards thinking: ' god, i've got to get my f****ing rocks off ', or they'd go to hampstead heath and meet strangers to shag behind a bush. \" he added: \" i feel sorry for straight men. \" fry insists he was misquoted in the story that triggered a firestorm of criticism, though he hasn't clarified his comments. \" now i ' m the antichrist, \" he complained.

It said the remarks are \" likely to be roundly dismissed by those who have embraced the idea of women's ability to have unemotional, uncommitted sex as an empowered lifestyle choice \". Fry, 53, used his favourite medium, micro-blogging site twitter, to offer his response, posting: \" so some paper misquotes a humorous interview i gave, which itself misquoted me and now i ' m the antichrist.

John allen-jill kelley email exchange lightly, assigning 15 investigators toiling seven days a week to review the thousands of pages of documents. They've now sussed out between 60 and 70 emails that \" bear a fair amount of scrutiny, \" according to a defense official, who didn't elaborate on what those emails might contain. The new york times reports the purpose of the investigation, which likely won't conclude until 2013, is to determine if one of three violations occurred: misconduct ( ie, adultery or inappropriate language ), substantial use of government property for personal matters, or a security breach. Those investigators aren't the only ones getting busy. A previously silent kelley is now defending herself, through her attorney. Abbe lowell, a big-time washington lawyer who has represented bill clinton and john edwards, yesterday released emails, phone recordings, and more evidence that, he says, prove kelley did not try to exploit her relationship with david petraeus. He also sent out three letters connected to the scandal, the ap reports: he asked the us attorney's office in tampa why kelley's name was released in the first place, adding that federal privacy laws could apply. He wrote another letter to a businessman kelley was trying to help make a deal with south korea, before she lost her honorary consul status. The businessman, adam victor, has said in interviews that kelley was not a skilled negotiator, and lowell says he defamed her in an attempt to bask in his \" 15 minutes of fame. \" in a letter to the attorney consumer assistance program ( which fields complaints about lawyers ), lowell accuses attorney barry cohen of talking publicly about conversations he had with kelley in 2009, thus breaking attorney-client privilege.",

Immediately, the league began taking flak: if, say, tim tebow, can pray in the end zone and not be penalized, why not a muslim player? earlier today, the council on american-islamic relations urged the nfl to clarify its rules to \" prevent the appearance of a double-standard, \" reports ap. Hours later, the nfl said the penalty was, in fact, a blown call. While league rules prevent players from celebrating while on the ground, there is an exception: the \" officiating mechanic in this situation is not to flag a player who goes to the ground as part of religious expression, and as a result, there should have been no penalty on the play, \" says an nfl spokesperson.

Trustee irving picard had sued fred wilpon and saul katz for $ 1 billion ( later knocked down to $ 386 million ), saying they disregarded warnings about madoff's dealings; they claimed ignorance. Much of the $ 162 million will be balanced by money katz and wilpon will receive as \" net losers \" from the scheme themselves. Katz and wilpon say they're due $ 178 million as madoff victims; they ' ll get a percentage of whatever picard can obtain from the beneficiaries of the scheme — money that will include the cash from their own settlement. So what does all this mean for the mets? wilpon and katz probably wouldn't have settled had it put their team ownership at risk, espn notes. But the team is still tens of millions of dollars in debt to bank of america and major league baseball, among others. The upshot: for wilpon and katz to maintain ownership of the team, they ' ll be counting on fans ' attendance.",

To date, he has secured some $ 9 billion — or about half his goal — much of it from madoff investors he has asserted were unjust beneficiaries of \"too good to be true \" returns. In his lawsuit against mr. Wilpon and mr. Katz, mr. Picard asserted that the men were sophisticated investors who were among those illegitimate beneficiaries. But mr. Picard suffered a number of setbacks. The lawsuit was removed from bankruptcy court, and jed s. Rakoff of the united states district court, who took over the case, both reduced mr. Picard's financial claims and raised the legal bar he would have to clear in order to collect. Still, if mr.

Obviously, like any victims of madoff's ponzi scheme, they won't recover every dollar. But they will get a certain percentage based on how much the trustee collects overall from net winners -- likely 50 percent or more. As a result, the wilpons ' actual payment to picard -- once the wilpons ' loser funds are reimbursed like other victims -- should be a fraction of the actual $ 162 million settlement.
