        "summary": "Japanese researchers have added to the \" nazca line \" mystery by uncovering yet another ancient geoglyph in peru, the smithsonian reports. The 98-foot-long bas-relief appears to depict a mythological creature that's sticking out its tongue, has many legs, and a body covered in spots, per a press release. What's it all about? interpretations of peruvian geoglyphs have varied, but the researchers, masato sakai and jorge olano, suggest this one is linked to ancient pilgrimages to a ceremonial center. Called cahuachi, the nazca center existed between about 1 ad and 500 ad in the central andes ' coastal area. In 2011, sakai and olano found another geoglyph near the path to cahuachi showing \" anthropomorphic figures \" in \" a scene of decapitation, \" they say. The latest find was made by pulling up dark-colored surface stones to reveal \" the underlying whitish ground \" and piling the stones in the shape of the animal, they explain. \" this is a characteristic technique of geoglyphs and [ the find ] may date back to 2,000 to 2,500 years ago, \" says sakai, per andina. \" taking into account there is an ancient path, between the two geoglyphs, heading to the cahuachi ceremonial site, we might say the figures are linked to a pilgrimage way to such religious place. \" the nazca lines were once thought of as calendars, but prevailing theory says they led to rituals performed for water and crop fertility, national geographic reports.

Reuters reports that the waller county district attorney sent the following text to the family attorney: \" looking at the autopsy results and toxicology, it appears she swallowed a large quantity of marijuana or smoked it in the jail. \" the houston chronicle quotes a judge who has seen the toxicology report as saying it shows \" high levels \" of pot in her system. \" i've had people ask me if that's relevant, \" says county judge trey duhon. \" right now, anything that can shed some light on her state of mind and health both at the time of the arrest and at the time of her booking is important to understanding her death. \" nbc reports that further tests are needed to determine when bland smoked or ingested the marijuana and what role, if any, it might have played in her arrest and death. A county prosecutor, meanwhile, says the autopsy shows that bland's body has no marks or abrasions that would be expected if she were involved in a violent struggle, and that the mark around her neck was uniform and thus consistent with suicide. Authorities have said she used a garbage can liner to hang herself. Meanwhile, abc news reports that the 28-year-old left a voicemail for a friend while in jail, after an initial court appearance. \" i ' m still just at a loss for words honestly at this whole process, \" she says on the 22-second message. \" how did switching lanes with no signal turn into all of this, i don't even know. \"",

Project blue book, an air force effort from 1947 to 1969 at ohio's wright-patterson air force base, investigated 12,618 strange sightings; greenewald says he has also included files from the project's predecessors, project sign and project grudge. Although the national archives has housed the ufo files on microfilm ( and other sites have posted partial info ), only greenewald had the stamina to spend the time \" collecting, programming, and converting \" all of it into an out-of-this world database. Project blue book was discontinued after it was determined that none of the ufos posed a threat to national security, that there was never any evidence of \" extraterrestrial vehicles, \" and that nothing that was witnessed was beyond the scope of modern-day technology, according to a national archives info sheet.

        "summary": "Vindication for all the skim-milk haters out there: a federal judge ruled florida is justified in labeling skim milk as \" imitation milk product \" if no vitamins are added to it, consumerist reports. In 2012, the florida department of agriculture told ocheesee creamery it had to start labeling its skim milk \" non-grade 'a ' milk product, natural milk vitamins removed \" because it wasn't adding vitamins to make up for the nutrients lost when the fat was skimmed off the top of the milk. The state argues skim milk has to have the same nutritional value as whole milk in order to be classified as milk, according to the ap. Ocheesee sued in 2014, accusing the government of impinging on its first amendment rights and forcing it to mislead customers — who, owner mary lou wesselhoeft says, \" knew exactly what they were buying. \" and while the dictionary may side with with ocheesee on the definition of skim milk — milk with the fat skimmed off — a federal judge this week found that the state has a right to set the standard for what constitutes milk. \"consumers take for granted the nutritional value of skim milk without even knowing that the vitamins have been restored, \" consumerist quotes the judge as saying. \"most consumers buy milk for its nutritional value, and most expect skim milk to include the same vitamin content as whole milk. \" meanwhile, ocheesee is throwing away \" thousands of gallons \" of skim milk, rather than labeling it \" imitation milk. \" skim milk accounted for about a quarter of ocheesee's profits, and an appeal is planned. ( in west virginia, lawmakers got sick suspiciously close to the passage of a bill about raw milk. )",

        "summary": "A sad twist in yesterday's horrific train derailment in the bronx: one of the four people killed when the train came off the rails at a riverside curve was lighting and sound expert jim lovell, who was on his way to help set up the famous rockefeller christmas tree for the holidays. The national transportation safety board has begun its investigation of the incident, which injured 63 people, 11 of them critically. Lovell also worked as a sound technician on the today show, where the executive producer says he is mourning his colleague, the wall street journal reports. Friends describe the 58-year-old as a free spirit, a keen historian, and a devoted father of four who had survived both cancer and open heart surgery in recent years. The other victims have been named as donna smith, a 54-year-old paralegal heading to the city with her sister to see handel's \" messiah, \" kisook ahn, 35, a registered nurse on her way home from a night shift, and james ferrari, 59, the new york times reports. The most seriously injured of the survivors is 43-year-old metropolitan transportation authority worker samuel rivera, who has a spinal cord injury and may never walk again, reports the new york daily news. Driver william rockefeller suffered unspecified injuries. The ntsb says its investigators will take around 10 days to probe the accident, which sent all seven of the train's cars and its locomotive off the tracks, reports the ap. The federal railroad administration has also sent a team of investigators, according to the bbc. Investigators have already recovered the event recorder — the train equivalent of a black box. New york gov. Andrew cuomo says the track doesn't appear to have been the problem, leaving speed as one of the likeliest causes. Survivors and witnesses say the train appeared to be going much faster than usual at the curve. Rockefeller, the train's driver, reported the same thing to the metropolitan transportation authority, the times reports. He told the first rescuers on the scene that he'd tried an emergency maneuver known as \" dumping the brakes, \" which involves slamming the emergency brakes on all the cars at once. Rockefeller suffered undisclosed injuries in the crash. He's a 15-year mta veteran, and his uncle tells the new york daily news that he's also \" been in fire departments, rescues.... Everything with him was safety. \" another source says he's \" traumatized over the accident. \"",

The whole performance is supposed to move quickly, and \" you just can't assemble the stage and break it down fast enough in the cold, \" the source says. And \" there's no plan right now of what to do in its place. \" it's not just the halftime show that's a problem, insiders say. \" there are a thousand things we didn't think about, \" notes one. \" the nfl is freaking out...

        "summary": "An experienced english climber who was halfway through a four-month trip through vietnam with his girlfriend has been found dead after attempting to summit the country's highest peak. Expecting to scale the 10,312-foot fansipan in a day, 22-year-old aiden webb set out at 6am last friday with only a small amount of food but soon fell, cut his arm open, hurt his knee, and lost his flashlight, reports the bbc. Using facebook messenger to communicate with girlfriend bluebell baughan, who'd stayed at the nearest town of sapa a few miles away, webb said he was \" determined \" to summit but by the next morning shared his location with baughan and asked for help. Then his phone stopped working. Webb's father and uncle both traveled to vietnam, arriving tuesday, and were eventually granted permission to use drones to search hard-to-reach ravines, reports the telegraph. Rangers found webb's body thursday afternoon near the location baughan had shared with local officials based on their facebook communication; local media reports he may have been dead for three days at that point. Friends and family raised roughly $ 9,000 to help pay for the 150-person search effort, while webb, who was nicknamed \" hercules \" for his strength, was honored across social media for his sense of humor and adventurous spirit. In one of his last posts, the climber wrote that he had just completed his first free solo ascent ( climbing without ropes or protective gear ) in late may and that he'd never \" had my mind so clear and empty. \" he added an apology to all family members \" who think i ' m loco and reckless, i ' m actually quite safe and know my limits. \" ( see why this climber blames himself for his wife's death. )",

Taylor died at the end of december at the age of 97, and oprah noted \" she lived as we all have lived: too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men.... For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dare speak the truth to the power of those men.

Would blab about church secrets. Documents indicate that the church ponied up $ 10,000 a week through an intermediary to two pis who said they were told to keep an eye on the comings and goings of the elder miscavige, who the village voice says reportedly defected from the church in 2012. The surveillance came to light when dwayne s. Powell was arrested in west allis, wis., in july 2013, not far from ronald miscavige's town. Powell, busted with six firearms, a couple thousand rounds of ammo, a gps tracking device, and a stun gun, first told cops he was house-hunting, the times notes, citing the records. Once at the police station, though, powell announced he'd been hired by the church to keep an eye on ronald \" full time. \" one of the most damning anecdotes in the documents: an episode in which powell thought the senior miscavige was having a heart attack and called his intermediary for advice. Powell said a man iding himself as david miscavige called him back. \" david told him that if it was ron's time to die, to let him die and not intervene in any way, \" the records say. Miscavige's attorney issued a statement without much wiggle room to the times: \" please be advised that mr. Miscavige does not know mr. Powell, has never heard of mr. Powell, has never met mr. Powell, has never spoken to mr. Powell, never hired mr. Powell, and never directed any investigations by mr. Powell, \" the denial reads.

Although the 48-year-old ex-nfler has long been a vocal critic of the \" reckless hits \" players take and iffy coaching decisions — often getting him in trouble with coaches and fans — he finally decided he had to take a stand and ditch his association with it all. \" i take full ownership of my alignment with the sport.

As a former seattle seahawks and arizona cardinals player, per si.com, he's been tested himself for brain damage ( he seems to be ok ). Cunningham admits it's difficult to leave a \" great \" job, one with a \" really nice six-figure salary \" and that he likely could've stayed in for decades to come.

The daily express notes that organizers attached burning torches to the bull's horns in front of a few hundred spectators, who watched as the frightened bull started freaking out, running in terror for a few seconds after it was untied, then dashing head-on into the post it had just been tethered to. Video footage shows the bull immediately fall to the ground motionless after head-butting the pole; local reports said it died instantly. The bull's death reinvigorates the debate swirling around bullfighting and animal cruelty, with animal rights advocates railing against it. \" how many lives will still be taken in the name of traditions that are nothing but barbarity? \" one such group posted on facebook. Despite spain's storied cultural history with the practice, various regions in the country have started decrying it, with most citizens being against national funding for this \" cultural asset, \" the independent notes. \" torturing animals is not fun, it's barbaric \" one commenter posted on a local newspaper site, per the metro.",

The republican is critical of his own party, the conservative movement, and, most of all, president trump. \" volatile unpredictability is not a virtue, \" he writes in conscience of a conservative: a rejection of destructive politics and a return to principle. Coverage: off track: flake tells npr that things were starting to go off track when he arrived in washington in 2001 as conservatives embraced big-government ideas such as president bush's no child left behind plan. \" when we couldn't argue that we were the party of limited government anymore, then that forced us into issues like flag burning or trying to intervene in the terri schiavo case, things that we wouldn't have done otherwise if we would have been arguing about true principles of limited government or spending. \" all this laid the groundwork for trump, he writes. In'denial ': in an excerpt at politico, flake accuses republicans of being in denial at the lack of \" normalcy \" in the trump white house. He explains his own rationale: \" so as i layered in my defense mechanisms, i even found myself saying things like, ' if i took the time to respond to every presiden­tial tweet, there would be little time for anything else. ' given the volume and velocity of tweets from both the trump campaign and then the white house, this was certainly true. But it was also a monumental dodge. \" he also says the president's tweets are \" all noise and no signal. \" the election: in the book, he describes the 2016 race as a \"sugar high of populism, nativism, and demagoguery, \" per the arizona republic. He faults trump \" on a litany of trumpian sins against conservative thought and action, from protectionism, to ducking entitlement reform, to praising dictators, and many things in-between, \" writes robert robb. He also calls out the president for his vilification of immigrants and opponents and his embrace of conspiracy theories. Bulworth: in the new york times, reviewer jennifer senior says flake \" has gone all ' bulworth ' on us, emulating that movie's devil-may-care truth-telling politician, \" especially in regard to his criticism of trump. She says it will make him a \" darling of the left \" for a while, but she also writes that he has mostly cast his votes in favor of trump policies and suggests his deeds aren't matching his words.

        "summary": "Henderson island, a south pacific island that has never been inhabited, is what a researcher calls \" one of the most pristine islands left in the world, \" per popular science. It's also one of the most polluted, home to an estimated 37.7 million pieces of plastic waste and other garbage over its 14 square miles; in some places, there were as many as 62 pieces per square foot. That's the highest density of trash ever reported in nature, say researchers, who spent three months on henderson island in 2015 and estimate some 3,750 new pieces of trash float onto its north beach each day, reports live science. \" the sheer volume really took my breath away for all the wrong reasons, \" study author jennifer lavers tells the atlantic. \" i don't think i've stood somewhere and been so utterly and completely surrounded by plastic. \" the debris — including fishing line, hardhats, toothbrushes, razors, lighters, and other \" disposable or single-use \" items that the researchers sourced to every continent but antarctica — isn't just ugly, reports the bbc. It has put two species of seabird at risk, \" creates a physical barrier on beaches to animals such as sea turtles, and lowers the diversity of shoreline invertebrates, \" says lavers, who saw a dead sea turtle wrapped in fishing line and hermit crabs making homes in bottle caps. She adds \" clean-up is not an option \" given the island's remote location and its inhospitable nature: there's no fresh water, and its sharp rocks cut into the researchers ' footwear. And the problem is likely worse than these numbers indicate, as the team's sampling only took into account items larger than 0.08 inches and found in the top 4 inches of sand. ( there's also plastic in the arctic. )",

Syed rizwan farook and tashfeen malik left behind a 6-month-old daughter. Few people know what it's like to be the child of a mass shooter because, as an expert explains, most shooters are childless or their children become victims. But zelia huberty knows what it's like. On july 18, 1984, she watched as her dad, james huberty, left their apartment in san ysidro, calif., telling his 12-year-old daughter that he'd never be back. Then he drove 200 yards to a mcdonald's and started shooting, killing 20 people and injuring 20 more before he was killed by a sniper's bullet. \" if i could go back in time i probably would have killed my father before any of this would have occurred, \" zelia huberty tells vocativ in her first interview in 30 years. \" i had a perfect view of it. I saw the car there. I saw everything. I saw people i knew, who i went to school with, \" she says. \" i wasn't thinking anything that time, except, ' better them than me. ' i know that's a horrible thing to say, but as a 12-year-old, that's the sort of thing you think. \" for 12 weeks, she kept silent in mandated therapy sessions. She took on an assumed name in high school — an expert says families of mass shooters \" often become demonized \" — and for a time feared she would become just like her old man. But \" i moved forward and proceeded with life, \" huberty says. \" i ' m a nurse, so i help others. And that's been my own therapy. \" what advice does she have for farook and malik's daughter, whom farook's sister is attempting to adopt, per the san bernardino sun? \" i would tell that little girl: you have a choice to make.

Here's what critics are saying: \" cruise is at his best \" in \" one of the most enjoyable movies of the year, \" writes colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune. He calls the film \" one of those increasingly rare beasts: a rousing, thought-provoking, cynical blockbuster. \" but it's also \" a morbidly fascinating comedy … delivering the kind of arsenic wit we haven't seen since goodfellas, \" he adds. Emily yoshida agrees. \" american made, which is consistently better than it has to be despite still hitting the occasional cliché pothole, is the best cruise has been in years, \" she writes at vulture. \" his strangely aging visage is as compelling as ever; at times it looks as if he's being physically dragged toward his 60s against his will \" and \" it serves the film well, \" she writes. The tale is \" superficially a condemnation of the hypocritical american impulse to take drug suppliers ' money with one hand and chastise users with the other, \" but the film fails to show why that story needed to be told on the big screen and essentially ignores seal's motives, writes simon abrams at rogerebert.com. The redeeming factor, however, is cruise. After all, \" you can't be seduced by the star of top gun in a book. \" leslie felperin is on the same page. The character of seal \" lacks depth and flavor \" and \" you get the feeling that you're just supposed to love the guy because he's played by tom cruise, \" felperin writes at the hollywood reporter. The film is also derivative, but at least liman \" applies plenty of stylistic top-spin to the bouncy, chatty screenplay by gary spinelli, compelling cruise to raise his game. \" the result is that cruise shows \" a sleazier edge than viewers expect from the usually clean-cut icon. \"",

Anders ericsson published a paper on the impact of 10,000 hours of deliberate practice on a musician's performance in 1993, his findings have become lore — and extended to a range of activities, such as medicine, chess, and sports. But while practice makes us better, its impact drops dramatically when comparing elite athletes, researchers report in the journal perspectives on psychological science. Analyzing 34 studies tracking 2,765 athletes, they find that while practice can explain 18 % of the differences in performance between all athletes, that drops to 1 % when looking only at those competing in world events like the olympics. New york magazine points to the astonishing performance of teen swimmer katie ledecky, whose ownership of the world's 10 fastest times in the women's 400-meter freestyle must be about more than hours of practice. \" practice is important to a point, but it stops differentiating who's good and who's great, \" brooke macnamara, a case western university psychologist and lead author of the study, tells scientific american. Ericsson, who's now at florida state, takes issue with the researchers'definition of \" deliberate practice, \" which he defines as teacher-directed assignments that provide immediate feedback. ( in the new study, the researchers included self-directed and other types of practice, not just teacher-directed practice. ) but he admits that this kind of super-directed practice is less common among athletes than, say, musicians. Macnamara, meanwhile, says her meta study could lead the way to future research that investigates the many factors that impact performance. \" i don't know if we ' ll ever be able to 100 % explain [ what makes a top athlete ], but i think we can do better than what we're doing now. \" ( one golfer is testing the rule. )",

Samuel oliver-bruno, 47, was arrested friday by ice at a morrisville, nc, office for us citizenship and immigration services. Oliver-bruno apparently believed he was there to provide fingerprints as part of his petition for deferred deportation, but ice was ready: \" the plainclothes ice officers forced samuel into a van in the rear of the office, where supporters who were waiting outside the office rushed to block the vehicle, \" says the immigrants-rights group alerta migratoria. When supporters refused to budge, 27 were arrested, including oliver-bruno's 19-year-old son daniel oliver-perez. Some backstory: oliver-bruno moved from mexico to greenville in 1994 and was arrested when he tried re-entering the us in 2014 for his wife's open-heart surgery, per the news &amp; observer. He was convicted and slated to be removed but for \" a variety of appeals and acts of discretion, \" says ice.

But after eight days, the caffeine-free group's hearing had recovered almost completely, whereas the caffeine group still had difficulty. \" our research confirmed that exposure to loud auditory stimuli coupled with daily consumption of 25mg/kg of caffeine had a clear negative impact on hearing recovery, \" researcher faisal zawawi says.

            "Importance noise-induced hearing loss is an increasingly worrisome problem. Although caffeine intake is common in people involved in noise-related environments, the effect of caffeine on the recovery of hearing after a temporary threshold shift requires further understanding. Objectives to determine whether caffeine impairs hearing recovery in a guinea pig model exposed to acoustic overstimulation. Design, setting, and subjects this experiment at the mcgill university auditory sciences laboratory used 24 female albino guinea pigs ( age, 6 months; weight, 500-600 g ) divided randomly into 3 groups of 8 animals each. Group 1 was exposed to caffeine; group 2, acoustic overstimulation events ( aoses ); and group 3, both. Data were collected from july 1, 2013, to march 30, 2014, and analyzed from april 1 to august 1, 2014.

The results are published in the journal of the american medical association. Since both caffeine intake and noise related hearing loss are so common in our society, these findings could have a significant impact on the general population, especially for those who ingest high doses of caffeine regularly.

        "summary": "They were brothers bound by a crime — and ultimately separated by the supreme court. The bbc has the story of sammy and david maldonado, who on the evening of aug. 13, 1980, met some teens at devil's pool in pennsylvania. Sammy and david eventually decided to make off with a box the others had with them, hoping it held valuables. Sammy took it, david grabbed a steak knife, and 19-year-old steven monahan chased after the two. Sammy says he dropped the box; monahan took him to the ground, and david stabbed monahan twice, piercing his aorta. The two brothers were convicted of second-degree felony murder and handed mandatory life sentences without the chance for parole. But now david is out and sammy remains behind bars 37 years later — even though he didn't commit the murder. That's because the supreme court in 2012 ruled mandatory life sentences for juveniles are unconstitutional. David was 17 when the murder occurred; sammy was 18 years, 4 months, and 10 days old. \" sammy didn't do the stabbing, he got beat up, \" says a lawyer for the brothers. \" he is far less culpable than david. \" but as a court document explains, because sammy was an accomplice \" in the perpetration of a felony \" — the felony being the robbery of the box — he, too, was guilty of murder in the second degree. The bbc looks into the science of brain development to make the argument that it's not finished until we're 24 or 25, which one could argue doesn't jibe with our legal system's definition of an adult. It's an idea that's \" gaining some traction. \" as for what was in that box: a report card, $ 10 bill, steak knife, pink comb and brush, red towel, and lone black sock. Read the full story here.",

        "summary": "\" we tend to think that objects in the sky have always been the way we view them, \" says planetary scientist matt siegler. But that most viewable of objects — our moon — hasn't always looked as it does today, according to siegler and his colleagues. They believe that some 3 billion years ago, in a process that took some 1 billion years to complete, the moon's axis was nudged 125 miles, or 6 degrees. Siegler provides a great visual: \" it would be as if earth's axis relocated from antarctica to australia. As the pole moved, the man on the moon turned his nose up at the earth. \" the finding was born of research into lunar polar hydrogen: where the sun doesn't shine, this hydrogen should take the form of ice; where it does, the hydrogen boils off, a press release explains. The christian science monitor reports that in 1998, scientists found hydrogen deposits, believed to be composed of ice, where they seemingly shouldn't be: not at the north and south poles, but 6 degrees off those poles. Now, a deeper dive into data gathered by nasa established that the offset occurred in identical amounts, and in precisely opposite directions, leading to the team's theory, published wednesday in nature. The axis shift gains the moon entry into a small group of so-called \" true polar wanderers \": mars, enceladus and europa ( moons of saturn and jupiter, respectively ), and earth. Ian garrick-bethell, who reviewed the paper for nature, says the theory raises two big questions: why wasn't a dragging trail of ice formed over the billion-year shift, and why didn't the hydrogen boil off in its new sun-touched position? the bbc reports the team suggests the ice might have been buried as asteroids hit the planet.",

Per abc 30, police said the boy's parent was not at home at the time, but that two adults were. Police said they have obtained a search warrant and were processing the scene in order to determine how the boy got his hands on the gun. Fresno police told ksee the boy was in critical condition from a gunshot wound to the head when they arrived. California law stipulates that firearms must be stored safely, such as with a cable lock, in areas where a child could be present. Criminal charges may be filed in instances where police determined safe storage has not occurred, per the state's department of justice website. In this specific case, fresno pd said they are working to determine what, if any, charges would be filed.",

Actor will ferrell was in a serious car crash thursday night in orange county, calif., with a 30-second video recorded by la-oc.tv and now on tmz showing a dented-up black suv with shattered windows after the accident. The hollywood reporter and los angeles times report the suv flipped after being sideswiped by a toyota around 11pm on interstate 5. Inside the suv: ferrell ( who was a passenger ) and three others. The video clip shows the 50-year-old funnyman talking on a phone while being loaded into an ambulance on a stretcher. Ferrell had been in san diego earlier that evening to appear at a funny or die event, per the washington post. No one in ferrell's vehicle appears to have suffered life-threatening injuries, and ferrell himself has already been released from the hospital, his rep tells tmz. It's not clear if anyone was injured in the toyota that hit the suv. Although tmz reported on open beer bottles being spotted on the road at the site of the crash, cops say neither alcohol nor drugs played any part in the crash, and no arrests have been made, though they're still looking into the accident.",

A judge will rule tuesday on whether the canadian-born senator is eligible to appear on the june 7 republican primary ballot in the state, per the star-ledger. On monday, three residents and a catholic university of america law professor argued cruz isn't eligible to run for president according to the constitution. Professor victor williams, a trump supporter, says cruz became a us citizen when he was born to a cuban father and american mother in alberta. He is not, however, a \" natural-born \" us citizen because he wasn't born on us soil, williams says, per the ap. Similar arguments were denied late last month in pennsylvania, where a judge wrote that a natural-born citizen \" includes any person who is a united states citizen from birth, \" per nbc news. Cruz's lawyer agrees, noting cruz is a natural-born citizen because his mother was a citizen, but also says the state doesn't have the authority to decide cruz's eligibility, reports philly.com. It's clear which way donald trump is hoping the decision will go, as the gop winner will nab 51 delegates and trump is scrambling to get the 1,237 needed to wrap up the nomination.

Here's what people are saying — and again, spoiler warning in effect: the felina episode \" closed out a great series in style, with visual flair, action, and a thorough lack of phony redemption, \" writes james poiewozik at time. It wasn't the best or most ambitious episode, but \" that's ok. Because what ' felina ' was — as effective, satisfying series finales are — was true. \" true to the show's heart, and true to walter white's journey. While it gives walt a victory it \" is also conscious of what walt cannot engineer. He cannot get his family to love him again. \" it \" may be the first recorded ( and distinctly over-tweeted ) perfect finale in television history, \" writes mary mcnamara at the la times. \" it contained the holy grail of all storytelling: an actual moment of truth. \" when walt admitted to skyler that he had done all of this for himself, he was \" speaking for every mobster, criminal, dictator, and king … who has ever used love of family or god or country as an excuse. \" the rest of the episode \" was just routine cleanup, \" albeit \" splendidly accomplished. \" but willa paskins at slate is annoyed that after all his misdeeds \" walt was rewarded with a death on his own terms, \" protecting the audience from dealing with the ramifications of rooting for this monster. This does nicely prevent the audience from being \" gleeful and bloodthirsty about his death, \" but our bloodlust is just redirected to the neo-nazis, \" as if we needed breaking bad to tell us nazis are the worst. \" alan sepinwall has a different qualm: \" was it ultimately too neat? \" he asks. Throughout the series, walt's plans invariably go awry, so it felt wrong that everything went perfectly. Last week's penultimate episode \" suggested a world in which heisenberg was dead and useless, but ' felina ' brought him back to life. \" still, give it this: \" in an era where the great dramas so often overreach, obfuscate, or stumble in their conclusions, this was definitive. These were the final, unmistakable steps on the path walter white put us on nearly six years ago.",

            "California department of public health ( cdph ) director and state health officer dr. Karen smith today announced the department is investigating a case of human plague in california, and conducting an environmental evaluation in the stanislaus national forest, yosemite national park and the surrounding areas. The department began investigating this incident after a child from los angeles county became ill and was hospitalized after visiting the stanislaus national forest and camping at crane flat campground in yosemite national park in mid-july. No other members of the camping party reported symptoms and health officials are continuing to monitor the child's family and treatment providers. The child is recovering. Plague is an infectious bacterial disease that is carried by squirrels, chipmunks and other wild rodents and their fleas. When an infected rodent becomes sick and dies, its fleas can carry the infection to other warm-blooded animals or humans. \"human cases of plague are rare, with the last reported human infection in california occurring in 2006, \" dr. Smith said. \"although this is a rare disease, people should protect themselves from infection by avoiding any contact with wild rodents. Never feed squirrels, chipmunks, or other rodents in picnic or campground areas, and never touch sick or dead rodents. Protect your pets from fleas and keep them away from wild animals, \" dr. Smith added. Cdph is working closely with",

Fears that a white supremacist gang is targeting law enforcement officials spread even to houston, where the chief prosecutor has gone under 24-hour protection. Authorities are investigating links between the murders of kaufman county district attorney mike mclelland, his assistant prosecutor mark hasse, and colorado prison chief tom clements. In other developments: a neighbor of the mclellands says he heard a possible attack happening early on saturday. \" it was five or six shots, one right after the other, \" he said. While officials see links between the mclelland and hasse killings, police recovered.223-caliber shell casings at the former but none at the latter, the new york times reports. An official said hasse's killer may have been a more experienced assassin from the same group. More is emerging on the history of mclelland's office and the aryan brotherhood of texas, a \" whites-only \" prison gang. His prosecutors conducted a multi-year racketeering investigation that indicted 34 alleged brotherhood members last year, including four leaders. A prosecutor called it a \" devastating blow \" and warned that the gang used violence against \" those who... Pose a threat to the enterprise. \"",

It found the berms collected maybe 1,000 barrels of the estimated 5 million spilled. By contrast, other damage-control efforts — including burning and skimming — collected somewhere between 890,000 and 1.85 million barrels, concludes the report from the national oil spill commission. It calls the amount captured \" minuscule \" compared to the \" overwhelmingly expensive \" cost. The report says the federal decision to approve the berms — and charge bp for them — was done mostly to appease louisiana politicians, reports the wall street journal.

Mcclendon instructed his subordinates to execute the conspiratorial agreement, which included, among other things, withdrawing bids for certain leases and agreeing on the allocation of interests in the leases between the conspiring companies. \"while serving as ceo of a major oil and gas company, the defendant formed and led a conspiracy to suppress prices paid to leaseholders in northwest oklahoma, \" said assistant attorney general bill baer of the justice department's antitrust division. \"his actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land.",

What the hungarian jewish congregations ' association ( mazsihisz ) is insisting upon, per reuters: the government must ditch plans to build a monument in budapest that would portray hungary as \" a victim of german aggression, \" must stop downplaying its wartime government's role, and must acknowledge that local citizens helped the nazis deport and kill hungarian jews. The monument's \" symbolism would significantly contribute to averting the national responsibility, \" reads a mazsihisz statement. Mazsihisz also has a problem with a memorial center being built in budapest near a train station that was used to deport jews, and with the newly appointed director of a history institute who called the 1941 deportation of foreign jews who sought shelter in hungary \" a policy procedure for foreign nationals, \" the ap reports.

        "summary": "Up until last week, mike chen was working on a blood pressure tracking app called bettir. Then, four days ago, he took 20 minutes to put together a side project he'd been thinking about called magic, and to say it's overshadowed bettir would be an understatement. The idea: you text what you want — anything legal, from flowers for your girlfriend to takeout sushi to a wrench — to a number, and the magic team works out the details and has it delivered to you, anywhere in the us and as soon as possible... Just like magic. \" this is something that i've always wanted to create to make my life easier, \" chen explains to mashable. He sent the new site to a few friends, figuring if they liked it, he'd improve the site ( the original landing page was pretty sad-looking ) and then do an official launch. Instead, the site immediately went viral. After the magic team ( at first just two or three people who were also working on bettir ) sent the aforementioned wrench to a customer, the site was posted on product hunt and hacker news ( it was no. 1 on the latter within 20 minutes, techcrunch reports ). By yesterday morning, the team — now at 18 people, with bettir put on the back burner — had gotten nearly 18,000 requests. The \" magicians, \" as they're calling themselves, fulfilled the aforementioned requests and even weirder ones, like getting someone's parking ticket dismissed. ( one they're still working on: a guy requested a tiger, the legality of which is not yet clear. ) the site makes money by adding on what is currently a \" slight markup \" to the cost of whatever it is you're having done; for now, chen says, they're mostly \" guesstimating. \" chen has barely slept, and the requests are still pouring in. \" twitter came out of another company that was doing something completely different.

The government is defending the agent's actions in the scheme to connect with potential criminal targets.

The account was created after arquiett was arrested for alleged involvement with a drug ring in 2010; she didn't find out about it until a friend asked about the pictures later that year, buzzfeed notes. Before arquiett's trial began, sinnigen established the facebook page and used it to communicate with a fugitive and investigate the drug ring. Prince, whose probation sentence in the case has ended, is now suing sinnigen, citing endangerment and a breach of privacy; her lawsuit claims he used the facebook account for at least three months without her knowledge. Officials argue that in allowing access to her phone for use in criminal probes, she \" implicitly \" approved the use of her photos. Outside experts aren't so sure: \" i may allow someone to come into my home and search, \" says one, \" but that doesn't mean they can take the photos from my coffee table and post them online. \" the case doesn't appear to be isolated: officials have previously used fake facebook profiles; the washington post notes that may not be illegal, but doing so does break site rules,",

Nancy black, a local marine biologist and co-owner of monterey bay whale watch, caught the latest attack on camera ( which you can watch here, about 30 seconds in ). She called this week's events \" unprecedented, \" and told the guardian that she hasn't seen this type of behavior from orcas in her 30-year career. The pod of killer whales, which she calls emma's group, is highly skilled and managed to separate a gray whale calf from its mother in just 20 minutes, a maneuver that black estimates typically averages one to two hours, reports the san jose mercury news. \" it's kind of exciting to see this group and how they've gotten really good at hunting, \" she says. Black has several theories on why the hunt has been so aggressive, including a later spring migration of gray whales to the area, due to traveling further south in mexico than usual this winter. \" it's still a mystery, \" black says of how the orcas know when and where to hunt gray whales, \" but they are very intelligent. \" she also posited that the killer whales may be binge-feeding ( a whale meal can feed an orca pod for two days ) and that the orcas could be teaching their young to hunt, with the youngest hunter in emma's group, called little b, just under six months old.

Police also closed off a street near trafalgar square to traffic and a gathering crowd. At one point the man stood on the head of the statue — of prince george, the first duke of cambridge — and then sat on george's head. He finally came down after about three hours and was taken away by police under the mental health act, the bbc reports. \" i just laughed, \" said a woman visiting from the us. \" it's an experience. \" but the owner of a pub complained that business owners lost money when police cordoned off the road; he also wondered why \" one naked man \" required eight police cars, two fire trucks, and four mounted police. But a scotland yard rep said that \" in a situation like this, public safety is paramount. \"",
