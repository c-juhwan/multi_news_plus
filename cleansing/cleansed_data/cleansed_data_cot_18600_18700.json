Colton tooley colton tooley looking around, he noticed others glancing at their cellphones and registering the same worry he was feeling. The warning sent throughout campus by administrators was prompted by reports that a young man, clad in black, wearing a ski mask and wielding a semiautomatic ak-47, had fired shots as he entered the southern edge of campus. The gunman, 19-year-old ut student colton tooley, fatally shot himself after police chased him into a library. No one else was injured. Within 15 minutes of the first police calls, sirens, e-mails, the ut website and public address systems blared the warnings, telling more than 55,000 students, faculty and staff members that the campus was in lockdown and urging everyone to stay behind locked doors. Meanwhile, law enforcement from the university, city and state swarmed to the site. Ut's efficient alarm system – practiced and coordinated by law enforcement only weeks before – was credited by local and national experts with probably sparing the campus from injuries and death. The incident began at 8: 10 a.m. When witnesses said they saw a man walk down the street about 100 yards south of the ut tower and begin shooting bursts of gunfire, first in the air and then toward the tower. Terrified students notified police, who quickly responded. Austin police chief art acevedo said students pointed city and university police toward the man, who was chased into the perry-castañeda library about two blocks east of the initial gunfire. Tooley, a sophomore from austin majoring in math and actuarial studies, ran to the sixth floor and shot himself, police said. Officers didn't speculate on tooley's motive.

But that doesn't mean the ex-new england patriot is going to be a free man any time soon. Hernandez is currently serving life without parole for murdering an acquaintance in 2013. The double murder charges stemmed from an altercation that reportedly started over a spilled drink and ended with daniel de abreu and safiro furtado dead. According to cnn, hernandez was acquitted of all eight charges related to the double murder except for a single weapons possession charge. The judge added four to five years to the end of hernandez's current life sentence for that charge. Hernandez's defense team cites a lack of evidence as the reason for the acquittal and claims hernandez's friend, who testified against him, is the actual killer. One of the eight charges against hernandez was for witness intimidation for allegedly shooting the friend in the face to keep him from testifying. An attorney for hernandez says the 27-year-old is \" relieved \" about the verdict. The attorney tells the boston globe he hopes people will now see hernandez \" for who he is — a very good young man. \" the district attorney says there's \" some consolation \" that hernandez will remain behind bars regardless.

        "summary": "Bill cosby showed up to a district court outside philadelphia wednesday afternoon and was arraigned on a sexual assault charge, the ap reports. He was fingerprinted and then released on $ 1 million bail pending trial, with the next court hearing set for jan. 14. A sampling of the coverage swirling around the case: how much prison time does he face? criminal defense experts tell time that there are many variables, but ultimately he could face up to a decade behind bars. The formal charge is aggravated indecent assault, and it carries a 10-year maximum sentence, but in pennsylvania, the standard sentencing range is 22 to 36 months — but a former da in a neighboring county believes that because the allegations are so serious ( involving alleged past sexual harassment and alleged use of incapacitating drugs, among other things ) cosby would get more than three years if found guilty. Read the criminal complaint. The los angeles times has the 23-page document, which includes the allegation: \" william henry cosby did penetrate the genitals of the complainant with a part of his body while the complainant was unconscious. \" read the original media report on the cosby scandal. After andrea constand accused cosby of sexual assault in 2005, and settled a civil lawsuit against him in 2006, people published a story in 2006 about three other women who said cosby had also drugged and assaulted them. Msn has it here. Could los angeles be next? multiple women say cosby assaulted them in la, and the los angeles times reports that the lapd is investigating one case, that of a woman who says cosby assaulted her in 2008, when she was 18. Though the statute of limitations is generally six years in adult sex-crime cases, legal experts say that a california law may mean he could face criminal charges in la as well. Read a timeline of the charges. Vulture has put one together, looking at the case from nov. 2002 ( when constand first met cosby ) to the current day.",

But now new research published in the journal nature communications suggests that these ornaments were in fact a \" signaling structure \" that attracted prospective mates.

Studying 111 skulls of theropods — which live science reports were mostly carnivorous and bipedal dinosaurs, t. Rex and albertosaurus among them — researchers found that 20 of the 22 biggest had bony structures protruding from their skulls, while only one of the dinosaurs smaller than 80 pounds did.

The study, which focused on theropods — a group of mostly carnivorous, bipedal dinosaurs that includes the giant tyrannosaurus rex and fearsome albertosaurus — could explain why these dinosaurs got big so fast, the researchers said.

This picture was taken on nov. 10, 2003 at the smithsonian national museum of natural history. Some dinosaurs that had bony protrusions on their skulls — such as horns, crests and knobs — evolved into giant dinosaurs 20 times faster than their relatives without skull ornaments did, a new study finds. The study, which focused on theropods — a group of mostly carnivorous, bipedal dinosaurs that includes the giant tyrannosaurus rex and fearsome albertosaurus — could explain why these dinosaurs got big so fast, the researchers said. Paleontologists have hypothesized for years that these bony protrusions on dinosaur skulls served to intimidate, defend and communicate, possibly signaling which individuals were sexually mature or socially dominant, the researchers said.

The los angeles times reports on a government contract with accenture, which has been tasked with \" the full life cycle of the hiring process \" for about 5,000 new border patrol agents, as well as 2,500 or so other government jobs. That hiring process includes recruiting efforts all the way up to formal job offers. The contract, which can extend for up to five years, will pay out nearly $ 43 million in its first year alone, per government records. It's being described as one of president trump's largest outlay of funds yet for border protection. He signed an executive order shortly after being inaugurated calling for the cbp to up its agent count by 5,000 ( it's nearly 2,000 agents short of what it's required to have, per congress ). Accenture, which will be supplementing the agency's internal hiring processes, beat out four other bidders for the contract, which some aren't so sure makes financial sense. \" they're spending almost $ 40,000 per hire, \" says a cato institute policy analyst, who says \" that seems like a pretty desperate move \" and perhaps unnecessary, as illegal immigrant apprehensions are now at an all-time low. In a statement, cbp defends the contract, noting the total amount also includes startup costs for recruiting. It also argues it needs help with hiring, which has taken a hit recently due to \" changing generational values, the statewide legalization of marijuana, and a growing distrust of law enforcement, \" among other reasons.",

On a typical day, cbp welcomes nearly one million visitors to the united states, screens more than 67,000 cargo containers, arrests more than 1,100 individuals and seizes nearly six tons of illicit drugs. That presents a special set of customer-experience challenges, according to suzanne shepherd, cbp's director of travel and tourism initiatives, including the agency's electronic system for travel authorization. Cbp has adopted a multi-pronged approach to improving customer service, including conducting traveler satisfaction surveys, establishing a 24-hour call center for business travelers, adding point-of-contact services managers at ports of entry for international travelers, automating paper forms to reduce redundancies, and developing self-service tools for travelers, including kiosks, mobile-friendly sites and an online information center many of those initiatives involved taking a closer look at the underlying processes and finding ways for travelers and businesses to use self-service tools and, for instance, use their smart device to submit information. \"it lowers costs and enables cbp officers to focus more on the inspection and less on administrative functions, \" shepherd said."

A candlelight vigil was held sunday in memory of 8-year-old gabriella doolin, who was found murdered near the high school football stadium on saturday night. A 7-year-old girl was found dead on saturday night near a high school football stadium and police suspect murder. Around 600 people in the community came together for a vigil on the scottsville town square on sunday to pray and remember gabriella doolin. The doolin family were attending a youth football game at allen county-scottsville high school when gabby disappeared in the small crowd. Brian and amy doolin lost their daughter in the crowd at 7: 40 p.m. They immediately asked the stadium announcer to call her name. \"it came over the intercom the third time and they shut it down, \" said family friend mike willoughby. \"we quit and the entire community started looking for her. We had a complete lockdown of the school. I mean it was super quick. \" it wasn't quick enough. Gabby doolin was found in a creek, apparently murdered, about 400 yards away from the stadium. The news has been unbearable for people in scottsville, which has a population of about 4,000. More than 500 people attended the candlelight vigil. Even brian and amy doolin attended, held upright by and encircled by love. \"we, as a community brian, stand with you. This whole town stands with you tonight, \" said pastor keith patrick. \"we are praying for you. We are crying with you. We are mourning with you. \" \"we are a great city, a great community, \" said willoughby. \"we love one another. You never expect it. But it's a constant reminder that evil has no borders or boundaries. \"just like paris, you wake up and something happens like that in your own backyard. \" no one attempted an explanation for what happened, they simply said to pray for the family and pray for justice. \"i love you. I ain't no speaker, but i have love in my heart, \" said brian dooley at the vigil. \"hold those babies tight. I'd love to hold gabby just one more time, just hold her tight. \" allen county sheriff jeff cooke posted a message to the family and community on his personal facebook page, which was then shared by the sheriff's office.

Yet elizabeth swaney has caused a hubbub in pyeongchang, after turning in what digg labels a \" hilariously mediocre \" ski run on the halfpipe. Today notes the us-born swaney, who's competing for hungary, \" leisurely skied \" the route on monday in an \" oddly captivating qualifying run \" — notable because she offered up exactly zero aerial maneuvers, jumps, or other tricks like her competitors. Nbc news and the denver post explain that swaney was able to qualify for the olympics due to a complicated system that involves country quotas, injuries, and the fact that turning in a top-30 performance at world cup events — which sets one on the path to the olympics — apparently isn't that hard to do. Swaney went to a bunch of those competitions and simply managed to \" not end up dead last, \" as one longtime judge tells the post. The key to that: she never fell because of her easy courses. Thus, she qualified for the olympics in what deadspin calls \" something between a scam and a tale of perseverance. \" however, she didn't see success in monday's run: she actually did come in dead last, finishing 24th, and won't be moving on. She tells reuters she's \" really disappointed \" but has no regrets about her experience. \" i want to show others that freestyle skiing is possible and it is never too late to get into this sport, \" she says. Today notes swaney only started freestyle skiing in 2013. Check out digg to see video of the qualifying run. ( this us skier's boyfriend just got booted from the olympics. )",

In time, the young blood boosted activity in older stem cells, which produced new muscle tissue and neurons more easily than before, the washington post reports. Other researchers simply injected blood or injected a protein in young blood called gdf11 and also saw positive results. But can all this benefit an aging society and increase human longevity? we won't know until it's tested on people; one researcher says he plans human studies later this year, and hopes to treat alzheimer's. Now, the caveats: rejuvenating old body parts could actually increase incidence of cancer if stem cells multiply uncontrollably, a professor warns, and science notes that none of the treated mice have actually lived longer. Then, there's the creepiness of swapping blood: \" it sounds terribly, terribly weird, i have to say, \" says one expert. \" but it's a good way to go. \"",

Yet the fu yuan yu leng 999 was not a fishing boat. Its crew, who now face jail time in ecuador for environmental crimes, were likely not the fishermen. To fish commercial quantities of shark, you need tens of thousands of meters of thick fishing line, big, motorized winches, and piles of hooks, each the size of an adult finger. That sort of gear was not on board. Rather, the chinese ship was a carrier vessel, whose job was to collect and deliver to port the illegal catch of other fishing boats. Its",

Officials at the galápagos national park had called in the navy to investigate the chinese-flagged vessel, which had been sailing through the area's marine reserve without explanation. It didn't take long to find the cargo. Roughly 300 tons of marine species lay heaped in piles onboard, including more than 6,600 dead sharks. Most of those were hammerheads, but authorities also found silky, thresher and mako sharks as well — all of which are off-limits to industrial fishers within the marine reserve.

Last week, the surviving members of monty python held a press conference in london to announce their reunion. The last time the group performed together was in 1998 at the u.s. Comedy arts festival in colorado. The group's surviving members include idle, john cleese, terry gilliam, terry jones and michael palin. ( the sixth python member, graham chapman, died in 1989. ) monty python's reunion production is expected to consist of a mix of new and existing material. It remains unclear if the group will take the show to the u.s. On a reddit session last week, cleese indicated that they may \" possibly \" take the show to new york.

Lee didn't even believe the deacon from mount olive baptist church when he got the call, because his wife had been interred in a sealed concrete vault. But sure enough, when he arrived at riceville cemetery, lee recognized the casket, which had floated at least 50 yards before it stopped along a guardrail, khou reports. \" i didn't want to look inside because i'd never get that out of my mind, \" he tells the chronicle. According to an inspector lee commissioned: the vault wasn't sealed correctly, and there were no built-in holes to allow floodwaters to pass in and out, the newspaper notes. \" clearly something went wrong here, \" lee's lawyer, annie mcadams, says, per the chronicle. \" bodies are not supposed to come up. \" lee's lawsuit against robinson funeral home not only alleges negligence in burying his wife, but also says it caused him anguish after his wife's \" charcoaled and sunken \" face was described to him, the paper says. \" i was distraught. … i couldn't believe this happened. … it reopened the wound i had, \" he tells khou. An injunction was filed on lee's behalf yesterday to keep the gravesite clear while they try to figure out what happened. \" we want to make sure that everybody that's buried there has the proper vaulting so this never happens to another family, \" mcadams tells khou. Meanwhile, another local funeral home has stepped up to the plate and will re-inter lee's wife free of charge, the chronicle notes.

Kim yo jung, who was blacklisted by the us treasury department in january over \" severe human rights abuses, \" has long been an influential member of her brother's government, helping create his public image in her role as the vice-director of pyongyang's propaganda and agitation department, cnn reports. At the same meeting saturday, kim jong un claimed that his country's nuclear weapons program has proven to be a \" powerful deterrent \" against the \" protracted nuclear threats of the u.s.

But an email from the school's center for students with disabilities, part of the larger student federation, put the kibosh on her plans, informing her that the classes had been canceled. Scharf figured it was a money issue and volunteered to teach for free, but she soon found out the real reason, the washington post reports. \" i have heard from a couple students and volunteers [ who ] feel uncomfortable with how we are doing yoga, \" a center rep emailed her. \" yoga has been under a lot of controversy lately due to how it is being practiced and what practices from what cultures... They are being taken from. Many of these cultures are cultures that have experienced oppression, cultural genocide, and diasporas due to colonialism and western supremacy. \" and there is indeed a movement against yoga's commercialization, including from the hindu american foundation, whose \" take back yoga \" campaign has been fighting what it believes to be a form of cultural appropriation. But scharf tells the cbc her classes focused solely on the physical benefits of yoga, not religious or spiritual aspects, and she notes to the post that she even offered to simply \" rebrand \" her program to be a \" mindful stretching \" class for people with disabilities, with zero mention of \" yoga \" — an idea the student federation rep initially seemed ok with, until \" higher-ups \" said they couldn't get a french name for the class in bilingual canada. Yahoo news canada notes there've been some online jabs at the incident, including a daily news reporter who tweeted, \" also cancelled: rock ' n roll. \" oddly, the university tweeted out monday that \" free yoga classes are still offered on campus by #uottawa, \" with a link to upcoming dates and times.

        "summary": "Good news for consumers who've had to play the waiting game to pay off medical debt: the three largest credit-reporting agencies in the us are working together to overhaul their systems to take better care of customer issues and the way medical debt is handled, reuters reports. In a settlement with new york state attorney general eric schneiderman, experian, equifax, and transunion have agreed that medical debt won't pop up on customers ' credit reports until after 180 days — giving customers more time to receive any insurance money that may still be trickling in. And, even if a medical debt ends up landing on one's report anyway, it has to be taken off asap once the insurance funds eventually come in and the consumer is able to pay it off. The plan, announced today, will start coming into play over the next six to 39 months, the wall street journal reports. The medical debt changes are probably the most noteworthy in the settlement, as 52 % of all overdue debt on credit reports is medical debt, per the consumer financial protection bureau. But other changes are also afoot: trained employees, for instance, will now be on hand to resolve disputes between creditors and consumers. Even if a creditor insists its info is correct, the credit-reporting agency will re-review all documentation anyway; in the past, once the lender said the info was correct, the process stopped there, and the consumer was stuck with that data on his or her credit report, notes the journal. The changes are \" a good sign that the reporting agencies are finally willing to step up their game and respond to the needs of hardworking consumers and their families, \" schneiderman said in an emailed statement to the journal.

Photo ms. Merkel's visit, the first by a major european leader since the start of the debt crisis in 2009, capped her recent efforts to show a renewed dedication to european solidarity after years of harsh words about greece and europe's other laggard economies.

Samaras in greece are the most amenable interlocutors she is ever going to have to work with. The debt crisis has brought down governments in ireland, italy, portugal and spain, but it has radically transformed the political landscape here in greece. In two destabilizing rounds of elections in may and june that eventually yielded mr. Samaras's coalition, the centrist parties saw their historic support plummet while a leftist opposition party surged and neo-nazis entered parliament. \"it's the outcome of the june 17 elections, the perception that this is the best government",

Thousands of protestors streamed into syntagma square despite a ban on protests and a security lock down.

Her trip also seemed to signify the dawning realization in berlin that as nettlesome as the current leaders of southern europe may have been at times, mario monti in italy, mariano rajoy in spain and mr. Samaras in greece are the most amenable interlocutors she is ever going to have to work with. The debt crisis has brought down governments in ireland, italy, portugal and spain, but it has radically transformed the political landscape here in greece. In two destabilizing rounds of elections in may and june that eventually yielded mr. Samaras's coalition, the centrist parties saw their historic support plummet while a leftist opposition party surged and neo-nazis entered parliament. \"it's the outcome of the june 17 elections, the perception that this is the best government",
            "\" i think that recently the pace of reform has picked up considerably, \" merkel said on her first visit to greece since the debt crisis erupted here in 2009. Seven thousand police officers and rooftop snipers and commandos were in place to provide protection for the german leader. Thousands of protestors streamed into syntagma square despite a ban on protests and a security lock down. Tv pictures showed protestors dressed as nazi soldiers holding nazi flags, while other protestors threw rocks at police who fired tear gas. Swelling anti-german sentiment in greece has revived haunting memories of greece's nazi occupation, which led to thousands of deaths. Cnbc's carolin roth reported that many in the crowd were holding banners saying 'merkel not welcome '. The german leader's visit came as the latest economic forecasts from the international monetary fund ( imf ) showed the country will miss the five-year debt reduction target that underpins greece's 130 billion euro ( $ 169 billion ) bailout. ( read more: pay no attention to imf, look at companies: gartman. ) the imf forecast that greek public debt will rise to 171 percent of gross domestic product ( gdp ) this year and 182 percent in 2013."

Now oklahoma republicans are making a push to build a $ 300,000 gas chamber in the oklahoma state penitentiary in mcalester, using nitrogen gas as a backup plan to lethal injection in executions, the ap reports. The move comes as the state awaits a supreme court decision on oklahoma's previous three-drug execution mix ( which includes midazolam ), which was involved in clayton lockett's botched injection last year. Rep. Mike christian explains to the ap that nitrogen gas would be a painless execution, as it simply leads to hypoxia ( lack of oxygen in the bloodstream ), akin to a pilot losing consciousness at high altitudes. \" you wouldn't need a medical doctor to do it, \" christian says. \" it's a lot more practical. It's efficient. \" arizona, california, missouri, and wyoming are the only states that currently permit gas executions, though they still use lethal injection as the primary method; no state has ever used nitrogen gas ( cyanide is a traditional gas chamber drug ). The two current backup methods allowed under oklahoma law are the electric chair and firing squad, though christian is considering lobbying for an end to the chair. The two bills that would make the gas chamber the new preferred backup plan if lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional are set for oklahoma legislative hearings this week, though a spokesman for the oklahoma coalition to abolish the death penalty thinks pols are going about the issue the wrong way. \" we're scrambling around trying to figure out humane ways to kill someone, \" he says. \" there isn't a right way to do the wrong thing. \" ( about 20 % of americans are all for bringing back the gas chamber. )",

The reason? to make just mayo more popular than it really was and impress investors, suggests bloomberg following interviews and a review of emails, receipts, and expense reports. Besides purchasing the egg-free sandwich spread, the contractors — called \" creekers \" — were instructed to call those same stores masquerading as customers and ask about just mayo to \" create buzz, \" per one email. An april 2014 email to creekers proclaimed that their actions \"will ensure we stay on the shelf to put an end to hellmann's factory-farmed egg mayo. \" ceo josh tetrick defended the buybacks, which he said cost an inconsequential $ 77,000. \" we spend more money on snacks than we spend on this program, \" he told cnbc. The primary purpose, said tetrick, was quality control, though \" we also thought it might give us a little momentum out of the gate, \" another exec conceded. Consumerist, however, sees the volume as not \" quite right \": receipts showed one creeker bought 140 jars in a day. \" it is highly questionable for a company to purchase its own goods, \" stanford accounting professor david larcker tells bloomberg.

Judge james boasberg says he took the tribe's request very seriously — npr notes he acknowledged the \" contentious and tragic \" relationship between native american tribes and the us government — but that it hadn't \" demonstrated that an injunction is warranted here. \" according to cnn, boasberg says the standing rock sioux failed to prove it \" will suffer any injury that would be prevented by any injunction. \" a lawyer representing the tribe says it plans on appealing. \" my heart is hurting, but we will continue to stand, \" the tribe's historian tells the ap, adding that protests of the pipeline will continue. The standing rock sioux had sued the army corps of engineers, alleging it violated federal laws when it approved portions of the pipeline near the tribe's reservation in north dakota and failed to properly consult the tribe. The tribe says construction is disturbing graves and other culturally, spiritually, and historically significant sites. It also says the $ 3.8 billion pipeline will cross the missouri river just upstream from the reservation, putting its drinking water in jeopardy in the case of leaks. The pipeline was originally going to cross the river closer to bismarck, but officials worried for the safety of the state capital's drinking water, the new yorker reports.

The bill's author, republican rep.

First, he notes, texas isn't another country, so it can't \" repatriate \" anything. Also, texas doesn't have $ 1 billion in gold — and the gold it does have isn't stored at the federal reserve, according to murphy.

        "summary": "\" right now, too many americans are working long days for less pay than they deserve. \" those are president obama's words in a huffington post op-ed about a proposal he predicts would help up to 5 million workers in 2016: increasing the overtime salary threshold from $ 23,660 to $ 50,440, reports the new york times. The president has the authority to set forth the regulation — spurred on by an economic policy institute report on overtime and expected to be formally announced thursday by obama in wisconsin — without congressional approval, the paper notes. The proposed change will be made available for public comment and may take months to finalize, the ap reports. \" without congress, i ' m very hard-pressed to think of a policy change that would potentially reach more middle-class earners than this one, \" jared bernstein, a senior fellow with the center on budget and policy priorities who co-wrote the epi report, tells politico. Unlike the rally to raise the minimum wage, which some argue doesn't help a good chunk of middle-class workers, the overtime rule would make eligible for time-and-a-half pay many who work as managers, notes politico. Critics have produced a laundry list of potential issues, including employers compensating for the change by hiring workers at lower starting wages, as well as cutting hours back. And the society for human resource management warned in a statement yesterday that tracking salaried managers'time and adhering to strict schedules would \" have a significant impact on employee morale, \" per usa today. But the times notes a cutback in overtime hours could boost hiring, while politico says that less overtime for existing workers would mean \" either more time with their families or more opportunities to work second jobs and put more money in their pockets. \"",

With known bouts of depression that kept her from completing much course work at all in her first three years of college, the canadian also left behind traces of inner turmoil on her blog and tumblr that, long after her body was found, left others mourning her in very personal ways in the months ( and now years ) to follow. So as cut-and-dried as the la police department explained the case to be — lam was depressed, perhaps experienced a psychotic break, made her way to a water tank on the roof of the hotel, and drowned either by accident or intention — many went looking for other answers, writes josh dean at medium.com. A few details of the case in particular didn't sit well with the many internet commenters who to this day are trying to solve what they perceive to be a mystery. Perhaps most famously was what dean calls the \" creepy \" and \" inexplicable \" video footage from the hotel elevator taken just after midnight the day she disappeared; she behaves strangely, looks frightened, waves her arms as if talking to someone outside the elevator, could have been on drugs. She also died during a tuberculosis outbreak in the area, and the name of the diagnostic test is lam-elisa, which was too much of a coincidence for some to handle. Theories abounded, and still do. There was a serial killer on the loose. There were ghosts. The hotel itself conspired against her. One blogger who became obsessed with the case before accepting the theory of a manic episode followed by an accidental drowning finally settled on this: \" while i had a lot of fun researching the whole thing, the case of elisa lam is not a mystery — it's a tragedy. \" click for the full story.

Among the affected apps, per the verge: ride-hailing app didi kuaidi and messaging app wechat, both popular in china. Before the breach, just five app store apps had ever been considered malicious, reports reuters. By security firm palo alto networks ' initial count, at least 39 apps had been infected, though chinese security company qihoo says it has found more than 300 infected apps, per the telegraph. \" to protect our customers, we've removed the apps from the app store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software, \" an apple rep says. The new york times explains that after download, the infected apps ' code could trigger certain websites to open that subsequently further infect the phone; the code can also force pop-ups that request things like passwords. Reuters notes developers may have used the bad version of xcode because it was held on a chinese server and could possibly be downloaded faster than apple's version on us servers.

A study in the scientific reports journal reveals the danger islands find of more than 750,000 pairs of adélie penguins — a discovery researchers are calling a \" total surprise, \" per the bbc. \" it's a classic case of finding something where no one really looked, \" study co-author tom hart says. The detective work started in 2014, when satellite images taken from space showed enormous guano stains ( guano being bird poop ), per the wall street journal. Those images spurred scientists to travel to the danger islands in 2015, where they realized the magnitude of their find. \" i was amazed by the sheer number, \" study co-author michael polito says, per the independent. \" the water around the island boiled with penguins. \" they counted the penguins by hand and with a drone that flew overhead snapping photos. It's a significant number, as this colony doesn't seem to have been as affected by population decline as other colonies on the antarctic peninsula. Researchers believe other colonies may have been adversely affected by a reduction in sea ice from climate change — krill, tiny crustaceans that are a staple in the penguin diet, live in the ice — an influx of fishermen, and other human disturbances. Because the archipelago where this new colony is located is so remote, the penguins there may have been protected from some of these factors. This group may have been around for decades, too: the scientists went back to satellite images taken in the late 1950s and, based on that evidence, they believe the penguin population there has been stable since that time.

The inuit — who consumed a diet mainly of whales, seals, and fish — rarely had heart attacks, and researchers speculated in the 1970s that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish guard against them, reports the new york times. But decades ' worth of fish oil pills may have been better dumped down the drain: a new study published in science provides what the times calls an \" intriguing new twist \" to the omega-3 story. In analyzing the dna of 191 greenland residents of almost entirely inuit descent, scientists found they boasted genetic variants that may help them consume high amounts of fat without negative consequences. The find suggests \" lessons from the inuit cannot be extrapolated to other populations, \" per study author rasmus nielsen. Their genetic mutations helped keep fasting insulin and ldl cholesterol levels low, reports reuters. The times notes that inuit with two copies of one gene variant in particular were an average one inch shorter and weighed 10 pounds less than those without it. The genetic variants — which may have come into play 20,000 years ago — \" regulate how much of these omega-3s and omega-6s you make yourself naturally, \" says nielsen, per npr. \" we saw that the inuit have such a high diet of omega-3s, so they produce much less of it themselves. \" this is \" perhaps the most extreme example to date of a genetic adaptation to a specific diet, \" he adds. In speaking to npr, a harvard medical school geneticist advises caution: it's tough \" to go beyond the known biology of these genes and make connections to weight, \" says joel hirschhorn. \" they're taking a leap of faith. \" ( this isn't the first study to throw fish oil benefits in doubt. )",

The budget would scrap our current six-bracket tax system for a two-tiered one: one at 10 % and one at 25 %, the washington post reports. Half of the spending cuts would come from health care moves, including completely eliminating \" obamacare, \" turning medicaid into a block grant, and implementing the medicare overhaul ryan devised with ron wyden. The budget has no chance of passing the democrat-controlled senate; indeed, it starts the budget wars anew, politico reports, because it scraps the spending targets agreed on in last summer's debt ceiling debate. \" this is outrageous and deeply disappointing, \" said sen. Patty murray, chair of the failed super committee. \" they have shown that a deal with them isn't worth the paper it's printed on. \" if ryan's assumptions are correct, his budget would shrink the deficit to just under $ 800 billion next year, and $ 166 billion by 2018, according to cnn.",

In a panel chat this summer, she said she would \" sit in on high level meetings with general petraeus \" during which she'd \" listen to classified chatter of terrorist talk and so forth, \" politico reports. And in its probe into the affair, the fbi found classified information on paula broadwell's computer, which she'd voluntarily handed over. But petraeus said he hadn't provided her with the documents, and the bureau concluded he hadn't violated any laws, reports the new york times. Regardless of where she obtained the information, it appears she may have leaked some of it. In a university of denver speech last month, broadwell said the attack on benghazi may have been an effort to retrieve three militia members who'd been taken prisoner. \" now, i don't know if a lot of you heard this, \" she said, \" but the cia annex had... Taken a couple of libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to try to get these prisoners back. \" fox news had earlier reported that the annex — separate from the attacked consulate — had held the prisoners, a story fox today confirms via a \" well-placed washington source. \" the cia, however, tells the daily beast that \" any suggestion that the agency is still in the detention business is uninformed and baseless. \" broadwell may simply have been misremembering the details of the fox report, the beast notes.",

        "summary": "When 14-year-old emmett till walked into a mississippi store in august 1955, the black teen had no clue that his entrance would lead to his untimely death. And little did anyone in 2017 anticipate that, decades later, the white woman whose words sealed his fate would partly recant her explosive accusations. Sheila weller revisits for vanity fair the story of the boy who helped launch the civil rights movement, as well as the story of carolyn bryant donham, the shopkeeper's wife who back then alleged emmett had whistled at her, grabbed her by the waist, and said, \" you needn't be afraid of me, baby. I've [ slept ] with white women before. \" his supposed actions led her then-husband, roy bryant, and his half-brother, jw milam, to seek emmett out to torture and murder him — charges for which they were acquitted, but which they admitted to for a paid magazine article a few months later. But weller talks to timothy tyson, whose book the blood of emmett till comes out next week, and tyson says when he interviewed donham in 2007, the then-72-year-old admitted she'd made up the worst bits of her story. \" that part's not true, \" she told tyson of the waist-grabbing and sexual talk emmett had purportedly engaged in. Donham, who was writing her own memoirs — which won't be released until 2036, per tyson — had since come out against white supremacy and told tyson, \" nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him. \" weller says donham, now 82 and living in seclusion, didn't go so far as to mention to tyson that she felt guilty. Weller notes her words, and tyson's book, have given us \" reason to revisit a period in our history when bigotry, blood, and sacrifice became a call to action. \" read the full story at vanity fair.

        "summary": "About 100 years ago, one of the founders of modern linguistics, ferdinand de saussure, wrote that the relationship between the sounds we make and the concepts they signify are arbitrary. Many have long agreed. But now the inherent randomness of human language is being challenged by a large new study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, which analyzed 100 basic words in 3,700 languages around the world. In short: certain words tend to contain or omit certain sounds in a significant number of these languages, and the consistency is \" stronger than we'd expect by chance. \" the team of physicists, linguists, and computer scientists from the us, argentina, and europe took a \" big data approach \" to 62 % of the world's languages, one of them tells the washington post. Among their many findings is that the word for nose contains the sound \" n \" in more than 1,400 languages, ranging from \" nev \" in icelandic and \" hana \" in japanese to \" kon \" in sar and \" nariz \" in spanish. Ditto the sound \" s \" in sand. The researchers don't yet know why, though they've ruled out the idea of there being one original language. It's not the first study to suggest a biological basis for the sounds we appoint to objects — something called the \" bouba/kiki \" effect dates back to 1929, suggesting that most humans think the fake word \" bouba \" sounds like a rounded shape while the fake word \" kiki \" sounds spiky. A separate researcher tells the telegraph that some words may derive from what babies can first say, such as \" mama, \" but says the study \" looked at too few words to make any firm conclusions. \" ( check out what linguists found while studying disney princesses. )",

The victim's husband, pastor davey blackburn, issued a statement saying he was \" extremely relieved \" by the arrests. \" though everything inside of me wants to hate, be angry, and slip into despair, i choose the route of forgiveness, grace, and hope, \" he said. \" today i am deciding to love, not hate. \"",

The idea behind the measure: when workers don't know their shifts until the last minute, it can be tough to work an additional job, care for kids, or take classes. What's more, \" some weeks you're getting 10 hours and others you're getting 25. It's very hard to figure out what you're doing in terms of family income, \" says an advocate. \" there are too many workers and families struggling in low-wage jobs with unpredictable shifts, \" says a member of the city's board of supervisors, which passed the measure unanimously. The measure doesn't apply to local mom-and-pop shops, the huffington post notes; instead, it's aimed at retail and food shops that have at least 11 locations across the country. And while a similar federal proposal is unlikely to pass, locals are hoping their move will catch on. \" there are a lot of eyes on san francisco now, \" the advocate says. \" people are wondering if we can bring this citywide, and then to the state level, and then around the country. \"",

        "summary": "Is it possible some vikings were muslim? that's a question the national post is asking following the discovery of viking funeral garb embroidered with ancient arabic characters spelling \" allah. \" annika larsson of uppsala university tells the bbc she was examining fragments of clothing discovered in 1,000-year-old burial sites in sweden when she noticed some unusual symbols in silver thread, and they reminded her of those seen on textiles belonging to muslim inhabitants of spain in the middle ages, per the guardian. She later identified the name \" ali \" in ancient kufic script, a likely reference to the cousin of prophet muhammad and the fourth caliph of islam. Then, with the help of a mirror, she found \" allah \" woven in reverse, possibly \" an attempt to write prayers so that they could be read from left to right, \" says larsson, who found the same pairing on 10 textile fragments. \" it is a staggering thought that the bands, just like the costumes, was made west of the muslim heartland, \" says larsson. The garments themselves were actually discovered more than a century ago but have been largely in storage ever since. The fragments discovered by larsson are the first in scandinavia to mention \" ali, \" a figure particularly revered by the shia muslim minority, per the bbc. The find — combined with the 2015 discovery of the kufic script for \" allah \" on a viking ring — opens up the possibility that other muslim artifacts in viking graves didn't simply come from trade or plunder, as has been generally presumed. \" the possibility that some of those in the graves were muslim cannot be completely ruled out, \" says larsson.

            "Image caption one of the excavated fragments made from fine silk and silver thread discovered at the two swedish sites, birka and gamla uppsala researchers in sweden have found arabic characters woven into burial costumes from viking boat graves. The discovery raises new questions about the influence of islam in scandinavia, writes journalist tharik hussain. They were kept in storage for more than 100 years, dismissed as typical examples of viking age funeral clothes. But a new investigation into the garments - found in 9th and 10th century graves - has thrown up groundbreaking insights into contact between the viking and muslim worlds. Patterns woven with silk and silver thread have been found to spell the words \" allah \" and \" ali \". The breakthrough was made by textile archaeologist annika larsson of uppsala university while re-examining the remnants of burial costumes from male and female boat and chamber graves originally excavated in birka and gamla uppsala in sweden in the late 19th and mid-20th centuries. She became interested in the forgotten fragments after realising the material had come from central asia, persia and china. Larsson says the tiny geometric designs - no more than 1.5cm ( 0.6in ) high - resembled nothing she had come across in scandinavia before. \" i couldn't quite make sense of them and then i remembered where i had seen similar designs - in spain, on moorish textiles",

Researchers at uppsala university describe the finding of the geometric kufic characters in silver on woven bands of silk as \"staggering \". How the female viking warrior was written out of history read more the researchers at uppsala, sweden's oldest university, were re-examining clothes that had been in storage for some time. They had originally been found at viking burial sites in birka and gamla uppsala in sweden. Textile archaeology researcher annika larsson told the bbc that at first she could not make sense of the symbols, but then, \"i remembered where i had seen similar designs: in spain, on moorish textiles. \" uppsala university ( @uu_university ) #viking age script deciphered – mentions 'allah ' and 'ali ' https://t.co/zdkdy0berl pic.twitter.com/7wpuowstr7 this led to the identification of the name \"ali \" in the text and, when looked at in a mirror, the word \"allah \" in reverse was revealed.

            "Image caption one of the excavated fragments made from fine silk and silver thread discovered at the two swedish sites, birka and gamla uppsala researchers in sweden have found arabic characters woven into burial costumes from viking boat graves. The discovery raises new questions about the influence of islam in scandinavia, writes journalist tharik hussain. They were kept in storage for more than 100 years, dismissed as typical examples of viking age funeral clothes. But a new investigation into the garments - found in 9th and 10th century graves - has thrown up groundbreaking insights into contact between the viking and muslim worlds. Patterns woven with silk and silver thread have been found to spell the words \" allah \" and \" ali \". The breakthrough was made by textile archaeologist annika larsson of uppsala university while re-examining the remnants of burial costumes from male and female boat and chamber graves originally excavated in birka and gamla uppsala in sweden in the late 19th and mid-20th centuries. She became interested in the forgotten fragments after realising the material had come from central asia, persia and china. Larsson says the tiny geometric designs - no more than 1.5cm ( 0.6in ) high - resembled nothing she had come across in scandinavia before. \" i couldn't quite make sense of them and then i remembered where i had seen similar designs - in spain, on moorish textiles",
            "A swedish university has claimed to discover arabic characters for \"allah \" and \"ali \" woven into viking burial clothes. Researchers at uppsala university describe the finding of the geometric kufic characters in silver on woven bands of silk as \"staggering \". How the female viking warrior was written out of history read more the researchers at uppsala, sweden's oldest university, were re-examining clothes that had been in storage for some time. They had originally been found at viking burial sites in birka and gamla uppsala in sweden. Textile archaeology researcher annika larsson told the bbc that at first she could not make sense of the symbols, but then, \"i remembered where i had seen similar designs: in spain, on moorish textiles. \" uppsala university ( @uu_university ) #viking age script deciphered – mentions 'allah ' and 'ali ' https://t.co/zdkdy0berl pic.twitter.com/7wpuowstr7 this led to the identification of the name \"ali \" in the text and, when looked at in a mirror, the word \"allah \" in reverse was revealed. The meaning of the characters was revealed in a mirror. Photograph: annika larsson \"perhaps this was an attempt to write prayers so that they could be read from left to right, \" said larsson.

This week, a house energy and commerce subcommittee moved forward with the sunscreen innovation act, aimed at easing the path of approval for ingredients — especially those that have been in use in other countries. Among other things, it would require the fda to make a decision on existing applications within eight months and new ones within a year, reports the hill. It's likely to pass the full house in a matter of weeks and then be taken up by the senate. Given that skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the us, supporters say it's long overdue.",

            "At some point on thursday evening, just after malaysia airlines flight 17 blew apart over some wheat field in eastern ukraine, vladimir putin had a chance to take stock of his options. There were essentially two. The russian president could stand behind the rebel fighters in eastern ukraine, even as suspicion grew that they were responsible for shooting the airliner down, and risk implicating russia in the tragedy and deepening the kremlin's conflict with ukraine and with the west. The other option, a familiar one for putin, would be to use the senseless loss of life as an opportunity to shift toward reconciliation. He had taken the latter approach a few years ago, in 2010, when a plane carrying polish president lech kaczyński and his entourage crashed in western russia, killing everyone on board. To the surprise of many in poland, putin took that tragedy as a chance to make amends, however briefly, easing the history of mistrust between the two nations. His displays of mourning and commiseration – putin even hugged and comforted polish prime minister donald tusk near the crash site – allowed russians and poles to call each other brothers for the first time in a generation. Taking the same approach after thursday's catastrophe would have helped putin on several fronts. He could have distanced himself from the increasingly erratic rebel leaders in"

Researchers say that the bullies themselves are also more likely to long for cosmetic surgery, reports refinery29.

Their findings play out in a world where cosmetic surgery rates are on the rise, they add, noting that in the us alone, 230,000 of the 16 million surgical procedures that took place between 2014 and 2015 were performed on teens. Says the lead author: \" our main message to plastic surgeons is: if young people present with a desire to have a cosmetic procedure, screen for bullying and mental health. There may be other solutions that help without risk and address the root problem. \" ( in some places, bullying is ticketed. )",

That's why tina gorjanc thinks he'd love her new project, which aims to make clothing from mcqueen's skin — or rather skin grown from mcqueen's dna. The recent fashion school graduate plans to use dna from mcqueen's hair, included in a 1992 collection, to grow skin that can be tanned and turned into bags and jackets, per quartz. \" you extract certain genetic information from it and then you use that information to reprogram already existing skin so it is the exact texture and color and everything of the original source, so in this case mcqueen's skin, \" gorjanc tells the telegraph. The goal isn't to sell the items, though she might hear offers from collectors. Instead, gorjanc — inspired by the case of henrietta lacks — wants to start a conversation about safeguards for genetic information. \" there are huge gaps in legislation because the technologies are evolving so quickly, \" gorjanc says. \" because of those loop holes we are able to extract genetic information from a human source... Then produce something out of it like a product and then patent it. \" in other words, her idea is \" completely legal. \" she's already applied for a patent that would give her ownership of the lab-grown skin — which would include mcqueen's dna, freckles, moles, and even tattoos — though she can't patent his dna itself. Though newser originally quoted gorjanc as saying reps from the alexander mcqueen brand \" were really fascinated \" with the undertaking, the fashion house says in a statement, \" contrary to some press reports the company wasn't approached about this project nor have we ever endorsed it. \"",

In one development that might make some headway against previous \" oscars so white \" backlash, 18 black performers and filmmakers are nominated this year, including moonlight director barry jenkins ( who could become the first black director to take home the prize ), denzel washington ( perhaps the first black contender to win three oscars ), and viola davis, who could become the first black performer to win an emmy, a tony, and an oscar. More on what to expect: cara buckley offers her predictions for the new york times ' carpetbagger, and she's betting on casey affleck to win best actor over denzel washington. Richard brody in the new yorker makes the case that moonlight will upset la la land for best picture. Rolling stone points out six races that are too close to call, including best director, which will likely come down to damien chazelle of la la land or barry jenkins of moonlight ). It's never easy to pick a winner from the best picture field, so bbc culture asks critics from around the globe to argue why each of the nine contenders should top the ballots.

        "summary": "Like him or loathe him, choosing apprentices appears to be one thing donald trump definitely excels at. Numerous pundits are calling trump running mate mike pence the winner of tuesday night's vice presidential debate, thanks in part to his calm demeanor in response to an aggressive, interrupting tim kaine, though pence failed to land any knockout blows on his rival. According to a cnn poll, 48 % of debate watchers consider pence the winner, compared to 42 % for the democrat. A round-up of opinions: chris cillizza at the washington post declares the \" cool, calm, collected \" pence the winner over kaine, who was \" trying to load so many trump attacks into every answer that it made it virtually impossible to grasp any one attack. \" but pence probably made a better case for pence 2020 than he did for trump 2016, cillizza writes — and overall, the debate was like \" watching two kids throw mashed potatoes at each other, \" only less entertaining. At redstate, caleb howe sees pence as the clear winner and kaine — who \" tried to be an attack dog but came off more like a yipping pup nipping at the mailman's heels \" — as the clear loser. But another loser, he writes, is trump, partly because \" pence winning only shows how truly terrible trump was during his debate. \" dan roberts at the guardian also says it was a bad night for kaine. When \" he should have calmly shredded the inconsistencies between trump and the rest of planet republican, he came across as the nervous and jittery one, \" roberts writes, calling it a missed opportunity because \" so much of what the vice-presidential nominee had to say in defense of his boss did not pass the smell test. \" pence succeeded in giving the trump campaign a calm face after more than a week of turmoil, writes errol louis at cnn, who credits the indiana governor's years as a radio talk show host for the smooth performance. Pence, he writes, has \" demonstrated to other trump supporters how to defend their candidate without doubling down on his abrasive style. \" the big loser here was the truth, according to politico, which notes that the facts \" started taking a beating \" when pence called longwood university \" norwood university, \" and takes a look at inaccurate statements from both candidates on issues including foreign policy, taxes, and immigration.",
