Assuming that's the case — last-minute production glitches could throw off the schedule — customers should be able to order about 10 days afterward. Apple is expected to offer updated versions of the iphone 7 and iphone 7 plus, but most eyes will be on the new iphone 8, rumored to be an ambitious upgrade to mark the phone's 10th anniversary. \" at this point, it's no secret what the iphone 8 will bring to the table, \" notes a post at bgr, ticking off features such as an oled display, advanced facial recognition, and wireless charging. In addition to the phones, apple also is expected to unveil an upgraded apple watch and apple tv.

            "Dow jones is reporting that apple will unveil its 2017 iphone lineup at a special event scheduled for tuesday, september 12. While apple has yet to issue official invites for the event, the september 12th date does align with previous rumors that recently emerged over the past few days. Assuming that the september 12 date is in fact accurate, apple in just about two weeks will introduce a brand new iphone 7s and an iphone 7s plus. Of course, it goes without saying that the main attraction at apple's upcoming event will be the highly anticipated iphone 8, a device which may very well usher in the largest iphone refresh apple has ever seen. At this point, it's no secret what the iphone 8 will bring to the table. According to a number of credible sources, the iphone 8 will feature a edgeless oled display and will incorporate advanced facial recognition technology. What's interesting, though, is that the inclusion of facial recognition technology might see apple remove touch id altogether. From what we can gather so far, apple initially wanted to embed the touch id sensor underneath the oled display itself, only to abandon this approach after encountering a yield issues during initial production runs. As for other iphone 8 features we can expect to see, apple's next-gen device will likely incorporate a new wireless charging feature. Though android smartphones have had wireless charging for quite some time, it's nice to see apple finally deciding to join the party. On a related note, a recent iphone 8 rumor claims that wireless charging on apple's next-gen device will not be up to par with what some android smartphone owners already enjoy. As we covered earlier, rumor has it that the iphone 8 — along with apple's iphone 7s lineup — will only support qi's slower wireless charging standard. As for some other iphone 8 tidbits worth mentioning, it's believed that the entry-level iphone 8 will sport 64gb of storage, with more premium models offering users 256gb and 512gb of storage.

But getting to space in one piece requires huge engines with lots of fuel to lift and land a single, solid machine. Huge engines and lots of fuel, however, add weight, which requires even bigger engines and more fuel — and on and on",

        "summary": "A five-hour humanitarian ceasefire between israel and palestinians ended as scheduled this morning, and hamas marked the occasion by lobbing another round of rockets at israel, the israeli military tells the ap. The rockets landed in the city of ashkelon at precisely 3pm local time, the hour the ceasefire was to end, but, as is usually the case with palestinian rocket fire, no casualties have been reported. A new, more lasting ceasefire may be in the works, however. An israeli official tells the bbc that talks with egypt have yielded a deal to end hostilities at 6am local time tomorrow. But hamas has denied any such deal. Even before the ceasefire ended, the israeli army reported that two mortar shells were fired from gaza into southern israel — followed by a third shortly after, says the ap. No injuries were reported. The shots came just two hours into the pause. Apart from the small burst of mortar fire, the ceasefire seems to have mostly been a success. Gaza residents rushed to banks and vegetable markets to take advantage of the brief window of safety. Ban ki-moon issued a statement saying that the pause had been \" mostly \" respected on both sides, and that it \" shows that a cessation of hostilities is possible if all the parties demonstrate the necessary will. \" meanwhile, israeli authorities have indicted one 29-year-old and two 16-year-olds in what they're calling the revenge killing of a palestinian teenager. The three suspects have all reportedly confessed, and reenacted the crime for authorities, the jewish telegraphic agency reports. Israel's attorney general called the killing \" a grave and shocking act, perpetrated against a background of racism, against an innocent teenager. \"",

But an hour later, was he buying drugs? a witness told police he thinks he saw hoffman, looking \" very sweaty \", withdrawing a lot of cash from an atm near his west village apartment around 8pm, then handing it to two men wearing messenger bags in apparent exchange for drugs. Investigators are looking for surveillance video to verify the account, fox news reports. A neighbor of hoffman's says he saw the actor earlier saturday looking \" grey \" and \" not well, \" buying tissues and soda at a grocery store. The next day, he was supposed to pick up his kids from their mom, mimi o'donnell, from whom the new york daily news says he was \" estranged, \" but he never showed; they were reportedly at a nearby playground yesterday morning when o'donnell asked someone who worked with hoffman ( reportedly screenwriter david katz ) to check on him. It was a grim scene when police found hoffman's body on his bathroom floor: he was wearing a t-shirt and shorts and there was a hypodermic needle in his left arm, the daily beast reports. At least five empty heroin envelopes were in the trash, two full ones were nearby, and sources tell the new york post there was a charred spoon in the kitchen sink ( hoffman went to rehab for snorting heroin in may of last year, and a source claims to radar that he was spending $ 10,000 a month these days on heroin and oxycontin ). Fox news'sources and other reports say police are investigating whether the heroin is linked to a tainted batch that has killed hundreds; the raw story notes that the lethal heroin just recently hit the east coast.

            "It has been over 3 years since the last eruption in iceland. However, there are signs that an eruption might be in the works near remote barðarbunga. The icelandic meteorological office ( imo ) is reporting two major earthquake swarms that started up on the morning on august 16 and continue to roll into august 17. Right it seems that there are two separate earthquake swarms producing small earthquakes and has now eclipsed the may 2014 swarm in terms of number of earthquakes. There are no indications that an eruption has started at barðarbunga, but some roads have been closed as a precaution because any eruption would likely produce a jökulhlaup ( glacial outburst flood ) as both swarms are occurring underneath vatnajökull. This ice cap is also the home of the last icelandic volcano to erupt, grímvötn. There was some foreshadowing of that eruption before the explosive event, but many earthquake swarms in iceland don't directly lead to an eruption. An overflight of the area performed today doesn't suggest much in the way of eruption either but the imo has put barðarbunga and the area around it on elevated alert. Update 9 am edt 8/16/14: the imo has raised the alert status at barðarbunga to orange after the continued and now shallowing earthquakes under the volcano. This suggests that magma is rising under the volcano, which means that the chances of",

Stuart jones, the acting assistant secretary for near eastern affairs, puts the number of syrians who have been rounded up, detained, and \" exterminated \" at the sednaya prison outside of damascus in the thousands, and the killings appear to have \" unconditional support \" from both russia and iran. Jones, who offered overhead photos of the reported crematorium, said evidence was culled from \" intelligence assessments, \" as well as human rights and other sources. Based on the amnesty international report, the prisoners are apparently yanked from their cells in the middle of the night, ostensibly to be placed in different cells, then summarily hanged or otherwise killed en masse, per cnn. Jones indicated that while russia and iran may not have known specifically about the crematorium, they've certainly been aware of other atrocities said to be taking place, abc news notes. Jones also had a pessimistic take on a deal last week, negotiated with russia's help, to set up \" de-escalation zones \" inside the war-torn country to cut down on the violence. \" in light of the failures of the past ceasefire agreements, we have reason to be skeptical, \" jones said, per reuters.

        "summary": "You could spend a night in dracula's transylvanian castle — but sleep is no guarantee. Airbnb is offering two guests an overnight stay at bran castle in the mountains of transylvania, fittingly, on halloween night. The great grandnephew of bram stoker, who based his 19th-century novel on the very place, will host the person with the best explanation of what they would say to dracula in a \" face-to-fang \" meeting, along with a guest, per the telegraph. Whisked away in a horse-drawn carriage, the pair can explore all 57 rooms of the castle where vlad the impaler, the inspiration for count dracula, was once believed to have been imprisoned. Should they find a secret passage, it ' ll take them to a dining room where they ' ll enjoy a \" blood-enriching \" meal \" prepared exactly as described \" in stoker's novel, airbnb says. Later, they ' ll have the option to get some shut-eye in two velvet-lined coffins in a crypt, though beds are also available, per the ap. Though the castle receives more than 630,000 visitors a year, halloween night will mark the first time anyone has slept in the castle since 1948. But \" this is the lair of vampires, and you cannot leave until dawn, \" airbnb says. It also notes \" the count is not a fan of mirror selfies \" and you ' ll have to leave your garlic, \" garlic-scented items, \" silver jewelry, and holy symbols at home. Stoker's nephew dacre stoker, who will play the role of dracula protagonist jonathan harker during the visit, says he hopes to give people \" a good experience and a good scare. \" feeling brave? you can enter the competition at this link until oct. 26.

In response to reported sexual assaults during uber, lyft, and taxi rides, michael pelletz launched chariot for women, providing ride-sharing just for women ( as well as kids of any gender under 13 and transgender women ) and employing only women drivers. The service also has a tight private background check for drivers, as well as a state check used by schools and daycares, per techcrunch, and the app issues a \" safe word \" to only the driver and customer, per the boston globe. So far more than 1,000 women have signed up, usa today reports. Pelletz tells the washington post he was partly inspired by the movie pretty woman, noting, \" i was made to take care of women, to love them, respect them. … i was meant to do this. \" pelletz says he came up with the idea to cater to \" the untapped market that uber and lyft neglected \" after a frightening experience of his own with an \" incoherent \" male passenger while he was an uber driver. But there are legal issues that could put the brakes on the service: specifically, gender-discrimination lawsuits. \" there's nothing wrong with advertising particularly to a female customer base, \" a boston lawyer tells the globe. \" but if a company goes further and refuses to pick up a man, i think they'd potentially run into legal trouble. \" an employment law expert says refusing to hire male drivers could get even stickier. But pelletz tells techcrunch he's ready to go all the way to the supreme court if need be \" to say that if there's safety involved, there's nothing wrong with providing a service for women. \" the service also says it will donate 2 % of each fare to charity.

Boston university researchers have found a biomarker for chronic traumatic encephalopathy that can be detected while a patient is still alive, reports the washington post. Previously, cte could only be confirmed in a post-mortem brain exam, notes cbs local. The study in plos one compared the brains of 23 football players, ages 25 to 87, to 50 non-athletes with alzheimer's disease, and a control group of 18 non-athletes. Researchers reported \" significantly \" higher levels of ccl11, a protein linked to age-related cognitive decline, in the group of ex-players, and those who played longer had higher levels. What's also notable here: the elevated ccl11 levels weren't present in alzheimer's patients, meaning scientists could ostensibly differentiate between patients with alzheimer's and patients with cte. More study is needed, but the hope is that the results could lead to early detection that could help millions of athletes across many sports, per cbs. Lead researcher dr. Ann mckee tells the post she's been \" frustrated for years \" by critics who contended that aging, not cte, is to blame. \" this is the first demonstration that shows it's … a distinct disease, and we're going to exploit the uniqueness of this disease to find treatment. \" she continues: \"we've been going down, and everything has just gotten more and more depressing. And now it's like, ' yeah, we're going to actually find some answers here.

A suspicious customer finally complained to the santa clara county district attorney's office in early 2016, accusing the restaurant of using the far-cheaper tilapia in its supposed petrale sole dish. The da's office found that morgan hill's odeum restaurant did, in fact, make the substitution from oct. 2014 to march 2016, and last week it reached a settlement with the restaurant, cbs san francisco reports. California restaurants are prohibited from falsely advertising the food they serve, per health and safety codes. Petrale sole is a type of flounder; the mercury news says it sells for two to three times the price of tilapia, a \" bargain-basement fish. \" odeum will pay $ 120,000 in civil penalties and restitution — all customers who ordered petrale sole during the time period in question will get $ 30 gift certificates, and any leftover restitution money will go to the county's department of environmental health for training, education, and enforcement in its consumer protection division. Munchies looked at odeum's \" fancy menu \" and found the $ 32 dish described as \" wild-caught petrale sole, lemon, capers, dill, saffron, parmesan risotto, and grilled asparagus. \" \" tilapia, on the other hand, is one of the cheapest and most widely farmed fish in the world, \" writes nick rose, noting that the year-plus it took for anyone to notice \" suggests that diners...

        "summary": "Astronomers have been intrigued at the notion of lightning strikes on jupiter since voyager 1 detected flashes nearly four decades ago, notes space.com. Now the juno orbiter has revealed a surprise: those strikes are more similar to lightning strikes on earth than previously thought. For one thing, jupiter's lightning can strike at the same rate as lightning on earth — juno's more sensitive equipment picked up about six times more strikes than voyager did, detecting up to four lightning strokes per second, reports gizmodo. And while voyager and subsequent nasa spacecraft detected strikes only in the relatively low-frequency kilohertz range, juno has revealed that jupiter also has strikes in the higher-frequency megahertz and gigahertz ranges, just like earth. \" given the very pronounced differences in the atmospheres between jupiter and earth, one might say the similarities we see in their thunderstorms are rather astounding, \" the university of iowa's william kurth, co-author of one of two new studies in nature, tells space.com. But juno also revealed a key difference in the two planets, regarding where the strikes occur. \" there is a lot of activity near jupiter's poles but none near the equator, \" says nasa scientist shannon brown in a release. \" you can ask anybody who lives in the tropics — this doesn't hold true for our planet. \" among the things to be resolved: why the strikes occur so often at the north pole in particular. Juno has been orbiting jupiter since 2016, and it will make its 13th flyby over the planet's clouds on july 16. ( juno provided the best look yet at jupiter's \" red spot. \" )",

Having sworn off of sunday drinking after a bad monday-morning classroom experience about a month ago ( long story short: don't go to an ancient philosophy lecture with a hangover, ) i looked around my room for anything else that could be consumed. All i had was a pouch of loose tobacco, my rolling papers and my cigarette roller. I briefly considered running to a local italian restaurant and stealing some oregano, to roll into a joint with my roller. I figured, \" hey, it kinda looks like weed, \" but then i decided against it because i'd feel stupid doing it. I took my mind off of the issue of my sobriety and spent the next half-hour rolling cigarettes. I think i rolled about sixteen, which is two short of the capacity of my cigarette case. Yes, i am a tobacco snob. I buy loose american spirit tobacco by the ounce and only use zig-zag papers. The long ones.

Houston was no exception, with some 6,600 kits having been kept in an hpd property room since 1987. About a year ago, two outside labs started going through the backlog at the city's request, and the houston chronicle reports that the efforts to turn over old stones has not been a fruitless one: the department's sex crime team yesterday said it has ided and charged a possible serial rapist. Herman ray whitfield jr., 43, who is currently behind bars, has been hit with four counts of aggravated sexual assault dating to 1992. The four rapes he is currently charged with occurred in 1992 and 1993, and 2008, which syncs with whitfield's time behind bars. He went to prison in 1994 on a kidnapping conviction and was released in 2006; he returned to prison in 2009 after violating his parole ( during his parole, his dna was put in a national database ), and will be there until 2016. Khou reports that police say his list of victims, which is believed to include a 12-year-old, could be even longer: his dna matched kits from a number of other victims that hpd hasn't yet been able to track down.

The bishop of vic swiftly responded to caram, reminding her that the \" virgin \" in \" virgin mary \" should be taken literally, referencing the concept of \" perpetual virginity \" that dictates mary didn't do the deed any time before or after jesus ' birth. He also informed followers that caram's remarks were regrettable and \" do not conform to the faith of the church. \" the 51-year-old caram — who also admitted during the program that she doesn't masturbate, per rt.com — put out a statement wednesday saying she's received death threats and that people shouldn't twist her thoughts about mary's sex life into something negative. \" sex is neither dirty nor something to be condemned, \" she said.

To that end, the company has been testing how the cover art that accompanies a movie or tv show influences a viewer's decision to ultimately watch it, the daily dot reports. Netflix figures it has about 90 seconds to capture your attention before you lose interest in watching a movie, writes the company's nick nelson in a blog post, and the best way of doing that is through images ( which, a previous study found, is where watchers put 82 % of their focus ). \" imagine having to tell your friend about the last movie you watched through a single drawing on the back of a playing card, \" writes nelson. Users spend only about 1.8 seconds assessing a title presented to them, and netflix has gleaned some insights into what works. ( read a technical post on the undertaking here. ) highlights: close-ups of expressive faces that \" convey a wealth of information … regarding the tone or feel of the content \" outperform images depicting \" stoic or benign expressions. \" the effectiveness of an image decreases when it contains more than three people. Writes nelson: \" while ensemble casts are fantastic for a huge billboard on the side of a highway, they are too complex at small sizes. \" cover art that depicts villains performs \" surprisingly well in both kids and action genres in particular. \" due to what netflix calls \" regional nuances, \" the performance of artwork varies by country; for example, the top sense 8 image was different in the uk, us, brazil, and germany.

Nbc news reports that the 45-year-old was charged with the murder of charlie carver, whose girlfriend was rescued from a container on kohlhepp's property earlier this month. The charge sheet shows just how lucky she is to be alive: kohlhepp is also charged with murdering 29-year-old johnny coxie in december last year, then murdering his wife, 25-year-old meagan coxie, on christmas or dec. 26 after holding her captive for a week. Kohlhepp was also charged with three counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime and one count of kidnapping, reports the greenville news. A police spokesman says kohlhepp hasn't been charged with kidnapping in the coxie murders because at this stage in the investigation, it appears that the couple went to his property voluntarily. Kohlhepp — who waived a bond hearing monday night, per the ap — is now charged with seven murders, including the killings of four people at a motorcycle shop in 2003. ( kohlhepp's mother says he carried out the quadruple murder because he was \" bullied and embarrassed \" in the store. )",

The idea is for more people to raise the possibility of sepsis should symptoms appear. They range broadly from fever or chills to elevated heart rate, confusion, shortness of breath, and general pain, making it easy to miss — which health providers appear to do with some regularity. Sepsis occurs when someone's body fights an underlying infection so fully that their entire body becomes inflamed in a sort of \" friendly fire, \" which results in problems that can include blood clots, reduced blood flow to organs, organ failure, and death, reports the new york times. It typically follows an illness such as pneumonia or infections of the skin, gut, or urinary tract, with the elderly and children most susceptible. By one estimate, it contributes to 380,000 deaths a year, and diagnoses are on the rise. For cdc chief thomas frieden, it's personal, notes the times. He once came home from work to find his infant son near death, but he correctly suspected sepsis, got antibiotics, and his son survived. ( the infection was pneumococcus, for which a vaccine has since been developed. ) \" i ' m like the thousands of parents and loved ones who experience this every year, \" he says.

He called the child's pediatrician, and within hours, the infant",

        "summary": "Italian surgeon sergio canavero said in 2013 that surgery to transplant a human head would be possible soon. Now he's set to announce a project to do just that, via a keynote lecture at the american academy of neurological and orthopaedic surgeons annual conference this june. He sees the procedure as being possible as soon as 2017 and believes it should be pursued as a means of saving people with, say, multi-organ cancer, reports new scientist. But the obstacles loom so large — spinal cord fusion among them — that most surgeons the magazine contacted dismissed the proposal altogether. \" there is no evidence that the connectivity of cord and brain would lead to useful sentient or motor function, \" a prominent surgeon said. But earlier this month, canavero sketched out what he considers to be a viable procedure in surgical neurology international: first he'd cool the head of the recipient and the body of the donor ( he intends to use a brain-dead donor ) to give their cells the ability to survive longer in the absence of oxygen; then he'd dissect neck tissue and reattach major blood vessels before severing the spinal cords — and severing them sharply is key, he writes. He proposes the use of a \" specially fashioned diamond microtomic snare-blade \" or a \" nanoknife... With a nanometer sharp cutting edge. \" but the most difficult part is fusing the two ends of the spinal cord; he believes polyethylene glycol could enable that. As new scientist puts it, \" just like hot water makes dry spaghetti stick together, polyethylene glycol encourages the fat in cell membranes to mesh. \" a three- to four-week induced coma would follow. He believes the patient would be able to speak in his own voice upon waking and that walking could be achieved within a year. \" if society doesn't want it, i won't do it, \" canavero says. \" but if people don't want it in the us or europe, that doesn't mean it won't be done somewhere else. \" ( soviet surgeon vladimir demikhov was the first to try to transplant a head — a dog's — in 1954; read about his controversial experiments. )",

            "If you were the child of dr. Vladimir demikhov, a russian scientist who gained fame in the 1940s and ' 50s, a two-headed dog could very well have eaten your homework. Over the course of 20 years, the controversial demikhov created at least 20 two-headed animals in his quest to perfect the art of transplantation. Although he sounds like a modern-day dr. Frankenstein, demikhov's work was an attempt to understand how damaged organs can be replaced, or how to create artificial substitutes. His studies would eventually set the stage for similar organ transplants some forty years later. Demikhov's early work focused on replacing hearts in dogs with artificial blood pumps, but by 1946 he successfully transplanted a second natural heart in a dog. He simply removed part of a lung to clear some space for the extra ticker, which beat independently of the original heart. Some of the two-hearted dogs managed to live up to five months. The ever-curious surgeon carried on his work by experimenting with just how much work a single heart could do. So rather than add a second heart to a dog, he added a second front end of a pup. This would determine if one heart could pump enough blood for both heads. Demikhov had",

            "San francisco ( kpix 5 ) – one week after a large tree branch fell onto a woman in a san francisco park, doctors told her husband that she will never walk again. Cui ying zhou was at washington square park with her two daughters last friday when a tree branch snapped and landed on her head. The limb weighed 100 pounds and fell from a pine tree. Her husband jian cong tan told kpix 5 that the branch fractured his wife's skull and broke her lower spine. Doctors said zhoo will definitely be paralyzed, even if they can reconnect her spinal cord. \"her lower spine was broken. The doctor showed me the x-ray and said, \"her lower spine separated into two parts, her skull was broken too, ' \" tan said. Tan said their daughters, who are only five and nine years old, are too distraught to go back to school. He has taken a leave from work to watch after their two girls who saw the horrific accident happen. Despite the seriousness of her injuries, zhou is showing some sign of improvement. \"it's amazing that she's still breathing and can talk to me right now. It's very amazing. It's like a miracle. \" tan said he hasn't slept all week and is just trying to stay",

More than 100 people have died in ukraine, italy is suffering its coldest winter in 27 years, and conditions are so severe in serbia that thousands have been stranded in -22 degree cold along with six feet of snow, reports the bbc. Food and medicines are being airlifted in, and helicopters are attempting to move the most fragile serbians to safety. Authorities are also scrambling to get help to people in greece, spain, and italy. Nearly 600 passengers were stranded this week for seven hours in an italian mountain train when the brakes and electrical cables froze. Temperatures have plunged as low at -40 degrees in russia — which is -52 with the wind chill factored in. England is steeling this weekend for several inches of snow and frigid temperatures. Forecasters, meanwhile, are perplexed by continuing mild weather in much of the us. Temperatures hit 62 degrees yesterday in wichita, kansas, warmer than las vegas. New york city has had just 4 inches of snow this year compared to a 36-inch dump by this time last year, reports the los angeles times. When cold snaps do occur, they tend to be extremely brief. \" if you don't like cold, it's a pattern you like, \" said one forecaster. But the lack of snow has been bad news for ski hill operators, and worrisome to western states continuously concerned about water.",

        "summary": "A man billed as a \" perfect donor \" by a sperm bank turned out to be a mentally ill felon whose lies on his donor application weren't uncovered for more than a decade, according to families who are now terrified for their children's futures. On its website, georgia-based firm xytex described donor 9623 as a completely healthy man with an iq of 160 who was working on a phd in neuroscience engineering, the toronto star reports. In reality, he was college dropout chris aggeles, a 39-year-old man who has been diagnosed with bipolar and narcissistic personality disorders and schizophrenia and has spent time in prison for burglary. His sperm was used to create at least 36 children in canada, the us, and the uk between 2000 and 2014. Families discovered his identity after xytex accidentally included his name in an email and they googled his name. Three canadian families with children between 4 and 8 years old are now suing xytex, and lawyer nancy hersh says she may also file suits for british and american families, the guardian reports. The lawsuit, which notes that schizophrenia can be hereditary, alleges that xytex allowed aggeles to keep selling his sperm even after problems surfaced. Angie collins, one of the canadian mothers suing, tells the star that her big problem is not with aggeles, but with the companies that sold his sperm without checking his background. Collins — described by hersh as the \" erin brockovich of the sperm-bank set \" — has devoted much of the last two years to pushing for greater oversight of the industry to make sure this never happens again.

There was \" what appeared to be smeared blood in various locations on the boat, \" which had been rented by banker richard ohrn, along with ohrn's wallet, cellphone, and the keys to his truck, found parked at a marina 15 miles south in deerfield beach, investigators say. The coast guard spent $ 400,000 on aircraft expenses alone as it searched for the missing man, to no avail, reports the sun sentinel. But odd tidbits started to surface: a marine repair shop had recently repaired an outboard motor for ohrn, who also purchased an inflatable boat, gas tank, and fuel line, police say. He was also facing a $ 400,000 lawsuit and accused of stealing money from clients, per the palm beach post. On april 12, ohrn called police and admitted to \" planning and carrying out his disappearance to escape legal issues, \" authorities say. After staging the accident scene on the fishing boat, ohrn got back to shore in his inflatable boat, then hopped in a truck he'd bought weeks earlier to drive to georgia and hide out in a rented house, police say. Following a grand jury indictment on thursday, ohrn, 45, now faces a felony charge of communicating false distress, which forced the coast guard to search 3,100 square miles of ocean. He remains in jail. \" whatever his punishment is, hopefully he learns his lesson and becomes a better person, \" ohrn's mom told the sun sentinel last year.

From silver screen beat: \" jared leto will star in brett ratner's hugh hefner biopic that literally nobody asked for. \" from vice: \" jared leto is going to play hugh hefner in a new biopic for some reason. \" a common thread running through the complaints is that everyone involved, particularly hef and ratner, is \" sleazy. \" if you've forgotten why ratner might be considered such, this interview in which he talked about \" banging \" olivia munn back when \" she wasn't asian \" and this one in which he said he forced lindsay lohan to get checked for stds before he would sleep with her might refresh your memory. He's been called \" the epitome of casting couch \" and \" an exact stereotype of a sleazy...

        "summary": "The latest alt-right flash point is in charlottesville, va., with protests and counter-protests over plans to remove a statue of confederate gen. Robert e. Lee from a city park. Things got heated over the weekend when white nationalist richard spencer led marches, including a nighttime one complete with burning torches, to keep the statue in place. Related coverage: counter-protest: the pro-statue marches took place saturday, and counter-protesters converged on lee park on sunday night, reports the daily progress. Alt-right blogger jason kessler of charlottesville was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, while a protester was charged with spitting on kessler and another with assaulting a police officer. Kessler is out with a video explaining his side of the alt-right protests here. The city's mayor, meanwhile, has forcefully condemned them as racist and likened them to the kkk tactic of trying to instill fear. Key quote: \" what brings us together is that we are white, we are a people, we will not be replaced! \" spencer told supporters at an afternoon march, with the event broadcast on periscope. What's this about? after the city decided to remove the statue of lee, opposition groups sued, arguing in part that lee is an integral part of southern history. A judge temporarily blocked the city's move earlier this month, and a hearing is set for june. Another statue in another park, that of gen. Stonewall jackson, also may go. All this hinges on whether the statues are protected under virginia's monuments law. A report at cbs19 has the background. Spencer: charlottesville is home to the university of virginia, and spencer is a 2001 graduate, so this is familiar turf for him. But a lengthy profile in the atlantic goes back even further: it's written by a former high-school classmate and traces his evolution into \" our generation's most prominent white supremacist. \" video profile: the atlantic also has an 11-minute video profile of spencer here. Governor's race: the statue is factoring in the state's gubernatorial race this year. Gop candidate corey stewart, who chaired donald trump's state campaign until he was fired, has made it a \" rallying cry \" and called its possible removal \" historical vandalism, \" reports the washington post. He declined to comment on the new alt-right marches, but other candidates in the race condemned them, notes the daily progress. Elsewhere: similar controversies are playing out in other cities across the south, notes npr, most notably in new orleans.",

        "summary": "Galileo: groundbreaking astronomer and early master of spin. Uk researchers say they have found a long-lost letter written by galileo that shows he engaged in a little deception to fend off the inquisition. It's all laid out in nature, and it takes a little unpacking. The saga began when galileo wrote to a friend in 1613 saying he now believed the earth revolved around the sun, and not vice versa. This was heretical in the eyes of the catholic church, but in his letter galileo scoffed at the idea of taking the bible literally on such matters. Copies made the rounds, and galileo faced big trouble when a friar forwarded it to the inquisition. This is where researchers say galileo got sneaky — by asking his friend for the original back so he could soften it. For example, galileo wrote that certain things in the bible were \" false, \" but he changed that to say they \"look different from the truth. \" after changes like that, he had a friend forward it to the vatican, arguing that it was his original and that the version in the church's hands had been doctored by enemies. The researchers say they know this now because they found the original letter in britain's royal society library, where it was discovered by chance last month after being mislabled. They say the edits are in galileo's own hand, showing that he was trying to exercise damage control, per nature. Don't judge him harshly for this, writes jennifer ouellette at ars technica. The changes are minor, and \" it's difficult for us to conceive just how dangerous a time the 17th century was for scientists and scholars who dared to cross the catholic church. \" in any event, galileo would be convicted of heresy in 1633; he spent the last nine years of his life under house arrest.

        "summary": "Prince was apparently battling opioid addiction when he died — and when he did die, he lay in an elevator for at least six hours before being found, the minneapolis star tribune reports. Sources close to the investigation say prince had suffered an opioid overdose on april 15 and received treatment from a twin cities physician to help battle opioid-addiction withdrawal. But prince grew agitated in the following days and went to a local hospital for intravenous treatment on april 20. At some point prince's staff contacted environmental and labor activist phaedra ellis-lamkins, who had worked with prince, and ellis-lamkins reached out to howard kornfeld, an addiction and pain specialist in california who then sent his son andrew to paisley park. Two associates of prince led andrew into paisley park on april 21 and began screaming when they discovered the singer's body in an elevator, sources say. A paramedic said prince had been dead for six hours or more. Soon another doctor, michael schulenberg, showed up and told investigators he had given prince treatment twice in april, including on april 20, and was only at paisley park to show the singer his test results. So are any doctors at fault? well, andrew kornfeld went to paisley park carrying a dose of suboxone, which contains buprenorphine, an opiate-addiction drug he wasn't licensed to administer, people reports. A lawyer says kornfeld only happened to have the drug, but possession alone could get him a $ 10,000 fine and up to 5 years in prison.",

That detail is among several emerging about the musician's final hours as state and federal investigators continue to piece together the cause and circumstances of his april 21 death at the chanhassen complex. A twin cities physician had been treating prince in the weeks before he died for withdrawal symptoms from opioid addiction. Autopsy and toxicology results are pending. Sources with knowledge of the investigation have told the star tribune that despite putting on a calm face after his emergency treatment for an opioid overdose in moline, ill., on april 15, prince grew increasingly agitated in the following days. That prompted one member of his staff to place a call to new york at 6 a.m. On april 20 — the day before the musician's body was found — seeking advice from someone who had recently worked with the musician, a source said. Later that day, prince was given an intravenous treatment at a local hospital, a source with knowledge of the investigation said. It's not clear whether that visit came before or after the doctor treating him for withdrawal symptoms made a house call that evening at paisley park. Attorney bill mauzy has spoken on behalf of dr. Howard kornfeld, a pain and addiction specialist called to help prince.

And as a lifelong athlete, she was eager to reclaim her fitness after months of ill health. So she took the tour, checked out the locker rooms, and then politely warned the desk manager she planned on swimming topless. Jaecks didn't think it would be a big deal. A bilateral mastectomy in 2011 left her as flat-chested as a child, and two thin scars now cut across her chest where her nipples once lay. There is simply nothing left to cover up. Still: \" i wanted to be respectful by making them aware, \" 47-year-old jaecks says. But swimming topless — breasts or no — was a big deal for the city. She was told she couldn't swim that day.

The aquatics manager for the parks and recreation department told jaecks they require \" gender-appropriate clothing \" and therefore she would not be able to swim topless. \" i ' m not an exhibitionistic kind of person. It's not my personality, \" jaecks said. \" i don't think of this as nudity. Not as it's generally perceived. \" but after a seattle weekly newspaper, the stranger, ran a photo of jaecks topless wednesday, the parks and recreation superintendent changed his mind. \" this was a long standing policy that had been in effect for a lot of years and it had never really been challenged, \" dewey potter, the communications manager for seattle parks and recreation, told abcnews.com. \" the staff on the face of it did their job by following policy, but when the superintendent took a closer look he decided attitudes had shifted and he decided to allow this woman to swim and look at further cases one by one. \" after hearing the superintendent's decision wednesday, jaecks, an illinois native who moved to seattle in 1991, decided not to swim and is"

In a 2009 vanity fair article, murdoch biographer michael wolff wrote that murdoch had called the internet \" predatory \" — and, yes, considered it a den of \" porn, thievery, and hackers. \"",

The accusations against bloom include having donors pay the mortgage of one of trump's accusers and trying to get a six-figure payday from media outlets for a woman who ended up not going public with her accusations. Some of the money from selling the alleged victims'stories would also have gone to herself. While bloom said she had no contact with hillary clinton or the clinton campaign, she wouldn't comment on possible communications with clinton-supporting super pacs. Bloom calls the hill's report \" spurious \" and \" an effort to undermine the trump accusers now that they are gaining momentum, \" according to the hollywood reporter. She accuses reporter john solomon of \" ' weaponizing'stories about progressives like me to feed to fox news. \" she notes that the hill doesn't challenge the truth of the women's accusations against trump and that none of the women say they were asked to lie about trump's actions. Bloom says the money was not meant to pay women to accuse trump but rather to hire security or relocate them in the case of backlash. \" multiple donors...

Rios recently made it clear on facebook that she doesn't support hillary clinton as president — but it's not just clinton herself that bothers rios. After the ceo noted clinton isn't the \" right person \" for the job, she continued, \" more importantly a female shouldn't be president, \" per cbs 11. \" let the haters begin. \" rios — whose twitter bio describes herself as a \" mom who still thinks old fashioned is cool \" — further elaborated: \" with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war. Yes i run my own business and i love it and i am great at it but that is not the same as being the president, that should be left to a man, a good, strong, honorable man. \" rios doubled down to a cbs 11 reporter: \" i believe in what i said. There's an old biblical sound reasoning why a woman shouldn't be president, \" though the station's report doesn't mention what that theological reasoning might be. Rios continued her take on twitter today, posting, \" i am old fashioned, i am christian and believe what i have said. I didn't say that women should be abused, or that they are stupid or can't be lawyers, doctors or run successful businesses, i fully know and support that they can as i have done that. I mentioned one position only the head of our government. \" she then implores people to \" please stop the nastiness. \" one of rios ' own clients, a male motorcycle store owner, is baffled by her take, telling cbs 11, \" i can't comprehend someone who thinks a woman can't do anything a man can do. They can. I promise you they can. \" ( croatia just elected its first female president. )",

Officials say what happened to the boy is \" not survivable, \" usa today reports. According to wesh, the child was wading in the 200-acre seven seas lagoon at disney's grand floridian when he was grabbed by what witnesses say was a possibly 7-foot-long alligator. The boy's parents tried unsuccessfully to fight the gator off. The man-made seven seas lagoon is connected to canals and lakes throughout disney's property in orlando, making the search difficult. The resort's beaches have been closed since the incident. Five alligators have been pulled from the water and euthanized, but so far there's no evidence any of them were responsible for snatching the child. Fifty or so people are continuing to search for the child's remains, and demings hopes to find the boy wednesday to \" bring some closure to this family. \" only 23 humans have been killed by alligators in florida since the 1940s.",

The park stretches over 2,700 acres just south of richmond, and holes several inches deep were discovered in places where the soil had been untouched. Though park officials have yet to detail the types of items targeted or even whether anything was taken, bryce notes that the looters \" likely would have used a metal detector and a digging tool \" and \" probably did research \" on the civil war. The siege of petersburg was the war's \" longest military event, \" dragging on for nine months between 1864 and 1865 and resulting in the loss of some 70,000 lives.

Bryce says that while the battlefield will remain open to visitors during the memorial day weekend, a portion will be off limits as the investigation is under way.

Minnesota's bureau of criminal apprehension is investigating the shooting of justine damond and it says matthew harrity, the other officer present, has told them he was \" startled by a loud sound \" as they drove down an alley following up damond's 911 call about a possible sexual assault in progress, the pioneer press reports. The bca says harrity told them damond approached the driver's side window of the squad car immediately afterward, and was shot by officer mohamed noor. The \" loud sound \" may have been the \" aerial fireworks \" referred to in radio conversations between noor, hannity, dispatchers, and other officers in the area, reports the sydney morning herald. The bca says noor declined to be interviewed by investigators, and his lawyer didn't say \" when, if ever, an interview would be possible. \" minneapolis mayor betsy hodges says the lack of information is \" frustrating, \" the star tribune reports. \" we cannot compel officer noor to make a statement \" but she wishes he would make one, she told reporters tuesday night.

The squad's lights were off and a loud noise startled harrity as they reached an intersection. In the next moment, justine damond, the woman who called 911, approached harrity, who was in the driver's seat. Suddenly, for reasons still unclear, noor fired across his partner through squad's open window, striking damond in the abdomen. They began cpr, but she was dead 20 minutes later. After nearly three days of silence, the agency on tuesday released the first preliminary account of what happened that night based on an interview with harrity, 25.the fatal shooting of damond, a 40-year-old spiritual healer from australia who was engaged to be married, has made international headlines in the days since it happened, stirring community unrest toward police and calls from family and friends for an explanation as to why noor, 31, shot her. The new information from the bca does not fully answer those questions — in part because noor refused to be interviewed by investigators, so his mind-set is still a mystery — but it offers a timeline of what happened that night.

The squad's lights were off and a loud noise startled harrity as they reached an intersection. In the next moment, justine damond, the woman who called 911, approached harrity, who was in the driver's seat. Suddenly, for reasons still unclear, noor fired across his partner through squad's open window, striking damond in the abdomen. They began cpr, but she was dead 20 minutes later. After nearly three days of silence, the agency on tuesday released the first preliminary account of what happened that night based on an interview with harrity, 25.the fatal shooting of damond, a 40-year-old spiritual healer from australia who was engaged to be married, has made international headlines in the days since it happened, stirring community unrest toward police and calls from family and friends for an explanation as to why noor, 31, shot her. The new information from the bca does not fully answer those questions — in part because noor refused to be interviewed by investigators, so his mind-set is still a mystery — but it offers a timeline of what happened that night.

On feb. 11, researchers were preparing to ship the sample to chicago for further tests — they hadn't even confirmed if hydrogen was present or if the sample was a solid ( hence all the skepticism ) — when the diamonds broke. Researchers say the sample either turned back into a gas or is lying around somewhere too small to see.

They weren't the first sign that something was amiss — for three years she was put in a variety of learning environments and programs but her cognition seemed to be slowly declining instead of progressing. Finally, after a battery of tests, her family got a concrete and devastating answer in 2011, reports the chicago tribune. Hayley suffered from a rare genetic disorder called niemann-pick disease type c, sometimes dubbed \" childhood alzheimer's, \" which prevents her from processing cholesterol properly and leads to the gradual shutdown of the nervous system. Of the 500 or so patients, most diagnosed in elementary school, few will live to be 20, reports health day news. \" you've got kids who are dying, kids in wheelchairs, kids who can't eat, kids on feeding tubes, \" says dad harry koujaian. \" it's a cruel disease. \" \" these children deserve a fighting chance at life, \" says hayley's doctor, elizabeth berry-kravis, who two years ago began giving hayley bi-weekly shots of cyclodextrin, which seems to help cells process cholesterol, under compassionate use permission from the fda. Berry-kravis is now part of a trial on an experimental new drug called vts-270 that has slowed decline in mice and cats and is being injected into volunteer kids like hayley with promising early results — results berry-kravis hopes will push vts-270 through the fda approval process. Hayley, now 16, is improving in areas like walking and swallowing instead of simply maintaining her base line, which the koujaians note on fightnpc.com is all they'd first hoped for.

Hayley is one of roughly 40 patients across the country using the investigational drug, hoping for future fda approval. Berry-kravis, a pediatric neurologist, said there's initial evidence the injections could be staving off the disease's progression. Some skills even appear to be improving. Before starting treatment a little more than two years ago, hayley was functioning at the level of an 18-month-old, based on language and cognitive testing.

Hayley has a rare genetic disorder called niemann-pick disease type c, often dubbed childhood alzheimer's because its symptoms are similar to those of adult dementia, though it's not the same disease. Memory, speech and mobility fade. It gets harder to eat and drink unaided. There is no treatment approved by the food and drug administration, and young children with the disorder typically don't live past their teens. \" we all knew what the outcome was going to be if the disease progressed, \" said her father, harry koujaian. \" there is only one outcome. That's why we were so desperate. \" yet the family has found hope in a promising experimental drug — and the local physician who helped them gain access. Every two weeks, dr. Elizabeth berry-kravis injects a treatment called cyclodextrin into hayley via a spinal tap at rush university medical center as her father holds her steady and her mother silently prays. Hayley is one of roughly 40 patients across the country using the investigational drug, hoping for future fda approval. Berry-kravis, a pediatric neurologist, said there's initial evidence the injections could be staving off the disease's progression. Some skills even appear to be improving. Before starting treatment a little more than two years ago, hayley was functioning at the level of an 18-month-old, based on language and cognitive testing. Now her abilities closer match a 2 1/2 - or 3-year-old, berry-kravis said. Swallowing is much easier. Her gait is smoother, and she's less apt"

Despite brazil's promise in its olympic bid to clean up the bay, sewage ( of which 60 % is untreated ) and garbage flow into it unchecked and might well give olympians incentive to move a little faster, even though the stench makes many hesitate to so much as dip a toe in. And with the first test events just months away, sailing officials tell the ap that they want independent water testing. This after the ap obtained a letter from rio state's environment secretary acknowledging that at most pollution flowing into the bay could be cut by half — not the 80 % brazil promised. \" it can get really disgusting, with dog carcasses in some places and the water turning brown from sewage contamination, \" says one olympic hopeful who ran into a sofa while sailing in the bay; the german sailing team called it \" the dump that is rio. \" one brazilian sailing legend ( who says he's seen human corpses on four occasions while sailing in the bay ) wants the events moved to waters hours away, but officials insist progress is being made and that fecal contamination levels are \" satisfactory. \" malarkey, says one biologist: \" the bay is still a latrine. It's an insult to rio's people to say it will be clean for the olympics. \"",

Greg risling, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, says prosecutors are investigating whether the 71-year-old actor should face charges in connection with the alleged incident, which dates back to the 1990s, the los angeles times reports. Police say the woman reported the alleged incident to police in santa monica in november last year. Police haven't revealed anything about the nature of the allegation, and it's not clear how charges could be filed: sexual assault allegations from the 1990s are too old to prosecute under the statute of limitations that was in place in california at the time. Martin singer, stallone's lawyer, is pushing back hard against the allegation. He tells cnn that his client \" categorically denies \" the allegation and says it is \" inappropriate \" to \" try to ruin \" somebody with it. \" it's outrageous that the da's office and pd would announce this information because it makes the public think that there's something there, \" singer says. The lawyer tells the new york post that stallone met the woman while filming rambo iii in the late 1980s and they had a \" consensual, sexual \" relationship for several years.

Everyone from women's groups to the new york times editorial page to members of the senate democratic caucus favor yellen, for reasons that range from personal to fiscal. Critics, for example, say that summers is sexist and gave short shrift to female staffers when working for obama during the first term, though politico finds plenty of women to rebut the charge; they say he's too centrist and thus won't keep up bernanke's \" quantitative easing, \" or stimulus, programs; and they say he pushed for deregulation in the 1990s that led to this decade's mess. The wall street journal notes that yellen, the fed's current vice chairwoman, is \" widely regarded as a'dove,'shorthand in financial markets for a central banker in favor of easy-money policies to reduce unemployment and less worried about inflation. \" and it follows with this quote from a jpmorgan economist: \" the general opinion seems to be that summers would be somewhat less dovish than yellen. \" dig into both sources for details, but smart bettors also will factor in one important summers ally: barack obama.",

Not that there aren't more discoveries to make, it's just that the spacecraft responsible for them has a faulty \" reaction wheel \" that might mean the end of the mission, reports space.com. Kepler needs three such wheels functioning properly to zero in on targets, but one is kaput. Nasa sent up the craft with a spare when it launched the $ 600 million mission in 2009, but that had to be deployed last summer. Now it's out of spares. Engineers aren't giving up hope of getting one of the two troublesome wheels working again, but if that proves impossible, kepler will have to shift to a less ambitious sky-gazing mission. ( it's 40 million miles away, so a manual fix is out of the question. ) kepler has been busy in its four-plus years, identifying 115 planets and another 2,740 likely candidates, reports the new york times. \" before we flew kepler, we didn't know that earth-sized planets in habitable zones were common throughout our galaxy, \" says a nasa scientist. \" we didn't know that virtually every star in the sky had planets around them.

Critics are worried about this extended surveillance, pointing out that search warrants are being flouted, clear rules for usage don't exist, and those using the radar aren't publicizing it. Law enforcement officials, however, claim the technology is needed to protect officers and that they're not advertising it because \" if you disclose a technology or a method … you're telling the bad guys along with everyone else, \" an ex-supervisor for the us marshals tells the paper. The device most are using is the range-r, a handheld sensor working as a \" highly sensitive doppler motion detector. \" the device sends out radio waves that penetrate walls — even concrete and brick, though not large metal objects — detecting movement up to 50 feet away on the other side; even people in bed breathing can be picked up by the sensor. Manufacturer l-3 communications says it's sold about 200 of the devices to 50 agencies at $ 6,000 a pop.

            "Demonstrators protest against the killing of 19-year-old renisha mcbride outside the dearborn heights police station in dearborn heights, michigan november 7, 2013. Dearborn heights, michigan ( reuters ) - supporters of a 19-year-old suburban detroit woman who was shot dead last week at a home where she sought help after a car accident held a rally in her honor on thursday evening amid questions about what could have lead to her death. About 40 people gathered outside the police station in dearborn heights, a detroit suburb where the shooting occurred, demanding justice for the victim, renisha mcbride. \" we don't want this death shuffled aside. We want a full investigation to happen now, \" community activist david bullock, who helped organize the event, said in an interview following the demonstration. In a statement released before the vigil, mcbride's family questioned the actions of the homeowner, who has not been identified by police. \" the alleged assailant did not, according to reports, immediately notify the police that the shooting had taken place, \" the statement said. \" it was reported that instead neighbors contacted police about the shooting. \" mcbride got into a car accident and knocked on the homeowner's door about 2: 30 a.m. On saturday looking for help, dearborn heights police lieutenant james serwatowski said. The homeowner has told police that he thought mcbride was trying to break into his house and that his shotgun accidentally discharged, striking her in the face, serwatowski said. She died of her wounds on the front porch. Serwatowski did not say how police were contacted about the shooting. Police were still investigating the case, which they plan to turn over to the wayne county prosecutor for possible charges, serwatowski said. The detroit chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people suggested in a written statement that racial profiling could have played a role in the case. Mcbride was black and police have declined to discuss the race of the homeowner. \" was this a racial profiling? \" the organization said. \" was this shooting warranted when the evidence indicates that ms. Mcbride had no weapon, created no disturbance, threatened no break-in, or demonstrated no disrespect to the household in question? \" a funeral for mcbride, who according to her family worked for the ford motor company, was scheduled for friday morning"
