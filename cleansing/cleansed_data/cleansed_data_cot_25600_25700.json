        "summary": "President obama told congress today that he has sent troops to niger to support france's mission against militants in neighboring mali, reuters reports. But the deployment of about 100 military personnel will only set up a base for unarmed aircraft to conduct surveillance, he wrote in a letter. He didn't explicitly reference drones, but nbc news — which numbers the first wave of personnel at 250 to 300 — reports that two surveillance drones will initially be stationed there. The move marks the beginning of another far-flung military mission for the us and a deeper commitment to battling terror in north africa, the new york times reports. Until this week, america's only permanent base in africa was in djibouti, some 3,000 miles from mali — where french and african troops have won back northern cities but allowed militants to melt back into the desert. The militants have continued a small-scale campaign of suicide bombings, guard-post attacks, and the like.",

Washington the pentagon has deployed about 100 troops to the west african nation of niger to conduct unmanned reconnaissance flights over mali and share intelligence with french forces fighting al qaeda-affiliated militants, president barack obama told congress on friday. Obama, in a letter to congressional leaders, said the last 40 of the approximately 100 military personnel had arrived in niger on wednesday and were \" deployed with weapons for the purpose of providing their own force protection and security. \" \" this deployment will provide support for intelligence collection and will also facilitate intelligence sharing with french forces conducting operations in mali, and with other partners in the region, \" the president said.

He says the \" best-case scenario \" for his daughter is that she regains 10 % to 20 % use of her arm, but that amputation is also a possibility. While police used \" less-than-lethal \" weapons on protesters sunday — including a water cannon in freezing temperatures — a sheriff's department spokesperson tells the los angeles times they didn't use concussion grenades. \" we didn't deploy anything that should have caused that type of damage to her arm, \" says the spokesperson, adding that wilansky may have been hurt while protesters were \" rigging up their own explosives \" using propane bottles. A gofundme page has raised more than $ 286,000 for wilansky's medical bills. ( a woman was hit with rubber bullets while filming an interview at the protest site. )",

Three weeks into the most flagrant debacle of his presidency, obama didn't say what went wrong, why or who was to blame. He offered no details about what the administration is doing to fix it ( \"we've got people working overtime \" ), or how long it will take. And he expressed no contrition, saying only that \"nobody's madder than me. \" amid his professions of irritation, vague promises and unsubstantiated optimism, the president did express one important truth: the healthcare.gov implosion doesn't say much about the soundness of obamacare writ large or the philosophical complaints that continue to plague it.

The man first robbed a nearby sporting goods store in san bruno with a handgun, making off with a rifle and ammunition, before scaling the incomplete building around 4: 15pm, police say, reports the san francisco chronicle. Officers arrived to find the man, who was wearing white overalls, pointing the rifle at nearby st. Luke's hospital and \" heard shots fired, \" police chief greg suhr tells abc7. Authorities say the man also pointed the gun at police from a construction elevator before three officers opened fire. Authorities also used flash bangs to neutralize the man before confirming he was dead, police say. The chronicle reports a camera facing the construction project caught footage of a man slumped against the side of the elevator at 4: 30pm. Another frame shows two officers on the building's roof around 4: 45pm; one is pointing a rifle at the man. Officers later confirmed that the gunman fired one round — they wouldn't say where that shot was directed — but that no one was hit. \" it's very fortunate that no one was injured or killed, \" suhr tells the san jose mercury news. \" we have no idea why he did what he did. \" the man appeared to be hispanic and in his late 20s, police say. The building where the shooting took place will become a replacement hospital for st. Luke's in 2019.",

Advocates of the measure collected thousands of signatures to get it on the ballot, but they ran smack into a powerful coalition of business leaders and public workers who argued that the move would cost $ 812 million, forcing a hike in other taxes, reports the los angeles times. While most states are raiding the couch cushions for spare change, north dakota is enjoying a more than $ 1 billion budget surplus, thanks in large part to an oil boom that's filled state coffers and driven down unemployment, notes cnn. Some states, finding themselves with an alternate cash cow, have eliminated income tax, but many north dakotans worried that killing the property tax would eventually jeopardize school and infrastructure funding. Still, lawmakers say they get the outrage over inconsistencies in property tax exemptions, and plan to reform the law.",

        "summary": "The man accused of killing american expatriate ashley ann olsen says he last saw her alive. His lawyer, antonio voce, says cheik tidiane diaw met olsen at a nightclub, then visited her apartment in the early hours of jan. 8 where the pair had consensual sex while drunk and high on cocaine. Voce says olsen eventually asked the senegalese migrant to leave, fearing her boyfriend would show up, and pushed him toward the door, reports nbc news. Angry that she was treating him \" like a dog, \" diaw punched olsen in the back of the head or neck, voce says, per the guardian and telegraph. Voce suspects olsen fractured her skull at some point during the resulting shoving match. Diaw allegedly told police he pushed olsen to the ground, causing her to hit her head. Voce says diaw never actually strangled olsen, though diaw reportedly told police he did pick her up by her neck to put her on the bed. Prosecutor giuseppe creazzo believes diaw may have unintentionally strangled olsen, perhaps while trying to revive her after she hit her head, reports the daily beast. However, when diaw left, voce says olsen was on the bed moaning that she didn't feel well. \" he did not want to kill her or hurt her, \" he says. Diaw is believed to have illegally joined his brother in italy recently, and made money handing out nightclub flyers. He is now charged with aggravated murder. A funeral for olsen is scheduled for friday. \" she was a beautiful and creative young woman with a happy, exuberant and generous soul, \" her father says. \" we are heartbroken that she was taken from us. \"",

            "Bellefonte -- a popular penn state professor died slowly after being pushed from a rock quarry ledge, possibly remaining alive and immobile for days, according to testimony heard wednesday in centre county court. That testimony from a state police investigator also revealed more details about what police say was an attempt on the life of penn state associate professor ronald bettig that occurred a few days before he fell from the quarry ledge. It also hinted at a romantic relationship between his two alleged killers -- 32-year-old danelle geier and 39-year-old george ishler jr. -- whom police say are related as niece and uncle. Grier on wednesday waived her preliminary hearing on the charges against her. The testimony came during a preliminary hearing for ishler. When it ended, counts of murder and related offenses were bound over for trial in county court. The lead investigator in the case, state trooper brian wakefield, said geier and ishler killed bettig because they thought they stood to inherit money from him. They had tried and failed to drown him on a trip the trio took to rehoboth beach in delaware on aug. 10. \" when they were in delaware, [ ishler ] stated that he did dunk bettig while in the ocean, but that he felt he couldn't do it [ hold him under ] and didn't continue, \" wakefield said. Wakefield added: \" [ ishler ] stated he was to dunk bettig and danelle was to wrap her legs around him to hold bettig down under water. \" according to the trooper, the trio returned to the state college area on aug. 12, and went directly to the blackhawk quarry in potter township, luring bettig with the promise of a marijuana harvest. It was there that wakefield said bettig was pushed from an 80-foot ledge. Police believe ishler pushed him, while geier waited in the car with her toddler son. It took five days for bettig's body to be discovered. But wakefield said a pathologist believes he may have remained alive for up to two days, immobile and possibly unconscious. A medical examiner has ruled the cause of death \" blunt force trauma due to a fall. \" wakefield said bettig was likely still alive then when geier and ishler returned to the scene eight hours later to plant bettig's belongings and vehicle there.

            "Bellefonte -- a popular penn state professor died slowly after being pushed from a rock quarry ledge, possibly remaining alive and immobile for days, according to testimony heard wednesday in centre county court. That testimony from a state police investigator also revealed more details about what police say was an attempt on the life of penn state associate professor ronald bettig that occurred a few days before he fell from the quarry ledge. It also hinted at a romantic relationship between his two alleged killers -- 32-year-old danelle geier and 39-year-old george ishler jr. -- whom police say are related as niece and uncle. Grier on wednesday waived her preliminary hearing on the charges against her. The testimony came during a preliminary hearing for ishler. When it ended, counts of murder and related offenses were bound over for trial in county court. The lead investigator in the case, state trooper brian wakefield, said geier and ishler killed bettig because they thought they stood to inherit money from him. They had tried and failed to drown him on a trip the trio took to rehoboth beach in delaware on aug. 10. \" when they were in delaware, [ ishler ] stated that he did dunk bettig while in the ocean, but that he felt he couldn't do it [ hold him under ] and didn't continue, \" wakefield said. Wakefield added: \" [ ishler ] stated he was to dunk bettig and danelle was to wrap her legs around him to hold bettig down under water. \" according to the trooper, the trio returned to the state college area on aug. 12, and went directly to the blackhawk quarry in potter township, luring bettig with the promise of a marijuana harvest. It was there that wakefield said bettig was pushed from an 80-foot ledge. Police believe ishler pushed him, while geier waited in the car with her toddler son. It took five days for bettig's body to be discovered. But wakefield said a pathologist believes he may have remained alive for up to two days, immobile and possibly unconscious. A medical examiner has ruled the cause of death \" blunt force trauma due to a fall. \" wakefield said bettig was likely still alive then when geier and ishler returned to the scene eight hours later to plant bettig's belongings and vehicle there. They had hoped to make it look as though bettig had been there on his own and accidentally fallen, wakefield added. Police say investigators first found the professor's car at the",

The girl, a virgin, is thought to have miscarried at 14, and ended up giving birth at age 16 after inseminating herself seven times, the guardian reports. The disturbing details are included in a recently opened court judgment; the mother, who nbc news reports is an american living in the uk, is serving five years in prison. The unnamed mother did not want to give birth due to a health problem, so she adopted her three children from abroad when they were infants, two of them while married and one after she divorced. She was attempting to adopt a fourth child when she was denied and came up with the plot involving her daughter. Midwives who delivered the baby became suspicious when the mother tried to keep her daughter from breastfeeding the new baby ( \" we don't want any of that attachment thing, \" she reportedly said ), and called in child protection workers when the mother tried to take the baby away from her daughter. The girl later told investigators she didn't want to participate in her mom's scheme, but thought that \" if i do this … maybe she will love me more. \"",

In fact, when factoring in money spent by the campaigns, their parties, and various super pacs, the race is now the most expensive one for a house seat ever waged, with the total north of $ 50 million, reports cnn. The seat has long been held by republicans, but the 30-year-old ossoff is hoping to change that in tuesday's runoff vote. His chances? too close to call. The latest poll by wsb-landmark communications has ossoff at 49.7 % and handel at 48 %, with just 2.3 % undecided. Other polls show similarly tight margins. \"it's all well within the margin of error, \" one pollster, matthew towery, tells politico. \" i'd say the preponderance of evidence suggests that ossoff has a very, very slight lead. But it really is a coin flip right now. \" one factor in the outcome might be whether ossoff can energize young voters enough to come out in a non-presidential race, notes politico.

The race for the suburban atlanta seat, closely watched for clues about the shape of the 2018 midterm elections, appears to be within a few percentage points — with perhaps the slightest edge to ossoff, the 30-year-old democrat seeking to wrest away a traditionally republican seat in the first major election of donald trump's presidency. Story continued below \"it's all well within the margin of error, \" said matthew towery, whose firm, opinion savvy, released a poll last friday conducted for atlanta's fox affiliate showing ossoff leading by a single point. \"i'd say the preponderance of evidence suggests that ossoff has a very, very slight lead. But it really is a coin flip right now. \" the tight polling has both parties — which have each made eight-figure investments in the race — expecting a nail-biter tuesday night.

Lee started working in film in 1947, and in the 1950s he started working in hammer horror films and gained notoriety.

She ' ll have to turn over all jewelry she's wearing save a metal wedding band ( no gems or stones ) and, if she wants, a metal religious medallion.

Once a week, she can go shopping for anything from sweats and microwavable meals to sunglasses at the commissary. What visits will be like: in the prison's visiting room, giudice's kids \" can sit in her lap. They can give her kisses. She can touch them and hold them and love them.

After suggestions that it was a rolling pin or a cattle insemination device, italian man micah barak correctly identified the object found in an old building at a jerusalem cemetery as something called an \" isis beamer, \" nbc news reports. The solid metal object — named for the egyptian goddess, not the extremist group — is a modern device made in germany that \" is intended for the use of naturopaths and people dealing with energy healing, \" the antiquities authority says. In other words, it's new age, not bronze age. The cemetery is an important archaeological site, and experts say that while they suspected that the device might be of modern origin, they consulted religious experts, a jeweler, and had a lab at the weizmann institute of science analyze it after finding it, just in case it was an ancient temple treasure that had been lost for thousands of years. \" at first we thought it was a military object, but then began to dream. I have been in this business for a long time and cannot recall such a mystery, \" the head of the authority's anti-theft unit tells haaretz. The antiquities authority has invited barak to visit israel, and it says it still wants to find out how the object came to be buried in an ancient structure, nbc reports. ( last month, the authority solved what it calls \" one of the great archaeological riddles in the history of jerusalem. \" )",

Amid rumors of a \" palace coup, \" a think tank run by north korean defectors suspects that his 27-year-old sister kim yo jong is in charge, at least while kim recuperates from what some observers believe is gout or fractured ankles. Not much is known about kim yo jong, the youngest of the leader's six siblings, but if she is indeed making national decisions, that \" means there is something seriously wrong with kim jong un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill, \" an analyst with the center for strategic and international studies tells cnn. He says she was first spotted at official functions earlier this year. A surprise visit to south korea by the country's no. 2 and no. 3 leaders last week fueled more rumors of kim's downfall, but analysts believe that while there may have been a shake-up at the top, he is still at the top, at least as a figurehead, the guardian reports. Kim's father and grandfather also dropped out of sight for long periods, so kim's \" disappearing act over the past month, in the north korean context, is not an aberration, \" a north korea expert at tufts university tells the new york times. \" such vanishing acts would be most unusual in democracies, but in totalitarian north korea, kim is the state. He is free to come and go as he pleases. \" tomorrow is the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling workers ' party — described by reuters as a \" key political event \" — and analysts will be closely watching to see if kim makes an appearance at his family's mausoleum as he has done the past two years.",

        "summary": "One wouldn't think buying commercial spots on the weather channel would be the obvious media choice for presidential candidates vying for votes, but with hurricane matthew barreling toward the battleground states of florida and north carolina just a month before election day, that's exactly what hillary clinton's campaign is doing, politico reports. The democratic candidate has spent $ 63,000 with the network for five days ' worth of ads targeting sunshine state markets starting thursday. But while it's a smart pre-election purchase in terms of viewership ( the weather channel is likely to see a surge of watchers as the storm progresses ), it could backfire if voters think clinton is exploiting a dangerous situation for political benefit. ( politico notes other candidates, including donald trump, have also bought weather channel ads in 2016. ) it's usually a tricky political situation with a major weather event, as political leaders toe the line between taking charge in affected areas and not looking like \" a politically crass politician who's parachuting in for a photo-op, \" as an adviser to mitt romney's 2012 presidential campaign puts it. There's even a difference between how a president is received versus candidates. President obama himself was set to be in florida campaigning for clinton, but he was stymied by matthew and called his pitch into a miami radio station instead, per the miami herald. A clinton campaign rep downplays the weather channel ads, noting it was \" less than 1 % \" of the campaign's recent media spending in battleground states. The storm may also put many campaign volunteers and staffers on both sides temporarily out of commission as they hunker down. ( matthew may hit florida twice. )",

Hurricane matthew is currently forecast to approach the florida east coast late thursday or on friday. It's a risky proposition.

The weather channel, unsurprisingly, gets a spike in viewership during natural disasters — and not just in the affected areas. Viewers across the country tend to tune in to watch storm footage.

Attendees were surprised to see him with his children at the event — which included a bouncy house and petting zoo — since he was feuding with his mother-in-law from his most recent marriage in 2014. Michelle shields, who attended the church, was estranged from her daughter, danielle shields, who worked there, reports the houston chronicle. But \" they thought, ' oh this is good. This is progress, ' \" says a friend of the mother-in-law, adding that michelle shields was particularly pleased to see kelley with her grandchildren. Shortly after 11am sunday, however, kelley appeared on a mission to \" take care of the mother-in-law, \" a commander of the texas department of public safety tells nbc news, when he emptied 15 30-round magazines inside first baptist church. Shields was not inside, but a witness says kelley yelled, \" everybody die [ expletive ], \" per ksat. Kelley's troubled past has emerged in the aftermath: he tried to sneak guns onto holloman air force base in new mexico, made death threats against superiors, and escaped a psychiatric hospital after assaulting his then-wife and infant son. He was also accused of rape in 2013, though the investigation halted when kelley moved out of state; he pleaded guilty to animal cruelty in 2014, per buzzfeed and cnn.",

The ranking, which tracks the world's 500 richest people, is updated after the close of each trading day in new york. Buffett, once the world's wealthiest person, is sliding in the ranking thanks to his charitable giving, which he kicked off in earnest in 2006. He's donated about 290 million berkshire hathaway class b shares to charities, most of it to gates's foundation. Those shares are now worth more than $ 50 billion, according to data compiled by bloomberg. Zuckerberg has pledged to give away 99 percent of his facebook stock in his lifetime."

        "summary": "The white house has rethought its mideast protocol: president obama himself will travel to saudi arabia tuesday instead of joe biden to meet with the nation's new king, reports reuters. Obama will cut short a visit to india, ditching a trip to the taj mahal, to pay his respects in the wake of the death of king abdullah, and to officially meet abdullah's younger half-brother, the new king salman. The meeting will come at a time of relatively strained relations between the us and saudi arabia, observes the new york times. \" the close ties once nurtured so lovingly by the bush administration have given way to complaints from the saudis about an aloof american president who should have done more to unseat president bashar al-assad of syria and less to unseat former president hosni mubarak of egypt, \" says the newspaper's analysis. Friction over how to deal with iran isn't helping, either. Still, the white house decision might have been helped along by clashes between the secret service and indian officials over security concerns in the city of agra, where the taj is located, reports the washington post. Given the ban on automobiles, obama would have been in an electric golf cart. He and the first lady arrive in india tomorrow.",

Us district judge mark goldsmith sided with the michigan court of appeal's ruling that the green party candidate, who received around 1 % of the vote, doesn't qualify as an \" aggrieved candidate \" for recount purposes, reports the detroit free press. Goldsmith, agreeing with the state gop, also said there was no evidence of hacking or other tampering with a state voting system so secure that \" gremlins, martians, or russian hackers \" couldn't mess with it. He said he suspects the recount law's makers intended to \" confine costly and disruptive recounts to cases where a losing candidate stood a reasonable chance of changing the outcome. \" stein's lawyers vowed to appeal the \" deeply disappointing \" ruling. \" backed by michigan republicans, donald trump — who himself has repeatedly alleged widespread voter fraud and a ' rigged election ' — suddenly sees no need for a routine verification of the democratic process in michigan, \" they said in a statement. \" his efforts to suppress the vote count is a stunning about-face, even by trump's own standards. \" trump was declared the winner by a margin of 10,704 out of almost 4.8 million votes, and stein's lawyers say they want to look into issues including 75,000 ballots with no presidential votes, which is almost twice as many as in 2012.

Jay maynor, 43, also fired shots into a country store when he saw the ex-boyfriend of another of his daughters, whom his daughter says was abusive, but that man was uninjured. On monday, jay maynor was sentenced to 40 years in prison for murder, plus 20 years for attempted murder, to be served concurrently.

As the observer reports, two geology students spotted pieces of bone amid the rocks in a quarry in england a few years ago. What they had found was a nearly full skeleton of leedsichthys, a jurassic era fish that scientists had previously estimated to grow to more than 25 feet in length. After studying it and other remains, scientists now believe the fish could grow more than twice that long — \" around 16.5 meters, \" or 54 feet, reports physorg. The fossil was a pretty amazing find ( especially considering the creature's cartilage-rich skeleton didn't fossilize well ) and, per the head of the team behind the research, the discovery broadens our understanding of \" the process... Known as gigantism. \" as professor jeff liston of the national museums of scotland explains, scientists know the land animals of the time were growing much larger ( think apatosaurus and brachiosaurus ); they can now confirm that \" a parallel process occurred in the oceans. \" what fish does the leedsichthys steal the \" largest \" title from? the whale shark, which can grow to about 40 feet.",

            "As the largest fish in the sea, reaching lengths of 40 feet ( 12 meters ) or more, whale sharks have an enormous menu from which to choose. Fortunately for most sea-dwellers — and us! — their favorite meal is plankton. They scoop these tiny plants and animals up, along with any small fish that happen to be around, with their colossal gaping mouths while swimming close to the water's surface. Feeding the whale shark, like the world's second largest fish, the basking shark, is a filter feeder. In order to eat, the beast juts out its formidably sized jaws and passively filters everything in its path.

        "summary": "At 1,460 pages, david j. Garrow's new biography of barack obama is no quick read, including details down to the student evaluations he received while teaching at the university of chicago. Rising star paints obama as a man making calculated choices in the course of a lifelong pursuit of the presidency. Among those, garrow writes, is his decision to break off a relationship with sheila miyoshi jager, a woman he loved in the late 1980s and to whom he proposed marriage, though her parents didn't approve. Garrow sees race as the central issue in their failed relationship — but not obama's race. Jager, of japanese and dutch descent, didn't seem to suit obama's need to \" fully identify as african american \" in order to pursue his \" calling, \" garrow writes, noting a non-black spouse was seen as a liability in chicago politics. But apart from the \" bitter musings \" of an ex, \" garrow has turned up little that's substantially new, \" michiko kakutani writes in a review at the new york times, calling the book \" a dreary slog of a read \" that is \" way more exhausting than exhaustive. \" it's \" as if garrow wanted to include every last scrap of information he'd unearthed \" from interviews conducted with more than a thousand people, she adds. At the washington post, carlos lozada agrees, noting \" at times garrow delivers information simply because he has it. \" but lozada notes garrow also adds some \" deliciously small-bore \" details — painting the illinois statehouse as a place of adultery ( not on obama's part ) and poker games, for instance — even if the presidential part of his legacy is rushed in \" a clunky and tacky epilogue. \" the book is out tuesday.

The papa john's founder, who stepped down as chairman of the company's board of directors last week after admitting he had used the n-word on a conference call, said in a letter to the directors dated saturday that he shouldn't have done so, the wall street journal and cnbc report. \" the board asked me to step down as chairman without apparently doing any investigation. I agreed, though today i believe it was a mistake to do so. I have checked with corporate governance experts who tell me that this was not a proper action by the board, \" the letter reads. \" i will not allow either my good name or the good name of the company i founded and love to be unfairly tainted. \" he claims the media consulting firm that was on the conference call attempted to blackmail the company for $ 6 million to keep quiet about his use of the n-word. The letter also addressed the incident, which took place during a media training after his controversial comments last year blaming declining pizza sales on the nfl's national anthem kneeling protests. He said that during the training, he was asked whether he is racist, and he said he is not. \" i then said something on the order of, colonel sanders used the word ' n, ' ( i actually used the word ), that i would never use that word, and papa john's doesn't use that word. Let me be very clear: i never used the ' n ' word in that meeting as a racial epithet, nor would i ever, \" he wrote. He also added that the firm suggested using kanye west as a spokesperson but he refused because the rapper \" uses the ' n ' word in his lyrics. \" sources say schnatter sent the letter after being informed the board wanted to discuss his full resignation ( he currently remains a member, just not the chair ), and the lawyer he recently hired says \" he's not going quietly. \" ( sports teams are dropping papa john's like it's hot. )",

Alekseyp set the tweeting threshold at 50mbps in part because the raspberry pi's ethernet port tops out at 100mbps.

Reddit user alekseyp has managed to automate passive aggression with a raspberry pi. Every time his comcast internet speeds drop significantly below what he's paying for, the raspberry pi will publicly tweet at comcast. You can check out the account for alekseyp's custom comcast-annoyance machine. The device is connected to alekseyp's local network and runs a series of speed tests once per hour. The service tier is supposed to provide 150mb down and 10mb up, speeds that alekseyp says he often does not get. When speeds drop below 50mb down ( the raspberry pi's ethernet tops out at 100mb anyway ), the bot sends a tweet to @comcast, @comcastcares, and @xfinifty with the live numbers. It also logs the values to a local database so it can be monitored. Judging by the twitter account, alekseyp has speed issues fairly often, sometimes more than once per day.

The videos are graphic, a word used by sheriff joe lombardo tuesday in describing the release of what the las vegas review-journal reports is a total of about 160 minutes of footage: \" we believe the release of the graphic footage will further traumatize a wounded community, and for that, we apologize, \" he said, per cnn. Police had resisted release of the records, arguing that they had scant funds and resources to carry out the request and citing potential trauma to survivors and victims ' family members. The nevada supreme court on friday ruled that the video had to be released, and the review-journal notes the footage gives the public its first view into how officers handled that night. It captures the officers'tension as they wait. \" breach, breach, breach, \" can be heard, followed by the explosion that blew open paddock's door. An alarm sounds; the group remains calm and shows no emotion. As they move forward, they're heard identifying a camera, spotting a rifle, and saying they're going to check under the bed. Officer levi hancock entered the suite first but his body camera was off, meaning the initial moments in the room aren't viewable. The footage was taken by two k-9 officers who entered the room shortly after hancock, and after paddock's body had been discovered.",

But the university of wisconsin-madison student's problems have since become much worse after several other women emerged in the days following with similar charges, the wisconsin state journal reports. Now the 20-year-old is expected to be slammed during a thursday court appearance with almost a dozen felony sexual assault charges and 15 misdemeanor ones, as well as charges related to strangulation and false imprisonment — 30 criminal counts in total regarding four women, the journal adds. And a madison police search warrant notes that \" dozens of females have come forward wanting to speak about unknown acts related to cook. \" a madison police investigator says the junior from minnesota, now under \" emergency suspension \" at the college, kept at least one notebook that documented how he groomed and stalked the women, including listing their interests and what he planned to do with them, with statements including \" kill \" among them, per the minneapolis star tribune. All told, investigators think cook has been committing these crimes with increasing aggressiveness since march 2015. Cook's lawyer, meanwhile, says the reports are nothing more than a \" character assassination \" and compares the entries allegedly found in cook's notebook to his own time as an english lit major in college, when \" every single short story could be interpreted 12 ways. \" ( a frat's initiation process reportedly including drugging and raping women. )",

Some notable races and ballot items to keep an eye on: the gop hopes to address the elephant in the room in kentucky: that there has only been one republican governor there since the early 1970s, politico notes. Still, republicans are hoping nominee matt bevin can beat democratic state attorney general jack conway. Bevin — who fivethirtyeight notes \" has made a number of missteps … [ and ] alienated many members of the republican establishment \" — is losing to the \" smooth \" conway in the polls, but not by much. Ohio will be voting on whether to legalize pot for both medical and recreational use at once — the only state to do so, per the washington post — with its issue 3 initiative. Surprisingly, issue 3 is expected to be voted down by many pot advocates, who don't like that the measure would effectively create a marijuana monopoly ( and make guys like nick lachey super-rich ). The virginia state senate is in the hot seat. The dems want to wrest control from their gop counterparts, which means they need to net just two seats, per roll call. Perhaps the most closely watched race: who will fill the slot of retiring democratic state sen. Chuck colgan, with dem jeremy mcpike and his gop opponent, hal parrish, both going all out with their ad campaigns, politico notes. Mississippi's jim hood, deemed by roll call as the \" last democrat standing \" in the state, is up for his fourth term as attorney general: if he loses to mike hurst, republicans would inhabit every statewide elected office. Also making waves there ( even more so than the governor's race ): a state constitutional amendment that would let people sue mississippi to up funding for public schools, the ap reports. Houston's prop 1, supported by the lgbt community, would prevent discrimination in everything from employment and housing to public accommodations, the houston press reports. Texas gov.

No men in women's bathrooms, \" which the houston chronicle notes was a response to hillary's previous support for the measure. Hillary clinton's response tuesday: \" @gregabbott_tx is right about one thing: equality is one of hillary's values.

Accounted for 24 % to 68 % ( depending on temperature, water ph and chlorine condition ) of the byproduct cyanogen chloride in the pool water samples. \" both chemicals have been linked to health problems experienced by swimmers, lifeguards, and pool staff, reports quartz, which points to a 2012 survey that found 19 % of adults cop to having peed in a public pool. If you don't count yourself among the group of offenders, you may be contributing to the problem anyway: philly.com cites previous studies that suggest swimmers typically \" drip out \" as much as two shot glasses of urine when swimming.

And each year, a handful of people choke to death on them. This year's toll was especially severe as compared to recent years: afp reports by way of local media that as of friday nine people had died and another 13 were hospitalized; the last two years saw a total of six reported deaths by mochi. The guardian reports that all but about 20 % of the victims are typically elderly, and japan today earlier reported that the six people who were taken to tokyo-area hospitals on thursday ranged in age from their 50s to their 90s. The sticky rice cakes are generally added to \" ozouni \" soup over the holidays, but they can also be toasted and wrapped in dried seaweed. The country's police and fire services advise the elderly to cut the mochi into small pieces and never eat it alone. In a 2011 look at the \" silent killer, \" the wall street journal explained why the elderly are more susceptible to mochi-related deaths, which it describes as the leading cause of food-related suffocation: age chips away at their \" mastication abilities and saliva secretion, \" making it easier for a bite of the glutinous cake to get lodged in the throat. In advance of last year's new year, the guardian reported that companies have been hustling to create a version that incorporates an enzyme that reduces the stickiness without sacrificing mochi's starchy flavor.

As for mara herself, her biggest role to date is nancy holbrook in the reboot of a nightmare on elm street. She's already worked with fincher: he cast her in the social network, his movie about facebook, and he fought for mara when sony wasn't convinced she was right as salander.

Monday's service was filled with emotion — genuine grief and sadness over losing \"everybody's best friend. \" there was humor, as you would expect, but the overall tone was a group-shared sense of extreme loss. But it was mcgroarty's obituary, written by him a year ago, according to his closest friends, that jettisoned mcgroarty to his 15 minutes of fame following his death. For example, mcgroarty wrote: \"mcgroarty achieves room temperature! \"kevin j. Mcgroarty, 53, of west pittston, died tuesday, july 22, 2014, after battling a long fight with mediocracy. \"he enjoyed elaborate practical jokes, over-tipping in restaurants, sushi and marx brothers movies. \" just a sampling of the wit and humor of mcgroarty,",
            "Leave it to an ad guy to write his own hilariously entertaining obituary, and have it go viral in the days after his death. Kevin j. Mcgroarty, who died last tuesday at age 53, had worked in advertising since 1983 and ran rhino media in west pittston, pa., until 2006, according to the obituary in the wilkes barre times leader — a 500-word mini masterpiece that gets off to a flying start with the line: \" mcgroarty achieves room temperature! \" every paragraph is amusing, though the high points include: • he was preceded in death by brother, airborne ranger lt. Michael f. Mcgroarty, and many beloved pets, chainsaw, an english mastiff in spring 2009, baron, an irish setter in august 1982, peter max, a turtle, summer 1968; along with numerous house flies and bees, but they were only acquaintances. • mcgroarty leaves behind no children ( that he knows of ), but if he did their names would be son, \" almighty thor \" mcgroarty; and daughter, \" butter cup patchouli. \" • he would like to remind his friends: \" please, don't email me, i ' m dead. \" • a mass of christian burial will be held at 10 a.m. Monday in st. Cecilia church of st. Barbara parish, 1700 wyoming ave."

It marked the state's first execution in almost three years, and its first using a single drug, the pentobarbital. Franklin had been granted a stay of execution late yesterday by a federal judge concerned by missouri's choice of that controversial execution drug; a federal appeals court then lifted that stay, and franklin's lawyers appealed to the supreme court, reports the ap. Early today, the high court rejected franklin's appeal, overturning the first judge's ruling that missouri must resolve a lawsuit from franklin and 20 other inmates before it can use pentobarbital for lethal injections, reports the new york daily news. Missouri's supreme court and gov. Jay nixon had already rejected appeals. Franklin, a white supremacist who targeted blacks, jews, and interracial couples in a three-year killing spree that began in 1977, was the shooter who paralyzed hustler publisher larry flynt in 1978. Franklin was sentenced to die for the sniper killing of a man outside a st. Louis synagogue in 1977. He was convicted of seven other murders and has confessed to or been charged with a dozen more. Flynt — who was targeted because his magazine depicted interracial couples — previously said he didn't want franklin executed.",

He said he spent the morning investigating what happened before coming to his conclusion. \"i have made clear in this campaign that we will conduct this campaign with the very highest standards of integrity, \" he added.

The complaints ratcheted up earlier this month, when ben carson took cruz's campaign to task for spreading false rumors during the iowa caucuses that the retired neurosurgeon was dropping out. But the accusations really started flying in south carolina, with protests over robocalls, photoshopped images, and other underhanded tactics. Rival campaigns have labeled cruz a liar, and have gone to great lengths to try to make that reputation stick. Earlier on monday",

No motive is known. \" right now we believe it's a sole actor, a lone wolf type actor, \" says lombardo. \" it's a devastating time. \" the latest: \" we do not know what his belief system was at this time, \" says lombardo of the shooter.

Lombardo says two off-duty police officers who were attending the concert are among the dead, the ap reports. Two others were injured, including one who is in critical condition, he says. The sheriff confirmed that the gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay, where he was killed after being confronted by officers, the guardian reports.

Then later: \" nfl. Just so you know. \" prosecutors say hernandez bought blue bubblicious gum at a gas station before picking up lloyd. Later, police recovered a piece of the gum and a shell casing, one that matched the casings found near the body, in trash of the rental car company used by hernandez. ( per the prosecutor, an attendant says he found the items while cleaning hernandez's rental, and remembered that hernandez offered him a stick of the gum. ) hernandez presumably has plenty of money socked away to pay for a strong defense, but the new england patriots hope to avoid adding to the coffer. By cutting him yesterday before letting the legal process play out, the patriots remain on the hook for millions, reports nbc sports. But mike florio writes that the team might simply refuse to pay hernandez the $ 3.25 million he is due in march as part of a signing bonus, along with another $ 2.5 million in supposedly guaranteed salary.

        "summary": "For more than 10 years, bav consulting has kept an eye on the donald trump brand, documenting its peaks and valleys in consumer opinion. But as politico reports, the donald's hold on the luxury goods market — which has helped amass him a portfolio that bloomberg has estimated is worth $ 3 billion — has suffered since he's embarked on his presidential campaign, with those who can afford those products and services turning away in increasing numbers. In a december bav survey, the \" value of the trump name is collapsing, \" as politico frames it, in categories such as \" upper class, \" \" prestigious \" and \" glamorous. \" and even if he's willing to give up his standing in the luxury world for a shot at the white house, there's more bad news: those same high-income consumers ( making at least $ 100,000 per year ) aren't as willing to assign the terms \" leader, \" \" dynamic, \" or \" innovative \" — ostensibly presidential descriptors — to him either. And those in the $ 150k-plus bracket are turning their noses up at him the most: trump's reputation for being \" obliging \" and \" upper class \" has plummeted 50 % since he became a candidate. As politico explains, a brand's cred usually falls after a negative major event, like a scandal or a recall. But when it comes to the trouble with trump, his personality has played a major part. And that one \" major event \" has been supplanted by a series of smaller ones that, taken together, may be erasing his brand's impact in the coveted demographic: after his statements last summer about mexican immigrants, for example, politico notes he experienced the \" first visible signs of the commercial cost, \" with his name ripped off of buildings and out of marketing deals. In the words of his own son, donald jr., in 2014, before sr. Said he was running: \" he will question … things in a way that you don't see anyone doing today. … there could be potentially ramifications to his business for taking these stances. \"",

In a further attempt to back up its claims, tehran yesterday aired 11 minutes of footage of military officials inspecting what it claims is the scaneagle drone, the wall street journal reports. The us navy continues to issue denials: \" we have seen the [ iranian ] footage. There is nothing we see that corroborates the claims, \" says a spokesperson. The journal notes there is the possibility iran somehow obtained the scaneagle through another channel and chose to unveil it now as a publicity play. It's a much lower-tech drone than some of the other models used, and more than 1,600 of them have been sold to various governments. The us has recently confirmed stepped-up surveillance of iran, but says drones stay beyond the country's borders.",
