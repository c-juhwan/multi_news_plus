Rhein was arrested mid-raze, as he was depositing debris into dumpsters — debris including all his wife's clothes and medications, appliances, etc., a neighbor tells cbs new york — and is facing a felony criminal mischief charge. He says he attempted to get a permit for the demolition but couldn't since the relevant office was closed monday — a federal holiday. He also says he tried to call his wife before starting the project, but she didn't answer. ( the electric, water, and gas lines to the house were shut off, though that's reportedly only because officials made emergency calls to avoid an explosion. ) and no, in case you were wondering, andryshak says the couple was not experiencing marital problems.

The stadiums selected are the nation's largest, home to six soccer teams in the top saudi professional league, cnn notes. The announcement drew criticism from conservative saudi twitter users, who deluged social media with surprised reactions to the fast pace of change, per afp. \" first women driving, now stadiums. What's next? night clubs? \" tweeted one. Seating arrangements were unclear but the kingdom strictly enforces separation of the sexes. In september, hundreds of women sat in family sections for the first time in a riyadh stadium for a national day celebration. While many praised the onetime freedom, conservatives who favor keeping to a strict interpretation of sunni islam, known as wahhabism, were not pleased. Last week, prince mohammed declared the heart of his modernization plan was a return to \" moderate islam, \" per the bbc. He said the 70 % of the saudi population under 30 wants a \" life in which our religion translates to tolerance. \" the prince's \" vision for 2030 \" plan to revitalize the economy includes boosting the participation of women in various sectors of saudi life, including increasing their role in the labor market to 30 % from 22 %, per afp.

        "summary": "How can elephants fend off ivory poachers? by never growing tusks at all. Some 32 % of female elephants in mozambique's gorongosa national park are now born tuskless — a far cry from the 2 % to 4 % naturally occurring in africa's wild, per research published in national geographic. Thousands of gorongosa elephants were slaughtered for ivory to fund the nation's long civil war, leaving just 200 females, half of whom are tuskless; now their female offspring are following suit. Numbers are worse in south africa's addo elephant park, where 98 % of all female pachyderms — mothers and daughters alike — were reportedly tuskless in the early ' naughts. The \" consequences of such dramatic changes in elephant populations are only just beginning to be explored, \" says a behavioral ecologist. Elephants use tusks for various things, like debarking trees for food and digging for minerals — yet tuskless elephants are surviving. Scientists are curious how they adapt, perhaps by widening home ranges to gather more recoverable foods. \" i've observed tuskless elephants feeding on bark, and they're able to strip bark with their trunks, and sometimes they use their teeth, \" says a researcher. One head-scratcher is why females are inheriting tusklessness, when the x chromosome, which carries genes for various traits, also goes from mother to son. \" but we don't see that, \" says an evolutionary biologist. \" tuskless males are extremely rare in african elephants. \" another factoid: it's nothing new. Scientists say asian elephants also evolved to lose their tusks or grow smaller ones, per the new york times. ( and elephants aren't only killed for their ivory. )",

            "And at least partly as a result, addo's elephants have also been spared something else: poaching. \"addo elephants might be the biggest success story anywhere, \" said the park's conservation manager, john adendorff. \"so maybe it's not a bad thing that they don't have tusks. Tusklessness has helped protect them. \" addo is the most dramatic example of the increase in the numbers of african elephants without tusks but not the only one. In mozambique's gorongosa national park, widespread poaching during that country's civil war in the 1970s to 1990s killed off disproportionately large numbers of elephants with tusks. The result is that in gorongosa, 53 percent of adult females and 35 percent of newborn females have no tusks, said joyce poole, an elephant biologist with the research and conservation organization elephant voices who has studied the animals for 43 years. \"among females then, the poachers were preferentially killing animals with tusks and leaving tuskless ones to survive, so they were breeding and producing more tuskless offspring, \" dr. Poole said.",
            "The oldest elephants wandering mozambique's gorongosa national park bear the indelible markings of the civil war that gripped the country for 15 years: many are tuskless. They're the lone survivors of a conflict that killed about 90 percent of these beleaguered animals, slaughtered for ivory to finance weapons and for meat to feed the fighters. Hunting gave elephants that didn't grow tusks a biological advantage in gorongosa. Recent figures suggest that about a third of younger females — the generation born after the war ended in 1992 — never developed tusks. Normally, tusklessness would occur only in about 2 to 4 percent of female african elephants. Decades ago, some 4,000 elephants lived in gorongosa, says joyce poole — an elephant behavior expert and national geographic explorer who studies the park's pachyderms. But those numbers dwindled to triple digits following the civil war. New, as yet unpublished, research she's compiled indicates that of the 200 known adult females, 51 percent of those that survived the war — animals 25 years or older — are tuskless. And 32 percent of the female elephants born since the war are tuskless. A male elephant's tusks are bigger and heavier than those of a female of the same age, says poole, who serves as scientific director of a nonprofit called elephantvoices. \"but once there's been heavy poaching pressure on a population, then the poachers start to focus on the older females as well, \" she explains. \"over time, with the older age population, you start to get this really higher proportion of tuskless females. \""

I literally had to look away from the tv screen in horror, that's how bad it was. But then... They went ahead and did it... They went ahead and dressed a 3-year-old up like julia roberts in pretty woman. Yeah, the waaaaaay trashy outfit from the beginning of the movie when she first picks up richard gere, with the silver-y loop thing connecting the spandex-y mini skirt/tank top combo and the thigh-high black patent-leather stripper boots and the blonde wig. Yeah, that one. Now you see why i was afraid to say the thing about \" just when we thought it couldn't get worse, \" right? because clearly it will get worse! there's definitely a pattern establishing itself here! and what could possibly be worse than a 3-year-old named paisley dressed up like a prostitute? not simply in a manner resembling a prostitute, mind you: like a specific prostitute. Paisley's mom",

        "summary": "Were you floored by the finding that we've had more mass shootings than days this year? so was mark follman. According to mother jones, where follman is an editor, there have been only four mass shooting this year — including the one in san bernardino — and only 73 since 1982. Why the discrepancy? \" the answer is that there is no official definition for ' mass shooting, ' \" follman writes at the new york times. The popular shootingtracker.com, for instance, labels a mass shooting as any incident involving four people who have been injured or killed — meaning that a late-night shooting in savannah, ga., that injured three and killed one on the same day as the san bernardino massacre is included. But follman says that's problematic. \" while all the victims are important, conflating those many other crimes with indiscriminate slaughter in public venues obscures our understanding of this complicated and growing problem. \" that's why mother jones'tally includes only attacks in which four or more people were killed, like the fbi's. However, it excludes murders linked to robberies, domestic abuse, and gang violence. This outline helped follman realize that \" the more narrowly defined mass shootings have grown more frequent, and overwhelmingly involve legally obtained firearms, \" he says. \" everyone is desperate to know why these attacks happen and how we might stop them — and we can't know, unless we collect and focus on useful data that filter out the noise. \" jodi upton at usa today offers a similar view. \" the problem is one of definitions, sometimes used sloppily and interchangeably, \" she writes. \" the result: a very confused, and possibly hyperventilating public. \" read follman's full piece here and upton's here.",

            "Can you contort your body -- roll upside down onto shoulders and tuck in knees -- while solving a math problem? then, try it in a pair of super tight, high-waisted jeans. Such was the talent of then-teenage actress brooke shields in a controversial 1980 calvin klein jeans campaign shot and directed by photographer richard avedon. The success of the campaign, for both ms. Shields and the brand, would have been impossible without stage mother teri shields, who passed away last week. Their ascent came with the rise of the denim pioneer that, while today would be considered staid, was responsible for introducing the concept of designer jeans to the u.s. Market. Perhaps ms. Shields ' mother had foreseen the career-launching power of calvin klein's fearless marketing, which, 10 years later, also catapulted actor mark ( marky mark ) wahlberg.

Aaron blake at the washington post, who calls haley's remarks an \" extraordinary rebuke \" of the white house, suspects trump reversed course on russia sanctions to defy advisers and assert his authority. \" whatever the reasons, though, haley made clear this was not handled well by the administration, and that it was not her fault, \" he writes.",

Second, duterte, already renowned for his brutal crackdown on drugs, is considering imposing martial law nationwide as his troops battle militants linked to isis. The details: praise on drugs: \"i just wanted to congratulate you because i am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem, \" trump told him. \" many countries have the problem, we have a problem, but what a great job you are doing and i just wanted to call and tell you that. \" duterte has been criticized by human rights groups for essentially declaring open season on drug dealers and users.

Transcript: here is the transcript of the phone call, from the intercept. Trump's style: the new york times says it sheds light on how he deals with fellow leaders: \" he sounds much the way he sounds in public, casing issues in largely black-and-white terms, often praising authoritarian leaders, largely unconcerned about human rights violations and genuinely uncertain about the nature of his adversary in north korea. \" hostages: duterte has declared martial law in the southern island of mindanao after militants affiliated with isis raided the city of marawi.

The second iteration didn't fare much better, but the third has now succeeded.

Story continued below the latest version of the ban levels a range of travel restrictions against five majority-muslim countries — iran, libya, somalia, syria and yemen — as well as north korea and venezuela. Chad, another majority-muslim nation, was removed from the list in april. Although several federal courts had blocked the ban nationwide, the justices allowed the policy to take full effect in december pending consideration of the merits of the case. The temporary order allowing full implementation was an ominous sign for opponents of the trump policy, particularly since only two justices — liberals ruth bader ginsburg and sonia sotomayor — dissented. The ruling on tuesday reverses the lower court decisions and will allow the policy to remain in place indefinitely, although litigation over the ban may continue. \"the proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing"

            "Cleveland — cleveland has reached a settlement with the justice department over what federal authorities said was a pattern of unconstitutional policing and excessive use of force, people briefed on the case said monday. The settlement, which could be announced as early as tuesday, comes days after a judge declared a cleveland police officer not guilty of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a car's two unarmed occupants, both of them black. The verdict prompted a day and night of protests and reignited discussions about how police officers treat the city's african-american residents. The details of the settlement were not immediately clear, but in similar talks in recent years, the justice department has required cities to allow independent monitors to oversee changes in police departments. Settlements are typically backed by court orders and often call for improved training and revised policies for the use of force.",

Still, both sides remain wary, reuters reports. \" if israel complies, we are compliant. If it does not comply, our hands are on the trigger, \" says hamas leader khaled meshaal. Some 162 palestinians were killed in the eight days of fighting, according to gaza health officials; more than half were civilians. Hamas fired some 1,400 rockets into israel, but israel says it pummeled gaza with 1,000 times the explosive power. Hamas has dubbed today a national holiday for \" the victory of the resistance, \" citing \" a new formula: if you hit gaza, we will hit tel aviv and beyond tel aviv. \" israeli defense minister ehud barak, however, calls the ceasefire \" a paper bridge for the defeated so that they can explain to their public how they can even show their faces after what they were hit with for a week. \" the measures stipulate that israel can't send ground troops or target specific militants in gaza; for its part, hamas must halt rocket attacks, the washington post reports. Neither side, however, can claim significant gains from the fighting, the post notes. Meanwhile, some israeli reservists seem poised to leave the gaza border, though thousands are staying, the new york times reports. Deployment decisions will come later today, the military says.

Boehner and harry reid: they averted a shutdown together in 2011. But then reid suggested boehner was out to keep his speaker gig at all costs in the fiscal cliff fight. Boehner's infamous reply: \" go fuck yourself. \" obama and mitch mcconnell: they've never been close, and now mcconnell is focused on his reelection bid.

It wasn't immediately clear whether they'd be active-duty troops or members of the national guard, or what their specific duties would be, reports cnn. But the best guess is that the troops would help shore up fencing and other barriers along parts of the border deemed vulnerable, rather than directly engaging with migrants attempting to cross illegally&amp; the development comes as thousands of migrants from central america continue to move north toward the us. In his tweet, trump again blamed democrats for weak immigration laws and quoted a guest on fox &amp; friends. \" brandon judd of the national border patrol council is right when he says... That the democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border, \" wrote the president. Judd represents about 16,000 border patrol agents in their union, notes nbc news.

        "summary": "At the end of world war ii, a jewish trauma psychologist in illinois went to europe to record conversations with holocaust survivors in the hopes of better understanding how they were coping, reports newsweek. He often broke the ice by having people sing, but when he died in 1961 and his archives were given to the university of akron in ohio, a box of 48 wire spools went unplayed ( and mislabeled ) because the devices used to play them were already obsolete. And there they sat for more than 50 years, collecting dust as the mystery surrounding what they contained deepened. Now, after a three-year engineering effort to build a device that could play the spools, researchers are sharing their discovery — that the recordings are of holocaust survivors and their songs. The researchers say that a woman named guta frank sang two of the most important pieces. Though her parents and most of her siblings were killed, she survived polish ghettos and concentration camps. The song \" undzer shtetl brent, \" which frank explained had been sung by the composer's daughter in krakow to ignite rebellion against the germans and call out bystanders for their complacency, includes the line \" our village is burning. \" frank instead sang that \" the jewish people are burning, \" reports the akron beacon journal. The other, \" unser lager steht am waldesrande, \" was sung by forced laborers and only its lyrics had previously been known. \" that we could give the world the melody to a song sung by those sentenced to their death...

Police today were questioning sinn fein leader gerry adams in the 1972 murder of jean mcconville, a widowed mother of 10 who was abducted by the ira from her belfast home, executed, and buried at a local beach, reports the bbc. Adams, who heads what is now the political arm of the ira, has always denied involvement in the killing and, in fact, has always denied that he ever belonged to the ira itself. He said in a statement today that he is \" voluntarily \" meeting with police, reports rte. The ira didn't admit to the mcconville killing until 1999, and her body wasn't found until 2003. The paramilitary group alleged she was an informer, though subsequent investigations have cast doubt on that, notes the guardian. Last month, police arrested a former ira leader named ivor bell and charged him in connection with her murder, one of several recent arrests in the case. Why now after all these years? because of the boston college tapes, which the bbc describes as \" a series of candid, confessional interviews with former loyalist and republican paramilitaries, designed to be an oral history of the troubles. \" participants were told the tapes would be released only after their deaths, but some content has been made public because of court challenges.

Last month, mr adams said he had asked his solicitor to contact the psni on the matter and said he was available to speak to them if they wished to speak with him. Mr adams denies any involvement in the murder of the belfast mother-of-ten. Speaking tonight, he said he had no role whatsoever in what was one of the most controversial murders of the troubles. In a statement, mr adams said while he had concerns about timing, he is \" voluntarily meeting with the psni this evening \".

The research out of brown university merely notes the association and isn't asserting that parents who allow the sipping are doing a bad thing, notes a post at eurekaalert. Still, the lead researcher says it should at least sound a note of caution about the so-called european model — the idea that letting young kids indulge a little will destigmatize alcohol and make them more responsible drinkers later. \" we need to be very careful not to assume that early alcohol consumption will somehow protect children or teach them how to drink safely, \" kristina jackson tells livescience. Researchers followed about 560 sixth-graders in rhode island over three years and found that the early sippers were about five times more likely to have had a full drink by ninth grade ( 26 % of them had done so ) than their peers. They were also about four times more likely to have gotten drunk ( 9 % ) or to have engaged in binge drinking. \" i think the most important thing is to make sure that children know when drinking alcohol is acceptable and when it is not, \" jackson tells cnn.

Paden mccormic was walking his three dogs through the mountains near the panther creek hot springs when two of the animals decided to go for a dip, reports reuters. One was killed \" rather quickly, \" but mccormic plunged into the springs hoping to save the other, a sheriff tells the idaho statesman. He suffered third-degree burns on over half his body pulling the dog from the water, reports localnews8.com. That dog later died, and mccormic was airlifted to a seattle hospital. A national forest rep says the water temperature of the springs usually allows for bathers, but it's suspected that drought conditions stopped cool water from flowing into the springs ' heated groundwater. Though it isn't clear exactly what the water temperature was at the time of the incident, the sheriff says it can reach 180 degrees. A relative says mccormic could spend three months in the hospital recovering. Officials add they've never heard of such an incident in the forest's 107-year history.",

        "summary": "Serena williams is getting tested for performance-enhancing drugs a lot. And williams, who's prepping for wimbledon, is getting annoyed. The us anti-doping agency versus serena situation came to a head on june 14 when a tester for the usada went to williams ' home in florida at 8: 30am for an unannounced test and williams was unavailable, reports deadspin. The tester reportedly refused to leave, but a test was never conducted. The seven-time wimbledon champion believes she is being unfairly targeted and complained to usada ceo travis tygart. Williams, who has been tested five times in 2018, according to the usada database, is by far the most tested player in us women's tennis. Other top us women's players have been tested once or twice in that time, if at all. She's also been tested more than any of the top five us male players. The usada conducts tests based on a dozen factors, among them, the players ' performance and ranking, training schedule and competition dates, information received about a player's possible doping practices, and injury data. A spokesperson for williams, who is seeded no. 25 for her return to wimbledon after having a baby, per the ap, tells deadspin that in williams ' 23-year career she has never tested positive for drugs and she has always willingly complied with testing. \"there is absolutely no reason for this kind of invasive and targeted treatment, \" the rep said. When asked if there is any reason to suspect williams of doping, usada rep brad horn said, \"absolutely not. \"",

The new ios will be supported by the new iphone xs, xs max, and iphone xr once they're all released, as well as by most apple products that support ios 11. Gizmodo has a list of the new features ios 12 includes, the splashiest of which are a memoji function that lets you emoji-fy your own face, new stickers you can now use to snazz up your still photos in facetime and elsewhere, and a function that spots problem passwords before you use them, among other updates. For all its perks, techcrunch warns iphone users who choose to download ios 12 to immediately make a few changes to security and other settings. The experts suggest users should set the phone to usb restricted mode in order to prevent anyone from using tools to bypass the password after it's been locked; that automatic updates should be turned on; to set a newer, longer numeric passcode now that they can be of any length; and to set up two-factor authentication.",

The 34-year-old contractor, who until a few years ago had served in the navy, spelled out this belief -- with the words, \" my elf weapon \" -- in the sawed-off remington 870 shotgun he brought into the military facility's building #197 on the morning of september 16. \" elf \" refers to low-frequency electromagnetic waves, a technology used for submarine communications that conspiracy theorists believe the government employs to monitor and manipulate unsuspecting citizens, the fbi said. \" ultra low frequency attack is what i've been subject to for the last 3 months, \" read a message obtained by federal authorities from alexis's thumb drives, phones and computers. \" and to be perfectly honest, that is what has driven me to this. \" \" this \" is the incident that left the navy, washington and the nation in shock",

I was not trying to drain the battery.

It just doesn't have much sex appeal: it's what it uses to monitor applications, compliance, and security. But we got a reminder this week that log data truly is valuable big data. After new york times writer john broder published a review bashing tesla's new model s, tesla ceo elon musk stepped forward wednesday with what he said was log data generated by the car during broder's test drive, and the data clearly refutes the writer's account. Log data and log data management make the world a little bit more honest by giving us hard facts about what's really happening in the moment, at the most granular level of detail imaginable. Beyond the intrinsic value in data-as-it-happens, log data immediately becomes a historical record that can prove or disprove our hunches and, at times, fabrications.

            "Smoking marijuana may affect the shape and quality of young men's sperm, ultimately putting their fertility at risk, new research shows. In a study published in the medical journal human reproduction, researchers analyzed many different lifestyle factors that could possibly have an impact on male infertility. The study was the largest of its kind, examining how habits such as smoking and drinking alcohol affected men's sperm size and shape – also known as sperm morphology. According to the researchers, marijuana use was the only habit they studied to be strongly associated with abnormal sperm morphology. \"we weren't really interested in [ the cannabis angle ] at all, \" dr.

        "summary": "Harley-davidson's foreign customers are important ones: international sales were up 12 % in q1, while the us saw a 0.2 % decline, reports the wall street journal. In an effort to preserve its good mojo abroad, the motorcycle maker on monday announced that within 18 months it will be producing eu-sold bikes outside of the us. The move is a reaction to the 31 % tariff the eu put in place on friday, which was itself the first phase of retaliation against new us tariffs on steel and aluminum. Cnnmoney reports the tariff had previously been 6 %. The company said the new figure would jack up the cost of a motorcycle by $ 2,200, and it's unwilling to pass that increase on to its eu consumers, who purchased roughly 40,000 bikes in 2017 — a six-year high. That made the eu its second-biggest source of revenue last year, per the ap. Harley-davidson will swallow the increase until the production has moved; it expects that to be as much as a $ 45 million hit this year. How the company frames its decision: \" increasing international production to alleviate the eu tariff burden isn't the company's preference, but represents the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the eu and maintain a viable business in europe. \" bloomberg reports the company didn't specify which of its foreign facilities would take on the extra work.

In the latest case, transgender actress trace lysette accuses tambor, who plays a transgender woman in the series, of lewd remarks and sexually suggestive actions, reports deadline. The 73-year-old tambor denies it, acknowledging in a statement that he can be \" volatile and ill-tempered \" and saying he is \" deeply sorry if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being sexually aggressive. \" but, he adds, \" i have never been a predator. \" an amazon spokesperson says the allegations will be added to the investigation into tambor that began when his former assistant, transgender woman van barnes, also accused him of sexual harassment. Tambor \" adamantly and vehemently \" denied those first allegations. Lysette ( who plays shea ) says tambor made a series of escalating remarks to her on the set, including, \" my god, trace. I want to attack you sexually, \" once when she emerged from her dressing room, per the hollywood reporter. Lysette says she and another actress laughed it off as a joke, but not so a subsequent incident a few minutes later, when tambor was dressed as maura pfefferman. \" he came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so i could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrust[ s ] back and forth against my body, \" says lysette. \" i felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas. \" the show is currently not in production, and deadline reports that tentative discussions are underway regarding how to potentially drop maura from season 5.",

Dr. Kevin smith says the risks associated with older fathers — studies have pointed to higher rates of autism and a range of other mental disorders — are enough of a problem that the government should consider setting up a state-supported sperm bank where men can deposit their swimmers at 18 and come back for them if they decide to father a child in their 40s or later. \" it's time we took seriously the issue of paternal age and its effect on the next generation of children, \" smith tells the bbc, which notes that private sperm banking costs around $ 300 a year, but also that the uk's national health service could probably bring costs down considerably. Fertility experts, however, tell the bbc that the suggestion is \" ridiculous \" for several reasons, including the fact that the risks associated with older fathers are \" really quite small, \" and the fact that most men's sperm doesn't freeze all that well. The chairman of the british fertility society tells the bbc that a national sperm bank isn't needed because it not only provides \" a very artificial approach to procreation, but also a false sense of security as the technology does not guarantee a baby. \" in a paper published in the journal of medical ethics, smith says \" health education to promote earlier fatherhood \" and \" incentives for young sperm donors \" should also be considered.

The study showed those with low neuropeptide y rated their emotional response as more negative while anticipating the event before and immediately after the event while reflecting on their experience. \" this tells us that individuals with the risk-associated npy gene variant tend to activate this key brain region more than other people, even in the absence of stress and before psychiatric symptoms are present, \" says researcher brian mickey, md, phd, assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the university of michigan medical school, in the news release.

It's a 28-minute movie released last week by the fbi that's designed to clue college kids in on the dangers of studying abroad — and its focus isn't exactly on stolen passports. Rather, the fbi is loudly warning this group, which numbers 280,000 annually, not to turn into spies. It makes the case that these students are targeted by foreign intelligence officers who sneakily forge relationships with students \" under seemingly innocuous pretexts such as job or internship opportunities, paid paper-writing engagements, language exchanges, and cultural immersion programs. \" and then things build from there. The movie makes its case by dramatizing a real case: that of glenn shriver, who left michigan's grand valley state university in 2004 to study in china. He innocently took a job writing political papers on chinese-american relations for $ 120 a pop, fox news reports. He was then encouraged by those he worked for to pursue a job with the us government ( prodding that occurred, at times, in hotel penthouses ). He complied: businessweek reports he failed the state department test twice, and moved on to applying for a position with the cia. He got $ 70,000 from china for his troubles... Along with a four-year prison sentence when he was arrested after his cia interview; he pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge. Message aside, how's the film? npr talked to its screenwriter, who said, \" i think it actually has very decent production values.

After using the frequency and order of symptoms to determine if a user was curious or actually suffering from an ailment, per neowin, the researchers identified 5 % to 15 % of pancreatic cancer cases with \" extremely low false-positive rates \" of one in 10,000 and one in 100,000, per the journal of oncology practice. \" we found that signals about patterns of queries in search logs can predict the future appearance of queries that are highly suggestive of a diagnosis, \" the researchers say, adding early screening could boost the number of pancreatic patients who survive for five years to 5 % to 7 %. \" i think the mainstream medical literature has been resistant to these kinds of studies and this kind of data, \" adds study author dr.

Indiana governor and now vp nominee mike pence will get his moment in the spotlight, where he ' ll need to make inroads with the american public: a cbs news poll taken july 8-12 found that 86 % of voters either don't know enough about him to form an opinion or are undecided on how they feel. A trio that trump defeated for the gop nomination will also speak at the convention: texas sen. Ted cruz, wisconsin gov. Scott walker, and ( via video ) florida sen. Marco rubio. Former vp hopeful newt gingrich and his wife, callista, will also appear to make one of the night's final speeches. Meanwhile, eric trump will offer words in his role as, per usa today, the \" obligatory trump family representative. \" the new york times notes that an imperative for the gop on wednesday is to simply pull off a single day \" without unwanted distraction or unforced errors \" in the wake of some convention floor discord ( an \" open revolt \" monday, alaska contesting its vote count tuesday ) and the melania trump plagiarism to-do. A bunch of \" trump allies \" will take the stage before the main speakers, including fox news regular laura ingraham and nutritional supplement marketer michelle van etten, and vox notes that \" while odds are they won't ruffle any feathers, there's potential for some wackadoo hijinks. \" the times also wonders if cruz will \" play nice, \" as well as whether trump will make yet another cameo and try to top his \" professional wrestling-style entrance \" from monday and his presence via video feed on tuesday.

        "summary": "The owner of the triple s mart in baton rouge, la., in front of which police shot and killed alton sterling on july 5, has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was falsely arrested and imprisoned and that police illegally seized his property, the daily beast reports. In the suit — which names several police officers, the police chief, and the city of baton rouge — abdullah muhlafi claims police stole his shop's security system, confiscated his phone, and locked him in a cruiser for four hours, letting him out only when he had to go to the bathroom ( which, per the suit, he was forced to do outside within public view ). Per the daily beast, police, at that time, had not applied for a search warrant and muhlafi did not sign a form consenting to the search. But, according to the website, police did file a search warrant and affidavit with the court on monday, nearly a week after the incident; per those documents, officers submitted an affidavit at 5: 23am july 5, and began their search of the convenience store at 5: 50am. Muhlafi, however, claims the search began about 1am. \"the timeline definitely doesn't add up, \" attorney joel porter told the daily beast, which notes the only way to know the truth is to see the security footage that police confiscated. Meanwhile, district attorney hillar moore iii has recused himself from the investigation into the death of 37-year-old sterling at the hands of officers blane salamoni and howie lake ii. Moore says he has worked with salamoni's parents, abc reports, both of whom are police officers. Now, the attorney general can take over, or appoint another district attorney.",

Ceo dave kerpen tells the new york post that he's \" a lifelong mets fan and 1986 was my first year watching the team. \" \" it can be very frustrating to watch as your team goes out and makes mistake after mistake, \" kerpen said. \" we often talk about our teams like we can control them.

Bloomberg's administration was already planning to enforce the ban and was shocked to hear of the decision by new york supreme court judge milton tingling. The judge said the ban was laden with loopholes and \" fraught with arbitrary and capricious consequences. \" he also accused the city board of health of overstepping its bounds by banning a legal item without there being an immediate threat of disease, the wall street journal reports. Set to kick in tomorrow, the ban would have prohibited venues from mobile food carts to restaurants from selling sugar-laden drinks bigger than 16 oz.

More: the ap has more on how the woman says garcia captured her: after he and her mother had an argument in august 2004, the then-teen went to a park. Garcia followed her, and she complained to him of a headache. He gave her five pills that he said would ease the headache but instead knocked her out; she woke up locked in a garage. Neighbors at garcia's apartment complex in santa ana are stunned by the allegations against the man they describe as a devoted family man, the los angeles times finds. \" he was a hard-working man, he worked two jobs, \" one resident says. \" he would do anything for her and their daughter. \" another resident says he doesn't \" understand how he could have her like that all these years, \" when \" the police station is right around the corner. \"",

        "summary": "A weather system that \" acts like a sort of traffic cop \" in the atlantic may have saved the us $ 150 billion and change after it helped shift hurricane irma's path and mitigate the storm's damage in florida. Bloomberg reports it was originally estimated the massive hurricane would cost in the ballpark of $ 200 billion, but by the time monday rolled around, that figure had dwindled to $ 50 billion. That's because the eye of the hurricane drifted west so that the bulk of the storm wasn't hovering over densely populated miami-dade county, yet it didn't drift too far west: jeff masters, co-founder of weather underground, explains that \" astronomical \" costs were avoided when irma hit marco island straight on, rather than shifting just 20 miles more to the west, leaving the more dangerous side of the hurricane ( to the right of the eye ) to wreak havoc along the state's gulf coast. The system tamping things down: the bermuda high, which the washington post describes as a high-pressure ridge over the central atlantic that serves as a steering \" guardrail. \" the bermuda high sent irma over cuba ( storms tend to weaken over land ), then sidestepped florida's tip, lessening storm surges. Where irma now stands, in terms of costliness: per the us national centers for environmental information, 2005's hurricane katrina tops the list at $ 160 billion, followed by 2012's hurricane sandy at $ 70.2 billion. Hurricane harvey costs are estimated between $ 65 billion and $ 75 billion, while irma estimates are coming in at $ 49.5 billion. A disaster modeler predicts as cities develop further, those costs will rise. \" i will not be surprised when we get to $ 300 billion, \" he tells bloomberg.",

The area over which tropical storm-force winds occur is greater, ranging as far out as almost 500km ( 300 miles ) from the eye of a large hurricane. One of the largest tropical cyclones ever measured was typhoon tip ( northwest pacific ocean, october 12, 1979 ), which at one point had a diameter of about 2100 km ( ~1350 miles ). One of the smallest tropical cyclones ever measured was cyclone tracy ( darwin, australia, december 24, 1974 ), which had a wind field of only 60 miles ( ~ 100 km ) across at landfall. A mature hurricane can be broken down into three main parts: the eye, eyewall, and outer region. In mature hurricanes, strong surface winds move inward towards the center of the storm and encircle a column of relatively calm air. This nearly cloud-free area of light winds is called the eye of a hurricane and is generally 20-50 km ( 12-30 miles ) in diameter. From the ground, looking up through the eye, skies may be so clear that you might see the stars at night or the sun during the day. Surrounding the eye is a violent, stormy eyewall, formed as inward-moving, warm air turns upward into the storm ( see hurricane development: from birth to maturity ). Usually, the strongest winds and heaviest precipitation are found in this area. In the northern hemisphere, the most destructive section of the storm is usually in the eyewall area to the right of the eye, known as the right-front quadrant. Based on the direction of movement of a hurricane during landfall, this section of the storm tends to have higher winds, seas, and storm surge. Outside the eyewall of a hurricane, rainbands spiral inwards towards the eyewall. These rain bands are capable of producing heavy rain and wind ( and occasionally tornadoes ). Sometimes, there are gaps between the bands where no rain is found. In fact, if one were to travel from the outer edge of a hurricane to its center, one would typically experience a progression from light rain to no rain back to slightly more intense rain many times with each period of rainfall being more intense and lasting longer until",

Now, the kathmandu post reports climbing guides are planning the \" most challenging, expensive, and longest \" everest mission ever to recover the 27-year-old indian climber's body. The expedition will require at least 10 guides, 40 oxygen cylinders, and four days in good weather. Kumar's body was found in a crevasse near the summit. It's possible rescuers will have to chip it out of the ice, increasing avalanche risk. According to outside, the mission \" seems almost beyond the realm of human capability. \" guides must nearly summit everest, descend into a crevasse, lift a frozen body laden with gear, and descend to a camp accessible by helicopters — all at an elevation known as the \" death zone, \" where life can't be sustained for long and it's impossible for one person to lift or drag another. The president of the nepal mountaineering association gives rescuers a \" 50/50 chance of survival. \" and outside states the mission is a mistake, with the rescuers themselves seemingly hesitant to undertake it. So why is it likely to happen when other bodies in similar situations have been left behind? the director of the agency behind kumar's expedition says his family \" wants the body at any cost. \" the indian government is also pushing hard for the mission, and the nepalese government doesn't want to risk the millions of dollars in aid it receives from india. The indian government has been asked to fund the mission, which could cost up to $ 70,000.

In the video, sudden flames spout at the bottom of the screen before obstructing the view as the gopro hero4 is swallowed. A year after the video was posted to youtube — and more recently popularized after a drone camera met a similar fate — national geographic explains what happened: while leading visitors on a tour of the park in august 2016, kilauea ecoguides owner erik storm put his camera down to record a fast-moving lava flow. That became a \" $ 400 mistake \" as, distracted, he told his charges about the polynesian fire goddess pele and was too late to pull his camera out of harm's — or pele's — way. By the time he returned to the camera, storm says the lava that had engulfed it had started to cool and harden, so he used a rock hammer to retrieve it. As the camera is pulled out of the lava, the video shows a screen turning from deep red to a cool blue hue. A man is then seen looking down at the camera. \" when i got home, i hammered all the hardened rock off of the camera and was amazed to see the blue wi-fi light still blinking! \" storm writes on storyful. And though the camera lens was melted — no surprise given that lava can reach up to 1,600 degrees fahrenheit in hawaii, per live science — \" the footage was intact, \" storm says.

            "New delhi, india - all currency is neurotic, wrote the late us philosopher norman o brown. The indian rupee seems to fit this description these days. How do you explain the fact that the currency of one of the world's fastest-growing economies has fallen more than 27 per cent against the dollar since july 2011? how has the rupee become one of the worst-performing currencies in asia this year? how serious are the rupee's neuroses? there is, obviously, no single reason for the rupee's debacle. A cocktail of threats have conspired to drive down the currency. The rupee's free-fall now threatens to stoke inflation, pull down the markets, and put additional pressure on an economy that has already contracted and is expected to grow by barely seven per cent this fiscal year - down from the nine per cent announced by the government at the beginning of the year. \" there is a very strong pressure on the rupee to depreciate, \" says subir gokarn, deputy governor of the reserve bank of india, the country's respected central bank.

        "summary": "Given a variety of reasons not to eat meat these days — think health, climate change, worker and animal welfare — many people are limiting the meat on their menus. But it's a splintered movement, with some going vegan, others vegetarian, and still others simply reducing their intake of animal products. This can lead to tensions, which is one reason 25-year-old brian kateman co-founded a movement called \" reducetarianism, \" alternet reports. It's \" an identity, community, and movement, \" he says, and its website sums it up: \" aspire to eat less meat? then you're a reducetarian! \" \" identifiers such as'semi-vegetarian ' and ' flexitarian'sound weak and inconsistent and describe individuals who primarily eat fruits and vegetables with the occasional inclusion of meat, \" kateman notes. The movement includes those people, as well as others who eat more meat, and \" encourages ( everyone ) to gradually eat less meat. \" the reducetarian website calls on followers to make a pledge to eat less meat for a month; it suggests trying meatless mondays or avoiding meat at dinner if you had it for lunch. Unlike similar movements, reducetarianism isn't focused on just one philosophy, kateman says: it advocates reducing meat intake for both ethical and health reasons. A crowdfunding campaign is working to bolster the movement, including sending \" ambassadors \" to schools. ( perhaps the measured approach will help subscribers avoid a vegetarian pitfall: keeping it up for just a year. )",

The best that cancer and heart groups will say about meat is it is not too harmful if you seriously limit portions.
