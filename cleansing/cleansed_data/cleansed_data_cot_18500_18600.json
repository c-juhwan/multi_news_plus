Sotheby's originally estimated that the 227-pound, 6-by-8.5-foot painting, called \" my wife's lovers, \" would fetch between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000, but a mystery buyer purchased what may now also have the distinction of being the priciest cat painting in the world for $ 826,000 on tuesday. Legend has it that kahler, who had recently moved to california from australia, where he'd painted racehorses, had never painted a cat before and thus spent three years doing sketches of johnson's felines. The resulting \" meowsterpiece \" features 42 of them, reports the new york post, with a critter named sultan, whom johnson bought for $ 3,000 in paris, front and center. All the cats in the painting are persians and angoras, reports the cbc, each with its own name and likely painted separately, sotheby's head of 19th-century european paintings says. \" no way did 42 cats sit still to have their portrait painted, \" she adds. A legion of servants is said to have looked after the felines. Johnson died not long after the painting was finished. ( like looking at cats? that's ok, it's good for you. )",

The 24-year-old rising star of conservative commentary was suspended by the blaze last month following an appearance on the view in which she voiced a pro-choice opinion. Lahren's lawsuit, filed friday in texas, claims she was then terminated by the blaze and her nightly talk show permanently cancelled, according to cnn. The lawsuit accuses the blaze of waging a \" public smear campaign \" against lahren and causing her \" irreparable harm \" by locking her out of her facebook page, the dallas morning news reports. A spokesperson for the blaze says lahren's lawsuit is \" puzzling \" since she hasn't technically been terminated. Lahren is still being paid by the blaze despite no longer appearing on it. The lawsuit claims the blaze is only paying her until it can figure out a way to legally end her contract, which doesn't expire until the end of september. Lahren's lawyer says her contract doesn't allow her to be fired for expressing her personal views. The lawsuit claims the blaze, whose staff it says put yellow caution tape over lahren's office door, is using her termination to boost beck's \" mediocre \" following. \" lay down and play dead really isn't my style, \" lahren tweeted after the lawsuit was filed.",

She had a funny way of showing it thursday when she posted a photo to snapchat of a nude woman in a locker room at an la fitness in los angeles, with the caption, \" if i can't unsee this then you can't either. \" the 29-year-old, named playboy's 2015 playmate of the year, then shared a selfie of herself covering her mouth, as though to hide a laugh. The backlash was hard and swift. The photo is \" body shaming at its worst \" and \" maybe illegal, \" kelsey garcia writes at popsugar. Twitter users, some of whom called on la fitness to ban mathers, were equally outraged. \" shame on you, \" wrote one user. \" now we know who you really are. Can't unsee that either. \" in a series of snapchat videos, mathers later said she was \" deeply sorry \" and had only meant to share the photo with a friend, per the bbc. \" i love the female body and i know that body shaming is wrong and that's not what i ' m about, \" she added. In other words, \" she knows body shaming is wrong, but was going to do it anyway — just privately, \" writes sam escobar at good housekeeping. Escobar also casts doubt on her claims of a posting oops, noting it's \" extremely easy \" to tell the difference between posting direct to a user versus to one's snapchat story. Mathers has since deleted all of her social media accounts except for facebook and says she will \" take some time to myself now to reflect on why i did this horrible thing. \" la fitness tells tmz that mathers ' \" behavior is appalling and puts every member's privacy at risk.

The short version is that we are as much as 10 times more susceptible to illness after nightfall than in the morning — in other words, we are at our most vulnerable during our commute home, as the telegraph reports. This is because our circadian rhythms are constantly instructing our bodies to turn various things ( from sleep patterns and body temperature to hormones and immune system activity ) into on and off mode, meaning the \" resources \" available, such as immune system response, vary throughout the day based on our body clock. \" the time of day of infection can have a major influence on how susceptible we are to the disease, or at least on the viral replication, \" the study's senior author says in a eureka alert news release. This could explain not just vaccine efficacy but also why shift workers are more prone to infections ( their circadian rhythms are often disrupted ) and why certain viruses are more successful at infecting humans in winter months. The study looked in particular at the influenza and herpes viruses, and researchers note that the herpes virus and malaria parasite have both been shown to manipulate our molecular \" clockwork \" to optimize infection. The good news, they say, is this \" molecular machinery \" could provide a \" universal drug target \" to better fight infections. ( binge drinking is also bad for the immune system. )",

According to cambridge university it is all due with our internal bodyclock which is constantly switching certain functions on or off.

To test whether they influenced susceptibility to infection scientists compared mice infected with the herpes virus at different times of day, measuring the levels of virus infection and spread.",
            "We are more susceptible to infection at certain times of the day as our body clock affects the ability of viruses to replicate and spread between cells, suggests new research from the university of cambridge. The findings, published today in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, may help explain why shift workers, whose body clocks are routinely disrupted, are more prone to health problems, including infections and chronic disease. When a virus enters our body, it hijacks the machinery and resources in our cells to help it replicate and spread throughout the body. However, the resources on offer fluctuate throughout the day, partly in response to our circadian rhythms - in effect, our body clock. Circadian rhythms control many aspects of our physiology and bodily functions - from our sleep patterns to body temperature, and from our immune systems to the release of hormones. These cycles are controlled by a number of genes, including bmal1 and clock. To test whether our circadian rhythms affect susceptibility to, or progression of, infection, researchers at the wellcome trust-medical research council institute of metabolic science, university of cambridge, compared normal ' wild type ' mice infected with herpes virus at different times of the day, measuring levels of virus infection and spread. The mice lived in a controlled environment where 12 hours were in daylight and 12 hours were dark. The researchers found that virus replication in those mice infected at the very start of the day - equivalent to sunrise, when these nocturnal animals start their resting phase - was ten times greater than in mice infected ten hours into the day, when they are transitioning to their active phase. When the researchers repeated the experiment in mice lacking bmal1, they found high levels of virus replication regardless of the time of infection. \" the time of day of infection can have a major influence on how susceptible we are to the disease, or at least on the viral replication, meaning that infection at the wrong time of day could cause a much more severe acute infection,"

These cycles are controlled by a number of genes, including bmal1 and clock. To test whether our circadian rhythms affect susceptibility to, or progression of, infection, researchers at the wellcome trust-medical research council institute of metabolic science, university of cambridge, compared normal ' wild type ' mice infected with herpes virus at different times of the day, measuring levels of virus infection and spread. The mice lived in a controlled environment where 12 hours were in daylight and 12 hours were dark. The researchers found that virus replication in those mice infected at the very start of the day - equivalent to sunrise, when these nocturnal animals start their resting phase - was ten times greater than in mice infected ten hours into the day, when they are transitioning to their active phase. When the researchers repeated the experiment in mice lacking bmal1, they found high levels of virus replication regardless of the time of infection. \" the time of day of infection can have a major influence on how susceptible we are to the disease, or at least on the viral replication, meaning that infection at the wrong time of day could cause a much more severe acute infection,"

It was found in 1980, and since then it's presented more than 20,000 artifacts to divers, including jewelry, gold coins, and even brain matter from some of the deceased crew ( around 800 men died and 40 survived, per the local ). But a recent two-week diving expedition turned up a new find that's \" pure gooey grossness, \" atlas obscura notes: \" some kind of dairy product \" crammed in a small black container, researcher lars einarsson tells the local, adding, \" we think it is cheese. \" the could-be cheese resembles \" granular roquefort, \" he continues, noting the yeasty aroma wafting from the jar. Einarsson and his diving partners presented the nose-wrinkling victual tuesday at sweden's kalmar county museum as part of an entire haul of items pulled up from the waters around the island of oland. But while einarsson admits he finds the odor somewhat \" exotic, \" he adds he has no plans to sample the wreck's wares. \" it's reasonably well preserved, but at the same time it has been at the bottom of the sea for 340 years — we're not talking tutankhamun's burial chamber, \" he says. For now, the stinky snack is being kept chilled so it can be further examined for clues as to its makeup and perhaps even regarding how sailors lived onboard warships during that time period.

A radar scan last november by japanese expert hirokatsu watanabe left the minister of antiquities 90 % sure there was at least one hidden chamber, possibly containing the remains of queen nefertiti, as british archaeologist nicholas reeves suspects. But us expert dean goodman has analyzed data from a follow-up scan conducted in march by a different team trying to reproduce watabane's results, and he says it's clear that no such chamber exists. \" radar data can often be subjective, \" goodman tells national geographic. \" but at this particular site, it's not. \" watanabe won't share his raw data — and he says he has made so many customizations to his equipment over the decades that he is the only one who can correctly interpret the results. At a tutankhamun conference at the grand egyptian museum last weekend, reeves and watanabe were allowed to present their research while the researchers behind the second radar scan were not, live science reports. Insiders say evidence that there are no hidden chambers has led to political feuding in cairo, where officials had hoped a big find would give the slumping tourist industry a boost.

Gawker suggests we call it the \" wafflaco. \" the times found the waffle too \" mushy \" and the sausage too \" rubbery, \" but the instagrammer who first broke the news of the waffle taco tagged it, #itsdelicious. Delicious it may be, but many are wondering: is it really a taco? the consumerist sums it up with this headline: \" is the ' waffle taco'really a taco, or just a folded waffle with stuff in it? \" and on buzzfeed, erin la rosa points out that almost anything can be folded in half and called a taco, including your hand folded around some ice cream and chocolate syrup. You may soon be able to judge for yourself: if the waffle taco is a success, \" we ' ll roll it out to all of our restaurants that serve breakfast, \" a taco bell rep tells usa today.

Nearly 200 people were arrested thursday, and the telegraph described the police presence at carnival as \" overwhelming. \" there are between 2,000 and 2,500 officers on duty for the weeklong celebration that usually draws 1.5 million people. \"our parents didn't really want us to come and they warned us to be very careful, but we decided that we're not going to be afraid, we're going to party, \" a 20-year-old woman at carnival tells the telegraph. Migrants and refugees were heavily blamed for the new year's eve attacks, and more than half of the identified suspects were found to be asylum seekers. Police distributed flyers explaining \" social etiquette \" at carnival and that \" no means no. \" there's been no indication that any of the sexual assaults reported thursday were carried out by migrants. Despite the attacks, it's difficult to find young people in cologne critical of germany's plan to welcome asylum seekers. \" when jews fled this country because of hitler and war, other countries took them in, \" one 20-year-old tells the telegraph. \"now germany must do the same; we have a responsibility even if it is hard. \"",

In a filing with the commerce department, gm said that the tax would invite retaliation from other countries and drive up the cost of imported components, increase the cost of vehicles, and stifle demand. \"increased import tariffs could lead to a smaller gm, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic american company, and risk less — not more — u.s. Jobs, \" it wrote. The national association of manufacturers also expressed concern that the tariff plan would put us manufacturing at a global disadvantage, \"undermining growth and job creation throughout the united states. \" the rationale behind the new tariff proposal is the belief that imported cars and components may pose a security risk to the us. The president cited similar security concerns to justify imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Those tariffs led to retaliatory tariffs from mexico, canada, the european union, india, and turkey. Toyota filed a separate comment on the proposal, suggesting that the new tariffs would \"threaten u.s. Manufacturing, jobs, exports, and economic prosperity, \" notes reuters. The company added that international automakers assembling vehicles in the us are based in countries that are us allies, including japan, germany, and south korea. \"it is difficult to foresee a situation in which any of them would engage in an armed conflict with the u.s., or cut off supplies of defense materials, and if they did, the united states would have an easy recourse of simply seizing their u.s.

But there's one newly discovered pit that scientists just can't make sense of, reports science alert. It's a massive hole — believed to be hundreds of yards across, so wider than most on mars — on the planet's south pole. It was recently spotted by the mars reconnaissance orbiter, which has already managed 50,000 trips around the red planet, in an area whose appearance is described as \" swiss cheese terrain. \" here, in a sea of frozen carbon dioxide, the summer sun converts portions of what is frozen into a gaseous state, reports newsweek, noting the pit appears to have ice at the bottom. It could be an impact crater or \" a collapse pit, \" says nasa. According to inverse, it might also be a great place to look for evidence of life on mars. But whether we ' ll ever be able to explore it is up in the air, er, space. Though nasa is hoping to send humans to mars in the next decade or two, its mars exploration program is on \" a troubling path of decline, \" per a planetary society report. With no planned missions after the mars 2020 rover, nasa has no way to get martian samples back to earth or indeed to allow for communication with earth if its two decade-old orbiters fail, the society says. Because funding must be established years in advance, \" the ideal timeframe for an orbiter to start is yesterday, \" the head of space policy for the society tells the verge.

In the process, the spacecraft has delivered some stunning and potentially important revelations: a giant volcano that went extinct at about the same time as the dinosaurs on earth; what our planet would look like to martians; and three possible landing sites for the mars 2020 rover. In short, mro has done its job. And yet, nasa has released yet another compelling image from the orbiting spacecraft. The picture shows a large hole that defies easy explanation. Much of the martian surface appears pock-marked. At the southern polar region, frozen carbon dioxide converted into its gaseous state under the martian summer sun creates a swiss cheese landscape. Astronomers have had images showing this pattern for about 10 years. But in a new, late-summer image of the planet '"

A recent study found almost 25 % of people with chronic hepatitis c have their initial requests for sofosbuvir denied by insurance companies. That number lowers to less than 10 % after appeals — but appeals take time away from treatment. Insurance companies often require patients to have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis before they agree to take on the cost of sofosbuvir.

However, it is necessary for insurers to accept that treatment with daas is medically necessary and authorise access. A 12-week course of treatment with sof/led costs $ 94,500, or $ 1,125 per pill.

The child's mother was 15 when she became pregnant by arshid hussain, and the sun explains the origins of what one official calls an \" appallingly insensitive \" move: the boy, now a teen, reportedly has needs beyond his mother's capacity, and so a case was brought to family court regarding placing him elsewhere. The law requires the local authority handling such cases to alert all \" respondents, \" a category that includes those \" with or without formal parental responsibility \" for the child. Though hussain was listed in court documents as not having such responsibility, he was listed as a \" respondent \" all the same and alerted by the local authority of what was happening. The boy's mother, sammy woodhouse, tells the bbc she was devastated upon learning about the situation. She took to twitter tuesday to decry the situation and to change the law \" to ensure that rapists can't gain access to children conceived through rape and abuse. \" she was one of nine rotherham girls that factored into the 43-year-old's 2016 conviction; he was given a 35-year sentence.

        "summary": "With only a handful of days left until election day, hillary clinton and donald trump stepped up their efforts thursday and made appeals to two very different groups of voters in the same swing state. The new york times reports that clinton, who is trying to boost minority turnout, painted trump as a threat to black america in a north carolina appearance, telling the crowd that her rival \" thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair. \" trump, meanwhile, tried to energize his base at two events in the state, including an evening appearance in johnston county. The news &amp; observer notes that he stuck to the script in a speech that focused heavily on the military. In other election coverage: politico reports that surrogates for both candidates have been spreading out across america, including three of trump's children. Clinton's high-profile surrogates include president obama, who linked trump to the kkk during a thursday appearance in jacksonville, fla. Cnn looks at why north carolina and its 15 electoral votes could be the key to winning the election. The race is tighter than it was a week ago, but with around a quarter of all ballots cast ( at least 35.1 million so far ), clinton still appears to have the edge, according to the ap. In florida, where more than half of all ballots have been cast and the number cast by democrats is roughly equivalent to those of republicans, black turnout is down but latino turnout is up. The latter trend is expected to give clinton a boost in states such as nevada. In north carolina, democrats have the edge in ballots submitted, 43 % to 32 %. The washington post reports that while the big increase in latino turnout is helping clinton, increased turnout in some areas is helping trump, including ohio counties that voted for mitt romney in 2012. The hill reports that tim kaine delivered a speech in phoenix this week that the clinton campaign says was the first of its kind: a presidential campaign speech delivered entirely in spanish. The wall street journal reports that both campaigns are making \" hail mary passes \" in their final days, seeking surprise wins in territory that has long favored the rival party. Clinton was in arizona wednesday night, while trump's week has included stops in colorado, wisconsin, michigan, and new mexico. According to the latest reuters poll, trump's support grew in 24 states over the last week and shrank in 11. Clinton saw her numbers rise in 13 states and fall in 22, leaving michigan, florida, and north carolina too close to call. The los angeles times says",

It might have worked, too, had the businessman not started bragging about his strategy while in line, reports the san gabriel valley tribune. Apple employees soon got wind of it and and stopped selling to the hired hands, who then turned their anger on the businessman because they weren't getting their promised money. Police had to escort him out of there for his own safety. \"it didn't go right. I stood out here all night, \" one 43-year-old homeless man who was promised $ 40 tells the la times. He estimates that the unidentified businessman recruited about 80 people from a homeless shelter in los angeles and drove them to the pasadena store. Maybe the worst part is that once police got the man out of there — the ap reports that he was clutching a bag full of phones at the time — the homeless were stranded. \" we have no way to get home, \" says one woman. Police made no arrests in the matter because \" it's a business issue, \" says a spokesperson.",

        "summary": "\" this system failed miserably and we need to start over. \" those are the words of hawaii sen. Brian schatz in the wake of a false alarm broadcast saturday warning residents of an incoming missile. The fcc apparently agrees and says it will open an investigation into the incident, which had hawaiians mistakenly thinking that a missile was inbound for 38 minutes on saturday morning. \" emergency alerts are meant to keep us and our families safe, not to create false panic. We must investigate and we must do better, \" fcc commissioner jessica rosenworcel tweeted, per nbc news. Hawaii gov. David ige says the alert went out \" when an employee pushed the wrong button \" during a shift change. A look around at coverage, including accounts from residents who got a scary awakening: cnn takes a look at hawaii's three-part warning system, which it began testing in december and which combines outdoor sirens, an emergency alert system that utilizes cable tv and wireless cable, and the wireless emergency alert system. It's a system without a lot of leeway: a north korean missile could hit hawaii in 20 minutes. Pacific command needs five minutes to assess a launch, giving people 15 minutes to find shelter. \" it's not much time at all, \" says the state's emergency management agency's administrator. \" but it is enough time to give yourself a chance to survive. \" \" so this is what it feels like to believe that you could have a nuclear bomb or an incoming missile about to destroy your world, \" writes jon letman at the daily beast. \" something must be done. Not just about the flawed mobile warning system in hawaii but about a situation in which this scenario is even plausible. \" at the washington post, allison wallis recounts frantically searching for the dog, texting her husband, and directing her young daughter to fill up the bathtub. \" the fear i felt the first time i heard the nuke test siren, it turns out, is only a modicum of the fear i feel now, cowering in a bathroom with my child. \"",

Austin, texas &#124; austin, texas ( reuters ) - lyndon b. Johnson was so smitten when he met claudia alta \" lady bird \" taylor in 1934 that he took her on a first date the very next day -- and asked for her hand in marriage. Taylor adored her suitor but was worried about rushing into marriage, according to dozens of love letters between the two set to be released for the first time by the lbj presidential library on thursday, valentine's day. In the pages of about 90 letters that the newly renovated library plans to post on its website, johnson seems lonely and impatient, persistently urging taylor to make up her mind. She says she wants to wait until they know each other better, though she also writes that she is afraid of losing him. \" all i can say, in absolute honesty, is -- i love you, i don't know how everlastingly i love you, -- so i can't answer you yet, \" taylor wrote him shortly after they met that september.

Before they parted, lyndon had arranged to meet lady bird the next morning for breakfast at the driskill hotel. Young lyndon johnson was a congressional secretary working for congressman richard kleberg of corpus christi; lady bird had finished a degree in journalism at the university of texas in austin the previous spring and had returned to her family home in karnack, texas. Lyndon and lady bird met for breakfast, spent the day together, and he purportedly proposed before the day was over. In the next few days, lyndon introduced lady bird to his parents; she met his boss, congressman kleberg; and they drove to karnack where lady bird introduced lyndon to her father. Johnson then returned to his job in washington, d.c. During the next 10 weeks, the two wrote approximately ninety courtship letters to each other before he returned to texas, and they \" committed matrimony, \" as lady bird described it, in san antonio on november 17, 1934. These letters, arranged chronologically in the 1934 courtship letters are also fully searchable and all have transcripts prepared by staff at the lbj presidential library. We hope you enjoy them"

Austin, texas &#124; austin, texas ( reuters ) - lyndon b. Johnson was so smitten when he met claudia alta \" lady bird \" taylor in 1934 that he took her on a first date the very next day -- and asked for her hand in marriage. Taylor adored her suitor but was worried about rushing into marriage, according to dozens of love letters between the two set to be released for the first time by the lbj presidential library on thursday, valentine's day. In the pages of about 90 letters that the newly renovated library plans to post on its website, johnson seems lonely and impatient, persistently urging taylor to make up her mind. She says she wants to wait until they know each other better, though she also writes that she is afraid of losing him. \" all i can say, in absolute honesty, is -- i love you, i don't know how everlastingly i love you, -- so i can't answer you yet, \" taylor wrote him shortly after they met that september. Johnson, then 26 and working in washington",
            "On september 5, 1934, a mutual friend, eugenia \" gene \" boehringer, introduced lyndon baines johnson to claudia alta \" lady bird \" taylor when both were visiting boehringer's office in austin. Before they parted, lyndon had arranged to meet lady bird the next morning for breakfast at the driskill hotel. Young lyndon johnson was a congressional secretary working for congressman richard kleberg of corpus christi; lady bird had finished a degree in journalism at the university of texas in austin the previous spring and had returned to her family home in karnack, texas. Lyndon and lady bird met for breakfast, spent the day together, and he purportedly proposed before the day was over. In the next few days, lyndon introduced lady bird to his parents; she met his boss, congressman kleberg; and they drove to karnack where lady bird introduced lyndon to her father. Johnson then returned to his job in washington, d.c. During the next 10 weeks, the two wrote approximately ninety courtship letters to each other before he returned to texas, and they \" committed matrimony, \" as lady bird described it, in san antonio on november 17, 1934. These letters, arranged chronologically in the 1934 courtship letters are also fully searchable and all have transcripts prepared by staff at the lbj presidential library. We hope you enjoy them"

It's like a rocket on wheels at that point. \" he adds: \" that's the fastest i've ever seen. \" \" i was thinking that at least this better be somebody famous so i could get an autograph, \" padden tells the minneapolis star tribune. Padden eventually pulled over the driver, who slowed and was clocked at 148mph, and cited him with careless driving. There was a female passenger in the car, and the male driver didn't give any particular reason as to why he was allegedly going so fast ( he also said that no, he didn't realize how fast he was going ). If found guilty, the driver faces up to 90 days in jail, a fine of up to $ 1,000, and the possible seizure of his driver's license.",

While speaking of the need to support gop incumbent scott walker, day said some voters might not be that sharp, the milwaukee journal sentinel reports. \" it's not going to be an easy election, it's a close election, \" she said. \" like i said, much closer than i can even understand why.

In his third election in four years, walker is far more worried than he was in previous contests — less confident that he can fend off a challenge from democrat mary burke, who is running a competitive race by targeting slow job growth during walker's tenure. Both his gubernatorial record and his potential 2016 presidential aspirations are on the line. \"rallies and tailgates are wonderful, but in the end we need people on the doors, \" walker said sunday as he spoke to dozens of republicans gathered around him in a circle during a packers game-watching party here. \"i need you to reach out to people you have never talked to about politics before — that's how close this election is. \" among the class of 2016 gop hopefuls, walker is the lone early contender who faces such a critical test nov. 4.

The militants released photos late saturday showing the soldiers being led to trenches and then face-down in them before and after their execution. Sources tell the bbc that captured soldiers were divided into ordinary conscripts, who were freed, and volunteers from shia militias, who were massacred. But some iraqi officials and human rights groups are casting doubt on the number of dead, the new york times reports. \" i would have thought there would have been leverage in keeping those prisoners alive, \" a guardian correspondent says. \" my suspicion is that they remain alive but in desperate peril. \" the photos, uploaded to an isis twitter account, show what could be as many as seven massacre sites, though the times notes they could also be various angles of fewer sites. No individual photo depicts more than 60 victims. The captions are particularly inflammatory, notes the times. A sampling: \" the filthy shiites are killed in the hundreds, \" and \" the liquidation of the shiites who ran away from their military bases. \" the us decried the photos as \" horrible. \" washington is so unsettled by the conflict that it is considering direct talks with frequent rival iran to resolve it. Those talks could come as early as this week, during scheduled nuclear negotiations in vienna. The un called the reports \" deeply disturbing, \" the ap reports. The photos and their captions seemed designed to incite sectarian violence, and ban-ki moon praised ayatollah ali al-sistani for calling for \" the highest possible level of self-restraint. Militants have also taken yet another city, seizing tal afar, which is west of musl, after two days of fighting, senior iraqi security officials tell the times. According to iraqi state tv, iraq's military is beginning to strike back after losing cities across the country in last week's stunning rebel advance, cnn reports. State tv says hundreds of militants were killed in airstrikes near fallujah. Government forces are also believed to be gathering near samarra in preparation for an attempt to retake tikrit.",

Morsi, who spoke bluntly in support of the syrian revolution in tehran three weeks ago, said on saturday that iran was \" a main player in the region that could have an active and supportive role in solving the syrian problem \".

Turkey and saudi arabia - like egypt - both support the syrian rebels, and are the two other members of the quartet. \" i don't see the presence of iran in this quartet as a problem, but is a part of solving the problem, \" morsi said, explaining that iran's close proximity to syria and its strong ties with the government make it \" vital \" in resolving the crisis. \" and we do not have a significant problem with iran.

        "summary": "In what a michigan police chief refers to as \" totally tragic \" and \" irresponsible, \" a loaded firearm was allegedly left in reach of children at an apparently unlicensed home day care in dearborn, resulting in two children being shot wednesday. Police say a toddler came upon the gun inside a bedroom and pulled the trigger, causing a bullet to pass through one 3-year-old boy before hitting another shortly after 10am, report wxyz and wjbk. The boys were rushed to hospitals in critical condition, one with a gunshot wound to the face, the other with a wound to a shoulder, per cbs detroit. Reports suggest one or both boys were in either stable or serious condition as of wednesday night. The sister of the homeowner tells detroit news that samantha eubanks, 31, looked after several children of \" friends and family but mostly family \" at the home. It's unclear what evidence was taken from the house, though clickondetroit.com notes it appeared officers removed hunting rifle cases. Cops say eubanks ' husband is a hunter. Eubanks, however, \" totally hates guns \" and wouldn't allow them in her home, her sister tells the detroit news. \" this would be her worst nightmare. \" dearborn police are still investigating and are expected to soon hand over the case to the wayne county prosecutor's office, which could bring charges. Meanwhile, \" we're going to pray these two young kids are going to be ok, \" says police chief ron haddad. ( a 4-year-old died last week after she went looking for candy but found a gun. )",

One boy fled, but the man blindfolded and abducted the other, who was 14, and sexually assaulted him. Fifteen years later, police finally got a break in the case. Late last year, 54-year-old mirek voyt was convicted of stealing money from his place of employment, a grocery store chain. Since that's a felony, his dna was taken and entered into a database — and authorities found that it matched dna evidence from the years-ago attack. Voyt was arrested tuesday and charged with the assault, the los angeles times reports. He pleaded not guilty thursday to charges of kidnapping to commit rape and forcible oral copulation. Police believe voyt took the victim to his home to assault him; he ultimately released the boy, ktla reports. Authorities now fear voyt may have committed other attacks in the intervening years, and are asking anyone with information to get in touch with police. He's moved around the los angeles area during that time, nbc la reports, and worked in a management position at a \" large \" grocery store chain police are not naming specifically.

The complaint alleges individuals are thrown in the slammer until they can either pay the fines or a preset $ 20,000 bond — a system said to unfairly target the poor and violate the fourth and 14th amendments. A collections department that goes after the convicted doesn't take into account individuals ' ability to pay, and partial payment won't do, says the suit, per the new york times. This \" creates a culture of fear among indigent people... Who borrow money at high interest rates, divert money from food for their children, and cash their family members'disability checks in a desperate attempt \" to avoid jail, the suit claims. Critics say judges have a conflict of interest because they actually benefit from the fines — the money goes into the judicial expense fund. The orleans parish court isn't the only one accused of this type of impropriety: the advocate points out this has been happening in jurisdictions nationwide, including in ferguson, missouri.

Some partners hosted secret interrogation prisons; some arrested suspects; others let the cia refuel its planes at their airports, the new york times reports. \" the moral cost of these programs was borne not just by the us but by the 54 other countries it recruited to help, \" says amrit singh, who wrote the open society justice initiative report. The document contains the longest list yet of those detained or transferred by the cia: some 136 people. The report describes extraordinary rendition, in which prisoners are denied legal procedures as they're moved between countries. Some were shipped to countries that regularly torture prisoners, the times notes. Countries involved ranged from pakistan and afghanistan to the uk and spain, the guardian notes; even iran and syria lent a hand, with syria one of the \" most common destinations for rendered suspects. \" but former cia boss michael hayden recently pointed to double standards: \" we are often put in a situation where we are bitterly accused of not doing enough to defend america when people feel endangered, \" he said. \" and then as soon as we've made people feel safe again, we're accused of doing too much. \"",

So widespread and extensive was the participation of governments across the world that it is now clear the cia could not have operated its programme without their support, according to the osji. \" there is no doubt that high-ranking bush administration officials bear responsibility for authorising human rights violations associated with secret detention and extraordinary rendition, and the impunity that they have enjoyed to date remains a matter of significant concern, \" the report says. \" but responsibility for these violations does not end with the united states.

Hours after finally acknowledging that president obama was born in the us, trump told supporters in miami that since hillary clinton supports gun control, her \" heavily armed bodyguards \" should lose their guns. \" take their guns away, let's see what happens to her, \" he said. \" take their guns away, ok? it ' ll be very dangerous. Cnn notes that trump has talked about disarming clinton's secret service detail before, but this appears to be the first time he's speculated about violence. A round-up of coverage: the guardian has more from the miami rally, where trump repeatedly veered off-script after taking the stage to a song from les miserables. Behind him, a huge screen showed a \" les deplorables \" poster. Aaron blake at the washington post notes that while trump and others have commented about disarming clinton's bodyguards before, by talking about what would happen, trump took a comment \" that was worn and not all that interesting and spun it forward with just a few extra words, giving it new life by painting a more violent picture. \" the miami herald reports that trump appears to have mastered the city's complicated politics: his friday visit included promises to cuban, venezuelan, and haitian-americans. This isn't the first time trump has apparently hinted at clinton's assassination, and clinton campaign spokesman robby mook says such remarks show that the republican is unfit to be president. \" whether this is done to provoke protesters at a rally or casually or even as a joke, it is an unacceptable quality in anyone seeking the job of commander in chief, \" he said in a statement. Politico reports that upon reflection, members of the media have realized that trump played them like a fiddle with yesterday's press conference announcing his stance on the birther issue. Before he announced that he now believes obama was born in the us — and blamed clinton for starting the controversy — he bragged about his new hotel and turned the stage over to military veterans who delivered trump endorsements for 20 minutes. \" while these american heroes are... Much greater men than rick astley, it's hard to imagine this as anything other than a political rick-roll, \" said cnn's jake tapper. The washington post takes a look at how prominent birthers are reacting to trump's announcement.

To venezuelans, he promised to stand with their \"oppressed \" countrymen. To haitians, he pledged to be their \"champion. \" fifty-three days before the election, trump seemed to have finally assimilated a fundamental rule of miami's heavily ethnic politics: candidates must target their messages to each community. Short on time until nov. 8, trump tried to ingratiate himself with several groups in a single afternoon. He dropped by the little haiti cultural center to meet privately with haitian-american professionals. Then he raced to downtown miami's james l.

The video shows a screaming baby being shaken and twisted as she's swung around by her legs and cheeks and dunked in a bucket of water dozens of times over the space of a couple of minutes, the bbc reports. A facebook spokeswoman says that while the video is \" upsetting and disturbing, \" \" people's desire to raise awareness of behavior like this \" means it will stay online, though a warning message has been added. A company rep tells the mirror that the video \" depicts a form of baby yoga \" and no breach of the rules was found after careful review. Britain's national society for the prevention of cruelty to children says such \" dreadful and disturbing \" content has no place on social networking sites and has asked the government to intervene, the bbc reports. The identity of the baby is unknown, and police in toronto say they looked into the matter after the video was reported to them, but there is no indication that the child is canadian and their investigation has hit a \" dead end, \" the toronto sun reports. The video may have originated in indonesia, according to the telegraph, which notes that it was reported for nudity as well as violence. ( after complaints in 2013, facebook reluctantly agreed to take down a beheading video. )",

A new pew research center poll of 5,122 adults shows americans who identify as catholic are much more accepting and have a very different view on what constitutes a sin compared to the vatican. A few takeaways, via usa today and nbc news: cohabitation: about 86 % are willing to accept a man and a woman living together without being married. In fact, 44 % of catholics say they were guilty of the practice at some point. When it comes to gay couples, 70 % support cohabitation. Non-traditional families: while 44 % of catholics say homosexual behavior is a sin, almost as many, 39 %, say it isn't. Some 66 % say they are accepting of gay couples who raise children, 87 % accept single parents, and 83 % support unmarried parents who live together. Birth control: some 66 % of us catholics say using contraception is a-ok, compared to just 63 % of the overall us population. About 75 % of catholics say the church should allow birth control. Abortion: though 57 % of catholics oppose abortion, a third say they support the termination of a pregnancy — a \" sin \" pope francis says can be forgiven. Divorce: a quarter of catholics have been divorced themselves and 70 % say there's nothing sinful about it. Some 49 % say getting remarried isn't a sin, either, compared to 35 % who believe it is.

Francesca bronzi's boyfriend, who was celebrating his birthday, was among those killed. But bronzi was luckily confined to a small cavity near galassi, 25, and forti, 22, who helped boost her morale. The couple recalls guests gathering in the hotel lobby after earthquakes shook the building. Then the avalanche struck, burying the hotel in 60,000 tons of snow, rock, and uprooted trees. \" it all started from a rumble. And then everything collapsed \" in \" a roar, \" forti says. \" we couldn't see anything, it was total darkness, \" adds galassi. \" i don't think i have ever prayed so much in my life. \" officials are now investigating the response to the avalanche; the ap reports rescuers were delayed because a call for help was initially interpreted as a prank.",

The teen buyer, in a vehicle with four others, asked to see the phone and bueno-sanchez obliged, according to police. The teen then handed him an envelope. But just as bueno-sanchez realized it contained only a few dollars, not the $ 450 he'd requested, the driver of the car raced away, police say, per abc 7. Because bueno-sanchez had been leaning inside the vehicle at the time, he was dragged along for a bit until he fell, say authorities.

He also said there's \" no scientific basis \" for keeping global warming at 2 degrees celsius or less, per the international climate change accord reached in paris in december, the washington post notes. At least some of the shareholders agreed, with the post reporting a \" choked up \" attendee telling tillerson, \" you personify all that is best in america. The lives of all of us shareholders are more secure and, in return, happier because of you. \" a vocal activist minority, however, had a different take on how the company should be approaching environmental concerns, with 38 % voting \" aye \" to a proposal that would force exxonmobil to annually document how adhering to climate change rules would affect profits. Critics have called out exxonmobil for claiming concern about the environmental effects of fossil fuel while simultaneously funneling money to groups that downplay those effects, per the post. While the shareholders ' proposals were rejected, the guardian notes that the significant-enough numbers shown in the vote may make it easier for them to get rid of the board's old guard and suggest members more friendly to renewable energy.",

He'd probably be taking over the latest of the late night shows, carson daly's half-hour interview program last call, which airs at 1: 35am. With jimmy fallon taking over for jay leno on the tonight show, and someone as-yet-unknown taking over for fallon on late night, that could mean new faces in all three late night slots. Baldwin, currently starring on broadway, has a much-admired podcast interview series called here's the thing, has been widely praised as a late night guest, and has hosted a record 16 episodes of saturday night live. After 30 rock ended, nbc inked a further two-year deal with baldwin to keep him around, deadline notes. In other baldwin news, he recently gave what he claims will be \" one of the last interviews \" he ever does to the hollywood reporter. He says he wants to focus on his soon-to-arrive daughter and his wife. Asked if he would ever host a talk show, he replied, \" it depends on the format and who it was for and what the schedule was like. Those guys that do talk shows have that terrible condition where they have to pretend everybody's special. I don't know if i could do that. \"",

The beloved filmmaker announced his retirement after the wind rises debuted at the venice film festival last year. Since then the movie — a biopic of jiro horikoshi, who designed japan's world war ii fighter planes — has earned acclaim, an academy award nomination, and criticism for its treatment of the war, korean laborers, and even cigarette smoking. Here's what people are saying: \" miyazaki couldn't have picked a more piquant swan song, \" writes richard corliss at time. The wind rises \" weaves a tender, doomed love story into two volcanic decades of japan's history. \" miyazaki is in his 70s, but this movie \" betrays no hint of flagging energy, let alone senility; it is vigorous, subtle, thematically daring, visually gorgeous. \" this is definitely a departure for miyazaki. It's suffused with his \" characteristic sensitivity and breathtaking vistas, but it nonetheless feels more earthily literal than the director's standard family-friendly fare, \" writes ann hornday at the washington post. \" younger viewers may not be so transported as the protagonist by talk of flush rivets … but miyazaki manages to cast a mesmerizing spell over even those quotidian objects. \" but then there's that controversy. \" should you see it? of course you should. Anything miyazaki does is worth your time, \" writes ty burr of the boston globe. \" but the movie's a gorgeous, problematic anomaly in an illustrious career. \" miyazaki largely ignores the damage done by jiro's planes, treating it as \" an unhappy necessity. \" we're to focus on jiro's personal tragedy, not the tragedies of world war ii. This \" artistic blindness \" makes for a \" dazzling, frustrating experience. \" dana stevens at slate disagrees. While it misses some opportunities to dive into the historical tragedies here, \" there's also no denying the constant presence... Of the twin specters of wartime trauma and survivor's guilt. \" they suffuse \" every frame of this dark and difficult film, which, it should be stressed, is not at all for young children. \"",

        "summary": "The two most senior surviving leaders of cambodia's khmer rouge were sentenced today to life in prison for crimes against humanity committed some three and a half decades ago. The un-backed tribunal handed what the ap terms \" historic verdicts \" to khieu samphan, the regime's former head of state, and nuon chea, who was second only to pol pot in the regime. Head judge nin nonn said both men were guilty of \" extermination encompassing murder \" along with \" other inhumane acts \" including \" forced transfer. \" as the week points out, the sentences may be short ones: the men are 83 and 88 years old, respectively. To wit, though the two were asked to stand as their verdicts were read, nuon chea was permitted to stay seated in his wheelchair. The new york times notes that the case, which started in 2011, covered just a \" narrow sliver \" of what happened under the khmer rouge's rule from 1975 to 1979, during which roughly 1.7 million people, or almost 25 % of the population, died: in what was touted as a move designed to hasten the arrival at a verdict, the case against the men was broken into stages, with this first one covering only the forced evacuations of urban areas — part of the regime's failed effort to create an agrarian utopia — and one site that saw mass executions. Prosecutors and victims have aired displeasure at which crimes were chosen to be covered first; the men now face another likely-years-long trial that could begin as soon as next month, on charges of genocide. The tribunal has spent more than $ 200 million since its 2006 founding, but has convicted only one other khmer rouge member, in 2010.",

        "summary": "The week of april 15-21 was a record-breaking one for the tsa, though not a record it likely wanted to break. During that one-week span, the federal agency found 73 guns stashed in carry-on bags at airports nationwide, breaking the previous weekly record of 68 set just last october, the pittsburgh tribune-review reports. Of those firearms, 68 were loaded, and 27 had a round in the chamber. Guns can be brought on flights, but they have to be declared in checked luggage only, unloaded, and secured in a locked container, per tsa rules. \" unfortunately, these sorts of occurrences are all too frequent, which is why we talk about these finds, \" a tsa rep says in a blog post, which features pictures of some of the confiscated items, as well as a list of what items were found at which airports. Also discovered: two replica military rounds at tucson's airport. The tsa notes that even if a passenger has \" no ill intent \" in packing the gun in the carry-on, he or she can receive a citation, be arrested, and/or have to pay a fine as steep as $ 11,000. And despite applause that may come the tsa screeners ' way for a job well done, they'd rather not find these weapons at all. \" each time we find a dangerous item, the line is slowed down \" and the passenger is at risk of the repercussions, the post explains. Oddly, despite findings like this, the tsa has been trying to do away with screenings at smaller regional airports to save money, sometimes screening passengers after they land at larger airports to make connecting flights — a process called \" reverse screening, \" per politico. The agency is now restaffing some of those smaller airports with screeners after congress got wind of the plan and some members denounced it as dangerous.",

Now a new dna study might — but only might — bring finality to the debate over the \" ancient one. \" danish researchers have concluded that he was native american, they report in nature. The results could sway the army corps of engineers to turn over the remains to native american groups for burial. Scientists want the bones kept available for study, and they have pushed against allowing native americans to bury the remains ever since they were found about 20 years ago in washington state. One reason: the skull doesn't resemble those of native americans. The corps promises to review the study and make a decision \" as quickly as possible, \" reports the washington post. \"it's very clear that kennewick man is most closely related to contemporary native americans, \" a geneticist at the university of copenhagen and lead author of the study tells the new york times. \"in my view, it's bone-solid. \" a skeptical smithsonian scientist, however, tells ap that the results aren't conclusive enough to tie kennewick man — a \" traveler \" who lived about 8,500 years ago — to modern tribes. Either way, the study author points out an ironic twist: the dna tests suggesting native american heritage — and thus opening the door to burial — were made possible by court victories won by scientists seeking to keep the remains available for study. Still, native american groups aren't expecting a quick resolution. \"we expect to have a fight, \" says a member of the confederated tribes of the colville reservation, \" but we would like to see him buried very respectfully in a resting place where he should be. \"",

Here's what people are saying: the console streams video to the pad flawlessly, which \" opens up a pandora's box of ideas for both game developers and media providers, \" writes ben gilbert of engadget. \" sadly, overall, the gamepad controller gives off a relatively low-grade impression; it looks and feels like a toy. \" \" keeping track of two screens could have been a mess, but it's actually pretty intuitive \" and even \" kind of liberating, \" writes matt peckham at time. \" the wii u already feels like a much more robust and fascinating idea \" than the original wii. \" i haven't been this impressed with a new interface since nintendo put a joystick on a gamepad in 1996. \" \" will nintendo finally match other consoles'dedication to hardcore gaming? no. But not for lack of trying, \" writes nic vargus at ign. There are some crucial omissions — why can't the pro controller handle a headset? — and its processor is unlikely to stack up well against the ps4 or next xbox. But \" it's going to offer a completely unique experience with a large handful of irreplaceable games. Unfortunately, those irreplaceable games really don't seem to exist just yet. \" cnet wasn't as impressed. \" it's tough to get around just how cumbersome the gamepad really is, \" its editors write. \" i can only imagine how a small child will perform with this enormous game controller. \" but there's a \" ton of value \" in its off-tv feature, which lets you play wii games on the tablet without monopolizing the tv — \" something anyone who doesn't live alone can appreciate. \" many reviewers also grumbled that key features, like \" miiverse, \" weren't available ahead of launch, the wall street journal notes. Users and critics alike will have to install a patch before assessing those now currently available. ( nintendo tvii isn't coming til december. )",

The irish woman and a friend documented their 48-hour trip to obtain a legal abortion in britain, as the procedure is banned in ireland unless the mother's life ( not merely her health ) is at risk. The irish family planning association site notes at least 10 irish women a day have to leave home to get an abortion, with at least 165,000 women and girls heading to uk clinics between 1980 and 2015. The live tweets went from boarding the plane in ireland to a series of waiting rooms in a british clinic, exhausted and hungry from their travels — \" we could be home by noon in another world, \" they noted. The procedure itself was \" safe \" and \" quick \" and attended to by a \" warm \" staff, they said. One \" cc \" included in nearly every tweet: that of @endakennytd, the twitter handle for ireland prime minister enda kenny, who's been accused of stalling on talks to repeal the country's eighth amendment, which is behind the abortion ban, per ireland's independent. The women received support, including from ireland's health minister, simon harris, who tweeted, \" thanks to @twowomentravel for telling story of reality which faces many. \" the two women had their own thanks to offer, \" with one glaring exception \" ( apparently kenny ). Women who head to england to get an abortion \" do not choose to be shamed into the secrecy, panic, and guilt that the journey to leave their home country inspires, \" the women behind the tweets wrote in their final post.

Researchers are following up on a 2011 study that asked women to rate top dance moves among men ( it's all about neck and torso fluidity ). Reporting in the journal scientific reports, they found that at least among the 200 viewers of 39 young women's dance moves, lots of hip movement and asymmetrical arm and leg movements got the highest ratings. From an evolutionary standpoint, the hips aren't surprising, one of the researchers tells scientific american, because fluidity here may signal a woman's fitness and even reproductive health. But most ( 143 ) of the 200 viewers doing the rating were female, hinting at the potential for dance moves to also be a competitive display of skill, reports the new york times. \" they're showing off how good they are to female rivals, \" says the researcher. Another researcher not involved in this study suggests that dance moves can also be a display of \" affiliation, friendship or bonds to other people, \" where displaying confidence helps one gain not just romantic partners but also friends. The stiffness of the lowest-rated dancers, for instance, is suggestive of shyness, while the asymmetry of arm and leg movements hints at a more relaxed person.

But what happened to the two ar-15 rifle versions after their purchase is what put them on the wrong side of the law: though the weapons were sold as what the trace calls \" california compliant \" models with magazine-locking devices, davis notes that the smith &amp; wesson rifle used in the attack was modified in an effort to allow for fully automatic mode, while the dpms rifle was altered so it could sport a larger-capacity magazine. The state's laws allow for ample wiggle room, with the trace noting that, thanks to the ar-15's \" modular, customizable construction, \" a \" determined owner \" of such a weapon \" would have other options. \" a long beach lawyer points out to the new york times that a \" substitution effect \" makes it easy for people to legally buy stripped-down versions of otherwise illegal weapons. \" if you ban rifle x, people will use rifle y, \" he notes.

The overwhelming majority of gun background checks take just minutes to clear the would-be buyer. Only 2 percent result in a rejection because of a disqualifying record in the shopper's personal history. And then there are the people who slip",

Then last night, the wall street journal confirmed this hunch: one of the rifles had been altered to quickly release and accept magazines, which is illegal under california law.

That's because their coastal village, located some 480 miles west of anchorage, is in the process of being washed into the bering sea. As the guardian explains in an in-depth look at the town, the ninglick river flows past three of newtok's sides on its path to the sea, and it's been chipping away at the village at a rate that's only grown more aggressive due to climate change ( more than 100 feet of shoreline gone some years ), which has been linked to melting permafrost and dwindling protective sea ice. The us army corps of engineers surveyed the village, and offered no break to the gloom: it concluded that seawalls or other protective measures wouldn't work, and that newtok's highest point could be underwater in just four years, by 2017. The villagers must leave ( a tribal administrator tells alaska public radio relocation has been a major town talking point for the last three decades ), leading the guardian to dub them \" america's first climate change refugees. \" the villagers selected a new site nine miles away, but moving the town there could cost $ 130 million, and relocation efforts have yet to truly get off the ground.
