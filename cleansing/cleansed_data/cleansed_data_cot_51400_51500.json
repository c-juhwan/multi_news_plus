        "summary": "People who stand on glass bridges shouldn't swing sledgehammers, right? not so, says the chinese government, at least when it comes to the zhangjiajie grand canyon bridge — the highest, longest glass bridge in the world, according to mashable. In fact, the operators of the bridge allowed dan simmons of bbc click to take a sledgehammer to the glass-bottom bridge that, per the china national tourism office, spans more than 1,400 feet ( it points out the grand canyon skywalk measures only 69 ) and is suspended some 1,000 feet above the ground. Simmons ' first whack resulted in cracking to the top of a glass panel. But after a dozen blows, the lower two layers were unscathed. The stunt was an attempt to prove the safety of glass bridges after a glass-bottom skywalk in china was closed last year due to cracking that had tourists scrambling to get off of the more than 3,280-foot-high structure. The cracks to a glass panel were caused by a dropped thermos, per the south china morning post. The new bridge, which is 20 feet wide and capable of holding up to 800 people at once, is set to open to the public in july, per abc, which adds that \" those wishing for an even more terrifying adventure \" may someday be able to bungee jump from the structure.

What needs squaring: his punishment for raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977 at jack nicholson's house. Lawyer harland braun reportedly wants long-sealed testimony in the polanski case opened to prove that polanski had cut a deal to spend just 48 days behind bars for the sexual assault. But when the director of rosemary's baby was released after serving 42 days, which included psychiatric evaluation, the judge ( now deceased ) who'd reportedly signed off on the deal allegedly had a change of heart and decided 50 years in prison was a more just punishment. Polanski fled to paris, where he's been living as a fugitive since, shortly after he agreed to plead guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse and right before his sentencing, per page six. A polish court ruling in a recent polanski extradition case said polanski, now 83, had honored his punishment with his original stint behind bars, prompting braun to call for a los angeles county superior court to do the same.

In july, noaa declared the die-off an unusual mortality event, which frees up federal funding and investigators to address the crisis. Now, a noaa team in charge of investigating the event is pointing to a type of morbillivirus as the culprit behind the bottlenose dolphins deaths.

            "Hundreds of bottle-nosed dolphins have been dying on the east coast, and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration says a virus is likely to blame. Morbillivirus, a disease similar to measles in humans, has been found in some beached dolphins tested by noaa, officials announced tuesday. Since july 1, 333 dolphins have stranded - gotten sick and washed up on beaches, or became stuck in shallow water - between new york and north carolina. Most of them are dying off the coast of virginia, where 174 have stranded since july 1. \" we don't have a lot of insight as to when it will stop. Typically, outbreaks last as long as there are susceptible animals that can be infected, \" dr. Teri rowles of the noaa fisheries marine mammal health and stranding response program told reporters during a conference call. Noaa has tested 33 beached dolphins, and 32 had",
            "A measles-like virus is being cited as a likely cause for the mass dolphin die-off that's been plaguing the u.s. East coast this summer. Since july 1, 333 carcasses have littered shores from new york to north carolina – a number that's roughly 10 times more than normal for this time of year. Scientists don't yet know how many dolphins have died offshore without reaching mid-atlantic beaches, but it could be thousands. In july, noaa declared the die-off an unusual mortality event, which frees up federal funding and investigators to address the crisis. Now, a noaa team in charge of investigating the event is pointing to a type of morbillivirus as the culprit behind the bottlenose dolphins deaths. Morbilliviruses are responsible for measles in humans, rinderpest in cattle, and canine distemper in dogs, coyotes, wolves and seals. There is no easy way to identify morbillivirus",

These super low temps, combined with an atmosphere roughly 1.5 times as dense as earth's, have resulted in a few extraordinary bodies of liquid methane and ethane, reports extreme tech, and scientists are anxious to explore their depths. ( in fact, titan is the only body aside from earth to boast liquid lakes on its surface. ) so nasa is working up a ( very early ) model of a submarine drone that could do just that — one that cnet reports will likely be nuclear-powered, weigh a ton, and come equipped with a seafloor camera, sampling system, and other fancy futuristic robotic accoutrements. But don't get too excited just yet. First, this is a fully automated mission: \" even if it were possible for humans to go swimming in titan's seas, \" notes cnet, it \" would be something like swimming in a freezing ocean of liquefied natural gas. \" hence, nasa's goal of sending the \" highly capable science craft \" to titan's largest sea, kraken mare, around the year 2040, in what it calls \" an unprecedented planetary exploration mission. \" many details remain to be sorted out, including how to get the craft to titan ( boeing's x-37 is a possibility ), how to land it ( parachute drop ), and while there, how to communicate with earthlings ( planar phased-array antenna ).

Truth can be stranger than fiction, indeed. Earlier this month, nasa published the below video introducing its concept submarine designed to explore kraken mare, one of the methane seas on titan, the remarkably strange moon circling saturn.

These super-low temperatures and thick atmosphere combine to create the feature scientists are so anxious to study in detail — vast lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane.

Police raided the club twice and detectives made several undercover purchases, and though greene wasn't directly involved in them, state prosecutors are charging her because the club is registered under her name.

The guardian broke the news to greene that six offenses have since been added, raising the total to 54 years.

Nearly 1,400 people have been killed by the flooding and landslides in the three countries so far, while millions continue to be displaced from their homes. Torrential monsoon rains have destroyed tens of thousands of houses, schools, and hospitals, according to the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. The agency estimates that almost 41 million people have been affected in three countries. Many of the flooded areas already have high rates of malnutrition. The disaster has raised concerns of food shortages and water-borne diseases, as thousands of hectares of farms have been washed away and relief work continues to be disrupted by continuous rain. As water from the floods recede in parts of nepal and bangladesh, reuters said nearly 80,000 people have been hit by diarrhea, malaria and dengue fever.

            "Heavy monsoon rains of historic proportions have slammed nepal, bangladesh, and india for weeks, leading to what international rescue and aid organizations say is the worst flooding in decades. Nearly 1,400 people have been killed by the flooding and landslides in the three countries so far, while millions continue to be displaced from their homes. Torrential monsoon rains have destroyed tens of thousands of houses, schools, and hospitals, according to the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. The agency estimates that almost 41 million people have been affected in three countries. Many of the flooded areas already have high rates of malnutrition. The disaster has raised concerns of food shortages and water-borne diseases, as thousands of hectares of farms have been washed away and relief work continues to be disrupted by continuous rain. As water from the floods recede in parts of nepal and bangladesh, reuters said nearly 80,000 people have been hit by diarrhea, malaria and dengue fever. This is what the floods have done to millions across nepal, bangladesh, and india."

But it wasn't until he \" punched it in the side of the head \" that he saw the animal was a cougar. ( sightings are common but attacks rare, says an rcmp deputy. ) the cat ran into the woods, but the punch proved insufficient. As gibb tried to pick up sasha's twitching body, the apparently confused dog bit him and the cougar reemerged, so he had to throw punches with his right arm while trying to protect his dog and his hurt left arm. \" she was fighting for her life, \" gibb says of sasha, who ran to safety. When the cougar went for mongo, gibb grabbed a big stick and got in its way before chasing it off into the woods again. With a vet clinic just a block away, sasha was tended to quickly, while local police found and killed the cougar. The vet says sasha had to be sewn up in her chest and had deep bites around her neck, but she survived thanks to her owner. ( and you thought the guy who punched a kangaroo was brave. )",

The case involves robert mccoy, who is currently on louisiana's death row after being convicted of a triple homicide back in 2011. Mccoy has always maintained his innocence, but his attorney, robert english, defied mccoy's wishes during the trial and told the jury that mccoy was guilty — figuring it was the only hope of avoiding a death sentence, explains nbc news. The gambit didn't work, however. Mccoy was convicted and sentenced to death, and now mccoy is arguing that his constitutional right to mount a defense was violated. More background and developments: the crime: mccoy is accused of killing his estranged wife's teenage son, mother, and stepfather, while searching for his wife, and the washington post reports that prosecutors had compelling evidence. On a 911 call, mccoy's mother-in-law could be heard saying, \" she ain't here, robert. I don't know where she is, \" before a gunshot rings out and the call is disconnected. Witnesses saw mccoy's car leaving the area, and cops later found the phone his mother-in-law used to call 911 in the vehicle.",

The report, the result of a 15-month-long investigation, notes the explosion sent thousands of metal objects in all directions and hundreds hit the plane with \" tremendous force, \" joustra said, per the guardian. He added shrapnel from the buk missile was found inside the bodies of the pilots, who died instantly, along with traces of paint from a buk missile. The bbc's anna holligan, who spoke to relatives briefed on the report, says all passengers and crew would've lost consciousness immediately as the plane broke apart in the air. A 65-foot reconstruction of a portion of the plane, revealed at the press conference, showed holes perforating the upper part of the cockpit, according to reporter luke harding. \" we can't be 100 % sure \" that no one suffered, \" but we've got to sort of think that was the case, \" a relative says. The report mainly focuses on the cause of the crash and avoids \" blame and culpability \"; a separate criminal investigation will point fingers, reports afp. The report at least rejects moscow's claim that the boeing 777 was downed by a missile fired by ukrainian troops on july 17, 2014, on a flight from amsterdam to kuala lumpur. But about 30 minutes before the report's release, moscow had dismissed it. \" it's always special when people already know that they don't agree with a report that's not even published yet, \" joustra said.",

            "A record number of people committed suicide last year by jumping off the george washington bridge. Eighteen people plunged to their deaths from the 212-foot-high span in 2012, compared with the previous high of 13 jumpers in 2010, port authority records reveal. There also were 43 attempted suicides from the bridge last year — an all-time high, too, law-enforcement sources said. The 81-year-old bridge has been suicide central for decades. Its annual number of jumpers typically dwarfs the totals for all other local bridges combined, the sources said. A veteran pa police official said the spike might be tied to rough economic times. After a cluster of suicides in early may, pa police acting chief of department john ryan ordered that police foot and car patrols be intensified. Paul nunziato, president of the pa police benevolent association, has encouraged the agency to update the closed-circuit television system on the bridge.",

        "summary": "The death of a 4-year-old girl from malaria on monday in italy has local health authorities searching for answers and worrying about a resurgence of the deadly disease, npr reports. Italy was declared malaria-free in 1970, and the mosquito that carries the disease no longer lives in the country. \" it baffles us how she could have been infected, \" nbc news quotes a doctor at a hospital in trento as saying. Sofia zago was brought to the hospital on saturday with a high fever and quickly fell into a coma. Tests showed she had cerebral malaria, the deadliest form of the disease, and she died monday after being moved to a hospital in brescia. A doctor says it was the first case of native malaria he's seen in trento in 30 years. \" it's a mystery, almost impossible, \" the general manager of the provincial health service says regarding the case. Doctors believe sofia may have been infected during a trip to a beach resort near venice. It's possible she was infected by a mosquito that had managed to travel to italy inside of luggage. It's also possible, though very unlikely, sofia contracted the disease a few weeks ago when she was hospitalized for childhood diabetes. The bbc reports there were two children at the hospital at the same time recovering from malaria they picked up in africa, though they were in a different ward and sofia received no blood transfusions. Italy's health ministry has ordered an investigation, according to the ap. While europe was declared malaria-free in 2015, there have been several individual cases of locally transmitted malaria in recent years, including one in rome in 2009. ( after decades of work, a malaria vaccine is finally here. )",

The story suggests that trump's attorneys trust mueller himself but not others in the justice department. For example, they point to a fox news story monday detailing how the wife of a justice department official named bruce ohr worked for the company behind the infamous anti-trump dossier that emerged during the election. Ohr was recently demoted for concealing his own meetings with the company, fusion gps. \" the department of justice and fbi cannot ignore the multiple problems that have been created by these obvious conflicts of interests, \" trump attorney jay sekulow tells axios. \" these new revelations require the appointment of a special counsel to investigate. \" it's not clear how likely this is to happen, but attorney general jeff sessions has previously floated the idea of a second special counsel to cover a wide range of gop concerns. Meanwhile, the washington post has a profile of trump's legal trio: sekulow ( the tv presence ), ty cobb ( a white house attorney ), and john dowd ( trump's personal attorney ).

According to ars technica, med express agreed to pay $ 5,500 in legal fees during a trial in 2014 but never did, leading to a second trial.

Per cnnmoney, india prime minister narendra modi announced that the country's two largest current bank notes — the 500-rupee note and 1,000-rupee note ( equivalent to about $ 7.50 and $ 15, respectively ), which equal about 85 % of the cash currently moving around india — were taken out of circulation in their current incarnation as of midnight tuesday, which the government hopes will lure people out of hiding who've been stockpiling money without paying taxes on it. The idea is to force them to swap the cash for legit replacement money at banks and post offices before the 50-day deadline for such trades arrives on dec. 30. Experts say there's a preponderance of this so-called \" black money \" in india, and by drawing it all out in droves, banks will be able to send up a red flag if people come in with large amounts, possibly helping the government catch tax evaders. There are about 16.5 billion of the 500-rupee bills and 6.7 billion of the higher denomination now in circulation ( atms will be shuttered wednesday and thursday so more notes won't be introduced into the flow ). In place of the now-almost-worthless notes, the government will issue new 500- and 2,000-rupee notes with images of gandhi on them, the wall street journal reports.",

Since the 1960s, nitrogen fertilizer, mostly from midwest cornfields, has been drawn into streams and rivers by rainwater and poured straight into the gulf via the mississippi and atchafalaya rivers, the times-picayune explains. There it feeds algae blooms that turn oxygen into carbon dioxide when it decays — poor conditions for fish and shrimp. Nitrates and nitrogen levels continue to increase, the scientists say. The epa has tried to shrink the dead zone to 1,991 square miles since 2001 and isn't making progress. Environmental groups have sued the agency to force its hand in adopting needed regulations to reduce harmful runoff. \" we keep being told by both regulators and industry that a hands-off approach … is working just fine, but the dead zone is clearly not going away, \" one attorney tells the times-picayune.

A washington state woman on tuesday reached out to consumer advocate christopher elliott with a problem. She needed to change the name on her comcast bill, and after phone calls and an in-person visit to a comcast location, remained unsuccessful. The bill continued to read: \" a -- hole brown. \" yes, you read that right. The bill had previously been addressed to \" ricardo brown \" ( her husband's name ) but was apparently changed by a comcast employee. Brown suspects the alteration occurred after she called to cancel her cable services. Wired points out that comcast makes it \" frighteningly difficult \" to ax services, and brown was indeed redirected to a retention specialist during her call. She says she was \" never rude, \" but was firm: she wanted to pay the $ 60 termination fee and pare down her services. Elliott dove in, first verifying with comcast that the bill hadn't been altered by brown and did indeed contain the unfortunate first name. Verification made. ( wired verified the story as well. ) a regional vp of communications then called elliott to express that the company has \" zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior \"; a comcast director vowed to fire the offending employee. The company's initial offer to brown: waiving that $ 60 fee. Brown expressed to elliott that she thought she deserved more, saying, \" i am requesting everything back i paid comcast for doing this to me \" — everything meaning two years ' worth of bills. Yesterday afternoon, comcast agreed to that. ( this remains perhaps the most memorable comcast customer horror story. )",

The study followed 620 students of both sexes through middle school and high school in six georgia districts, time reports. Results came from regular surveys asking students about their behavior over the past 30 days.

The unidentified woman had dozed off a couple of hours into the feb. 19 flight while wearing the headphones, and per an australian transport safety bureau warning issued about the incident, she awoke to a loud bang and a burning sensation on her face. She was able to gather her wits, grab the headphones, and hurl them to the floor, where she says they were \" sparking \" and \" had small amounts of fire. \" flight attendants came running with a bucket of water to douse the device, part of which had melted and stuck to the floor of the plane. The atsb release shows images of the woman's face and neck covered in black soot and with burns and blisters on her hand. \" people were coughing and choking the entire way home, \" one passenger says about the cabin's acrid smell. An atsb rep tells abc australia that although this is the first report in the country about a pair of headphones exploding, other devices — including phones and a personal air purifier — have gone up in smoke. An australia civil aviation safety authority rep tells cnn they ' ll be looking more into what happened to see if the headphones themselves were damaged, sparking the explosion, or if the blame falls on the batteries. In the meantime, the atsb, which has declined to say what battery brand was involved, reminds travelers that extra device batteries should go in carry-on bags, not checked luggage, and that if a phone or other device falls between the seats, one should dig the device out or call for the crew's help before moving the seat.

The next step is finding — and punishing — whoever leaked the gruesome crime scene photos. The new york times has stitched together some of the non-graphic leaked photos to give a complete view of the inside of paddock's hotel room and its contents, which included more than 20 guns and hundreds of rounds of ammunition carried up to the room inside 10 suitcases. According to the independent, some people online believe one of the photos shows a note left behind by paddock, but that appears to not have been the case. The las vegas metropolitan police department undersheriff says the department has \" opened up an internal investigation to determine the source of the leaks. \" while whoever leaked the crime scene photos would face consequences, it's unclear what those consequences would be. Lawnewz notes a los angeles police department officer who leaked photos of rihanna following a domestic violence incident in 2009 was fired from her job but didn't face criminal charges. Crime scene photos leaked from the terrorist attack at an ariana grande concert last year in england resulted in british intelligence cutting us intelligence off from certain information.",

And while the unemployment rate fell to 6.7 % from 7.0 %, it was \" for all the wrong reasons, \" writes steven russolillo at the wall street journal. Specifically, the big drop can be explained by the fact that the participation rate fell to a new low of 62.8 %, meaning fewer people were looking for work. The ap reports that cold weather could have played a role in the poor numbers, noting that construction firms cut 16,000 jobs — the largest drop in 20 months. One silver lining from the report: november's new jobs were revised upward to 241,000 from 203,000. And russolillo writes that the same could happen here. \" something doesn't smell right. This jobs number is so far out of whack from the recent economic data that have come out.

It gets a bit complicated: davis was already under investigation for a burglary and arson when he was arrested for the rape of a woman in her car in late december. At his january arraignment, davis — who was sent to prison for more than a year in 2012 for a home invasion and also has been convicted of window peeping — was then charged with another sexual assault at his workplace, though his lawyer says he started working there after the assault report. In both cases, davis contends police led the victims to believe he was their attacker, and that even after the dna and other evidence started to surface in february showing he wasn't in the car case, he was still incarcerated for months. He also says his face and name were plastered everywhere after his arrest, and he lost his two jobs and was evicted from his home after he got out of jail, per wood. He said he told cops during his initial questioning: \" you guys are gonna be sued after this if you don't fix this. \" charges in both cases were dropped, and wood notes davis has since secured a new job and place to live.

        "summary": "A georgia teen who failed to return home from school nearly two years ago has resurfaced in the state with a new look. Aubrey jayce carroll, who turned 17 in january, appeared alongside spalding sheriff darrell dix in a video posted to facebook tuesday, sporting long hair and a beard, reports the macon telegraph. Though the formerly well-groomed teen didn't detail where he's been since leaving his griffin home in may 2016, dix says aubrey \" traveled extensively on the west coast and midwest \" after joining a group of people who barter and use only cash. \" they basically looked like a group of people from the woodstock era in their clothing and lifestyle, \" dix notes in a press release, per 11alive, adding aubrey encountered police, including in alabama and alaska, at least five times during his travels. Just last year, dix said aubrey's family was \" tortured by the lack of information \" about the missing teen. That changed last tuesday, when authorities met with his parents and showed them a facebook page aubrey was using under a different name, reports nbc news. The group decided not to contact the teen for fear he'd go dark again ( due to his age, he couldn't be forced to return home ), opting to wait until he had another encounter with police. But one relative \" went out on a limb \" and messaged him anyway and apparently convinced aubrey to contact his mother. He told her he was ready to come home so long as certain conditions were met regarding who he saw and where he went. Though much of his time away remains a mystery, dix says aubrey's \" tale was absolutely amazing. He has seen and done things that make your jaw drop. \" ( another missing georgia teen was found using snapchat. )",

        "summary": "Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the justice department to raid gibson guitar facilities in tennessee last week. Npr aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old lacey act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the us. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with gibson possibly importing banned madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from india. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that gibson rival cf martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The landmark report thinks that's fishy, given that martin's ceo is a democratic donor and gibson's ceo is a gop backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible michelle obama ran afoul of the lacey act when she presented france's carla bruni with a gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \" it's a nightmare, \" says a dealer. \" i can't help it if they used brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970. \"",

Had decided to close the tabloid because the allegations — if true — were \" inhuman \" and had no place in the company. He said the paper's reputation had been \" sullied by behavior that was wrong. \" the paper is one of britain's sauciest and most storied tabloids, and was a key building block in the global media empire created by news corp. Chairman and chief executive rupert murdoch, who purchased it in 1969. News corp. Also owns the wall street journal. News of the world became the u.k.'s best-selling sunday paper with a righteous, no-holds-barred approach to taking down the rich and famous, from politicians to soccer stars. That style both appealed to the u.k.'s working class and titillated sophisticates who bought it as a guilty pleasure.

The paper has been under immense pressure for five years amid investigations into the use of private detectives to break into the mobile-phone voice mail of celebrities and political leaders. The public rebuke reached a new level this week with the allegation that, in 2002, the paper accessed the voice mail of an abducted 13-year-old girl who, it turned out, had been murdered. Other allegations then surfaced of hacking into phones tied to other child-murder victims, as well as the families of war dead and of victims of 2005 terrorist attacks in london. A person familiar with the matter said james murdoch proposed the closure to his father earlier this week, and the idea was pursued immediately. \" the news of the world is in the business of holding others to account, \" the younger mr. Murdoch said.",
            "News corp. Says it will close its 168-year-old u.k. Tabloid news of the world, a dramatic bid to cap a scandal centered on the paper's controversial reporting tactics in pursuit of racy scoops.

He got flustered, gave conflicting ( and at least once, wrong ) answers, and constantly asked for questions to be repeated — and this was while being questioned by his own side, the prosecution. After a performance like that, the washington post's melinda henneberger predicts that \" he stands a very good chance of being ripped apart by the defense \" during cross-examination today. Highlights from his testimony, via the post, the ap, and the news-record: the night edwards announced his 2008 campaign, he, young, and hunter passed around a bottle of wine in the car as young drove to the kick-off event, young said. When edwards first learned of hunter's pregnancy, \" he said she was a crazy slut and there was a 1-in-3 chance that it was his, \" young said. When heiress rachel \" bunny \" mellon started funneling money to hunter — the central issue of the trial — \" we were scared, \" young said. \" it was a truckload of money, more money than had ever flowed through our accounts.... It was crazy. \" in order to phone hunter without his wife finding out, edwards often used staffers ' phones … as well as a secret cell phone he, young, and hunter referred to as \" the bat phone, \" young said. When edwards came up with the idea of using young as a cover, he gave young what the aide referred to as a \" campaign stump speech \" explaining that the issue \" was bigger than all of us, \" and that voters \" don't give a s --- about you. They want me. \" why did young agree to it? \" i wanted my friend to be president, \" he admitted. \" being friends with the most powerful person on earth, there are benefits to that. \"",

Kaepernick led the 49ers to a 3-16 record the past two seasons.

            "Shawn inglima for new york daily news rasheen rose died at a queens state development care facility while being restrained by workers, his family's attorney said. A harlem woman has been hit with a whopping $ 11.67 million medical bill from a state institution she says killed her mentally disabled brother. Shaniece luke, 39, said her jaw dropped when she received the bill from the state office for people with developmental disabilities. \"i thought it was ridiculous. I couldn't believe it! \" luke told the daily news wednesday. She and her lawyers contend the astronomical bill is in retaliation for filing a wrongful death lawsuit against the agency and the queens developmental center where her brother, rasheen rose, died in 2012. \"it has to be, \" luke said. \"but they were the ones who killed my brother. \" the notarized bill, sent to rose's estate in march, was for paid medicaid assistance from august 2002 up to rose's death. The state agency is demanding to be paid the staggering amount if luke prevails in her suit and is awarded punitive damages. New york daily news shaneice luke received this bill for $ 11,672,701.66. \"the number is mind-boggling. And it becomes more egregious because rasheen died at the hand of one of their workers, \" luke's attorney, aaron depass,",
            "Albany, n.y. ( ap ) — two years after a 33-year-old mentally disabled man died at a state institution in queens, and one year after his sister filed a lawsuit accusing the staff of killing him, new york officials have sent her an $ 11.67 million bill. The claim against rasheen rose's estate cited his total medicaid assistance from aug. 6, 2002, through aug. 6, 2012, the day he died. A spokeswoman for the office for people with developmental disabilities, which runs the center, said wednesday officials were following federal medicaid obligations in seeking reimbursement. \" not doing so would be a violation and could put federal medicaid funding at risk, \" spokeswoman jennifer o'sullivan said. Medicaid, a state and federal program for the poor, doesn't typically demand reimbursement.

John cornyn of texas had a stronger phrase: \" mob rule, \" while democrat dick durbin of illinois heard the \" noise of democracy. \" democrats were staging a unified front to try to keep the hearing from proceeding, angry about withheld documents from kavanaugh's past, including his tenure in the george w. Bush white house. The release of more than 40,000 documents monday night seems to have only made things worse, with democrats arguing that it was humanly impossible to review them in time. Despite the democrats ' protests, senate judiciary committee charles grassley says he will not stop the hearing, which is expected to last four days, reports politico. Other developments: arrests: capitol police arrested 22 protesters on disorderly conduct charges during the morning, reports the washington post. Handmaid's tale: women dressed as characters from the handmaid's tale were among the protesters outside the hearing room, notes the huffington post. See an image here. The costumes illustrate their concerns that kavanaugh on the supreme court will be a setback for women's rights. Roe v. Wade: when the direct questions finally begin, democrats are expected to press kavanaugh on whether he'd be willing to overturn the ruling that legalized abortion, reports the new york times. The question, said democratic sen. Dianne feinstein, is not whether he believes that roe v. Wade is \"settled law, \" but \"whether you believe it is the correct law. \" the judge's views on executive power and gun control also were expected to be examined. 2 views: the interruptions and chaos are about \" democratic senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election and just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election, \" said republican ted cruz, per the ap. But democrat patrick leahy wondered, \"what are we trying to hide? why are we rushing? \" excerpts: read excerpts of kavanaugh's eventual opening statement here via marketwatch. \" a good judge must be an umpire — a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy, \" kavanaugh is to say. \" i don't decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.

The panel was led by robert kennedy jr., chairman of the world mercury project. According to buzzfeed news, kennedy believes journalists are working with the cdc to bury the truth about a vaccine ingredient called thimerosal causing autism in children, and he offered a $ 100,000 reward to anyone who can produce a study that finds vaccines with the ingredient are safe for kids and pregnant women. De niro, who was mostly quiet during the panel, did speak up to say he agrees with kennedy \" 100 %. \" science, on the other hand, does not. Doctors, medical organizations, and the cdc say kennedy's beliefs are unequivocally false. The director of a vaccine education center says seven studies published between 2000 and 2007 alone show that. Furthermore, thimerosal hasn't been used in children's vaccines since 1999 and is barely used in flu vaccines anymore, but autism rates are rising anyway, notes buzzfeed. Kennedy met with trump in january about heading a commission on vaccine safety. He says he's spoken to aides three times about the commission since then and expects it to happen, stat reports. With that on the horizon, 350 medical organizations, including the american academy of pediatrics, sent a letter to trump last week reasserting the safety of vaccines.",

Kennedy, the son of the late us attorney general, is a longtime environmental activist.
