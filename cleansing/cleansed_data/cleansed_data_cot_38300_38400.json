The black and hispanic \" central park five \" — who were aged 14 to 16 when they were caught up in the racially charged 1989 case — have agreed to a $ 40 million settlement in a long-running civil rights lawsuit, reports the new york times. Their convictions were overturned in 2002 when a convicted rapist and murderer confessed to the attack and dna evidence supported his claim. Four of the five exonerated men spent around seven years in prison each, while a fifth spent 13 years behind bars and is set to get the biggest wrongful-conviction payout in the city's history. The savage attack on the 28-year-old jogger came amid reports of \" wolfpacks \" of teens \" wilding \" in the park, and after the teens were arrested, donald trump took out newspaper ads calling for the return of the death penalty, the new york daily news reports. \" we took a lot of abuse, \" says the rev.

        "summary": "If your feline friend has a bad \" cattitude, \" the color of its fur might be a factor. Researchers at uc davis have found a correlation between a cat's markings and its level of feistiness, the san jose mercury news reports. Calicos and tortoiseshells are more likely to be aggressive — to bite, hiss, scratch, or swipe — when interacting with humans, according to the study published this month in the journal of applied animal welfare science. It may have something to do with the cats having two x chromosomes. And it's not a universal designation, the news notes, but the behaviors are more prominent in those cats. Also, the researchers say the results shouldn't be interpreted to mean that cats of those colors are dangerous; they're just feisty. Researchers based their findings on the results of an online survey of more than 1,200 cat owners, the california aggie reports. Respondents answered questions about their cats ' behavior — using a scale of zero to five to rate frequency of particular behaviors — and provided their feline's color and pattern. Researcher liz stelow tells the aggie that the study aimed to explore the \" long-standing assumption \" among vets and cat owners that \" calicos and tortoiseshells are somehow different. \" as it turns out, \" they were significantly different from most other coat colors for aggression toward humans. \" on the flip side, the study found that cats with solid black, gray, or white coats are less aggressive. Researchers want to be sure their findings don't discourage people from adopting calicos and torties. Just because they're more aggressive, another researcher tells the aggie, \" does not mean they are a problem. \" ( of course, your cat might secretly want to kill you. )",

            "Grinnell's jack taylor didn't just amend the ncaa's record books when he scored 138 points -- a new collegiate high mark -- in his team's 179-104 victory over faith baptist bible tuesday night. The division iii star wrote a new chapter. \" there was a point during the second half where i hit a number of threes in a row -- maybe seven or eight -- i felt like anything i threw up was going in, \" taylor said. \" i've been in the zone before but i've never taken so many shots. \" bevo francis of rio grande held the ncaa scoring record with 113 points against hillsdale in 1954. In 1953, francis had 116 against ashland junior college. Frank selvy is the only other player to reach triple figures, scoring 100 points for division i furman against newberry in 1954. The previous grinnell record was 89 by griffin lentsch last nov. 19 against principia. Taylor said he entered the locker room at halftime under the assumption he'd racked up 30 points in the first half. But when head coach david arseneault whipped out the first-half stat sheet, he realized he was mistaken. \" coach walked in with a stat sheet and said i had 58, \" taylor said. \" you could see the team's eyes light up."

What they uncovered was an \" exceptional and extremely rare treasure \": 2,200 silver coins, 21 gold coins, a gold signet ring, gold foil, and a circular object also made of gold. It's a collection unlike any ever found, according to french archaeologists, who made the discovery together with students from the university of lyon, per a release. For the past two years, lyon students have participated in digs at the abbey of cluny in saone-et-loire, among the largest monasteries in western europe in medieval times. But the most recent class was especially lucky. Over a monthlong dig that wrapped up in late october, they uncovered what researchers say is the largest collection of french denier coins ever found. The team had been trying to find the corner of the infirmary when coins suddenly spilled from a buried cloth bag. \" i thought how i'd never again see something like it in my life as an archaeologist, \" a student tells the local. The deniers are believed to mostly have been minted at cluny some 900 years ago when the coins were the prevailing currency. But they were surprisingly found next to a hide bundle housing islamic gold dinars minted in spain and morocco around the same time. The ring inscribed with a religious greeting and depicting the bust of a god was also in the bundle, say researchers. An expert notes the owner of the items could've exchanged them for \" between three and eight horses \" in the middle ages — if they'd been retrieved. ( the first us coin may have been found. )",

The researchers say cooking rice with a small amount of coconut oil — they used a teaspoon for every half-cup of rice — and then putting it in the refrigerator can reduce digestible starch, and calories, by more than 50 %, reports popular science. The researchers found the method, which converts starch into a form the body can't easily turn to glucose, cut calories more than 10 % in the most fattening kind of the 38 varieties of rice they looked at, and they believe it could reduce starch by up to 60 % in other kinds of white rice, abc reports. While obesity has long plagued the us, the professor supervising the research tells the washington post that \" it's becoming a problem in asia, too. People are eating larger and larger portions of rice, which isn't good. \" the team says earlier research has shown that similar methods can reduce starch and calories in other staples like potatoes, and there's a chance it could work for bread. But much more research remains to be done: the scientists plan to look at other varieties of rice, as well as other kinds of oil, and popular science notes that it's not clear whether the cooking method affects nutrients like potassium that are found in rice — or, for that matter, taste.

In asia, where an estimated 90 percent of all rice is consumed, the pillowy grains are part of almost every meal. In the caribbean, where the starch is often mixed with beans, it's a staple too. Even here in the united states, where people eat a comparatively modest amount of rice, plenty is still consumed. Rice is popular because it's malleable — it pairs well with a lot of different kinds of food — and it's relatively cheap. But like other starch-heavy foods, it has one central flaw: it isn't that good for you. White rice consumption, in particular, has been linked to a higher risk of diabetes. A cup of the cooked grain carries with it roughly 200 calories, most of which comes in the form of starch, which turns into sugar, and often thereafter body fat.

        "summary": "A russian woman who went for a routine procedure in hopes of soon becoming pregnant ended up dead after doctors mistakenly injected her with formaldehyde instead of saline — leading to her being \" embalmed alive, \" per the washington post. Ekaterina fedyaeva, in her late 20s, had gone in for the operation in march in ulyanovsk to remove ovarian cysts, the london times reports. But doctors \" did not read the name on a bottle \" believed to contain saline, says local health minister rashid abdullov, and injected her with poisonous formalin, a formaldehyde solution, instead, leading to her agonizing death. \" her legs were moving, she had convulsions, her whole body was shaking, \" her mother tells the sun, adding that the formalin, typically used to preserve corpses, was inside her daughter's body for 14 hours before doctors tried to remedy the situation. \" mom, i ' m dying, \" her mother tells rt her daughter said after the operation, right before her organs started shutting down and she was put on life support. Doctors used more than 50 drugs in their efforts to save fedyaeva, but it was too late, per the sun. Fedyaeva died earlier this month. Her mother also tells the times that right after the procedure, doctors tried to conceal what had really happened and blamed the side effects fedyaeva was suffering on the anesthesia she'd been given. \" they deliberately tried to deceive us, \" fedyaeva's mother says. In a recent tweet, abdullov called the incident a \" terrible tragedy \" and said those responsible are being held accountable while the investigation continues. Medical staff could face up to three years in prison if convicted of causing fedyaeva's death due to negligence. ( a 30-year-old chicago woman died during plastic surgery. )",

Ekaterina immediately began to suffer agonising convulsions before falling into a coma.

Her horrified mother galina said: \" her legs were moving, she had convulsions, her whole body was shaking. \" for 14 hours after surgery she was living with this formalin and they [ doctors ] did nothing. \" what is formalin and how does it work? formalin is a toxic, colourless liquid derived from formaldehyde gas dissolved in water. It is used in the manufacture of textiles, plastics, papers - but also to preserve human corpses, according to bimc hospitals. The solution - injected into the arteries - works by killing bacteria and \" fixing \" cellular proteins so they can't feed the bacteria - hence stopping decomposition. But both forms are incredibly dangerous, according to australia's department of health. East2west news formalin is used to stop the decomposition of corpses it says inhalation or ingestion can cause \" severe pain with inflammation, ulceration and necrosis of the mucous membranes which line almost every internal organ \". Necrosis is quite literally the death of all the cells in an organ or tissue due to disease, injury or lack of blood supply. Other symptoms of ingesting formalin include nausea, vomiting blood, diarrhea with bloody stool, blood from the urine, vertigo, circulation failure and death. 30ml is considered the lethal dose of formalin. What does it feel like to be embalmed alive? the formaldehyde – normally used to preserve corpses - would have quickly ruptured ekaterina's red blood cells, according to dr christopher hoyle, a toxicologist at university of colorado hospital. This would have stopped oxygen being sent throughout her body,"

The details: at one point, trump asks the interviewer if he's ever heard of the phrase \" priming the pump, \" which has been widely used in economic circles for at least the better part of a century. \" have you heard that expression used before? because i haven't heard it.

Another said: \" the phrase ' priming the pump'dates to the early 19th century. \" at the washington post, philip bump is baffled.

The gelmerbahn funicular in bern has a maximum gradient of 106 %. But unlike others of its kind, the cars on the stoosbahn, which resemble beer-barrels, have a level-adjusting function that keeps passengers level as the gradient changes.

They were colleagues whom i personally liked and respected, so i was sad to see them go and regret much of how it happened. But the new republic is too important an institution to accept their departures as its end. I didn't buy the new republic to be the conservator of a small print magazine whose long-term influence and survival were at risk. I came to protect the future of the new republic by creating a sustainable business so that our journalism, values and voice — the things that make us singular — could survive. I've never bought into the silicon valley outlook that technological progress is pre-ordained or good for everyone. I don't share the unbridled, panglossian optimism and casual disdain for established institutions and tradition of many technologists.

The 68-year-old continental resources ceo still has \" billions to spare, \" though, even after an oklahoma city judge ruled yesterday that he must pay sue ann hamm, 58, nearly $ 1 billion in one of the costliest divorce settlements ever, the new york times reports. Harold will cough up $ 322 million by year's end, then start paying sue ann at least $ 7 million a month starting in january until he pays the balance, the ap reports. Sue ann also got three of their homes, while harold retained a missouri home and an oklahoma log cabin situated on 154 acres. The settlement could make sue ann one of the richest women in the country, reuters notes, though she had hoped for much more. The couple married in 1988 with no prenup; sue ann filed for divorce in 2012. What made the largely closed-door, nine-week trial interesting is that what gets divvied up under oklahoma law depends on whether money made during the marriage was obtained based on a spouse's skill ( fair game ) or \" circumstances beyond the parties ' control \" ( not fair game ). Harold's attorneys tried to argue that the successful energy entrepreneur had lucked into his fortune — a hard sell the judge didn't go for, calling hamm \" an expert in the oil field service business \" whose expertise facilitated an \" increase in value for continental, \" per the times. ( a russian magnate is said to have had \" the most expensive divorce in history. \" )",

        "summary": "Does drinking milk make kids taller? if the milk comes from a cow, the answer may be yes, cbc news reports. A new study in the american journal of clinical nutrition found that 3-year-olds who drank 3 cups of an alternative to cow's milk, such as soy, almond, or rice milk, each day were on average 1.5 centimeters ( or.59 inches ) shorter than kids who quaffed 3 cups of the real stuff. While it is not known if the kids will grow up to be shorter, lead author jonathon maguire tells the national post that height differences often widen over time. \" even a one- or two-centimeter difference when you're little can result in a big difference when you're an adult, \" he says. And \" when you are only 2.5 feet high, \" he tells cbc, \" it is a fairly sizable difference. \" his team at st. Michael's hospital in toronto studied 5,000 children between the ages of 2 and 6, of whom 92 % drank cow's milk daily and 13 % drank alternatives daily. ( even children who drank a combination of cow's milk and alternatives were shorter on average than those who only drank cow's milk. ) while researchers didn't examine a cause for the height drop-off, they theorize that dietary protein and fat are at the heart of the matter. Steadily on the rise, alternatives to cow's milk tend to have less of both. With 16 grams of protein, two cups of cow's milk pack 100 % of the daily protein requirement for a 3-year-old. In contrast, the same amount of almond milk has about four grams. Many cow's milk alternatives contain little fat and and the calcium is not not as readily absorbed, a dietitian tells healthday.

In the ensuing decades, madison, variously reported to be either 66 or 67, has suffered several strokes and says he cannot remember the crime that sent him to alabama's death row, where he is one of the longest-serving inmates. But on monday, the us supreme court ruled the state can execute him regardless of that, the new york times reports. \" madison is competent to be executed because — notwithstanding his memory loss — he recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed, \" the court wrote. Hours before madison was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection last year, he was granted a stay by a lower court and the supreme court upheld that stay, al.com reports. In monday's ruling, the high court reversed that decision. Though the decision was unanimous, three justices wrote concurring opinions noting that the court should return to the legal questions raised by madison's case; they simply didn't find his case an appropriate vehicle to address those questions. Justice stephen breyer, for example, pointed out that the \" unconscionably long periods of time \" that prisoners often spend awaiting execution could be a constitutional problem, as \" we may face ever more instances of state efforts to execute prisoners suffering the diseases and infirmities of old age, \" the washington post reports.

Us researchers say a possible design flaw in the pool produced a water current that gave some swimmers an unfair advantage, reports the wall street journal. Specifically, they say that swimmers in the high-numbered lanes of 4 through 8 got a boost over those in lanes 1 through 3 in the men's and women's 50-meter races. Five of the six medalists came from the higher lanes, the lone exception being us gold medalist anthony ervin from lane 3. What's more, 15 of the 16 swimmers who qualified for the finals did so from the higher lanes. The world swimming body fina is investigating, given that a similar problem uncovered by the same researchers affected the 2013 world championships. \" disappointing \" but not surprising, researcher joel stager of indiana university tells the guardian. As is sometimes the case in world competitions, the pool at rio is a temporary one that will be taken down afterward. Maker myrtha pools says tests conducted before and during the competition — which involved floating a large jug — found no evidence of a current. Assuming the anomaly existed, it would have affected longer races, too, but in a more complicated way — the same current that boosted swimmers in the one-lap 50-meter race would have worked against them in the opposite direction.",

        "summary": "You've likely heard of \" black sites \" operated by the cia at which prisoners are interrogated off the grid and without due process. Well, an investigation released yesterday by the guardian asserts that the chicago police department has something similar — a former sears warehouse on the west side of the city called homan square that police have used since the late ' 90s. The report by spencer ackerman alleges that suspects brought there enter the equivalent of a legal black hole: their names don't show up in booking databases, making it all but impossible for families and attorneys to find them, and those interviewed describe beatings, shackling for prolonged periods, and the detention of people as young as 15. The guardian today reports that two former top doj officials say the report's claims merit a preliminary inquiry; the newspaper describes that as \" a first step toward a full civil rights investigation. \" \" this homan square revelation seems to me to be an institutionalization of the practice that dates back more than 40 years of violating a suspect or witness's rights to a lawyer and not to be physically or otherwise coerced into giving a statement, \" chicago civil rights attorney flint taylor tells the guardian. The story cites the case of brian jacob church, arrested during a protest of a nato summit in 2012, who was detained, shackled, and questioned for nearly a full day before being released to a police station to be booked. \" it's a domestic black site, \" church says. \" when you go in, no one knows what's happened to you. \" the department called the facility a \" sensitive \" location vital for undercover operations and insisted that it \" abides by all laws, rules, and guidelines. \" click for the full story, and an accompanying one describing the site itself in more detail.",

Their decision most likely prevented what was already a deadly rampage in this rural hamlet southwest of red bluff from becoming a bloodbath on the scale of sandy hook in connecticut. Apparently infuriated by a longstanding dispute with neighbors, a gunman armed with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns shot four people to death in the tiny community of rancho tehama reserve early tuesday. Clad in a military-style assault vest capable of storing multiple rounds of ammunition, the man wounded at least 10 others before officers rammed into the stolen vehicle he was driving, shot him and killed him. The tehama sheriff's department said the number of fatalities might grow. Assistant sheriff phil johnston said officials are worried because they've had trouble locating several of the gunman's relatives. As bad as the spree was, johnston said he was thankful it wasn't worse. Although two young boys were shot in the early morning rampage, including one inside rancho tehama elementary school, the assistant sheriff said no students or teachers were killed. He credited school officials with locking down the campus without even waiting for the customary notification from the sheriff's department.

            "The sound of gunfire was in the air, and school officials ordered an immediate lockdown. Their decision most likely prevented what was already a deadly rampage in this rural hamlet southwest of red bluff from becoming a bloodbath on the scale of sandy hook in connecticut. Apparently infuriated by a longstanding dispute with neighbors, a gunman armed with a semi-automatic rifle and two handguns shot four people to death in the tiny community of rancho tehama reserve early tuesday. Clad in a military-style assault vest capable of storing multiple rounds of ammunition, the man wounded at least 10 others before officers rammed into the stolen vehicle he was driving, shot him and killed him. The tehama sheriff's department said the number of fatalities might grow. Assistant sheriff phil johnston said officials are worried because they've had trouble locating several of the gunman's relatives. As bad as the spree was, johnston said he was thankful it wasn't worse. Although two young boys were shot in the early morning rampage, including one inside rancho tehama elementary school, the assistant sheriff said no students or teachers were killed. He credited school officials with locking down the campus without even waiting for the customary notification from the sheriff's department.

Researchers analyzed 65 studies from 34 countries ( one study was conducted in nyc in 1999; other locations included cuba, england, australia, sweden, turkey, and ghana ) and found that women were mistreated across income levels and locations. The mistreatment ran the gamut, from things like neglect, a refusal to provide pain meds, poor communication, or a lack of respect for a woman's preferred birth position, to the extreme: slapping, pinching, gags, threatened beatings, and verbal abuse. One study, conducted in tanzania, recorded four self-reported instances of rape and three of sexual abuse. While the researchers write that their study provides \" a comprehensive, evidence-based typology of the mistreatment of women during childbirth, \" the new york times notes it does not calculate any sort of global estimate of abuse, and some figures produced by the individual studies themselves are wide-ranging: 28 % of women in that tanzania study reported abuse, while 98 % did in a study out of nigeria. The paper observes that such abuse can spur women to steer clear of hospitals, \" undermin[ ing ] international goals of reducing deaths during childbirth. \" in a 2014 statement on the issue, the who wrote, \" adolescents, unmarried women, women of low socio-economic status, women from ethnic minorities, migrant women, and women living with hiv are particularly likely to experience disrespectful and abusive treatment. \" ( this woman has an extreme birth story. )",

            "This systematic review presents a comprehensive, evidence-based typology of the mistreatment of women during childbirth in health facilities, and demonstrates that mistreatment can occur at the level of interaction between the woman and provider, as well as through systemic failures at the health facility and health system levels. We propose this typology be adopted to describe the phenomenon and be used to develop measurement tools and inform future research, programs, and interventions. We searched pubmed, cinahl, and embase databases and grey literature using a predetermined search strategy to identify qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies on the mistreatment of women during childbirth across all geographical and income-level settings. We used a thematic synthesis approach to synthesize the qualitative evidence and assessed the confidence in the qualitative review findings using the cerqual approach. In total, 65 studies were included from 34 countries. Qualitative findings were organized under seven domains: ( 1 ) physical abuse, ( 2 ) sexual abuse, ( 3 ) verbal abuse, ( 4 ) stigma and discrimination, ( 5 ) failure to meet professional standards of care, ( 6 ) poor rapport between women and providers, and ( 7 ) health system conditions and constraints. Due to high heterogeneity of the quantitative data, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis; instead, we present descriptions of study characteristics, outcome measures, and results.

Despite growing recognition of neglectful, abusive, and disrespectful treatment of women during childbirth in health facilities, there is no consensus at a global level on how these occurrences are defined and measured. This mixed-methods systematic review aims to synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence on the mistreatment of women during childbirth in health facilities to inform the development of an evidence-based typology of the phenomenon.

She was apparently killed while picking edible plants in a mountain forest. Three men, one in his sixties and two in their seventies, were also killed in the same area in separate incidents while picking bamboo shoots. Authorities responded to suzuki's death by sending out a search team and fatally shooting a 4-foot-high, 154-pound female asiatic black bear just 20 yards from where the woman was killed, asahi shimbun reports. Local vet takeshi komatsu says there may be only one perpetrator behind the maulings. \" after tasting human flesh ( for the first time ), the bear may have realised that it can eat them, \" komatsu says. Yet sightings of black asiatic bears and brown bears have soared in northern japan this year, surpassing 1,200, which already doubles last year's count. An unusually high crop of beechnuts may have boosted the bear population by improving the nutrition of mother bears, yomiuri shimbun reports. Meanwhile, authorities are advising people to take precautions when walking around the mountains. \" bears normally avoid humans, so it's good to make them aware of your presence by using something like a bell, \" says a member of a nonprofit that specializes in driving away bears.",

That's because zappos, under the direction of ceo tony hsieh, is pioneering a total revamp of its workplace, including getting rid of all its managers, replacing \" jobs \" with \" roles, \" and adopting an entirely new lingo — for example, you don't resolve conflicts, you \" sense a tension, \" an in-depth article in the new republic details. It's all part of hsieh's attempt to create a self-actualizing, self-organizing corporate culture where one's outside life is tightly intertwined with work, a \" tribal identification \" is instilled ( workers proudly call themselves \" zapponians \" ), and an \" arcane \" management system called holacracy is designed to equally distribute power to structure zappos \" more like a city and less like a bureaucratic organization, \" which hsieh hopes will lead to more innovation and productivity in the long term. The reorg was inspired by frederic laloux's reinventing organizations ( zapponians call it \" the book \" ), which describes a color-coded organization spectrum that corresponds to \" different stages in the evolution of human consciousness, \" starting at \" reactive-infrared \" for hunter-gatherers and ending at \" evolutionary-teal, \" the stage zappos has just supposedly entered. The internal workings sound... Interesting: to get a raise, you have to earn a currency called \" people points, \" and people who don't do well in their roles are banned to the \" beach, \" a \" holding pen \" for undesirables. An employee the new republic kept in touch with says there's still lots of confusion about who can make decisions, and the magazine notes \" it seems that most of the self-organizing and self-actualization... Is being carried out by hsieh, \" but he tells the magazine there's \" so much untapped potential \" among his 1,500 or so employees — and he's convinced this is the way to unlock it.

        "summary": "A development of \" great impact \" has been made in the world of flowers — specifically among chrysanthemums, which researchers have just turned a true-blue hue for the first time, per science. The magazine explains that vibrant blue flowers are hard to find in nature — only a few species exist, and others we think are blue are really more purple or violet. Scientists have long tried to manufacture blue versions of flowers, but the complexities of plant pigmentation have stymied them: for a flower to \" turn \" blue, pigment molecules called anthocyanins have to have just the right amount of sugar or other atoms, and the plant cells have to offer just the right conditions. A cornell scientist tells science news that such a flower is the \" holy grail, \" while a university of florida plant biotechnologist says previous efforts have \" never worked perfectly. \" until now. In a study published in the science advances journal, success came via the work of naonobu noda, a plant biologist in japan who used a double-punch technique to turn a chrysanthemum blue, per the royal horticultural society's color scale. He inserted not one, but two genes into his samples: one from the bluish canterbury bell flower, another from the butterfly pea. And although his team had anticipated having to add a third, two did the trick, as a color-free component already in the chrysanthemum interacted well with the altered anthocyanin. Per nature, the scientists say this genetic alteration may also be used on other commercially coveted flowers such as carnations and lilies, though noda tells npr we likely won't see these modified blooms in florists anytime soon.

Beckerman rejected comparisons to the boston tea party or lunch counter sit-ins during the civil rights movement, reports the washington post. \" those were peaceful protests, \" she said. \" this was so far beyond a peaceful protest. \" bail hearings for three other activists were delayed and prosecutors appealed a decision to grant bail to another, the guardian reports. Shawna cox, the only woman being held, can be freed on bail when the occupation ends, beckerman ruled. At the hearing, ammon bundy described himself as a \" federalist, \" the post reports. \" i believe federal government has a role and it is to protect people from the outside world, \" he said. \" i do love this country very much. \" the guardian notes that prosecutors argued that bundy has no respect for the federal criminal justice system, citing an aug. 2015 facebook post in which he said: \" there is no justice in a federal court. \" there are still four occupiers at the refuge despite ammon bundy's call to \" go home, \" the oregonian reports.

Davock sank on what's been termed \" the most disastrous day in the history of lake michigan shipping, \" but why the freighter and its 32 crewmen went down amid 80mph winds and 30-foot waves has been a 75-year mystery. Wzzm reports a sudden blizzard blew in on nov. 11, 1940, and while smaller ships survived, three larger ones were destroyed. Three divers found the davock — upside down and with coal scattered around it — 32 years later. But its resting place 210 feet below the lake's surface put it in waters so murky that an investigation into why it sank was all but impossible, michigan live reports. On a clear day last fall, however, divers from the michigan shipwreck research association captured the first known footage of the wreck and evidence of a fatal blow: a broken rudder and snapped propeller blade. \" the waves were so strong, they must have snapped the rudder's connection, at which point it swung so far over that it struck the propeller, \" says msra diver jeff vos, who filmed the wreck. \" with no power or steering, the davock would have been at the mercy of the storm. \" msra board member craig rich says the davock \" would have gone into the trough of the wave sideways, which would have swamped the ship. \" the msra notes the ship may have capsized before sinking. Interestingly, divers may owe their discovery to invasive zebra mussels, which have made lake michigan's murky water more clear in recent years. \" it's not as warm as it is in the caribbean, but it's certainly starting to rival it in clarity, \" rich says. \" the divers didn't even use a light for the discovery. \" ( meanwhile, archaeologists are uncovering the gruesome aftermath of a wreck in australia. )",

File - this nov. 13, 2012 file photo shows new jersey gov. Chris christie during a news conference in trenton, n.j. Threatened with repeal just weeks ago, president barack obama's health care law now... ( associated press ) friday was the original deadline for states to notify washington if they would play a role in building new health insurance markets through which the uninsured can get coverage starting in 2014. Though the administration granted a month's extension, most states have already made their intentions known. As of friday, 23 states plus washington, d.c., were proceeding; 15 said they'd defer to the federal government to run their markets and 12 were still mulling over their options. The mostly blue group proceeding included five republican-led states.

Republicans unsuccessfully challenged the law in court and many delayed implementing it, hoping romney -- who called for the law's repeal -- would win the nov. 6 presidential election. \"it's a bad piece of legislation, \" louisiana governor bobby jindal said at a news conference in las vegas yesterday. \"it's going to have a lot of unintended consequences. \" democrat obama's re-election lifted uncertainty over the law, which will extend health-care coverage to as many as 30 million uninsured when its major provisions take effect in 2014. States are now facing decisions about how to move forward with the most sweeping changes to the nation's health-care system since 1965. States must decide whether to create exchanges in which consumers can buy subsidized insurance policies beginning in 2014, or have the federal government do it for them. They also need to determine whether to expand medicaid, the federal-state health-care program for the poor, to about 17"

The dashed deal reveals the difficulty of stopping the illegal arms trade with pyongyang despite un sanctions, the washington post reports. The freighter jie shun, sailing in secret under a cambodian flag, was ferrying 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades hiding under a load of iron ore. A un report later called it the \" largest seizure of ammunition in the history of sanctions \" against the north. While it was unknown if the buyers, egyptian businessmen, ever paid the $ 23 million tab, the incident angered us officials, who put the brakes on nearly $ 300 million in military aid to cairo over the summer. Egypt's defense minister announced last month his country was cutting military ties to north korea. But with long-standing ties to pyongyang dating to when it was legal to trade, cairo remains a \" resilient customer today \" for kim jong un's arsenal of cold war-era conventional weapons, one expert tells the post. Sanctions and the war of words playing out between president trump and kim has failed to defeat a vibrant trade with countries whose military forces depend on the soviet-designed hardware and replacement parts north korea can provide, including cuba, syria, burma, and uganda. Terrorists have obtained small arms they've used to carry out attacks, the guardian reported last month. \" as the russians and chinese have moved away from this market, the north koreans have stuck around, \" an expert tells the post.

While the gop win was a virtual certainty beforehand, the question now is how much the party can pad its margin. By ap's count, republicans currently control 234 seats of the 435 seats, and various projections have them adding six to 15 seats in these midterms, reports the new york times. Nbc, for the record, projects the new total to be 242-193, but it's got a margin of error of eight seats. As a historical footnote, republicans would need to hit 246 to match their high mark — reached when harry s. Truman was president, notes ap. \" if we do, we're up in territory we've not seen, \" says oregon rep. Greg walden, chairman of the national republican congressional committee. \" you're in pretty thin oxygen when you're up there as a republican. \"",

But he did call the commander in chief \" republican in basically name only, \" and he did make a reference to a 2016 primary in south carolina that many in attendance tuesday took to be a trump burn — and that brought some of the trump kids to their father's defense. Bush said that after that particular primary, he was able to go home to children \" who actually love me, \" bringing laughter from the audience. The washington post reports that comment raised the ire of donald trump jr., who tweeted at bush late wednesday. \" jeb! i love everything about my father, \" he posted. \" i love that he's a fighter, i love that he has guts, i love that he's president ( all those things you're not ). Also love that he learned enough about politics in a few weeks to dismantle you piece by piece despite it being your life's work. \" eric trump, who usually isn't as vocal on twitter as his brother, had weighed in earlier, tweeting to bush, \" i actually love my father very much. #pleaseclap \" — a reference to when bush had to instruct a crowd at an early 2016 new hampshire town hall to applaud for him after he spoke.",

At one point, bush described the current president as \"republican in basically name only. \" and earlier in his speech, bush said that after the 2016 republican primary in south carolina, he returned home to children who \"actually love me. \" his comment was met with raucous laughter from the crowd, and several audience members interviewed after the event said they interpreted bush's comment as a jab at trump. Bush — the son of president george h.w. Bush ' 48 and brother of president george w. Bush ' 68 — gave a lecture under the title \"a conversation with jeb bush: restoring conservatism in america. \" the lecture and questions that followed focused on the state of american politics and how the younger generation can create a reinvigorated conservative movement. \"if there was ever need for a bill buckley-like approach, to transforming conservatism in this country, it is right now, \" bush said. \"maybe not a 19th-century or a 20th-century version of conservatism but certainly a 21st-century version of that. And sadly the fracturing of the conservative movement could not come at a worse time. \" following opening remarks from madeline fortier ' 19, president of the the william f. Buckley, jr.

Buckley, jr. Program at yale. \"i ' m still in therapy. \" but that didn't stop him from taking shots at president donald trump, his opponent in the 2016 republican presidential primary. At one point, bush described the current president as \"republican in basically name only. \" and earlier in his speech, bush said that after the 2016 republican primary in south carolina, he returned home to children who \"actually love me. \" his comment was met with raucous laughter from the crowd, and several audience members interviewed after the event said they interpreted bush's comment as a jab at trump. Bush — the son of president george h.w. Bush ' 48 and brother of president george w. Bush ' 68 — gave a lecture under the title \"a conversation with jeb bush: restoring conservatism in america. \" the lecture and questions that followed focused on the state of american politics and how the younger generation can create a reinvigorated conservative movement. \"if there was ever need for a bill buckley-like approach, to transforming conservatism in this country, it is right now, \" bush said. \"maybe not a 19th-century or a 20th-century version of conservatism but certainly a 21st-century version of that. And sadly the fracturing of the conservative movement could not come at a worse time. \" following opening remarks from madeline fortier ' 19, president of the the william f. Buckley, jr.

In what has to be one of science's odder recent experiments, researchers in portugal decided to pop a pair of headphones on a dozen cats while they were being spayed ( and thus weren't conscious; humans have been shown to react to music during general anesthesia, a press release notes ). The researchers assessed the felines'reactions to three different two-minute pieces of music: samuel barber's \" adagio for strings, \" \" torn \" by natalie imbruglia, and, in case the operation wasn't stressful enough, the ac/dc song \" thunderstruck, \" popular science reports. Apparently, hard rock just wasn't really the cats'thing. Researchers determined this by tracking the cats ' pupil dilation and breathing speed to assess how relaxed they were. Classical music was, it seems, the most relaxing; natalie imbruglia was in the middle; and ac/dc was the most stressful. Not hugely surprising, it seems: a veterinarian notes that \" during consultations, i have noticed … that most cats like classical music, particularly george handel compositions, and become more calm, confident, and tolerant throughout the clinical evaluation. \" that helped inspire the experiment, whose results could help vets reduce the amount of anesthesia used during operations by adding music, \" reducing undesirable side effects of anesthetic agents and thus promoting patient safety, \" the authors write in the journal of feline medicine and surgery.

            "Beirut ( reuters ) - syrian opposition activists called mass protests for friday to test a fragile, day-old ceasefire by president bashar al-assad's forces, and international pressure mounted for damascus to fully comply with a u.n.-backed peace plan. Anxious to build on a truce between the armed forces and rebels which brought an eerie calm to syria on thursday, after more than a year of clashes, the u.n. Security council worked on a resolution authorizing u.n. Observers to monitor it. World leaders welcomed the halt in fighting which had threatened to spill over into neighboring countries and u.n. Secretary general ban ki-moon said the situation looked calmer. \" the world is watching, however, with skeptical eyes since many promises previously made by the government of syria have not been kept, \" he told a news conference in geneva. Along with the withdrawal of forces from population centers, u.n.-arab league envoy kofi annan's six-point plan calls for talks with the opposition aimed at a \" political transition \", the release of political prisoners, access for humanitarian aid and journalists, and for the authorities to \" respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully \".

        "summary": "The white house is releasing new data on the effectiveness of healthcare.gov, and many of the figures aren't pretty. The washington post reports that the registrations of nearly 15,000 people who signed up for plans failed to arrive in insurers ' inboxes, at least at first. Things have gotten better, however, since the start of this month, the administration says: now, less than 1 % of the registrations aren't getting to the firms. Still, officials don't actually have a list of names of those who suffered the problem. The so-called \" orphan files \" are just one of several issues highlighted in the post and wall street journal. In some cases, insurers got inaccurate data from the exchanges. Meanwhile, thousands of users were incorrectly assigned either to medicaid or to private insurers, or their eligibility was wrongly denied; at their worst, these problems may affected up to a fifth of applicants, per an estimate cited by the journal. Some legal immigrants in illinois, for instance, were informed they'd get medicaid coverage despite not having lived in the state long enough to qualify. An administration rep emphasizes that \" the vast majority of the ( newly-released data ) is retroactive. \"",

But then a speckled body breaks the water's surface, standing out among the bright white whales. The narwhal, swimming more than 600 miles south of its usual arctic homeland, \" behaves like it was one of the boys, \" says robert michaud, president of the nonprofit group for research and education on marine mammals, which recorded the surprising footage in july. First spotted blowing bubbles with belugas in july 2016, the st. Lawrence narwhal with a 1.5-foot-long tusk, thought to be a juvenile male, appears to have been fully adopted by his distant cousins. The whales interact with the narwhal just as they would with their own kind, michaud tells the cbc: \" they are in constant contact with each other. \" with a knack for living in icy water, narwhals usually hunt deep-water fish, while belugas prefer shallow, coastal waters where salmon and capelin stay close to the surface. But females of both species experience menopause, which forbes recently reported is \" highly unusual \" in the animal kingdom. Narwhals and belugas are also very social, and similarly communicate via chirps and clicks, per the cbc. Noting an inuit legend tells of a narwhal among belugas, which have also been seen in narwhal pods, harvard researcher martin nweeia adds the animals are probably capable of caring and compassion \" to welcome another member that may not look or act the same. \" according to gremm, the animals \" might find themselves in one another's company more and more frequently \" as climate change continues to take a toll on the arctic.",

            "A team of researchers in the uk and the us have discovered that female narwhals and beluga whales go through menopause as they get older. Menopause refers to the time when menstrual cycles permanently cease, marking the end of female reproductive years. This often occurs decades before the end of life. We've come to accept this as a normal and natural phenomenon — which it is … for humans — but within the animal kingdom, it's highly unusual. In most animals, the reproductive system ages at the same rate as other tissues in the body, and does not enter a phase of 'senescence ' where function shuts down well before everything else. Indeed, most other species are able to reproduce their whole lives. Female elephants, for example, remain fertile well into old age ( and elephants are among the oldest living land animals in the world ). Certainly",

By a vote of 9-0, the council approved an income tax that only applies to wealthy residents, with the 2.25 % tax starting at income above $ 250,000 for individuals and above $ 500,000 for married couples filing joint returns, the seattle times reports. The city estimates that the tax will raise around $ 140 million a year from seattle's 20,000 or so wealthiest residents. Washington state doesn't have a personal income tax and a 1984 law bans cities and counties in the state from taxing net income, meaning seattle's move is certain to face legal challenges, the ap reports. Opponents vowed to fight the measure, with washington state republican party chair susan hutchison urging citizens to \" forcefully resist \" the tax and not pay a penny. Seattle mayor ed murray says he ' ll sign the measure into law friday — and he will welcome legal challenges. The goal is to replace the current \" regressive \" tax system with a fairer one, \" while ensuring seattle stands up to president trump's austere budget that cuts transportation, affordable housing, health care, and social services, \" the mayor tells reuters.

            "The families learnt of the mix-up by chance after the husband of one of the women divorced her and then refused to pay maintenance for their daughter, saying she looked nothing like him. To everyone's astonishment, a dna test proved that the angry husband was right and that 12-year-old irina belyaeva was not biologically related to her parents, yuri and yuliya belyaeva. An investigation revealed that irina was instead the biological daughter of a local muslim family and that the other family's daughter, anya, was the biological daughter of yuri and yuliya. It transpired that the two children had been born within 15 minutes of each other in the same ward in 1998 but that the midwives had mixed up their wrist-tags, possibly because the two mothers were listed under their maiden names which both began with the letter a. \" i had never thought carefully about my daughter's looks before, \" yuliya belyaeva told the komsomolskaya pravda daily newspaper. \" and then when this happened i tried to recognise my own and my former husband's features in her. There was not the slightest resemblance.

The parents of an 11-year-old boy in canada learned that the hard way after doctors solved the mystery behind their son's serious vision loss. Toronto doctors who examined the boy spotted a buildup of bitot's spots on his corneas, live science reports. The foamy patches, caused by severe dryness, were a tip-off that malnutrition may be the cause. One point was crystal clear: eight months after symptoms began, the boy could only see hand motions 12 inches from his face. Writing in jama, the doctors say blood tests found the boy to be severely deficient in vitamin a, with 14.33 micrograms per deciliter, well below the normal range of around 26 to 49 micrograms. With multiple food allergies and eczema, the boy was on a restrictive diet to prevent outbreaks. It turns out that pork, lamb, apples, and cheerios are not the stuff of a balanced meal, even if you add potatoes and cucumbers. None of those foods — all the boy ate — were a good source of vitamin a, which keeps the corneas moist and feeds photoreceptor cells that detect light, per science alert. Without these foods on his dinner plate, the boy was slowly going blind. Rare in developed countries, \" vitamin a deficiency is very common in poorer parts of the world, where it is a leading cause of blindness, \" the boy's doctor, eyal cohen, tells live science. After six weeks of megadoses of vitamin a, the boy's sight was vastly improved, but doctors say he may never fully recover. ( italy considered jailing parents of vegan kids. )",

But caffeine, it turns out, may not be the only culprit, reports live science. While one monster energy drink contains 160mg of caffeine, the man's total daily consumption of 320mg is still below the 400mg the mayo clinic considers safe for healthy adults. But the patient was, while otherwise healthy, also obese, reports medical daily, and then there's the issue of consuming multiple beers a day, creating a potentially dangerous mix. Other ingredients in energy drinks, such as taurine and guarana, may boost the effects and even levels of caffeine. In any event, the man is not alone; between 2004 and 2012, the fda reviewed 40 reports of people with a wide range of health problems linked to energy drinks, including increased blood pressure and cardiac arrest.
