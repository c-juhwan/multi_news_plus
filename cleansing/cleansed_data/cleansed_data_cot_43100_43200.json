        "summary": "Arshell dennis iii was due to fly back to new york on sunday after a surprise visit home to chicago for his sick mother's birthday, reports the washington post. Instead, the son of a chicago police officer was shot dead. Police say dennis, 19, was sitting on his family's front porch, chatting with a friend after a block party, when an unknown assailant opened fire, reports wgn. Dennis — naacp student chapter vice president at st. John's university, where he was studying journalism — was killed by a bullet to the chest, while his friend was taken to a hospital in serious condition with wounds to his arm and side. No arrests have been made but the shooting may have been a case of \"mistaken identity \" or part of a gang initiation, police tell the chicago sun-times. There is \" absolutely no credibility \" to the idea that dennis'death was linked to his father's role as a dea task force officer, says police superintendent eddie johnson. \" any shooting victim that's in chicago is unacceptable, \" he adds, \" but this one hits close to home. \" neither victim was involved in gangs or had a criminal history, says johnson. Dennis — seen discussing police brutality in this youtube video — \" was a beautiful young man, full of laughs and always teasing us, \" his grandfather tells the chicago tribune. \" it's a deep loss, and it hurts. I wish this senseless killing would stop. \" nine people were killed over the weekend in chicago, which had tallied 436 deaths from gun violence in 2016 as of thursday. ( in all, more than 2,000 people have been shot in the city this year. )",

Last night, topeka's city council took the startling step of repealing the local law that makes domestic violence a crime, the new york times reports. The move is aimed at making sure the city isn't stuck with the bill for domestic violence cases, which councilors say the county will now have to prosecute under state law — but the county da, citing budget shortfalls, stopped pursuing domestic assault and other misdemeanor cases a month ago. \"we had hoped that he would not put that group of victims at risk, that he would find some other way to absorb the cuts, \" said a county official. \" i absolutely do not understand it, \" the director of the national coalition against domestic violence said after the vote. \" it's really outrageous that they're playing with family safety to see who blinks first. People could die while they're waiting to straighten this out. \" since early september, there have been at least 35 reported incidents of domestic battery or assault and 18 suspects have been freed without charge because the cases against them were not pursued, the ap finds.",

        "summary": "On any given day on the job as compton's deputy treasurer, salvador galvan quietly lopped between $ 200 and $ 8,000 off the top of municipal fees he collected for the california city, prosecutors say, per the los angeles times. He wasn't busted until december, after a co-worker saw something amiss in a ledger, and after galvan had accrued more than $ 3.7 million, they add. The 47-year-old — who'd worked for the city treasurer's office for more than 20 years, taking in cash payments from locals paying utility bills, parking tickets, and other fees — started out small and grew his take exponentially over the next six years, the criminal complaint lays out: an audit shows his first alleged skim in 2010 brought him just $ 1,400, but in 2012 he netted nearly $ 400,000 by year's end, with that figure jumping to almost $ 720,000 for 2013. In 2015, a staggering $ 879,536 vanished, court records show. Galvan's now-ex-colleagues were often puzzled by what a doj release describes as \" unexplained affluence \" on his $ 60,000-per-year salary, including driving a fancy audi sedan and splurging on office parties. He allegedly would write out correct receipts for the cash he collected, but then fudge the numbers on deposit slips; a co-worker noticed a $ 7,000 mismatch late last year, and galvan was arrested in december by the la county sheriff's department. He was freed on bond, but fbi agents arrested him again wednesday on federal theft charges. The case has demoralized some residents hard at work trying to keep compton's history of crime and corruption in the past. One local activist says he's \" disappointed, \" asking what processes have been implemented to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.

Romney was second with 21 %, followed by newt gingrich at 14 % and ron paul at 13 %. Santorum picked up 33 delegates in the jayhawk state; romney won seven. Campaigning in springfield, missouri, on saturday afternoon, santorum went after president barack obama. He criticized the president's stance on energy, health care, iran and the debt. The republican candidate also talked about entitlement programs. \" in the eyes of the president, america is a great country because government redistributes wealth, \" santorum said. Just watched paul: we will win",

Fire officials say the largest active wildfire in the region has now burned more than 19,000 acres in the north georgia mountains, an area larger than new york's manhattan. All told, wildfires have burned more than 80,000 acres of forest and blanketed large areas of the south in dangerous haze. A section of the appalachian trail several miles long has been closed as a result of fires in georgia and north carolina, and npr reports people are being evacuated in those states as well as tennessee. With no sign of coming rain, the tennessee valley authority has issued a burn ban on its public lands in seven states, the ap reports. The tva on tuesday said the ban applies to anything that might produce an open flame, from campfires to smoking cigarettes. It's even prohibited to park a car off-road where a hot tailpipe might light up dry grass or leaves. The rules apply across tennessee and in parts of alabama, georgia, kentucky, mississippi, north carolina, and virginia. Meanwhile, tennessee gov. Bill haslam has banned outdoor burning in more than half the state's counties through dec. 15.",

We could lose about 5 % of the planet's corals ( or 4,500 square miles ) this year, while 38 % may be affected. Similar events in 1998 and 2010 each lasted a year, but this event — caused by warming oceans as a result of global warming, el nino, and a warm \" blob \" in the pacific ocean — started last year and is likely to last into 2016, putting corals \" under really prolonged stress, \" says noaa researcher mark eakin, per the washington post and discovery news. When stressed, corals lose the symbiotic algae that provide color and thus turn white. They can recover, but death often follows long-term events. About 95 % of us coral reefs will encounter temperatures that can cause bleaching this year, while 60 % are likely to be \" hit with severe thermal stress, \" says eakin. \" we've been hearing worrying reports of bleaching from various places … with worse news likely yet to come with the strengthening el nino, \" a coral expert from the smithsonian institution tells the post. A university of queensland scientist expects a bleaching event to occur every year by 2030. \" coral reefs are the underwater equivalent of rainforests, and by removing the corals, you remove the trees of that underwater world, \" adds another expert.

She also claims she was told her poor social media skills caused certain sponsors to sever ties with the miss america organization, that she was given grief over her clothes ( \" during a photo shoot this year, regina looked at the karl lagerfeld dress i was wearing and said ' yuck.

It was not related to sex. \" he went on to apologize to schroeder dolphin, though his explanation of the yearbook reference was decried as unlikely by some.

The former governor and presidential candidate formally announced that he's running for the seat being vacated by orrin hatch, and the move makes him the \" instant front-runner \" given his popularity in the state, reports the salt lake tribune. A poll conducted by the newspaper in january suggested that he would win easily. Romney announced with a video, saying he wanted to \" bring utah's values and utah's lessons to washington. \" romney has previously been a vocal critic of president trump, but cnn notes that he did not go after the president in the video. He did, however say that utah \" welcomes legal immigrants \" while \" washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion. \" romney added that, \" on utah's capitol hill, people treat one another with respect. \" still, politico expects that romney will avoid running as an anti-trump candidate and will instead keep the campaign \" hyperlocal. \" the state's gop chief hit romney on that general topic earlier this week, asserting that \" a lot of utahns see him as a carpetbagger \" and adding, \" he doesn't buy his groceries here, he hasn't raised his kids here. \" however, rob anderson later apologized for the remarks, and romney has the support of the state's top leaders, including gop gov. Gary herbert. ( a romney victory could change the senate math if he joins with democrats to vote against the trump agenda on certain issues. )",

            "Pharmaceutical firm mylan is dramatically expanding a nationwide recall of some blood pressure medications after detecting trace amounts of a chemical linked to cancer. The recalled products all contain valsartan, which is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Mylan said in an announcement posted on the the u.s. Food and drug administration's website that the drugs -- which were sold in the u.s. Between march 2017 and november 2018 -- show trace amounts of the chemical n-nitrosodiethylamine ( ndea ). The international agency for research on cancer classifies ndea as a probable human carcinogen.

        "summary": "Despite warnings from groups like the american academy of pediatrics and the national institute of health, infant deaths related to padded crib bumpers may have tripled in recent years, stat reports. A study published tuesday in the journal of pediatrics used data from the consumer product safety commission to identify 23 bumper-related deaths between 2006 and 2012. That's up from an average of eight during every previous seven-year period starting in 1985, according to reuters. And it could still be a massive underreporting. \" despite this nationwide publicity … deaths have not decreased, likely because bumpers remain widely available in the marketplace, media articles commonly show cribs with bumpers, and parents often believe bumpers are necessary for comfort and safety, \" reuters quotes the study. Stat reports the padded crib bumpers intended to keep babies safe can actually cover their noses and mouths, leading to suffocation. And reuters notes the american academy of pediatrics has found no proof they actually work. According to the study, it's not clear whether bumper-related deaths are actually increasing or just being reported more. Regardless, the study's authors hope their research will lead to a bumper ban. \"until we get them off of all the store shelves, we're going to keep seeing these deaths, \" a child-safety advocate tells stat. Bumpers are currently banned in maryland and chicago, and some target and ikea stores have stopped selling them. Bumper manufacturers maintain their product is safe as long as instructions are followed.",

            "( reuters health ) - infant deaths attributed to crib bumpers may be increasing despite media coverage of the risks and industry regulation, according to a new analysis. Three times as many children died in crib bumper-related deaths between 2006 and 2012 as in the three previous seven-year time periods, researchers report in the journal of pediatrics. \" i don't know if it's that people are more aware and they're reporting more, but it could be an actual increase, \" said senior author dr. Bradley thach, of washington university in st. Louis, missouri. Crib bumpers are pillow-like walls installed around the inside of cribs to protect babies from bumping into hard bars or getting limbs caught. However, the american academy of pediatrics ( aap ) says there is no proof that bumpers work, but they do pose a risk of suffocation, strangulation or entrapment. For the new study, thach and his colleagues analyzed data from the u.s. Consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) on bumper-related deaths, injuries and accidents. They identified 48 deaths by suffocation related to crib bumpers between 1985 and 2012. On average, infants were about five months old when they died, but ages ranged from one to 22 months. \" they get their face pressed into the bumper and then they don't get adequate oxygen, \" thach",
            "Padded bumpers offered as safety features in baby cribs are to blame for a rising number of infant deaths, according to findings reported tuesday in the journal of pediatrics. \"when a baby's nose and mouth are covered by a bumper, they can suffocate from their airway being blocked or from breathing oxygen-depleted air, \" said the report's lead author, nj scheers. Now retired, scheers is the former manager of the infant suffocation project at the federal consumer products safety commission ( cpsc ). Various groups, including the american academy of pediatrics, the canadian pediatric society, and the national institutes of health, have recommended against the use of bumpers since a 2007 study highlighted the risks. But pediatricians ' warnings don't appear to be diminishing the products ' usage. Scheers and colleagues analyzed bumper-related deaths in cpsc databases and found that from 2006-2012, crib bumpers were responsible for 23 deaths, nearly as many as were seen over the two decades prior to 2006. Scheers said she hopes the research will lead to a cpsc ban. Currently the action is voluntary: some ikea and target stores have stopped selling the bumpers in recent years.

Items include \" eliminate the estate tax, \" \" hire 5,000 more border patrol agents, \" and \" suspend the syrian refugee program. \" there is one interesting item, however: \" cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. \" president trump's executive order to withhold funding from sanctuary cities is currently being argued in federal court, with justice department lawyers arguing the order would only really keep a small amount of funding from sanctuary cities.

Lawmakers called for an aggressive and wide-ranging response to the crisis at an event yesterday where the report was released, pennlive notes. Speakers echoed the report's recommendations by calling for moves including a statewide prescription drug database, a \" good samaritan \" law to ensure people who seek help for overdose victims won't be prosecuted, and tougher penalties for dealers whose customers die of overdoses.

            "Harrisburg pa. ( reuters ) - young people in rural pennsylvania can buy heroin more easily than a bottle of wine and getting high with the opiate can be cheaper than buying a six pack of beer, according to an investigative report released on tuesday. Overdose deaths have climbed steadily since 1990, when drug deaths in rural areas of the state were at one per 100,000 population. As of 2011, that figure stood at 13 deaths per 100,000, the center for rural pennsylvania said in the report. \" heroin is cheaper and easier for young people to obtain than alcohol, \" said state senator gene yaw, the republican chairman of the center, a joint legislative state agency. Pennsylvania is not alone in its heroin problem. In rural vermont, governor peter shumlin said his state was experiencing a \" full-blown heroin crisis, \" while the overdose rate in new york city has surged as well, especially in the wealthiest neighborhoods. In pennsylvania, yaw said a small packet of heroin costs between $ 5 and $ 10 and delivers a high lasting four to five hours. The report, based on evidence submitted in hearings across the state this summer, listed cambria county in central pennsylvania as having the highest overdose death rate outside of philadelphia, 22.6 deaths per 100,000 population. That is equal to philadelphia's drug death rate",
            "Heroin is cheaper and easier to get than beer in pennsylvania, and the people selling it use sophisticated methods on par with the biggest retailers.

            "Harrisburg pa. ( reuters ) - young people in rural pennsylvania can buy heroin more easily than a bottle of wine and getting high with the opiate can be cheaper than buying a six pack of beer, according to an investigative report released on tuesday. Overdose deaths have climbed steadily since 1990, when drug deaths in rural areas of the state were at one per 100,000 population. As of 2011, that figure stood at 13 deaths per 100,000, the center for rural pennsylvania said in the report. \" heroin is cheaper and easier for young people to obtain than alcohol, \" said state senator gene yaw, the republican chairman of the center, a joint legislative state agency. Pennsylvania is not alone in its heroin problem. In rural vermont, governor peter shumlin said his state was experiencing a \" full-blown heroin crisis, \" while the overdose rate in new york city has surged as well, especially in the wealthiest neighborhoods. In pennsylvania, yaw said a small packet of heroin costs between $ 5 and $ 10 and delivers a high lasting four to five hours. The report, based on evidence submitted in hearings across the state this summer, listed cambria county in central pennsylvania as having the highest overdose death rate outside of philadelphia, 22.6 deaths per 100,000 population. That is equal to philadelphia's drug death rate",

But the tsarnaev brothers \" are quite literally caucasian, as in from the caucuses, \" writes joan walsh on salon. Plus, the us census bureau considers americans of chechen or russian descent to be white, and one of the brothers was a naturalized american citizen. So why don't right-wingers consider them to be white? walsh considers a few possibilities: america has a history of \" sorting white from non-white. \" many european immigrants \" became \" white as time went on, society became more accepting, and decidedly \" non-white \" people started arriving. \" embracing racism and xenophobia, sadly, could be a shortcut to white status for previously non-white european immigrants. \" of course, it could boil down to the simple fact that the tsarnaevs are muslim, immigrants, or simply that \" they're ' bad, ' and whiteness must be surrendered when white people are bad, \" walsh writes. But, walsh points out, the brothers actually have more in common with other mass murderers than they do with al-qaeda terrorists. By insisting they're not white, conservatives are simply proving the original salon columnist's point: white american murderers basically escape scapegoating and racial profiling, but with the tsarnaevs being viewed as non-white, you can expect \" a destructive new wave of...

We still know comparatively little about the tsarnaev brothers, but they seem to have more in common with other american mass murderers than with al-qaida terrorists of any race and ethnicity.

Most players who celebrate a game-saving interception or a pick-six come out the other end just fine, but there are the select few who celebrate so hard, their acls give out.

While it doesn't dispute the link between mental illness and a parasite carried in cat feces, known as toxoplasma gondii, the psychological medicine study does suggest previous studies linking cat ownership and psychosis failed to consider factors like household over-crowding and socioeconomic status. Researchers followed 5,000 children from birth to age 18, gathering health data as well as information on whether they grew up with a cat or even whether their mother lived with a cat while pregnant, per the conversation.

Chambers, who had been doused in gasoline, was still alive when rescue workers found her and was able to speak a few words, but she died in a hospital within hours. Tellis went to high school with chambers and sources tell wreg that he had an on-and-off relationship with her. Tellis — who has served time in prison for burglary and finished his most recent sentence in october 2014 — is in the ouachita parish jail in monroe, la., on charges related to the killing of meing-chen hsiao, an exchange student from taiwan, in august. Police say he used an atm card belonging to the 34-year-old, who was stabbed to death in her apartment. He hasn't been charged with murder in that case, though sources say he is a suspect. \" god knows i've been waiting a long time for this, \" jessica's father, ben chambers, tells wtvm. \" nothing will bring jessica back, but at least i ' ll know he will never do this to somebody else's daughter.

            "Goldman sachs group inc. Doubled its lobbying expenses as it focused on proposed financial regulations and faced u.s. Securities and exchange commission charges that it misled investors. New york-based goldman, which paid $ 550 million last week to settle the sec suit, spent $ 2.7 million to lobby during the first six months of 2010, more than double the $ 1.3 million it spent during the same period a year earlier, according to new congressional filings.

The first thing you need to know about goldman sachs is that it's everywhere. The world's most powerful investment bank is a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money. In fact, the history of the recent financial crisis, which doubles as a history of the rapid decline and fall of the suddenly swindled dry american empire, reads like a who's who of goldman sachs graduates.

Around 350 bags of heroin were seized inside three apartments. Two men, ages 57 and 48, have been charged with felony drug possession, and a man and a woman, both 22, have been charged with misdemeanor drug possession, according to the new york post. Police raided the three apartments after a tip from a heroin user who uses the same dealer and claimed to have seen hoffman in his apartment, a source tells tmz. But none of the seized bags of heroin had \" ace of hearts \" or \" ace of spades \" stamps similar to those found in hoffman's apartment after his death, sources say. Tests on the heroin found in the actor's home had no trace of fentanyl, a powerful narcotic sometimes used to cut the drug, a law enforcement official tells cnn. Heroin tainted with fentanyl killed at least 22 people in maryland last month.",

The lawsuit asserts that all of this \" negligence \" led to frey being \" rendered sick, lame, and disabled, \" caused him \" pain [ and ] mental anguish, \" and eventually led to his death. Per billboard, frey's manager gave an interview to the wrap shortly after frey's death and indicated frey's colitis and pneumonia were partly brought on by the meds he'd been taking for more than a decade for his arthritis.

So in a voice-over video message to nasa, the swedish association for sexuality education ( rfsu ) points out that the us has a long history of sending objects into outer space, and then proposes that nasa get to work on launching, well, a condom. The campaign coincides with world contraception day, which was last monday, and should not be a surprising choice given the scandinavian country's reputation for sexual liberty and, as the local reports, advocating for objects to be sent into space. ( last year, swedish brothers launched a doughnut 20 miles high just because no one had ever done it before. ) the rfsu points out that the condom is one of civilization's greatest inventions. In the rfsu's pitch to nasa, which the group posted to youtube, it points out that a condom could prove quite useful if aliens visit our planet and \" find some hot earthlings. \" but even more vital, the group says, the condom is \" so important in letting every human decide about their own body and their own lives. \" in an interview with vice, emma günter at rfsu says they chose this campaign because humor and surprise are some of the most effective ways to communicate important things. \" that's what we want — for contraceptives to be prioritized, politically. \" she goes on to say that she believes in some kind of extraterrestrial life, and while she has \" no idea what it might look like, \" she'd \" love it if they got hold of a condom. \" ( a swedish sex toy company is also trying to revolutionize the condom. )",

Plus, investigators say macchiarini should have never made it past the 2009 recruitment process, with the institute's management showing a \" stunning \" indifference to bad references and \" questionable \" data in some of his publications. The former head of karolinska's ethics committee, who calls this \" the biggest scandal we have ever had in swedish medicine, \" per the washington post, says the nobel panel shouldn't award the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in october for two years and instead give the money to the families of macchiarini's patients.

This time, the whole thing hinges on four words, the new york times editorial board writes. In a subsection, the law says that health care subsidies should come from an exchange \" established by the state. \" but 36 states didn't set up exchanges, prompting the federal government to do so instead. The legal challenge holds that thanks to those four words, people in those 36 states can't receive subsidies. This is a superficial tactic, the times notes. The supreme court has previously said that it \" must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy. \" the case could come down, once again, to john roberts, writes noah feldman at bloombergview. After fellow conservatives slammed his support for the law's individual mandate in 2012, was he \" scarred \" enough to follow their lead this time? or will he reject the challenge and avoid accusations of \" wishy-washiness \"? it ' ll be a \" long six months of speculation \" before we know for sure.

No illegal drugs have been found in the room, but tmz reports that houston was taking xanax, and it is possible that she drowned in her bathtub. Combined with alcohol, xanax can cause extreme sleepiness; the gossip site speculates that houston fell asleep in the tub. Houston was out partying the night before and did not look good, says tmz. She was allegedly at the hotel bar with friends and the group was very \" boisterous. \" reports conflict about houston's condition before her death, with the la times saying she was \" visibly bloated \" and behaving \" erratically, \" while cnn cites a music executive describing her as \" healthy \" and \" happy. \" houston's daughter, bobbi kristina brown, got into a shouting match with police officers outside her mother's hotel room several hours after her death when they would not allow her in to see her mother's body, reports tmz.

The treatment modifies a person's t-cells to target the cancer cells.

The experimental treatment wasn't easy. Mike suffered what abc calls \" severe side effects. \" he got pneumonia and required 20 bone marrow biopsies and half a dozen infusions of stem cells. But it appears to have been worth it. \"prior to starting the therapy, mike's bone marrow was almost completely made up of leukemia cells, \" kate writes on facebook. \"twenty-eight days later there were none. \" kate calls it a \" huge relief \" but says she knows \" we still have quite some distance to go in our journey. \" ( a family decided to let their toddler die of leukemia; it saved him. )",

The main point of his trip didn't directly involve syria — he was there to try to ease tensions with ankara, which blames the us for playing a role in a failed coup attempt last month. But the visit coincided with a us-backed turkish military offensive into syria against the islamic state, and that's where things get complicated. Coverage of the two developments: at a press conference, biden insisted that the us \" had no knowledge beforehand of what was to befall you on july 15, \" referring to the coup attempt. \" turkey has the united states ' unwavering support, \" he added. The wall street journal. But that support does not involve quickly extraditing the man turks blame for the coup, fethullah gulen, a cleric living in pennsylvania. \" we have no, no, no, no interest whatsoever in protecting anyone who has done harm to an ally, but we need to meet legal standard requirement under our law, \" said biden, per usa today. He urged patience; lawyers from the justice department are working with turkish lawyers on the extradition request.

In the end, turkey-backed militants, not the kurds, appeared to have taken control of the town, reports cnn.

        "summary": "More than 1 million people clamor their way through a spartan obstacle race each year. Andy weinberg has moved on to a more extreme kind of challenge. He's the co-founder of spartan but no longer a part of it following a legal battle between him and co-founder joe de sena. What drives a man to create the \" world's largest endurance brand \"? and what does he do next? kevin koczwara answers those questions in a men's health profile. He recounts how a young weinberg battled add by swimming, a practice that ultimately landed him a scholarship to missouri state university. After college, he grew weary of the travel involved in trekking to iron man and other races, so he launched his own in central illinois. He met de sena, and the two were of the same mind: endurance races were light on surprises. So the two came up with the death race, which was the polar opposite. \" you might have to find your clothes in a snowbank after a bikram yoga session... Or work with your fellow racers to build a set of stairs up a mountain, \" writes koczwara. That evolved into the spartan brand, and after weinberg split from it, he created the now-4-year-old and even more challenging endurance society. The events are in some cases secretive and in most cases not for the faint of heart. Witness koczwara's opening anecdote of seeing almost unbelievable photos of weinberg's frostbitten toes ( which \" looked like they were dunked in lava \" ), the result of a 48-hour subzero 20-plus-mile hike over eight adirondack peaks.

        "summary": "In the minutes before his execution by an isis militant in syria, chechen magomed khasiev confessed to being a spy recruited by russian intelligence agency federal security service — something chechen leader ramzan kadyrov quickly denied. But many people who knew the 23-year-old say he \" seemed to live a double life, \" per reuters, with connections to muslim groups as well as russian security. Born yevgeny yudin to a non-muslim family in chechnya, khasiev lived for a time in an orphanage. \" he was soft as a kitten, \" a former orphanage head says. He was later adopted by a chechen family and took the family name, becoming magomed khasiev ( he had earlier given himself the muslim first name ). Sources say he was friends with a cop, associated with non-muslims, and did not appear to be a radical. Others, however, say khasiev was a devout muslim whose best friend at the orphanage, minkail temiev, tried to convince him to fight for islamist militants. When temiev left the orphanage to enroll at an elite military school, friends say khasiev kept in touch. In 2014, khasiev sold his apartment and traveled to the syrian town of kobani on the border with turkey. One report suggested he was caught with illegal drugs in february 2014 and then pressured into spying by the fss, per the telegraph. But a friend who received messages from khasiev says he went to syria to find temiev, who khasiev's adoptive family believed had become radicalized. Khasiev told the friend he found temiev was dead, so he \" simply collected dead bodies \" with other fighters, whom he called \" brothers. \" in his execution video posted dec. 2, khasiev says he passed intelligence on isis to russian authorities through an old acquaintance, an ethnic armenian named grant. A friend of khasiev's says grant worked for the police. Little else about him is known.",

Marc ambinder, atlantic: \" on the small-medium-big scale, obama went medium. Leaving out an explicit call for cap-and-trade was a deliberate choice, obviously. But obama wants action on climate change, and the only way to wean our dependence off fossil fuels is to put a price on carbon. He did not make that explicit.... He did not call upon congress to make the political sacrifices necessary, and it may be difficult to reconcile his words, laced with an urgent tone, with the actions he is willing to put his weight behind. \" ezra klein, washington post: \" the optimistic take, at least for environmentalists, is that this is the language and approach obama uses when he really means to legislate. The pessimistic take is that obama shied away from clearly describing the problem, did not endorse specific legislation, did not set benchmarks, and chose poll-tested language rather than a sharper case that might persuade skeptics. \"",

Every day in june, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 american couples will say \"i do, \" committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn't work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist ty tashiro points out in his book the science of happily ever after, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?"

While psychiatric analysis noted \" paranoid delusions, \" the independent reports kabou was deemed able to stand trial. On monday, she reportedly told the court she killed her daughter because it was \" easier that way. \" per french media, kabou has described the moments leading up to her daughter's alleged abandonment: \" she was looking for my breast, i gave it to her.... I clutched her against me \" and cried. Then, \" i must have left ada at five meters, perhaps two. In any case, she would have drowned straight away.

Reuters puts the death toll at 15. Local officials say the group was wrongly identified as an al-qaeda convoy, but one official tells the ap that al-qaeda fighters were suspected of being among the party. Also unclear: yemeni officials say a us drone fired the missiles, but reuters reports that it's not known whether a yemeni aircraft was responsible for the attack, which left charred bodies and burnt cars on the road. If it's the former, reuters notes in a separate report that the attack may have been counter-productive. \" these ( drone ) strikes create more terrorism, \" says one man whose brother, an innocent civilian according to the yemeni government, was killed in a strike earlier this year after unknowingly riding in a car with suspected al-qaeda members. \" in our area there was never anyone linked to al-qaeda. After the strike, everyone in the area started listening to al-qaeda types, exchanging videos on mobile phones. \" says a us official who served in yemen: \" every drone death yields 50 to 60 new recruits for al-qaeda. \"",

        "summary": "As expected, dennis hastert pleaded guilty wednesday in a convoluted case that involves allegations he sexually abused a student as a high school wrestling coach. What he pleaded to was lying to the fbi about shady bank transfers made in recent years. Prosecutors say hastert was shuffling money around illegally to make payments to an unidentified person, with sources saying they were blackmail payments related to the sex-abuse allegations. The washington post notes the brief hearing neither revealed why hastert agreed to pay $ 3.5 million to \" individual a \" nor who individual a is. As part of the plea deal, federal prosecutors are recommending a prison sentence of up to six months. Hastert will be sentenced feb. 29; the judge has the ability to hand him up to five years. When the judge asked him to describe his wrongdoing in his own words, hastert read from a brief written statement that — like his indictment — focused on how he technically broke banking laws. He told the court that he had been withdrawing cash $ 50,000 at a time. After banking officials questioned him, he began taking out less than $ 10,000 to avoid reporting requirements. Nbc news reports hastert \" illegally structured \" $ 952,000 in total withdrawals; $ 1.7 million in payments were made to individual a, per the indictment. Speaking in a halting voice and losing his place in the text at one point, he described why he lied to the fbi: \" i didn't want them to know how i intended to spend the money. \" the judge asked hastert, \" did you know that what you were doing was wrong? \" he responded, \" yes, sir. \"",

At wdbj in roanoke, where he worked with victims adam ward and alison parker, vester lee flanagan was ordered to get medical help after racking up complaints from colleagues, according to documents seen by the guardian. \" this is a mandatory referral requiring your compliance, \" then-news director dan dennison told him in july 2012, ordering him to speak to employee assistance professionals. \" failure to comply will result in termination of employment. \" the station gave him a final warning just before christmas that year and he was fired three months later. Dennison, who hired flanagan in 2011, tells hawaii news now that when flanagan was fired, he refused to leave the building and they had to call police to escort him out. In court papers from a lawsuit flanagan filed against the station, alleging racial discrimination and sexual harassment for being gay, dennison says that as officers took flanagan from the newsroom, he threw a hat and a wooden cross at him and said, \" you ' ll need this. \" as part of the lawsuit, flanagan accused colleagues of placing a watermelon in a \" strategic location \" and requested a jury made up of african-american women. According to internal memos, when police escorted flanagan from the station, ward videotaped it, reports the huffington post. The memos state that flanagan gave ward the finger and told him to lose his \" big gut. \" dennison says flanagan had many complaints about colleagues, \" largely... Along racial lines, and we did a thorough investigation and could find no evidence that anyone had racially discriminated against this man. \" in 2000, flanagan was fired from florida's wtwc-tv for what the station's former news director says was \" bizarre behavior, \" including threatening colleagues, the ap reports. \" he just had a history of playing the race card, \" a former wtwc anchor tells the daily beast. ( flanagan, who died two hours after shooting himself yesterday, left a 23-page suicide note describing the charleston church shootings as a tipping point. )",

        "summary": "Before he died of a heart condition at age 25, michael keck told his wife that he wanted to donate his brain to boston university. The former football player thought he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( cte ), nbc news reports, the degenerative brain disorder caused by repeated blows to the head that has made headlines in recent years for affecting nfl players. Doctors, performing an autopsy on keck's brain, confirmed his self-diagnosis in a case study published monday in jama neurology. \" it was the worst cte i've seen in an individual this young, \" study coauthor dr. Ann mckee says. Keck's 16-year football career began when he was 6 years old, the study notes. During that time, he sustained more than 10 concussions, the first when he was 8. \" that's a lengthy exposure, \" says mckee. \" brain injury is cumulative. \" as a freshman playing for missouri state, keck momentarily lost consciousness after a hard hit. That was followed by symptoms, such as blurry vision, headaches, and forgetfulness, which forced him to quit playing football his junior year. Previously having a 3.8 gpa, the study notes, keck \" left school with a gpa of 1.9, 12 credits short of earning his bachelor degree. \" symptoms, including \" feelings of worthlessness \" and \" suicidal ideations, \" persisted until his 2013 death of an unrelated congenital heart defect. Some, including the doctor who first identified cte, have called for an end of high-impact sports for kids. Others, though, say the concern is overblown. The medical director for pop warner football tells nbc that the keck study doesn't indicate the brain trauma was the result of childhood injuries. \" it is more likely that the exposure that he got in high school or college, or even doing other activities, led to the accrual of cte changes, \" he says. ( researchers recently found cte in 96 % of 91 deceased nfl players. )",

On saturday, president obama held a three-hour meeting with his national security team on the issue, and cbs news last night shared three notable details by way of sources: there was absolutely no questioning the use of force, obama wants the public to see a declassified report backing a potential military move before that force is used ( cbs says it could be out today or tomorrow ), and the president has ordered the presentation of legal justifications for a strike. Chuck hagel, for his part, tells the bbc that the military is \" ready to go \" and prepped to \" comply with whatever option the president wishes to take. \" a us strike would likely last two days at the most; washington would likely use cruise missiles or long-range bombers aimed at military targets — though not ones directly linked to chemical weapons, the washington post reports.

Meanwhile: the regime says claims it used chemical weapons are \" utterly and completely \" off the mark, and is calling on the us to reveal evidence to the contrary, the guardian notes in a liveblog. \" there is no country in the world that uses a weapon of ultimate destruction against its own people, \" says syria's foreign minister, per the bbc.

But... A security guard came in and told the mother to turn the baby upside down into a bowl of water. The mother begged the guard to spare her, but he kept beating her. So the mother, her hands shaking, put the baby face down in the water. The crying stopped and a bubble rose up as it died. \" she also reported that north korean women were sold to chinese traffickers in the ' 90s. In her telling, one of the few available foods was salted frogs. Shin dong-hyuk, 31, who broke out of a prison camp in 2005, witnessed \" almost monthly public executions. \" a 7-year-old girl's punishment for stealing a bit of wheat? she was clubbed to death.

Sustained blasts from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and anti-aircraft guns rang out in the center of zawiyah, a city on the coastal highway 50 km ( 30 miles ) west of tripoli that the rebels entered this week, in a clash that killed at least two. As they pushed to consolidate control of the city and its strategic oil refinery, rebels in zawiyah's central square exchanged heavy fire with gaddafi forces holed up inside a nearby hospital before driving them out, reuters witnesses said. East of tripoli, opposition forces fought bloody street battles in the city of zlitan but suffered heavy casualties, a reuters reporter there said. A rebel spokesman said 32 rebel fighters were killed, with 150 wounded. Rebel advances have cut off tripoli from its main supply routes, putting gaddafi's four-decade rule under heavy pressure. But gaddafi's information minister, moussa ibrahim, said late on friday the government's military retained the upper hand and scorned what he described as ' bands of insurgents '.

Obama's much-ballyhooed speech in cairo in 2009, intended to begin healing rifts with the muslim world, \" stands now as a monument to america's declining influence in the world, \" he writes. The president has been wishy-washy in his response to the military coup that ousted mohamed morsi, and it turns out that all our money gave us little sway over either the military or the muslim brotherhood while it held power. Nothing \" was more important than getting egypt right, \" writes cohen, but we got it exactly wrong. What to do? at the wall street journal, bret stephens writes that it's time to move beyond finger-wagging and actually establish a policy. \" if the us wants influence, it needs to hold its nose and take a side, \" he writes. And that side is clear: the us should support the military leaders, and hope they win this fight as quickly as possible. The generals \" may not need shiny new f-16s, but riot gear, tear gas, rubber bullets, and taser guns could help, especially to prevent the kind of bloodbaths the world witnessed last week. \" it's not pretty, but it's the best path to restoring normalcy to the egypt.

The peak reached thursday seemed unimaginable in 1997 when apple teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, with its stock trading for less than $ 1.

The stock has been surging this week as anticipation mounts for the next generation of iphone, expected to be released in september. Apple hit the $ 1 trillion mark when its shares reached an all-time high of $ 207.05 around midday in new york. The shares are up 22 percent so far this year.

        "summary": "President trump's firing of james comey was so unexpected that the fbi director initially thought it was a joke, sources tell the new york times. Comey was addressing fbi employees in los angeles when news of his firing flashed on a tv screen, insiders say. He said he thought it was a pretty funny prank — but aides then ushered him into another room. Comey, who flew to washington, dc, tuesday night instead of attending an fbi recruiting event in hollywood as scheduled, \" was caught flat-footed, \" a source tells the los angeles times. In other developments: the abrupt firing puts the future of the fbi's investigation of the trump campaign's alleged links to russia in doubt, with democrats calling for a special prosecutor to continue the probe, the wall street journal reports. Most republicans didn't go that far, though sen. John mccain called for the creation of a special congressional committee. The bbc looks at the letter from deputy attorney general rod rosenstein recommending comey's firing. Rosenstein cites comey's handling of the hillary clinton email investigation, especially his \" usurpation \" of authority in announcing that the probe would be closed without charges. Abc has trump's letter firing comey in full. \" while i greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that i am not under investigation, i nevertheless concur with the judgment of the department of justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau, \" the president writes. Politico spoke to a wide variety of experts about the constitutionality of the move, and received a wide range of answers, with some declaring a constitutional crisis and others saying trump made a completely correct call. Comey's \" mishandling of the clinton investigation and his usurpation of prosecutorial decisions \" would have been enough to get him fired under any administration, according to university of virginia law professor saikrishna prakash. Aaron blake looks at comments trump has made about comey and the clinton investigation in recent weeks and concludes that the president was looking for an excuse to fire the fbi director. By misstating facts about the clinton investigation at a senate hearing, comey gave trump the excuse he needed, blake writes at the washington post. The ap looks at key moments leading up to comey's firing, including his letter to congress tuesday correcting earlier testimony. Axios answers seven questions about the firing, including what happens next: deputy fbi director andrew mccabe will take charge until the senate confirms a replacement. Democratic sen. Bob casey was among those calling the firing \" nixonian, \" though the richard nixon library begged to differ, reports",

        "summary": "Here's a novel idea that could literally shake up the way that millions of people treat constipation: a pill that vibrates when swallowed, rather than delivering medication. The capsule, which is being developed by the israeli company vibrant, is the size of a multivitamin and works by mimicking the peristalsis process that pushes waste through the lower intestine, usa today reports. Researcher yishai ron says it increased the number of weekly bowel movements from two to four in 26 test subjects who took it twice a week for two weeks, nbc news reports. That's good news for chronic constipation sufferers ( which an estimated 15 % of americans are ), as many as 50 % of whom who don't get much relief from laxatives, says ron. Six to eight hours after being swallowed — about the time food would reach the lower part of the digestive system — the vibrant pill begins pulsating three times a minute. The action is controlled by an external base unit but isn't noticeable to the patient; the capsule is eventually expelled in a bowel movement. The pill could be a superior alternative to laxatives, researchers say, because only a few minor side effects were noted — whereas research has shown that laxatives can have serious side effects, particularly if the dose is increased over time, which is often necessary. The brief study doesn't speak to potential long-term effects, though; more extensive trials are planned. ( weird sidebar: elvis ' longtime doctor claims the king died of chronic constipation. )",

The tactic is used to shift prices in the trader's favor, and prosecutors say it tripled coscia's earnings of $ 150,000 a month in 2011, reports reuters. Prosecutors explained how coscia manipulated prices in such markets as soybean meal, british pounds, and coppers, using an algorithm for high-frequency trading, bloomberg reports. \" it's hard to see why he was doing that other than greed, \" said us district judge harry leinenweber in chicago, who sentenced coscia to two years less than prosecutors had sought. The trader plans to appeal the conviction but may still have to report to federal prison by sept. 30. He has already paid a $ 3 million fine. Former prosecutor renato mariotti says that when the case first surfaced, many people thought the government wouldn't be able to prove its case. \" i think that skepticism is gone, \" he says. \" i think any trader who hears this sentence has to be thinking, ' i don't want to go to jail.

            "Chicago ( reuters ) - a u.s. Judge sentenced futures trader michael coscia to three years in prison on wednesday, a lighter punishment than prosecutors had sought for the first person criminally convicted of the manipulative trading practice of spoofing. Coscia also was sentenced to two years of supervised release from jail, in a case that was closely watched by traders who want to avoid similar charges and market regulators. Spoofing involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell futures contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions. Prosecutors had asked u.s. Judge harry leinenweber to lock up coscia, owner of new jersey-based panther energy trading, for as long as seven years and three months after he was convicted last year of spoofing and commodities fraud. Leinenweber told a packed courtroom in chicago that coscia's typical earnings of about $ 150,000 per month tripled while he was spoofing markets in 2011. \"it's hard to see why he was doing that other than greed, \" the judge said.

            "Chicago ( reuters ) - a u.s. Judge sentenced futures trader michael coscia to three years in prison on wednesday, a lighter punishment than prosecutors had sought for the first person criminally convicted of the manipulative trading practice of spoofing. Coscia also was sentenced to two years of supervised release from jail, in a case that was closely watched by traders who want to avoid similar charges and market regulators. Spoofing involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell futures contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution. By creating an illusion of demand, spoofers can influence prices to benefit their market positions. Prosecutors had asked u.s. Judge harry leinenweber to lock up coscia, owner of new jersey-based panther energy trading, for as long as seven years and three months after he was convicted last year of spoofing and commodities fraud. Leinenweber told a packed courtroom in chicago that coscia's typical earnings of about $ 150,000 per month tripled while he was spoofing markets in 2011. \"it's hard to see why he was doing that other than greed, \" the judge said. Coscia, who had denied wrongdoing during his trial, said in short prepared remarks at the sentencing: \"i stand here convicted and shamed because of my actions. \" stephen senderowitz, one of coscia's attorneys, said he would appeal the conviction, partly because the government did not sufficiently show that other traders lost money as a result coscia's actions.
