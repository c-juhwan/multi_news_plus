Propublica reporters have used it to uncover questionable prescriptions of antipsychotics and painkillers; doctors have used it to compare themselves with peers; law enforcement has used it to investigate illicit pain-medication trafficking and fraud; and patients have used it to wisely compare doctors. But engelberg is seeing the dark side at a time when the cdc says opioid painkillers are creating an addiction crisis, nbc news reports. Propublica's solution? for now, it's warning surfers of the database about addiction crisis and linking to cdc advice on using opioids to relieve pain.",

The next vote is expected to be on the 2015 version of an obamacare repeal bill, which is expected to fail. A second vote on the gop's better care reconciliation act is also expected to fail. After that, senate republicans plan to hold votes on a series of amendments that would amount to a \" skinny \" repeal of obamacare without a replacement. Here's what else you need to know as the future of american health care is being decided: the new york times explains a \" skinny \" repeal would amount to removing the individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax. While those are the least popular portions of obamacare, getting rid of them could result in increased premiums, fewer people covered under medicaid, and smaller, sicker markets that are unappealing to health insurers. Both republicans and democrats will be able to add amendments during that part of the process. The wall street journal reports that could lead to some uncomfortable votes in a situation with \" few recent precedents. \" vice president pence cast the tie-breaking vote tuesday. It's the fourth such vote pence has cast in his first year as vice president, which puts him in the middle of the pack for the office but nowhere near john adams ' 29 tie-breaking votes in his first year, according to fivethirtyeight. \" we can now deliver grt healthcare to all americans! \" president trump tweeted following tuesday's vote.

Speaking of mccain, he received a standing ovation from fellow senators upon his return tuesday, usa today reports. He also criticized the gop health care bill and the process currently underway during a speech following his \" yes \" vote. He says he won't vote for the bill as it stands and that the senate should start over with actual hearings and input from democrats. He encouraged senators to \" stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths \" who decry compromise: \" to hell with them! \"",

Sessions has previously said the decrees \" diminish [ officer ] effectiveness \" and may lead to a rise in violence. But an official who oversaw investigations into 23 police departments tells the washington post that sessions ' move is \" terrifying \" and suggests the doj might not care if officers violate the constitution. The doj has since asked a judge to delay a hearing on a decree in baltimore so it can check that it matches the \" directives of the president and the attorney general. \" but a negotiator says the agreement — which followed the death of freddie gray in police custody and ordered new training for officers — was backed by the baltimore police commissioner.

Richardson hacked a remote control, making it possible to automatically mute the tv whenever a certain word — in this example, \" snooki \" — appears in the closed captioning. The best part? the remote can be programmed to automatically ignore anyone you deem distasteful, be it snooki, donald trump, or kim kardashian, cnn reports. Richardson's hack, which he will debut this weekend at new york's maker faire, automatically mutes the tv for 30 seconds every time the offending word appears — and continues to do so as long as the word keeps popping up. Of course, it's not a perfect system, as closed captioning isn't always real-time — but the first time richardson got it to work, he experienced \"silent bliss for that 30 seconds i didn't have to hear about kim kardashian. \" he has no plans to commercialize the remote, which cost about $ 70 and took about a week to make, but you can check out the code he posted here.",

The participating countries called off what was to be last year's g8 summit in russia in protest of the country's annexation of crimea. This year's host, german chancellor angela merkel, previously said russia's return is \" unimaginable \" unless a ceasefire and peace plan can be solidified, usa today reports. As canada's stephen harper put it to the ap, \" i don't think russia under vladimir putin belongs in the g7. Period. \" a guide to what's planned for this 41st summit and what the guardian describes as its 26 hours: merkel plans to pursue an \" ambitious agenda \" that the guardian reports was hashed out over 18 months; topics include trade deals, health emergencies like ebola, ukraine, female empowerment, marine pollution, and world hunger, report the ap and guardian. Leaders from iraq, nigeria, and tunisia will serve as guest speakers, describing their domestic experiences with terrorism. But merkel's main focus is climate change. Germany and france are expected to push for a commitment to zero carbon emissions as a long-term goal, but \" there is not yet agreement, \" merkel says; canada and japan will likely be the toughest to convince, with the us somewhere in the middle of the spectrum on the issue. Reuters reports obama has an agenda item of his own: pushing eu leaders to keep up sanctions against russia. In what the ap calls the \" biggest operation in their history, \" bavarian police say 17,000 officers and 30 helicopters are at the ready in case of protests. The guardian reports many germans are displeased at the summit's price tag — roughly $ 220 million — which is largely covered by taxpayers, as well as its \" elitist \" nature ( the paper points to the absence of china and india ). Barack obama won't be arriving alone: his entourage will be 2,000-strong.",

        "summary": "Officials in baghdad are increasingly worried that the iraqi army is simply incapable of standing up to the islamic state of iraq and syria, which is both better armed and better trained, diplomats and politicians tell the bbc. And the militants provided plenty of evidence for that as their campaign rolled on today, capturing their fourth town in two days. Rutba in anbar province lies on a key road between baghdad and jordan. Yesterday, they took two other towns along the euphrates river. In other developments: yesterday also saw the rebels seize a border crossing into syria, the wall street journal reports, giving them a potentially strategically crucial pipeline between their two staging grounds. But the corresponding checkpoint on the other side of the border is under the control of the al-qaeda-affiliated al-nusra front, which is fighting isis for control of it — unlike the iraqi army, which simply fled its checkpoint. Iraq's government fired off an airstrike in tikrit that it said killed 40 militants. But witnesses say many civilians were killed as the strike hit a gas station. Shiite volunteers are coming out of the woodwork in baghdad, thanks to grand ayatollah ali al-sistani's call to arms, the new york times reports. Muqtada al-sadr's mahdi army put on a particularly strong paramilitary display in sadr city yesterday. \" isis is not as strong as a finger against us, \" one mahdi fighter said. \" if muqtada gives us the order, we will finish isis in two days. \" but isis is gaining wealth and weapons with every target it takes. Even before it took over mosul outright its extortion rackets there were generating $ 8 million a month, and now those rackets have transformed into \" taxes. \" \" we don't know the exact amount of money they stole from mosul, \" one member of iraq's parliament says. \" but it is big, big enough that isis can use it to occupy other countries too. \" the militants are also pulling in donations from places like saudi arabia, thanks in part to their social media savvy. When they captured five american-made helicopters recently, for example, they cheekily tweeted, \" we ' ll expect the americans to honor the warranty and service them for us. \"",

Chanting \"one, two, three, mahdi! \" they implored their leader, the cleric moktada",
            "A member of the board of governors of the central bank of iraq was reluctant to specify how much isis got away with in mosul, but estimated that it at least $ 85 million and possibly much more. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case. \"isis gets some money from outside donors, but that pales in comparison to their self-funding, \" said an american counterterrorism official. \"the overwhelming majority of its money comes from criminal activities like extortion, kidnapping, robberies and smuggling. In mosul, isis has probably been hauling in several million dollars monthly just from its extortion racket.

        "summary": "We may have no one but ourselves — in part — to blame for the heavy rains and floods that have been plaguing everywhere from nashville to australia in recent years. Prior studies discovered that the likelihood of experiencing severe precipitation on a given day jumped 7 % over the years 1951 to 1999, and a new study, based on elaborate computer modeling, has found that the increase cannot be attributed to natural variability. The computers found that the bump only made sense when mankind's effects on the atmosphere, by way of activities like the burning of fossil fuels, were factored in. A second study, also published in nature, looked at major flooding in england and wales during 2000. Using more computer simulations, researchers compared the events of that year to a hypothetical year that existed in a world that saw no industrial revolution and the release of few greenhouse gases. The result? the gases basically doubled the chances of those floods occurring. The new york times notes that the studies are unlikely to change the minds of climate-change contrarians, who feel computer simulations can't capture the full complexity of the real world.",

        "summary": "In 1971, the middle class made up 61 % of the us population. That figure has now plummeted to just below half, and analysts are worried about the breakdown of what the los angeles times calls \" a pillar of the us economy. \" a pew research center report released wednesday culled data from the census bureau, labor department, and federal reserve to determine that 120.8 american adults are in middle-class households, while 121.3 million are in the lower- or upper-class tiers. Pew defined middle class as any household making two-thirds to twice the overall median income; for a family of three, that range is $ 42,000 to $ 126,000. What's led to what pew calls a \" thinning in the middle and bulking up at the edges \": more low-skilled immigrants to bolster the lower class, and more women in the workforce and increased college enrollment on the upper end. All of the tiers suffered during and after the great recession, but the middle class saw the financial gains it had reaped over the last quarter-century virtually wiped out: the median wealth of a middle-class household in 1983 was $ 95,879, a number that rose to $ 161,050 by 2007. But after the recession, median wealth for this group was back down to $ 98,000 in 2010 and remained at that number until at least 2013, the pew report notes. A recent gallup poll also shows that people's perceptions are in line with what the pew report shows: in 2008, 63 % of americans identified as being part of the middle class, while the poll given this spring shows that number has dropped to 51 %.

He asked the colleague to inspect his own pot and, voila, turns out it was made around 1900 bc in the indus valley civilization in what is now afghanistan. \" i feel a bit guilty about keeping my toothbrush in it now, \" says martin in a news release from hansons. The pot features the image of an antelope, and the style is consistent with indus valley work, according to the chief of antiquities at hansons. The piece recently sold at auction, and while martin won't get rich on the $ 102 it fetched, it's still not a bad return on his investment. ( this piece of pottery is twice as old, and it suggests that those who made it enjoyed their wine. )",

What's unusual here is that the transplant was necessitated by the uk patient's extreme fear of needles — the first time that's happened anywhere in the world, the bbc reports. Sue york, 55, has had type 1 diabetes since she was 7, but her needle phobia had made dealing with her disease a living hell. Before the transplant, it would often take york up to 20 minutes to inject herself with insulin, an \" impossible \" process that would typically leave her shaking and vomiting, she tells the bbc's victoria derbyshire program. Things only got worse in 2012, when the uk's dmv required diabetic drivers to check their blood sugar levels every time before driving, as well as every two hours once behind the wheel. \" it was just … too many invasions into the flesh, \" york says. Diabetes.co.uk notes that there can be varying reasons for such needle fright, including childhood trauma of some sort, and that it can become a permanent fear. In york's case, she tried different types of therapy to get over her phobia, but ultimately she decided to fight to get on the transplant list — an effort that took more than two years and several panel appearances to justify. She received the transplant at the manchester royal infirmary and now say she feels \" incredible, \" while doctors assert the surgery has doubled her life expectancy. \" no longer am i struggling to walk up a flight of stairs, \" she tells the bbc. \" no longer is my skin yellow or grey.

They say that at the time of murphy's death, meth and cocaine in the la area were frequently mixed with rat poison and other toxins — meaning murphy may have accidentally exposed herself to the chemicals found in her hair, blood, and tissue. But as vanity fair points out, there's no evidence illegal drugs played a role in her death. And then there's the fact that those findings may not even be valid: the world health organization itself has weighed in to act as the voice of reason, abc news reports. \" hair is not... A reliable material for the determination of exposure to many chemicals because it is prone to contamination from the external environment, \" explains a who scientist; a forensic pathologist who spoke to page six says the same. Other toxicologists also dismissed the findings; one points out that murphy did not have lines across her fingernails when she died, which is a key sign of heavy metal poisoning.",

        "summary": "We humans can be a superstitious lot, and scientists are revealing yet another example of the extremes we ' ll go to in the fight to keep evil and danger at bay. In this case, experts report in the journal of archaeological science: reports that human bones excavated in 1963 and 1964 from the much-studied medieval english village wharram percy in north yorkshire had been chopped, broken, and burned post-mortem. In their study, the researchers note that textual accounts of revenants — that is, \" a re-animated corpse that arises from its grave \" — in england date back to the 11th century, and they conclude the mutilation was likely done in an attempt to \" lay revenant corpses. \" it would be the first such evidence of the practice in england. Researchers reached this conclusion after studying 137 bones from 10 people ( between the ages of 2 and 50 ) who'd been dismembered and decapitated between the 11th and 14th centuries. They say the revenant-corpse evidence is stronger than that of a competing theory: survival cannibalism. The bbc reports the cut marks were in the wrong places for butchery ( not near large joints, for instance ) and differed from those made on animals consumed at wharram percy. Scientists also seemingly disproved another theory, that the remains were those of foreigners whom the villagers feared. The guardian reports an isotopic analysis of their teeth indicated they were of the area. \" it shows us a dark side of medieval beliefs and provides a graphic reminder of how different the medieval view of the world was from our own, \" says lead researcher simon mays.

Cops suspect foul play in the death of the mom of three, who'd been with the navy for nearly two decades. One clue pointing to possible turmoil: a protective order granted to washington by a duval county judge just a couple of weeks ago due to domestic violence in the home. In the order issued sept. 4, a man who lives with washington — news4jax identifies him as her boyfriend — was accused by washington of an incident in which the man chased her, shoved her to the ground, kicked her in the stomach, and threatened her with a gun. Washington had said he turned violent when she asked him to contribute his share of the household bills. Also noted in court documents were allegations that the man had wrecked her ipad, caused damage in her bedroom, and swiped the keys to her car and mailbox. Washington had been set to appear in court regarding the order of protection on the day she was found dead. \" if you're dealing with something, somebody should know, \" the longtime friend who'd bought the hennessy for her tells wtlv. \" i hope justice prevails. \"",

Some highlights from the jay leno interview, which politico sees as part of the president's push to \" get back to being barack obama again \" and stop being the butt of late-night jokes: on the global travel warning for us citizens: \" the general rule is show some common sense and some caution, \" obama said, praising the reactions of americans who went about life as usual after the boston marathon bombing. \" terrorists depend on the idea that we're going to be terrorized, \" he said. On trayvon martin: \" all of us were troubled by what happened, and any of us who are parents can imagine the heartache that those parents went through, \" obama said after leno praised his \" eloquent \" remarks after george zimmerman's acquittal. \" it doesn't mean that trayvon was a perfect kid, none of us were, \" obama said, adding that the issue of having a fair justice system for everybody is a \" particularly sensitive topic for the african-american community. \" on russia's anti-gay laws and the sochi olympics: \" i think putin and russia have a big stake in making sure that the olympics work, \" the president said, \" and i think that they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the olympics we wouldn't tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently. \" on nsa surveillance and edward snowden: \" we don't have a domestic spying program, \" claimed obama, calling the controversial nsa programs \" mechanisms that can track a phone number or an email address that is connected to a terrorist attack. \" he confirmed that he would attend the g20 summit in st. Petersburg and that the us-russia relationship is intact, despite disappointment with moscow's decision to grant asylum to snowden. There is \" still a lot of business that we can do with them, but there are times when they slip back into cold war thinking, \" he said. The interview had a few lighter moments, including discussion of obama's recent lunch with hillary clinton, nbc notes. Asked whether clinton was measuring the oval office for drapes, obama quipped, \" keep in mind she's been there. She doesn't have to measure them. \"",

The clean power plan imposes tough limits on power plant emissions and dozens of corporations are preparing to fight what they call a \" war on coal, \" as well as up to 25 states, reports the new york times. The measure will give each state an emission-cutting target to meet, with a goal of cutting power-plant emissions by around a third by 2030, but several governors have already said they plan to simply ignore the limit, setting up legal battles expected to end up before the supreme court, the bbc reports. The court blocked an emissions-limiting plan in june. The environmental protection agency, however, sounds as if it is ready for the fight. ' we certainly know how to defend against lawsuits, for crying out loud, \" epa administrator gina mccarthy said last month when she was asked about looming challenges to the plan. An administration insider tells the washington post that mccarthy was under a lot of pressure to create a legally solid rule — especially after the supreme court defeat. \" she recognized the amount of scrutiny this rule will be under, both politically and legally, \" the source says. \"she has been leading the charge to ensure that it is airtight, that all the legal t's are crossed and i's dotted, and that it adheres strictly to the clean air act. \"",

In rosehill's crematorium, each body is burned in a brick-lined chamber that's heated to 1,200 degrees; a second chamber then burns off the gas and particulates before it all goes into the atmosphere.

        "summary": "There has long been a slight problem with the declaration of the hanging gardens of babylon as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world — there was no proof it actually existed. Now, an oxford university researcher says she's tracked down evidence the garden did indeed grow in what is now iraq, just some 300 miles north of where legend placed it. Stephanie dalley spent roughly two decades pinpointing its location, which she has ided as being located 300 miles from babylon in nineveh, and built by an entirely different king — an enemy one at that, reports the guardian. Though the story went that babylonia's king nebuchadnezzar constructed the gardens to appease his homesick wife, dalley asserts that it was instead assyria's king sennacherib behind them. Using her expertise in the region's ancient language, dalley translated a number of babylonian, assyrian, greek, and roman texts, and found what the independent describes as \" four key pieces of evidence. \" among them: indications that nineveh may have been seen as a \" new babylon \" after the assyrians conquered the babylonians in 689 bc, studies of the topography near the respective locations, and signs that the historians who wrote about the gardens a few centuries later actually visited locations near nineveh. The guardian also reports that, by dalley's translation, a 7th-century bc assyrian inscription that had been woefully deciphered about a century ago revealed nineveh was home to an intricate system of waterways that would have transported water 50 miles to the gardens. Recent digs have uncovered signs these aqueducts existed, notes the guardian, which says the dangerous nature of the area has prevented much exploration of it.",

Stephanie dalley, of oxford university's oriental institute, has finally pieced together enough evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the famed gardens were built in nineveh by the great assyrian ruler sennacherib - and not, as historians have always thought, by king nebuchadnezzar of babylon. Dr. Dalley first publicly proposed her idea that nineveh, not babylon, was the site of the gardens back in 1992, when her claim was reported in the independent – but it's taken a further two decades to find enough evidence to prove it. Detective work by dr. Dalley – due to be published as a book by oxford university press later this month – has yielded four key pieces of evidence. First, after studying later historical descriptions of the hanging gardens, she realized that a bas-relief from sennacherib's palace in nineveh actually portrayed trees growing on a roofed colonnade exactly as described in classical accounts of the gardens. That crucial original bas-relief appears to have been lost in the mid 19 century.

After 18 years of study, stephanie dalley of oxford university has concluded that the garden was built by the assyrians in the north of mesopotamia – in modern iraq – rather than by their great enemies the babylonians in the south.

            "President barack obama and israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu headed into a white house meeting tuesday with the same goal: trying to move the israelis and palestinians to resume face-to-face peace talks. It comes after a rocky white house meeting between obama and netanyahu in march after israel's surprise announcement of plans for new construction in east jerusalem as vice president joe biden was in israel and preparing for dinner with the prime minister. Netanyahu on sunday endorsed the u.s. Call for direct talks between the israelis and palestinians, just days after white house officials said obama would push during the oval office session for those negotiations to get under way sooner rather than later. Addressing his cabinet on sunday, netanyahu said the \" time has come \" for palestinian president mahmoud abbas to get ready to meet with the israelis \" because there is no other way to advance peace. I hope this will be one of the results of the visit to washington. \" aides to obama sounded a hopeful tone late last week, telling reporters that weeks of shuttle diplomacy between the two sides by george mitchell, obama's special envoy to the middle east, had paid off and \" the gaps have narrowed. \" \" we believe there are opportunities to further narrow those gaps, to allow the sides to take that next step to direct talks, \" added",
            "The result is a surprising juxtaposition: as the american government seeks to end the four-decade jewish settlement enterprise and foster a palestinian state in the west bank, the american treasury helps sustain the settlements through tax breaks on donations to support them. A new york times examination of public records in the united states and israel identified at least 40 american groups that have collected more than $ 200 million in tax-deductible gifts for jewish settlement in the west bank and east jerusalem over the last decade. The money goes mostly to schools, synagogues, recreation centers and the like, legitimate expenditures under the tax law. But it has also paid for more legally questionable commodities: housing as well as guard dogs, bulletproof vests, rifle scopes and vehicles to secure outposts deep in occupied areas.

But researchers at the oregon health and science university did just that to study how alcohol affects the birds ' ability to sing — and to learn more about how it affects the human brain, smithsonian reports. Birds are a great case study for how people use language, and zebra finches in particular are well suited, adds new scientist. Each male zebra finch has a signature tune, which helps them in the mating game. \" we just showed up in the morning and mixed a little bit of juice with 6 % alcohol, and put it in their water bottles … they seem( ed ) to tolerate it pretty well and be somewhat willing to consume it, \" researcher christopher olson tells npr. Researchers found the birds loved to sing while drunk — at a bac of.05 % to.08 % — but didn't do so well. Their songs were \" slurred, quieter... And disorganized, \" adds smithsonian. Olson calls it their \" husky bar voice. \" what most interested researchers was the effect alcohol had on adolescent birds. Month-old birds got 3 % ethanol in their water bottles for 90 days and researchers immediately saw the effects. Zebra finches tend to test out different tunes before settling on their own, but birds who drank gave up after only 55 days of trying and opted for a simple tune, new scientist adds. Researchers think alcohol damaged their brains ' ability to learn. And the effect was permanent — adult birds can't learn new songs. Researchers say this could reveal the effect of binge drinking on teenagers. ( songbirds can tell when a tornado is coming. )",

Reviews from visitors who got a preview of the animatronic trump on monday were mixed, with those who voted for the flesh-and-blood trump most impressed by the robotic version.

        "summary": "A highly volatile fuel known to the russians as the \" devil's venom \" has been powering the success of north korea's missile program, analysts say — and it may be too late to cut off its supply. Intelligence memos from as far back as the george w. Bush administration warn that unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine, or umdh, could allow north korean missiles to reach the us, but there was no serious effort to cut off the supply from china or russia and officials believe the country can now produce the fuel itself, the new york times reports. Russia has tried to avoid the potent fuel since a 1960 explosion killed more than 100 people in the worst-ever space-related disaster, and nasa switched to safer propellants decades ago. The rare fuel — which is made from chemicals, not oil — has caused other disasters and vann h. Van diepen, a former state department official who long worked to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, tells the times that pyongyang probably dealt with a few catastrophes in the process of learning to make umdh over the last 25 years. \" my guess is that the north korean tolerance for casualties is probably pretty high, \" he says. The fuel and its ingredients are not included in the sanctions whose effect president trump boasted about on sunday. In a tweet, he called kim jong un \" rocket man \" and spoke of \" long gas lines forming in north korea. \" ( kim says his country is nearing military \" equilibrium \" with the us. )",

            "When north korea launched long-range missiles this summer, and again on friday, demonstrating its ability to strike guam and perhaps the united states mainland, it powered the weapons with a rare, potent rocket fuel that american intelligence agencies believe initially came from china and russia. The united states government is scrambling to determine whether those two countries are still providing the ingredients for the highly volatile fuel and, if so, whether north korea's supply can be interrupted, either through sanctions or sabotage. Among those who study the issue, there is a growing belief that the united states should focus on the fuel, either to halt it, if possible, or to take advantage of its volatile properties to slow the north's program. But it may well be too late. Intelligence officials believe that the north's program has advanced to the point where it is no longer as reliant on outside suppliers, and that it may itself be making the potent fuel, known as udmh. Despite a long record of intelligence warnings that the north was acquiring both forceful missile engines and the fuel to power them, there is no evidence that washington has ever moved with urgency to cut off pyongyang's access to the rare propellant. Classified memos from both the george w. Bush and obama administrations laid out, with what turned out to be prescient clarity, how the north's pursuit of the highly potent fuel would enable it to develop missiles that could strike almost anywhere in the continental united states.",

            "When north korea launched long-range missiles this summer, and again on friday, demonstrating its ability to strike guam and perhaps the united states mainland, it powered the weapons with a rare, potent rocket fuel that american intelligence agencies believe initially came from china and russia. The united states government is scrambling to determine whether those two countries are still providing the ingredients for the highly volatile fuel and, if so, whether north korea's supply can be interrupted, either through sanctions or sabotage. Among those who study the issue, there is a growing belief that the united states should focus on the fuel, either to halt it, if possible, or to take advantage of its volatile properties to slow the north's program. But it may well be too late. Intelligence officials believe that the north's program has advanced to the point where it is no longer as reliant on outside suppliers, and that it may itself be making the potent fuel, known as udmh. Despite a long record of intelligence warnings that the north was acquiring both forceful missile engines and the fuel to power them, there is no evidence that washington has ever moved with urgency to cut off pyongyang's access to the rare propellant. Classified memos from both the george w. Bush and obama administrations laid out, with what turned out to be prescient clarity, how the north's pursuit of the highly potent fuel would enable it to develop missiles that could strike almost anywhere in the continental united states.",

That's according to the european court of justice, which was asked to rule on a case involving spreadable dutch cheeses.

The court wasn't having it, however, ruling that taste doesn't fit the definition of a copyrighted work: an intellectual creation \" identifiable with sufficient precision and objectivity. \" taste is \" subjective and variable, \" therefore it can't be protected, the court said. \" it's a discrimination of senses that something you can taste with your mouth is not protectable by copyright, \" says heks ' nkaas ceo michel wildenborg. The court disagreed. Taste depends on \" factors particular to the person tasting the product concerned, such as age, food preferences and consumption habits, as well as on the environment or context in which the product is consumed, \" it declared.

        "summary": "Firstborns really do have an advantage, a new uk study suggests. Research out of edinburgh university finds that there's a measurable iq difference between firstborns and their siblings, and it shows up as early as age 1, reports the bbc. The reason? parents tend to spend more time with their first children on games and tasks that develop thinking skills, such as reading and playing musical instruments, say the researchers. As later kids come along, parents get more strapped for time. \" it doesn't mean firstborns get more love — that stays the same, \" says researcher ana nuevo-chiquero, per the edinburgh news. \" but they get more attention — especially in those important formative years. \" the researchers examined data on 5,000 kids from pre-birth to age 14 in the us children of the national longitudinal survey of youth, and correlated that with parental behavior. The kids were assessed every two years on a variety of skills, with firstborns generally outperforming siblings starting at 12 months. The edge increased slightly with age, and the scientists say that meshes with studies suggesting that firstborns end up in better-paying jobs as adults. Not only did parents spend less time with their subsequent kids, but the mothers even took higher risks during pregnancy, like smoking, they report in the journal of human resources.

Expect the campaigns to set up shop in ohio, a state without which, the washington post points out, no republican president has ever been elected. Super pacs backing mitt romney, rick santorum, and newt gingrich are all already airing ads in the buckeye state. Santorum visited yesterday, and romney will hit toledo and columbus today. Romney has had a team in ohio for months, and has the backing of the majority of the state's major politicians, real clear politics reports. But given his blue collar shtick, santorum can ill afford to lose two midwestern states in a row, abc observes, and it doesn't look like he will. A recent university of cincinnati poll has him 11 points ahead of romney in the state. That's close to nate silver's projections, which currently show romney behind in georgia, oklahoma, and tennessee as well.",

What they stumbled across, 400 feet below the surface: the remains of the royal albert schooner, which sank nearly 150 years ago after leaving oswego, ny, for toledo, ohio, the democrat and chronicle reports. Jim kennard, 73, tells the toronto star he was going back and forth in a certain area of the lake — what he refers to as his \" mowing the lawn \" method — with roger pawlowski and roland stevens when the sonar picked up the schooner. \" we saw two masts lying on either side of the ship, \" he tells the democrat &amp; chronicle. Because kennard had an extensive database of shipwrecks — he's helped track down more than 200 shipwrecks since the ' 70s — and an idea of the royal albert's size and shape, they were able to id the vessel. A remote-controlled vehicle sent to take pictures and video of the ship offered more evidence of their find. The 104-foot-long schooner, which kennard says sank 15 miles west of oswego, was transporting 285 tons of railroad iron on aug. 10, 1868, when something happened ( some say bad weather ) to make the railroad iron move, causing it to tear a hole in the side of the vessel; kennard tells the ap some of those rails can be seen in video of the ship's hold. The crew safely made it to shore in a small boat. Kennard and his fellow explorers were out on the lake thanks to the national museum of the great lakes, which funds volunteer shipwreck explorers, per the toledo blade. \" our collaboration with jim kennard and his team have produced some of the most important discoveries on lake ontario, \" the museum's director said. As for the royal albert, it will likely stay put, per local and federal shipwreck laws. \" it's essentially an underwater museum of maritime history, \" kennard tells the democrat &amp; chronicle.

New studies suggest the beginnings of life on this planet could have occurred deep underground, the independent reports. Researchers have found microbes up to 3.1 miles below the earth's surface — tiny organisms that are almost exactly the same on opposite sides of the planet. That points to a possible common ancestor about 3.5 billion years ago, which is when earthly life began, the paper explains. Scientists pulled such microbes from fissures in rocks as widespread as north america, japan, europe, south africa, and even, according to red orbit, deep hydrothermal vents in the caribbean. The samples were more than 97 % identical, or practically the same species, according to researcher matt schrenk, who notes that some may \" live as deep as ( 6 miles ) into the earth. \" he adds: \" it is easy to understand how birds or fish might be similar oceans apart, but it challenges the imagination to think of nearly identical microbes ( 10,000 miles ) apart from each other in the cracks of hard rock at extreme depths, pressures, and temperatures. \" ( click for more of the craziest discoveries of the week, including the idea that the universe may actually be...

            "Found up and down the north american coastlines, these marine mammals spend half of their lives swimming. Although they can reach up to six feet in length and weigh around 180 pounds, when on land and in plain sight harbor seals may not be easy to spot. Their spotted brown or tan fur allows harbor seals to blend in with sand and rocks. Unlike their very vocal relatives -- sea lions and elephant seals -- harbor seals are quiet creatures that make little noise. They like to hang out on beaches, sand bars and rocks during low tide to bask in the sun and sleep, but they never go far from the water. At the slightest sign of danger, they will quickly slip back under the waves. These expert swimmers have been known to plunge to depths of more than 1,600 feet and stay underwater up to 28 minutes. Manatees, also known as sea cows, are gentle herbivores that live in marshy areas in tropical and subtropical waters. The average adult manatee can weigh up 1,200 pounds and is around 10 feet long. Because of their slow metabolism, these animals can only survive in warm waters. Due to the unusually long, cold winter this year in part of the southeastern united states, populations of manatees throughout florida were devastated. During the day, manatees usually like to stay close to the surface. At night, manatees will often sleep"

            "Cannabinoid ligands regulate bone mass, but skeletal effects of cannabis ( marijuana and hashish ) have not been reported. Bone fractures are highly prevalent, involving prolonged immobilization and discomfort. Here we report that the major non-psychoactive cannabis constituent, cannabidiol ( cbd ), enhances the biomechanical properties of healing rat mid-femoral fractures. The maximal load and work-to-failure, but not the stiffness, of femurs from rats given a mixture of cbd and δ( 9 ) -tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) for 8 weeks were markedly increased by cbd. This effect is not shared by thc ( the psychoactive component of cannabis ), but thc potentiates the cbd stimulated work-to-failure at 6 weeks postfracture followed by attenuation of the cbd effect at 8 weeks. Using micro-computed tomography ( μct ), the fracture callus size was transiently reduced by either cbd or thc 4 weeks after fracture but reached control level after 6 and 8 weeks. The",
            "Cannabis -- marijuana, hashish -- was used as a go-to medical remedy by societies around the world for centuries. But the therapeutic use of marijuana was banned in most countries in the 1930s and ' 40s due to a growing awareness of the dangers of addiction. The significant medical benefits of marijuana in alleviating symptoms of such diseases as parkinson's, cancer, and multiple sclerosis have only recently been reinvestigated. A new study published in the journal of bone and mineral research by tel aviv university and hebrew university researchers explores another promising new medical application for marijuana. According to the research, the administration of the non-psychotropic component cannabinoid cannabidiol ( cbd ) significantly helps heal bone fractures. The study, conducted on rats with mid-femoral fractures, found that cbd -- even when isolated from tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ), the major psychoactive component of cannabis -- markedly enhanced the healing process of the femora",

But a new study states it's closer to one in 45 following interviews with nearly 12,000 parents in 2014. ( it's an even bigger jump from a one-in-80 estimate that was based on interviews from 2011 to 2013, though researchers blame that dramatic increase on a change in interview methodology. ) experts believe these new numbers are the most accurate estimate. \" we do believe autism is more prevalent, but we have long believed that the one in 68 number is an underestimate, \" the director of public health research at autism speaks says, per cnn. This new estimate is important for two reasons. One, the old estimate of one in 68 already had public health officials worried and resources maxed out, the washington post reports. It now falls to the country to figure out how to help an increasing number of kids with autism. Second, it fuels the debate about what's causing the steady increase over the past decade. According to live science, some researchers believe the jump is due to the increasing awareness and lessening stigma of autism. The post reports others are looking to environmental factors as possible causes. Ultimately it may not matter. \" the fact that we have one in 45 children with a very serious neurological condition is a catastrophe by any measure, \" the president of the autism society of san francisco says.",
