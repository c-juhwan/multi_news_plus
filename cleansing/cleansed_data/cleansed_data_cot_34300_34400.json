        "summary": "That was fast: the deal ted cruz and john kasich forged on sunday to stop donald trump winning already looks shaky, with confusion over whether kasich's supporters should vote for him or not next week. Trump, meanwhile, is poised to win all five eastern states — pennsylvania, delaware, maryland, rhode island, and connecticut — voting in tuesday's primaries. A roundup of coverage: kasich appeared to undermine the deal on monday when he told reporters that indiana supporters should still vote for him, reports the washington post. \" i've never told ' em not to vote for me, \" kasich said. \" they ought to vote for me. But i ' m not over there campaigning and spending resources. \" hours earlier, kasich's indiana campaign co-chair had said his supporters should vote for cruz to keep trump from winning the state on may 3. Republican insiders are very skeptical about whether the deal will actually work, the hill reports. Some believe kasich supporters are unlikely to embrace cruz. The ohio governor's supporters are now \" left choosing between two people who they see as unappealing, \" gop operative mike murphy says. On the campaign trail monday, trump slammed the \" collusion \" as evidence of how \" weak \" and \" pathetic \" his rivals are, reports the guardian. \" if you collude in business, or if you collude in the stock market, they put you in jail, \" he said. \" but in politics, because it's a rigged system, because it's a corrupt enterprise, in politics you're allowed to collude. \" redstate explains the delegate allocation process in the five states voting tuesday and predicts a near-total sweep for trump, though a weak spot could be pennsylvania, which is the only state where polls put cruz instead of kasich second. Fivethirtyeight also predicts trump wins in all five states, though its state-by-state analysis finds a few spots where kasich could sneak wins. It will be interesting to see which version of trump takes the stage for a victory speech, the new york times notes. If it's the trump who slams cruz as \" lyin'ted \" instead of the more statesmanlike trump seen after his new york victory, it could signal that a \" messy spectacle at the convention \" lies ahead, whether he gets 1,237 delegates or not. ( trump's latest target is kasich's \" disgusting \" eating habits. )",

A scientific assessment of the planet's heat balance has found that the most likely explanation for the recent hiatus in global warming is the continual absorption of thermal energy by the huge \"heat sink \" of the deep ocean many hundreds of metres below the sea surface, according to scientists from the met office. Senior climate scientists said that they had always expected periods when the rate of increase in temperatures would level off for a few years and emphasised that the last decade was still warmer than any previous decade, with 12 of the 14 hottest years on record occurring since 2000. Professor rowan sutton, a climate scientist at reading university, said the temperatures have levelled off in the past, the latest example being in the 1940s and 1950s when sulphate pollutants from the post-war boom in industrial production may have acted as a shield against incoming solar radiation. \"some people call it a slow-down, some call it a hiatus, some people call it a pause.

On the other side, european policy makers seem set to deliver more of the same. They ' ll probably find a way to provide more credit to countries in trouble, which may or may not stave off imminent disaster. But they don't seem at all ready to acknowledge a crucial fact — namely, that without more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in europe's stronger economies, all of their rescue attempts will fail. The story so far: the introduction of the euro in 1999 led to a vast boom in lending to europe's peripheral economies, because investors believed ( wrongly ) that the shared currency made greek or spanish debt just as safe as german debt. Contrary to what you often hear, this lending boom wasn't mostly financing profligate government spending — spain and ireland actually ran budget surpluses on the eve of the crisis, and had low levels of debt. Instead, the inflows of money mainly fueled huge booms in private spending, especially on housing. But when the lending boom abruptly ended, the result was both an economic and a fiscal crisis. Savage recessions drove down tax receipts, pushing budgets deep into the red; meanwhile, the cost of bank bailouts led to a sudden increase in public debt. And one result was a collapse of investor confidence in the peripheral nations ' bonds.

Can this strategy work? not for greece, which actually was fiscally profligate during the good years, and owes more than it can plausibly repay. Probably not for ireland and portugal, which for different reasons also have heavy debt burdens.

They ' ll probably find a way to provide more credit to countries in trouble, which may or may not stave off imminent disaster. But they don't seem at all ready to acknowledge a crucial fact — namely, that without more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in europe's stronger economies, all of their rescue attempts will fail. The story so far: the introduction of the euro in 1999 led to a vast boom in lending to europe's peripheral economies, because investors believed ( wrongly ) that the shared currency made greek or spanish debt just as safe as german debt. Contrary to what you often hear, this lending boom wasn't mostly financing profligate government spending — spain and ireland actually ran budget surpluses on the eve of the crisis, and had low levels of debt. Instead, the inflows of money mainly fueled huge booms in private spending, especially on housing. But when the lending boom abruptly ended, the result was both an economic and a fiscal crisis. Savage recessions drove down tax receipts, pushing budgets deep into the red; meanwhile, the cost of bank bailouts led to a sudden increase in public debt. And one result was a collapse of investor confidence in the peripheral nations ' bonds. Advertisement continue reading the main story so now what? europe's answer has been to demand harsh fiscal austerity, especially sharp cuts in public spending, from troubled debtors, meanwhile providing stopgap financing until private-investor confidence returns. Can this strategy work? not for greece, which actually was fiscally profligate during the good years, and owes more than it can plausibly repay. Probably not for ireland and portugal, which for different reasons also have heavy debt burdens. But given a favorable external environment — specifically, a strong overall european economy with moderate inflation — spain, which"

The discovery came during restoration of the library at the ancient st. Catherine's monastery in south sinai, and it took some sleuthing. The medical recipe attributed to the greek physician was found on a leather parchment known as a palimpsest, but it had actually been overwritten by a later recipe. Spectral imaging, however, revealed the original text, believed to have been laid down by hippocrates in the fourth or fifth century bc and then preserved by scholars on the parchment in the sixth century. The 1,500-year-old manuscript \" will be enlisted among the oldest and the most important manuscripts in the world, \" says a researcher with the early manuscripts electronic library, per the asharq al-awsat newspaper. One drawback: while egyptian authorities celebrated the discovery of the medical recipe, they apparently didn't reveal the recipe itself. The manuscript contains other recipes penned by an anonymous early writer and adorned with drawings of herbs.

        "summary": "The race is on for the 2022 winter olympics — the race to get out of hosting, that is. Four cities that were considering hosting, including two finalists for the job, have dropped out of the running. Four finalists remain, but only two of those bids look robust. Cities just don't seem to want to take charge of an event that cost $ 51 billion this year in sochi. Deadspin has the story: this week saw krakow drop its finalist bid \" due to the low support for the idea among the residents, \" the city's mayor said. How low? well, 70 % of them voted against holding the games. Stockholm was another finalist, until its ruling party decided in january not to fund the event because afterward, there \" isn't any need \" for, say, a luge facility. Votes in munich as well as davos/st. Mortiz, switzerland, opposed olympic bids, with a german lawmaker citing \" the non-transparency and the greed for profit of the ioc. \" as for the remaining four finalists: oslo's bid had only slim support in september, and public opinion against it has grown. Plus, a bid would require the ruling and opposition parties to join forces. The head of the lviv, ukraine, bid says its \" dream is on hold \" amid the country's violence. That leaves almaty, kazakhstan — a country whose president is in power for life — and beijing. At business insider, tony manfred explains the issue: research shows that hosting the olympics offers fewer gains and bigger costs than estimates indicate. \" employment benefits of the project are matched by employment losses associated with higher taxes or spending cuts elsewhere in the system, \" a holy cross economics professor wrote in 2006. These days, manfred suggests, countries are realizing that researchers are right.",

Khamenei didn't quit there, reiterating other messages he reportedly made in a speech in tehran, cbs news notes. He seemed to close the door on future talks with the us about other topics, stressing, \" we allowed negotiation with us only on nuclear issue for certain reasons, in other areas we did not and will not allow negotiations with us, \" adding that \" [ us ] negotiation is means of infiltration and imposition of their wills. \" he then rubbed salt in the wound, finishing up with: \" we would negotiate and reach agreement in different levels of'state, religion or ethnic groups ' with all countries but the great satan, \" using the epithet bestowed on america by his predecessor, ayatollah ruhollah khomeini.

The social media team whipped up a \" special birthday cover \" and ( snarkily? ) stated, \" welcome to the 902-5-oh. \" oof. Perry, of course, played dylan mckay on the ' 90s hit tv show, as the \" bad boy \" of the group. Perry became a favorite with viewers of the show and often graced the covers of teenage magazines, such as \" seventeen \" and \" teen beat. \" ( this, despite being 24 years old at the time of the show, cnet pointed out. ) top entertainment videos: story continues below &#124; things to do and new flicks: sign in for newsletters but it seems that plenty of people were not pleased about being reminded not only of perry's age, but of their own mortality.

        "summary": "Another woman has accused director roman polanski of sexually assaulting her when she was a minor — and her lawyer says she hopes more victims will come forward. The 59-year-old woman, who gave her name only as robin, says polanski abused her in 1973, when she was 16 years old, the los angeles times reports. At a press conference at attorney gloria allred's office tuesday, she says she kept quiet at the time because she feared her father would \" do something that might cause him to go to prison for the rest of his life. \" robin said she decided to come forward now because she was \" infuriated \" by the forgiving attitude of samantha geimer, who polanski has pleaded guilty to raping when she was 13. \" i am not over it, and i certainly believe that roman polanski should be held accountable for his criminal conduct with samantha geimer, \" robin told reporters. Polanski, who fled the us before he could be sentenced in 1978 and has lived overseas since, has been trying to get the case thrown out, a move geimer supports, reports jezebel. The deadline to file criminal charges in robin's case has passed, but allred says the accusations were reported to law enforcement this year and robin might be called to testify if polanski goes to trial in the future. In 2010, british actress charlotte lewis said polanski sexually abused her \" in the worst possible way \" on the set of his movie pirates in 1982, when she was 16.",

She claims the assault happened when she was a minor. The woman and attorney gloria allred will hold a press conference on tuesday in los angeles. Polanski pleaded guilty to raping the 13-year-old samantha geimer in 1979 but famously fled the country before sentencing. He has lived in europe ever since and has tried to get the case thrown out by alleging judicial misconduct. But his efforts have been rejected even after geimer urged the court to dismiss the case in june. The british actress charlotte lewis also alleged that polanski sexually abused her when she was a 16-year-old star in 1983 on the set of his movie pirates. Advertisement if you're wondering, why the hell hasn't roman polanski been arrested yet for this rape that occurred decades ago that he pleaded guilty to, you would be very right to wonder that! you might remember that polanski was arrested in zurich, switzerland in 2009 and was held there but then the swiss let him go. Then poland held him in 2014, the us asked authorities to arrest him and extradite him to the us, and polish authorities rejected that request.

Schedule i substances are classified as dangerous, ripe for abuse, and without recognized medical use — claims that kratom users say just aren't true. Kratom, derived from a plant native to southeast asia, has long been used as a medicine in asian cultures. In recent years, it has gained popularity in the us among a small but dedicated community, many of whom use it as an alternative painkiller and a way to wean off addictive and dangerous opioids. Kratom advocates cheered the dea's decision to solicit further feedback before making a decision on regulating the drug. Susan ash, the founder of the american kratom association, told the huffington post, \" we believe kratom should not be scheduled in any way, shape, or form, \" adding that there was \" no impetus to make it a controlled substance. \" the dea said backlash from users and researchers prompted the agency to review its decision — an \" unprecedented \" step for the drug agency to take, per the huffington post.

The announcement came at the end of a heated 11-hour session held behind closed doors, the new york times reports. Pakistan's intelligence chief denounced the us raid and said he was ready to resign over the incident. He also denied that pakistan maintained links to militant groups, and blamed an intelligence failure for bin laden's presence in the country. The session was meant to address military and intelligence failures that allowed the us raid to go forward undetected. Parliament also called for the us to end its drone attacks, four of which have occurred in the country since bin laden was killed, reuters reports.",

In a study published in the journal plos one, researchers say testing carried out over 27 years at 63 nature reserve sites in germany found a reduction in flying-insect numbers of more than 75 % between 1989 and 2016. The \" overall pattern of decline in insect diversity and abundance \" is alarming, not least because many plants rely on the insects for pollination, and many kinds of mammals, 60 % of birds, and some reptiles rely on insects for food. \" insects make up about two-thirds of all life on earth, [ but ] there has been some kind of horrific decline, \" says researcher dave goulson of sussex university, per the guardian. \" we appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological armageddon.

That's messed up. \" that was the reaction of one delaware viewer interviewed by the news journal to a video released yesterday showing a white dover police department officer kicking a black suspect in the head during an august 2013 incident, the newspaper reports. Cpl. Thomas webster can be seen about halfway through the five-minute, 25-second video ( taken from a police car dashboard camera ) coming up to a then-30-year-old lateef dickerson near a dover gas station where a fight had been reported, with gun drawn. Ordered to the ground, dickerson begins to comply; webster kicks him once in the head. Dickerson lost consciousness and was taken to the hospital with a broken jaw, the paper adds. A 2014 grand jury chose not to indict webster, and that same year the us attorney's office said dickerson's civil rights hadn't been violated, per reuters — actions that prompted the aclu to sue the police department and demand the video's release. Attorney general matt denn, in place since just january, took a personal look at the case and requested a second grand jury to weigh in; it indicted webster monday and he was arrested on a felony assault charge that day. Rep. Sean lynn tells the news journal that the officer's use of force \" seems completely unwarranted. … i was definitely taken aback. \" meanwhile, the head of the delaware police union had a different rationale for why criminal charges were brought: \" it's not fair. This was done because of what is taking place in society today, \" he said in apparent reference to baltimore and ferguson.

The bbc reports an appeals court in sudan has nixed the death sentence for 19-year-old noura hussein, who was sentenced by an islamic court in may to die by hanging for killing her husband after she says he raped her. Per cnn, hussein's family was also ordered by the court to pay nearly $ 19,000 in \" blood money \" to the deceased 35-year-old man's family. Hussein's five-year prison sentence will include time already served, per the independent. Her case generated international outcry not only over her specific predicament ( she was forced into marrying a man 16 years older than her when she was just a young teen ), but also on child marriage and marital rape overall in sudan. Cnn notes the appeals court was swayed by the fact that it believed hussein when she said she'd found the knife she killed her husband with under a pillow while they struggled — not taken it from the kitchen as prosecutors alleged. While pleased with the \" hugely welcome news \" on her sentence, amnesty international says it's not enough for sudan, which allows children to be married at age 10 and doesn't outlaw marital rape. \" [ this ] must now lead to a legal review to ensure that noura hussein is the last person to go through this ordeal, \" a director with the east african arm of the group says. \" sudanese authorities must take this opportunity to start reforming the laws around child marriage, forced marriage, and marital rape, so that victims are not the ones who are penalized. \" hussein's lawyers say they plan to appeal both the payment and the prison sentence.",

        "summary": "Facebook officially revealed its new design today, a visual and in some ways functional overhaul designed, in mark zuckerberg's words, to \" give people the best personalized newspaper we can. \" what does that mean? well: the first thing you ' ll notice when it arrives is that photos have been made much more prominent; they're bigger, full-bleed affairs, and there will be an entire feed devoted just to them. Sources tell mike isaac at all things digital that photos consistently generate the most user engagement, forcing engineers to rig the algorithm to show more text-based updates to compensate. Speaking of the dedicated photo feed, it ' ll be just one of several sub-feeds you can browse, including one for music, one for pages you're following, and one for each of your interest and friends lists. Zuckerberg explained this with the newspaper analogy: \" it should have a front page news section of top things going on, and let you drill down into any topic you want. \" photos aren't the only things that ' ll be larger; check-ins will be bigger, too, with maps to display locations. In another news-oriented move, facebook will try to display more content about trending topics, displaying news stories from various sources about topics you've liked, techcrunch reports. Facebook also made a point of saying the design was \" mobile inspired, \" and designed to work just as well on phones and tablets as it does on your laptop. Third-party content will also get a makeover. One nifty change: if several of your friends share the same link, you ' ll be able to mouse over their profile images to see what each of them had to say about it. One curious thing: despite the visual-centric approach, facebook said that its prized possession instagram will be treated just like any other app. The changes will roll out slowly in the coming weeks, though impatient users can sign up for a waiting list here to get them asap. The changes will also hit iphone and ipad before they come to android. Click for more.",

Cain more than tripled his support in gallup's october poll, jumping from 5 % in september to 18 %, just a hair behind mitt romney's 20 %. Rick perry, meanwhile, plummeted from 31 % to 15 %. The result is roughly in line with last week's polls showing cain's surge. The rest of the candidates were all in the single digits. The tumult is unusual for republicans, who have historically ( with the exception of john mccain in 2008 ) picked a frontrunner early and stuck with him, gallup notes. And given that a whopping 20 % of the field is still undecided, \"the race may remain fluid for some time. \" romney for one plainly isn't worried by cain's rise — last night he told a crowd in new hampshire that cain was a \"terrific guy \" and that they should \"give him a look, \" politico reports. \"vote for either one of us and you ' ll be happy. \"",

However, romney's support is matched by the 20 % of republicans who are unsure which candidate they will back for the republican nomination in 2012. Gallup's oct. 3-7 update of republicans ' preferences for their party's 2012 presidential nominee shows that romney since mid-september has regained a numerical lead over the rest of the field, mainly because perry's support has dropped by half over the same period. At the same time, support for cain has more than tripled, from 5 % to 18 %, creating a competitive three-way race for the nomination between romney, cain, and perry -- all within five percentage points of each other.

According to cbs affiliate khou jakadrien turner ran away from home in the fall of 2010 following her parents divorce and the death of her grandfather. She ended up in houston, where she was arrested for theft. The girl gave police a fake name, which apparently belonged to a 22-year-old illegal immigrant from colombia, who had warrants for her arrest. Khou reports that immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) took the girl's fingerprints, but didn't confirm her identity before deporting her.

That's what happened to irina tipunova yesterday when malaysia airlines flight mh17 exploded overhead. \" there was a howling noise and everything started to rattle. Then objects started falling out of the sky, \" the 65-year-old tells reuters. The woman's body is still inside, awaiting expert examination. Tipunova isn't alone.

In other mh17 news: russian rebels have been hiding their links to a buk missile battery that may have shot down the plane, western defense and intelligence sources tell the guardian. The ukrainian interior ministry bolstered those cover-up fears by releasing a video purporting to show a rebel truck headed for the russian border carrying a buk missile launcher with one of its four missiles missing. There's been significant speculation about why mh17 was over the area in the first place. The plane's flight plan appears to have included a well-traveled stretch of airspace used by a host of other airlines in recent days, nbc news reports. Malaysia airlines released a statement saying that the flight plan was approved by eurocontrol. It also said that air traffic control had ordered the plane to drop from 35,000 feet to 33,000 feet, and said that from now on malaysian airline planes would avoid ukrainian airspace entirely.",

Some 700 workers phoned as many as 15,000 unwitting americans, posing as irs agents and demanding immediate payment for unpaid taxes. While the exact amount of thakkar's haul is unknown, reuters reports the swindle netted more than $ 300 million, and the new york times says it took in as much as $ 150,000 a day. Indian police have charged more than 390 people in the scheme, per cnn.

There is no other intention for this, \" a local police rep says.

The masked hatchet-holder, believed to be in his 40s, came into the burien store sometime before 6am sunday and started swinging the hatchet toward the 60-year-old customer, who was drinking his morning coffee, reports q13 fox. The suspect then changed course and went behind the counter, where he attacked the clerk, identified by kiro 7 as kuldeep singh. That's when the customer, who has a concealed pistol license, drew his weapon and fired at the suspect, who died after failed resuscitation efforts by paramedics called to the scene, cops say. The customer is said to be a store regular who's been stopping by for more than 10 years and who's described by another employee as a \" nice guy \" who often buys scratch-off lottery tickets. \" this could have been a lot worse, \" says king county sheriff's sgt. Cindi west, adding to komo that it wasn't clear whether the suspect planned to commit a robbery. Singh received minor injuries to his stomach, while the customer is said to still be too shaken to talk about the incident. One thing he probably doesn't need to worry about is facing charges: kiro 7 notes that local officers are calling him a hero, while west says that \" we do not see any wrongdoing on the part of the customer.

Within minutes, however, the anchor failed, leaving only a section of engine holding the boat in place.

            "Niagara falls, n.y. -- two people were rescued from a disabled motor boat that was adrift near the brink of niagara falls, a hazardous nighttime rescue that was hindered by high winds but helped when nearby dams lowered the river level, authorities said monday. Police using a boat reached the pair after the winds prevented a helicopter from getting to them. The 2 1/2-hour rescue effort began around 11 p.m. Sunday, when the u.s. Coast guard said its buffalo station was notified by one of the boaters that their 18-foot boat hit a reef and was adrift.

            "Niagara falls, n.y. -- two people were rescued from a disabled motor boat that was adrift near the brink of niagara falls, a hazardous nighttime rescue that was hindered by high winds but helped when nearby dams lowered the river level, authorities said monday. Police using a boat reached the pair after the winds prevented a helicopter from getting to them. The 2 1/2-hour rescue effort began around 11 p.m. Sunday, when the u.s. Coast guard said its buffalo station was notified by one of the boaters that their 18-foot boat hit a reef and was adrift. The vessel was near goat island, which lies between the american and canadian falls, and the coast guard told the boaters to anchor.

        "summary": "There's an emerging tick-borne disease spreading across the us, and it has infectious disease experts sounding the alarm. The so-called powassan virus, which the cdc reports is related to west nile, is still very rare, with only about 75 cases reported in the past decade. But it is far more worrisome than lyme disease, in that it's transmitted much more quickly ( under an hour versus 24 hours ) and can be fatal — the virus can cause meningitis and brain inflammation called encephalitis. An \" important change in the ecology \" of the virus is behind the emerging concern, reports the yale school of public health. Though the first reported case dates to the 1950s, it wasn't considered a threat because it was transmitted by a tick that rarely bites humans, reports today. Now that it's found in deer ticks, the game has changed. One neurologist warns that \" we should be very scared of it because nobody is safe from it. \" of the cases reported between 2006 and 2015, most ( 20 ) were in minnesota, per the cdc's stats. But because deer ticks pick up pathogens from the deer on which they feast, the number could rise as more deer and thus more ticks become infected. Those who do develop symptoms experience things like fever, confusion, weakness, vomiting, headache, and seizures within one to four weeks. The cdc has recorded eight deaths and reports 50 % who survive experience permanent neurological symptoms. Most recently, a 5-month-old baby in connecticut was diagnosed with the virus. There is no vaccine or treatment, so experts tell maine public radio that people should wear long pants and repellent when outdoors. ( a major tick infestation is predicted for this summer. )",

And they pulled it off. They got fired, sure, but they pulled it off. According to recently declassified documents acquired by buzzfeed, the contractors in question managed to steal \"vending goods by disconnecting the freedompay network termination cables connecting to agency vending machines. \" we're not talking about a stray snickers bar here or there, either.

Before the accident, clayton was a teetotaler and father of five who preached at his own ministry, according to the guardian, but he split up with his wife and became an alcoholic after the injury. According to the new york times, he checked himself into a mental hospital for 15 months two years after the accident out of fear he couldn't control his rages. After he emerged, he took a job as a police officer instead of returning to the sawmill, but he quit after nine months because he believed he shouldn't be in a position of responsibility.

Ocean city police say ashley o ' connor suffocated in a deep hole that apparently collapsed or was otherwise filled with sand sometime after 2am monday. \" we don't think there were any suspicious circumstances, \" lindsay richard of the ocean city police department tells nbc dfw. Richard says the 30-year-old newlywed likely fell or climbed into the hole after she was seen walking on the beach alone. Richard adds it \" hasn't been determined \" whether tractors used to sift and clean the sand overnight may have mistakenly covered the hole while o ' connor was inside, as some on social media have suggested, per the delmarva daily times. Authorities are continuing to investigate why the hole was present in the first place. Beach rules prohibit the digging of any hole deeper than the knee height of the smallest person nearby. But while beach officials keep watch for such holes during the daytime, the captain of ocean city beach patrol notes they are sometimes dug at night. Investigators say whoever dug the hole in which o ' connor died contributed to her death, reports wtop. Only o ' connor's arm was visible through the sand, roughly 30 yards from the high-tide line, when beachgoers alerted authorities around 6: 30am monday. That was shortly after o ' connor was reported missing by her parents, with whom she was vacationing after a friend's wedding.",

Its effects, however, are already rippling through europe, where stock markets and the euro have plummeted, and cypriots were yanking their money from atms yesterday. The country has extended today's bank holiday through tomorrow, and the new york times notes that many think that will be extended to wednesday. Some fear a run on banks could hit spain and italy amid concerns the levy might not be limited to cyprus. The hit could now be as high as 15 % on deposits of more than $ 646,000, an insider tells the wall street journal, while smaller deposits could be subject to a 3 % or 10 % tax. The goal is $ 7.6 billion, in the first european bailout to be financed by depositers. Still, there's no guarantee the measure will pass. There's no majority party, reuters notes, and three parties have already refused to support it. But cyprus president nicos anastasiades is calling on lawmakers to take action, saying that failure to back the levy could result in a \" complete collapse of the banking sector. \" a lawmaker, however, offered a different take: \" essentially parliament is called to legalize a decision to rob depositors blind, against every written and unwritten law. \"",

In the eyes of jake woolf, they might have been ok in the ' 90s era of loose-fitting clothing, but they don't fly with today's sleeker fashions. \" boxers, with their loose fit and ballooning fabric scrunched into one elastic waistband, bunch underneath everything, from slim-fit trousers and jeans to even shorts, \" writes woolf. Worse, they ' ll destroy the look of a good suit. \" you say they're masculine, unpretentious; we say they're the uniform of your overzealous teenage-boy self, \" writes woolf. He concedes they're fine in one situation only: in the morning, around the house, when you're not seen in public. Beyond that, buy some black boxer-briefs. \" be part of the solution, \" he implores. Just stop. Meanwhile, a blogger at deadspin has an equally clear message for men at gq who tell other men what kind of underwear to use: stop now. Albert burneko doesn't so much write a defense of boxers as a defense of not being pressured into clothing choices by a fashion magazine whose interest it is to create james bond clones. You like boxers? great, put ' em on. \" wearing what makes you feel good and confident and comfortable will make you look good and confident and comfortable, and therefore attractive, \" he writes. \" the people who will be attracted to you when you are feeling good and confident and comfortable will be better — in the sack and everywhere else — than the people who will be attracted to you when you are chasing the fashion of the moment. \" read his full post here, and woolf's here.",

            "Port-au-prince, haiti — jean-bertrand aristide, the former priest who rose to become haiti's first democratically elected president before being forced into exile twice, returned home on friday to a raucous welcome from supporters and jitters that he would rattle a presidential runoff intended to settle months of political discord here. Thousands of people cheered, danced and blocked streets around the airport upon his arrival. Then they swarmed the grounds of his spacious home, climbing over walls to get on the property, scaling trees to get a look at him and massing on his porch to peer into windows — once the thick crowd parted enough for him to get out of his car and make it inside. Several people swiped coconuts from his trees and cracked them open during an impromptu celebration under the fierce sun. Mr. Aristide, who remained secluded inside, arrived like a conquering hero on a chartered flight from his adopted home in south africa at 9: 05 a.m. Local time, stepping onto haitian soil for the first time since he left the country in 2004 under strong american pressure as rebels closed in on the capital. A polarizing but closely followed figure, beloved by the poor but reviled by others as corrupt and autocratic, mr. Aristide defied american efforts to keep him out, at least until after the runoff on sunday. The election is the",

        "summary": "As far as eulogies go, aretha franklin got a crummy one, at least according to her family. \" he spoke for 50 minutes and at no time did he properly eulogize her, \" said the late singer's nephew regarding the rev. Jasper williams jr. \" we found the comments to be offensive and distasteful, \" said vaughn franklin, per the daily beast. In his statement on behalf of the family, franklin said williams wasn't his aunt's choice, as she didn't dictate any funeral wishes; rather, the family asked him to speak as he had done for the family on previous occasions, including 34 years prior at franklin's father's funeral. The ap reports the atlanta pastor's eulogy was criticized for its political overtones: he likened kids in a fatherless home to \" abortion after birth \" and said black lives \" must not matter until black people start respecting black lives and stop killing ourselves. \" the ap notes that upon uttering the line \" no, black lives do not matter \" during the eulogy, stevie wonder shouted out \" black lives matter. \" other critics took issue with his line about single black mothers being unable to mold black boys into men; franklin herself was a single mom to four boys. In comments to the ap on sunday, williams didn't budge. \" i ' m sure much of the negativity is due to the fact that they don't understand what i ' m talking about, \" he said. \" anybody who thinks black america is all right as we are now is crazy. We're not all right. \" he went on at length, saying wonder \" did not understand what i said \" and that his words about black single moms were taken out of context. Read his full comments here.",

Some children didn't know their birthdates or their parents ' names, and \" several said ' mama ' when asked what their mother's name was, \" he says. Hospital staffers had to send photos of the children, who were in kindergarten to fifth grade, to teachers to find out their identities and contact their parents.

There were no reports of injuries in that incident. Nbc news reports that jasmine mateen, whose daughter was killed in the crash, says she had been complaining about walker's dangerous driving since august. Mateen — whose two other daughters were injured in the crash — says she complained to the school, the board of education, and the bus company after her daughters told her walker would do things like slam on the brakes on purpose, making the kids hit their heads.",

            "It certainly lived up to the hype -- and is on its way to being historic. Variously described as snowmaggedon and snowmygawd, the biggest snowstorm to hit the twin cities since the halloween storm a generation ago whited out -- and pretty much paralyzed -- the metro area and much of the rest of central and southern minnesota on saturday. One of the casualties was the roof of the metrodome, which collapsed overnight. The dome collapsed after 5 a.m., roy terwilliger, head of the metropolitan sports facilities commission, told wcco-am. Terwilliger said that a rip in a panel in the middle of the roof caused it to deflate. As predicted, more than a foot of snow had fallen across a wide swath of the state by saturday evening, shutting down highways, bedeviling snowplow drivers and shuttering stores and pre-holiday events. The storm was shaping up to be one of the most historic ever recorded in minnesota, easily piling up into the top 10 snowfalls ever measured in the twin cities. By saturday evening, nearly 17 inches had been dumped on minneapolis, with snow still falling. Nearly 22 inches fell in shakopee. Although that accumulation was short of the 28.4 inches of snow recorded in the storied halloween blizzard of 1991, it was by far the deepest since then.

The roof gave way at 5 a.m. Sunday when three fabric panels tore under the weight of more than 24 inches of snow in places, creating a mess that ultimately could cost the vikings millions in lost revenue. No one was injured. An estimated 64,000 ticket holders were expected at sunday's game. With season ticket holders paying $ 30 to $ 150 a ticket and more money at the concession stand, potential losses could be high. Inside the bitterly cold stadium sunday morning, a surreal scene emerged: sunshine shimmered on seats and splattered snow covered the green turf.

The orange county register reports that the crustaceans, which look like tiny lobsters or crawfish, created a bright-red rim along the shoreline of dana point, san clemente, newport beach, and huntington beach yesterday. Experts say the 1- to 3-inch-long crustaceans, which normally live off mexico's baja peninsula, are going farther north because of the warm water that has lingered off southern california for the past year. In recent weeks, blue jellyfish-like creatures known as \" by-the-wind sailors \" have also been spotted, and tropical fish such as yellowtail and bluefin tuna are showing up earlier than normal this year. Tuna crabs get their name from the fact that they're a favorite meal for tuna and other large fish. Sea birds, sea otters, and whales also dine on the creatures, but experts at scripps institution of oceanography say people should avoid eating them because the phytoplankton they consume can contain toxins, the san diego union-tribune reports.

The pleuroncodes planipes, also known as pelagic red crabs or tuna crabs, showed up in early january and again in february on balboa island, fascinating marine scientists and beachgoers, some who tried to save the still-live critters by throwing them back to the sea, though most were dead.

An editorial published today in the people's daily newspaper, widely considered a chinese government mouthpiece, calls for a \" reconsideration \" of japan's claim to the ryukyu islands, which include okinawa, reports the afp. The editorial, penned by scholars from china's leading state-run think tank, argue that the islands were a \" vassal state \" of china, but that china had been so battered by foreign aggression it was unable to fight the japanese annexation of the islands in 1879. But the piece doesn't go quite so far as to argue that the ryukyus are chinese territory, notes the wall street journal. \" our so-called'reconsideration ' is absolutely not saying the ryukus belong to china or the ryukus should belong to china, \" said one of the authors in an interview. \" we're pointing out the facts, telling the japanese government that if there are questions about the ryukyus, then they can't even begin to talk about the [ senkakus ]. \"",

As buzzfeed reports, senators have called for him to leave the race and severed their financial ties with his campaign. Moore's attitude last night? he tweeted, \" dear mitch mcconnell, bring. It.

What can be done? that's the topic du jour, and the potential avenues are unusual ones. Where things stand: lean on kay ivey: some gopers are pushing alabama gov. Kay ivey to reschedule the special election, which might provide the breathing room necessary to get a new candidate in place. But buzzfeed notes that ivey isn't giving interviews and has thus far only \" mechanically \" repeated that the election will go ahead as planned on dec. 12. The new york times notes that it's extremely unlikely she'd push the date, in part because absentee voting is already underway. A \" drastic \" option: politico reports that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and his advisers are considering another potential option: asking sen.

Now, with the death of a northern white rhino in a czech zoo, there are just four of the animals left in a species already past the point of no return. Nabire, a 31-year-old female, died monday in the same zoo where she was born; she was unable to produce offspring because she suffered from uterine cysts, one of which ended up killing her, live science reports. \" the pathological cyst inside the body of nabire was huge. There was no way to treat it, \" said the zoo's rhino curator in a statement. \" her death is a symbol of the catastrophic decline of rhinos due to a senseless human greed, \" the zoo's director said, per afp. \" her species is on the very brink of extinction. \" with the death of nabire, the only remaining northern white rhinos are three females who are unable to breed — an elderly female at the san diego zoo and two in kenya — and the last surviving male, who's also at the kenyan conservancy, where a last-ditch breeding effort to save the species failed, the ap reports. In a facebook post, the san diego zoo offered its condolences to the czech zoo and said that instead of giving up on the species, it's collecting genetic material so the rhino's genome can be preserved. The czech zoo removed nabire's healthy left ovary after her death, and the zoo's statement notes that the ultimate goal would be to generate northern white rhino embryos and transfer them into a closely related surrogate: the southern white rhino. But scientists have not yet developed ivf procedures that work for rhinos, live science notes. ( a cougar has come off the endangered species list — for a very bad reason. )",

        "summary": "Bad news for the future of cds ( and, let's face it, probably the future of cd wallets, too ). Billboard reports two major cd retailers — best buy and target — are reconsidering their relationship with the three-decade-old music format. Sources say best buy — which has gone from the \" most powerful \" music seller in the us to a \" reduced and shoddy \" selection that brings in only about $ 40 million a year — will stop selling cds on july 1. Meanwhile, sources say target — which is carrying far fewer cds these days but still managed to move over 500,000 copies of taylor swift's most recent album — wants to change to a consignment model where it wouldn't have to pay suppliers for any cds that go unsold. Sources say at least one major label is considering pulling its music from target rather than agree to the new financial risk that would represent. The changes at best buy and target could speed up the cd's demise, but they're far from the first signs of its impending doom. Usa today reports cd sales hit $ 13.2 billion in 2000, and 712 million cds were sold in 2001. In the 14 years since that peak, recorded music lost 40 % of its global value, according to npr. In 2016, streaming took over as americans ' main means of listening to music and kmart stopped selling cds. In 2017, ford manufactured its first car without a cd player in 25 years. That same year, cd sales in the us dropped 18.5 %. However, while things look bleak now, cds could always make a vinyl-like comeback a few years down the road. In fact, while best buy is giving up on cds, it will reportedly continue selling vinyl records for another two years. ( speaking of: sony is doing an about-face after helping kill vinyl. )",
