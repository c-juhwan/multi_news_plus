When asked about it today at a news conference, obama explained that there's no precedent for such a thing, reports nbc news.

Days after her official execution date, the state supreme court today ruled that michelle byrom, 57, will be retried, cnn reports. Byrom was convicted 14 years ago of masterminding the murder of her allegedly abusive husband. But her son, edward byrom jr., confessed to the killings in jailhouse letters. He later recanted, and byrom confessed to the killings, but now says she did so only to protect her son from murder charges, reuters reports. Byrom's husband was shot dead at home in mississippi in 1999 while she was in a hospital with double pneumonia. In his testimony, byrom jr. Said his mother paid one of his friends $ 15,000 to commit the murder. Byrom took her attorney's advice and let a judge sentence her rather than a jury, but the judge sentenced her to death. It's pretty rare for us women to be executed, reuters notes: only 14 have been put to death since 1976, compared to 1,400 men. Byrom is one of two women among 50 death-row inmates in mississippi.",

None of the outcomes is a surprise. Romney faces no serious challenge to the republican nomination. Even the candidate himself is essentially ignoring tuesday's primaries. Romney has been spending the day campaigning in michigan, where he castigated president barack obama as an \" old-school liberal \" whose policies would take the country backward."

He's at 1-2, with the next best odds belonging to frosted at 5-1 and materiality at 7-1, reports the courier-journal. If pharoah does win, the horse could be worth $ 100 million in future years because of stud fees, notes fortune. Owner zayat stables sold the breeding rights last month for a figure estimated to be \" north of $ 20 million, \" reports cnn, but that could prove to be a bargain for the coolmore ashford stud farm with a victory today. An analysis at wired says not to start counting the money yet, however. There's a reason triple crown winners are so rare, writes lexi pandell: \" there are two weeks between the derby and the preakness, and three weeks between the preakness and the belmont. That tight schedule — and the super-specific needs of racehorses — means horses competing in the grueling back-to-back-to-back triple crown races have a big disadvantage against fresh horses. \" on that note, the 5-1 frosted sat out the preakness and should be fresh indeed.

            "Update: on june 6, 2015, american pharoah won the belmont stakes and took the triple crown. California chrome had it all. The three-year-old thoroughbred won the kentucky derby last year. Two weeks later, he topped the field at the preakness, becoming the only horse bred in the golden state to ever win both races. Then, on june 7, 2014, he was about to run the belmont stakes, the final race in the so-called triple crown. The last horse to win all three of these races was affirmed in 1978, but maybe chrome had a chance to bring the title into the 21st century: the colt had a prime starting position, second in the gate. The odds were on his side, at 3-5. His legion of fans, the #chromies, mustered on twitter. But chrome fell short. Tying for fourth, he became the 13th horse to win the first two legs of the triple crown only to fail in the third in almost 40 years. The winner at belmont, tonalist, hadn't raced in the derby or the preakness, and in a post-race interview, chrome's co-owner steve coburn argued that the triple crown should be a closed circuit: no parachuting in to run the belmont if you haven't already run the previous races in the series. \" it's not fair to the horses that have been in the game since day one, \" coburn said. \" it's all or nothing.

In the post, engineer susan fowler calls her year at uber \" strange, fascinating, and slightly horrifying, \" recounting how on her first day on a team, she was harassed with messages from a manager who was clearly seeking sex. ( \" he was trying to stay out of trouble at work, he said, but he couldn't help getting in trouble, because he was looking for women to have sex with. \" ) she says complaints to hr and management were met with indifference; she was told \" they wouldn't feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part. \" she later met other women in the company who experienced similar harassment from the same manager. Fowler says that amid a \" game-of-thrones political war \" between management factions, female engineers deserted uber, with the proportion dropping from 25 % to below 6 % by the time she left in december last year. She says that in one especially ridiculous moment, all employees were promised leather jackets — but women were later told that they wouldn't be receiving them because there weren't enough of them for a bulk order to be placed. Kalanick tweeted that the behavior fowler described is \" abhorrent \" and that he has instructed the company's hr chief to conduct an \" urgent investigation. \" \" there can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at uber — and anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is ok will be fired, \" he said in a statement to the san francisco chronicle.",

Although neither primary is open to independent voters, which oregon public broadcasting says could hurt sanders, it still seems he ' ll defeat clinton in oregon, politico reports. Even though a recent opb poll showed a 15-point clinton lead, the poll came out the same week clinton was endorsed by two former oregon governors. A democratic strategist says oregon is \" prime territory for bernie demographically, all white, \" with lots of likely support from young voters — similar to nearby states he's won. Kentucky, meanwhile, is \" definitely clinton territory, \" says an ex-state democratic party chair. Not only has clinton gone strong in the state with 16 campaign events ( sanders has held four ), she slammed barack obama there in 2008, 65 % to 29 %. But politico notes some are comparing kentucky to west virginia, where sanders won and where the coal-mining community believes clinton wants to put their industry out of commission. \" attacking coal is like attacking our culture, and it's part of a whole centuries-old theme of outsiders coming in and trying to tell us what to do, \" says an ex-candidate for kentucky's treasurer position. But clinton has been trying to woo voters back, running tv ads there, visiting a local diner, and noting she'd put bill clinton, still popular in the region, \" in charge of economic revitalization \" in struggling areas.",

The memo is a direct contradiction of one issued by former attorney general eric holder in 2014 that stated trans employees were protected by title vii. \"it is a dark day in our nation's history when those tasked with defending our civil rights open the door to government-sponsored discrimination, \" democratic us rep.

According to the hill, those principles include \" the right to act or abstain from action in accordance with one's religious beliefs, \" meaning religious businesses or organizations can decide to hire or not hire people based on their religion and could be allowed to legally discriminate against some people, likely based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The memo stems from an executive order signed by president trump meant to make it easier for churches to get into politics while remaining tax exempt. The memo states the trump administration \" will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied, or silenced anymore. \"",

            "A flight destined for iran never made it off the tarmac at a swedish airport when passengers on board protested over the deportation of kurdish refugee ghader ghalamere who was due to be sent home on the same flight. Ghalamere fled iran in 2012 and settled as a refugee in sweden with his wife fatemeh ( a swedish resident ) and two children. Despite qualifying for a residency permit - swedish immigration laws demand that he formally applies for it outside sweden - he was put on the stockholm flight at östersund. The aircraft would ultimately have returned him to iran. Angry passengers refused to fasten their seatbelts in protest at his treatment and prevented the pilots from being able to take off. Ghalamere has been given a temporary reprieve. He is being housed at the migrant detention centre in gavle, central sweden. Sanna vestin, chairman of the swedish network of refugee support groups, said: \" it's enough now. No one who sees the family can doubt that it would harm the children to see their father expelled. \" his deportation order to iran was prompted when he failed to get residency while he was in norway for two weeks.

Symptoms like coughing, sneezing, fever, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, and lethargy may not appear for 10 days, but they can then last up to two weeks. The virus can also spread through shedding or by humans, who may touch an infected dog and then others without washing hands or clothing. While a vaccination for canine flu isn't always recommended, veterinarians say \" because of the outbreak we're recommending it for all high-risk dogs. \" the virus can be especially dangerous for dogs under 1 year old and over 7.

His case against genting casinos uk, the owner of crockfords, was dismissed last year, and he challenged that dismissal. But on wednesday, britain's supreme court upheld the lower court's ruling, the ap reports. Ivey and a colleague used a technique called \" edge sorting, \" in which they got the croupier to unknowingly arrange the cards in a way that allowed ivey and the other player to figure out what cards were being dealt, based on small differences in the pattern on the back of the cards, and bet accordingly. Crockfords returned his stake but never paid out the winnings, leading to the court battle. The supreme court found what ivey did was definitely cheating, but after the ruling ivey maintained his innocence. \" at the time i played at crockfords, i believed that edge sorting was a legitimate advantage-play technique, and i believe that more passionately than ever today, \" he said. \" as a professional gambler, my integrity is everything to me. \" ivey was accused of doing the same thing in the us.",

Eventually, the plane would have been \" washed into the ocean by rising tides and surf, \" explains gillespie. Tighar has already found artifacts on the atoll that support such a story.

That's why 100-plus researchers from the us, uk, and other nations are gearing up for a massive $ 27.5 million study on the thwaites glacier, in hopes that the data will help them better predict sea-level rise, live science reports. And the vessel that's going to break through the ice to lead this five-year mission: the rrs sir david attenborough, better known as the boat that the internet wanted to call boaty mcboatface, reports the guardian. Per the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, the global sea level in 2014 was 2.6 inches higher than it was nearly 20 years earlier — and it's set to keep rising at about one-eighth of an inch every year. Landlocked glaciers like thwaites keep bigger ice masses back, but when these glaciers start to melt, that adds new water into the ocean. Scott borg, the deputy assistant director at the national science foundation, tells the guardian the thwaites dilemma is one that should concern us all. \" what happens in the antarctic does not stay in the antarctic, \" he says. \" we do not know how quickly [ the glacier ] will contribute to sea level rises, and whether we have decades or centuries to prepare for it. \" ( how rising sea levels are creating \" ghost forests. \" )",

Clothes-shedding will be acceptable between 8am and 7: 30pm, and peeping toms and exhibitionists shouldn't expect to see, or put on, a free show, officials warn — \" good behavior \" guidelines will be on display to make sure everyone respects the rules, the bbc reports. Local nudists are celebrating, with one member of the paris naturists association proclaiming the decision \" a true joy \" and \" one more freedom for naturists, \" per afp. The france 4 naturisme organization notes that more than 2.6 million people in the nation regularly recreate in the buff, with nearly 500 campsites, beaches, and other venues set aside for those who find clothing inhibiting. Paris itself is no stranger to these disrobed denizens: three times a week they're permitted to splash around in the nude in one of the city's public pools. The new section will also protect naturists from legal repercussions. When it was announced last year, cnn noted the illegality of public nudity, which can earn a transgressor up to a year in prison or a $ 15,000 fine. The au naturel spot in bois de vincennes \" will help change people's attitudes toward nudity, toward our values and our respect for nature, \" the pna rep says, adding he thinks thousands of people will flock to the site.

However, hackers did breach the website of the city webmaster, and took data from a recent program offering amnesty to people with outstanding warrants for municipal offenses. Hackers claiming to be affiliated with anonymous have launched a spate of attacks on law enforcement websites in recent weeks, hitting such cities as salt lake city, boston, syracuse, n.y. And greece. The collective of activists, pranksters and hackers have also targeted financial institutions such as visa and mastercard, as well as the church of scientology. The warrant amnesty information from mobile had already been made public by the city to encourage people to participate in the amnesty program, drummond said. She said city technicians are still trying to determine whether some personal information required",

Uncomfortable, contentious, debatable or not, the bartender is now required to serve her in new york city, according to new guidelines from the city's human rights commission, which note restaurants and bars can't refuse alcohol or entry to expectant mothers, per the new york times. \" judgments and stereotypes about how pregnant individuals should behave, their physical capabilities, and what is or is not healthy for a fetus are pervasive in our society and cannot be used as pretext for unlawful discriminatory decisions, \" read the guidelines, meant to clarify anti-discrimination protections for pregnant women under the city's existing human rights law, per abc news. Mayor bill de blasio calls it one of the strongest anti-discrimination laws in the us, per cbs new york. Medical groups such as the american academy of pediatrics say women shouldn't drink while pregnant, and bars are required by state law to post warnings that drinking while pregnant can cause birth defects. But officials say only a mother-to-be has the right to decide whether she drinks, and about 10 % of pregnant women do, according to the cdc. The guidelines also note restaurants and bars can't refuse to serve pregnant women high-risk foods like raw fish and soft cheese. And they ' ll \" enable pregnant employees to understand their rights so they can request reasonable accommodations without fear of retaliation, \" the commission chair says in a statement. Those \" reasonable accommodations \" include light duty, unpaid leave, and adequate bathroom breaks on the job. ( the dangers of drinking while pregnant are outlined here. )",

        "summary": "The san francisco 49ers cut linebacker reuben foster on sunday, hours after he was arrested at the team hotel in tampa, fla., on charges of domestic violence. An arrest report from the hillsborough county sheriff's office said foster was booked at 11: 11pm saturday and held without bail. Foster was arrested by tampa police at 9: 10pm at the grand hyatt where the team is staying before playing the buccaneers on sunday, reports the ap. The team released a one-sentence statement sunday saying it had cut foster. Foster, 24, was charged with a count of first-degree misdemeanor domestic violence. Tampa police rep janelle mcgregor said a 28-year-old woman said that foster \" slapped her phone out of her hand, pushed her in the chest area, and slapped her with an open hand on the right side of her face, \" per cnn. Mcgregor said officers observed a 1-inch scratch on her left collarbone. Mcgregor said officers learned that foster had lived with the woman in the past and had been involved in an on-and-off relationship with her over the past three years. Police later confirmed the woman was elissa ennis, who had accused foster of hitting her in february but later recanted the allegations. 49ers general manager john lynch and coach kyle shanahan said in april following that arrest that the team had a zero-tolerance policy. \" we can promise you guys, if there's someone who ever hits their significant other, girlfriends, some person like that, that person is not going to be on our team, \" shanahan said in april. After the charges were dropped, lynch said foster was told he would have to continue to earn his place on the team with his behavior. But saturday night's arrest ended foster's time with the 49ers. Foster was suspended the first two games of this season for violating the nfl's conduct and substance-abuse policies.",

        "summary": "Japanese whalers sailed to the antarctic in december with the goal of killing 333 minke whales. Discover reports they returned thursday having met that goal. Japan signed on to an international moratorium banning whale hunting in 1986 but has since been taking advantage of a loophole that allows killing whales in the name of \" scientific research. \" in what can only be seen as a particularly bold claim, japan says it's killing whales as part of research meant to prove there are enough whales for them to hunt commercially. For years the country has insisted most whales aren't actually endangered, seeking to return to hunting whales for food, according to reuters. But the un says that's exactly what's happening now under the guise of scientific research. Japan openly admits that the meat from the whales killed in the name of science is used for food, including in school lunches. That prompted the un to ban japan's hunt last year, gizmodo reports. For one year, japan managed to conduct its research without killing any whales before falling back on claims that killing is necessary. This year's haul was the largest in years. Approximately 90 % of the mature female whales killed in this year's hunt were pregnant, which japan says shows their \" breeding situation \" is \" healthy. \" the country plans to kill 4,000 whales over the next dozen years.",

        "summary": "An american pastor detained for two years in turkey on charges of espionage and aiding terrorist groups is heading home. A turkish court on friday allowed the release of evangelical pastor andrew brunson, who lived for more than 20 years in turkey before he was jailed in the 2016 crackdown that followed a failed coup, accused of links to alleged orchestrator fethullah gulen and kurdish militants. Facing up to 35 years in prison, the north carolina native was handed a three-year sentence on friday but ordered released considering his time served, reports reuters. Under house arrest since july, brunson had declared his innocence at friday's hearing and cried as the judgment was read. It came a day after nbc news reported that a secret deal between washington and ankara would secure brunson's release around the time of the hearing. The deal included lifting some sanctions imposed and threatened by president trump, per the washington post. However, the state department later said it was unaware of such a deal. \" pastor brunson just released. Will be home soon! \" reads a tweet from trump. According to nbc news, the president's lawyer, jay sekulow, says brunson has already boarded a plane to the us. Reuters adds that brunson's release could help the president score points with evangelicals ahead of next month's midterms.",

            "Director of national intelligence james r. Clapper jr. Said thursday that he has submitted his letter of resignation to president barack obama, cementing his long-declared plan to leave his job as the nation's spy chief when a new president is sworn in. \" i submitted my letter of resignation last night, which felt pretty good, \" clapper said in testimony thursday morning before the house intelligence committee. \" i have 64 days left and i would have a hard time with my wife for anything past that. \" u.s. Officials emphasized that clapper's resignation was unrelated to the election victory of donald trump, who has publicly dismissed the work of u.s. Spy agencies on critical issues, including russia's interference in the election and moscow's involvement in the war in syria. Clapper began his career as a rifleman in the u.s. Marine corps reserve and went on to serve in a series of intelligence-related assignments over the past 50 years, culminating in his appointment as director of national intelligence in 2010. The disclosure that clapper has submitted his letter comes at a time of widespread apprehension among u.s. Intelligence agencies over how they will be treated in a trump administration.

The 1-year-old boy was dragged 100 feet in his stroller when it was caught in the car's back wheels; a 4-year-old girl was the other victim killed. \" the pregnant woman was just lying on the street … bleeding from her head, \" one bystander tells the new york post. Another says that while the girl was being given cpr, \" i ran to [ her mom ] telling her, ' please, miss, stay down. ' … she tried getting up on her knees and fell back down. \" she was rushed to a hospital, where her condition was listed as being in critical but stable condition. Another woman, whom the post identifies as the boy's mother, may also have been taken to a hospital in stable condition, but details of the story are still developing and vary from source to source. Pix 11, for example, reports that both children were with the same woman; the new york times says police do not believe the children were related; and the wall street journal, which gives the children's ages as 5 and 3, says the pregnant woman was taking care of the little boy. Police sources say the driver of the volvo involved — whose alleged identity was given by the post but has not been confirmed by police — told them she was creeping forward at the intersection in anticipation of the red light turning to green, but she accidentally hit the accelerator. It's not clear whether the light was red or green when the car entered the crosswalk. After the pedestrians were hit, the volvo hit a parked car, causing a chain reaction in which at least three other vehicles were hit. The post says police did not hold the 44-year-old driver, but abc 7 reports she was taken into custody. She was also brought to a hospital after telling officers she has a medical condition.",

Born on march 5, 1898, misao okawa turns 117 tomorrow, and even she's not entirely sure why. \" i wonder about that, too, \" she told the ap, adding that to her, her life span has \" seemed rather short. \" huffington post and usa today say okawa is one of just five people alive today who were born in the 1800s, which means she's experienced three separate centuries, 20 us presidents, and a slew of technological wonders, from cars and planes to the advent of social media, guinness world records notes. Okawa, who married husband yukio in 1919, has three children, four grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren, per the ap; sadly, yukio died when she was in her early 30s — meaning she's been a widow for almost 84 years. The head of the osaka nursing home where the spunky centenarian lives says she loves sushi ( \" particularly mackerel on vinegar-steamed rice \" ) and makes sure she gets at least eight hours of sleep each night, the telegraph reports. \" eat and sleep and you will live a long time. You have to learn to relax, \" she says in a message to the paper. Okawa took over the honors of the world's oldest after jiroemon kimura, also of japan, died at age 116 in 2013, guinness notes; the average life span for a japanese woman is nearly 86 years, the records group adds. The wall street journal noted in 2012 that there were more than 50,000 centenarians in japan, and the telegraph points out that experts have cited that country's healthcare program, respect for its elders, and a nutritious diet of fish, rice, and vegetables as being partly responsible for citizens ' longevity.",

In reality, republicans remain in control thanks to rogue democrat simcha felder, who has caucused with the gop since soon after he was elected and says he doesn't plan to change now, the new york daily news reports. The victories of democratic candidates shelley mayer in a closely watched race in westchester county and luis sepulveda in a more predictable race in the south bronx give the democrats 32 state senate seats, enough to give the party control of the chamber for the first time since 2010 if felder, who represents a brooklyn district, would cooperate, the new york times reports. Felder is the last holdout from a group of nine breakaway democrats. The others agreed to return to the fold last week, but felder says that with just 25 days left in the year's legislative session, he wants to avoid an \" unprecedented and uncertain late session political battle that will only hurt my constituents. \" democrats say they expect to win a bigger majority this fall.

Camryn said he doesn't want it to appear like the couple is \"shoving \" their license in the faces of others who have yet to receive their own. \"that's far from what we're trying to do … i wish we could be on their side fighting for ours, just like they are,"

This time, simpson is up for parole for the armed robbery and kidnapping case that has kept him locked up in nevada since 2008. The hearing will be broadcast live at 1pm edt on thursday, reports the wrap, and espn will be among the networks airing it, as part of a 90-minute special. Related coverage: optimistic: \" tell them we ' ll be playing golf again soon, \" simpson told friend tom scotto in a phone call last week, per usa today. If the parole board assents, simpson would be free on oct. 1, and he'd either move in with scotto in florida or with his sister in sacramento, calif., at least initially. Decent chance: earlier this year, sports illustrated ran a lengthy analysis on simpson's chances, taking into account factors including his prison behavior and his age of 70. Bottom line: \" indications are strong that this will be the year oj simpson will be released from prison. \" ditto: the ap also reports that simpson stands a decent chance of getting out. It quotes the prosecutor who got him convicted in 2008: \" assuming that he's behaved himself in prison, i don't think it will be out of line for him to get parole, \" says david roger, retired clark county district attorney. Unless... Page six reports that, unlike his last parole hearing in 2013, the press is being allowed to cover this one, which has simpson worried. \" he thinks all this media hype is going to screw with the parole board and put pressure on them to keep him locked up, \" says a former prison guard at lovelock correctional center. 1988: that was the year simpson starred in the first of the naked gun crime comedies, per this timeline of his life via the ap. Six years later, ex-wife nicole brown simpson and friend ronald goldman were stabbed to death. New nickname: guards don't call him the juice, they call him nordberg, his character's name from the naked gun franchise, sister shirley baker tells inside edition. She also says he's got a job in prison: keeping the gym equipment clean. Goldman's family: an attorney for the family of stabbing victim goldman says if simpson is freed, he will go after him for $ 52 million, reports lawnewz. That's because of a 1997 civil judgment against simpson in a wrongful death lawsuit. The amount has accrued interest since then.",

The tradition of tracking santa started back in 1955 when a typo on a store advertisement that urged kids to call a santa hotline led children to mistakenly call conad, norad's predecessor. The head of conad then gave instructions to his staff to search for santa, and a tradition was born. According to norad, santa started his journey from the north pole at 9am gmt, with his first stops scheduled for the south pacific, new zealand, and australia. Read the full article.",

Another day of life ryszard kapuscinski despite working for communist poland's aptly named pap press agency, kapuscinski was the 20th century's best foreign correspondent. In 1975 he went from benighted warsaw to far more benighted luanda to cover the civil war in angola. He evokes the sweating, choking fear that's ever-present in guerrilla combat more effectively than anything short of my coming over to your house and shooting at you."

        "summary": "Maybe the toughest question to answer in the midst of donald trump's effort to assemble his administration is the status of chris christie. The new jersey governor met with trump on sunday, nine days after being dumped suddenly as head of the transition team, and afterward the president-elect called him a \" great guy \" but didn't commit to offering him a position, reports the asbury park press. Some related coverage on their complicated ties: two big factors have played a role in christie's \" fall from grace, \" as politico puts it. One is that trump got worried about revelations from the bridgegate trial that christie knew about the scheme all along; the other is that trump was ticked that christie filled the transition operation with lobbyists. Read the feature here. In its own analysis, yahoo news reports that a small thing also irked trump: he felt that christie was aggressively pushing to get into photo ops during trump's victory speech on election night. Full story here. The washington post also digs in to the various theories, concluding: \" what is clear is that christie has become an object lesson of the perils that face those who try to navigate donald trump's world, a place where loyalty is demanded, but not always one where it is returned in kind. \" full story here. One columnist thinks that trump son-in-law jared kushner torpedoed christie as revenge for christie's prosecution of his dad years ago. Read it here. \" it seems christie underestimated kushner's loyalty to his family, and trump's loyalty to his, \" writes olivia nuzzi at the daily beast, who says signs point to an exit for the \" loyal footman \" christie. We could know more after monday, because christie has called a rare meeting of his own cabinet in the morning, and he will be on a radio call-in show in the evening, reports nj.com. One seton hall professor says it's possible christie will tell his cabinet he's resigning, then make it public on the radio. \" that would make sense, \" he says. \" but the opposite also makes sense. He could be telling the cabinet he is staying until the end. \"",

Nevertheless, we try to be pretty careful. For instance, we had assigned a 25 percent likelihood that joe miller would defeat the republican incumbent, lisa murkowski, in alaska, as happened. We had also assigned small likelihoods to a number of other outcomes that did not come to fruition, like j.d. Hayworth ousting john mccain in arizona ( mr. Mccain won by 24 points ) or chet d.

That's the takeaway from an international study announced today, reuters reports. \" to be blunt: if we burn it all, we melt it all, \" says the study's lead author. The study looked at a worst-case climate change scenario involving going through all of the world's coal, oil, and natural gas deposits; the resulting increase in temperatures and melting ice would also cause the sea level to rise more than 160 feet, the new york times reports. Much of the netherlands, bangladesh, florida, and other parts of the world could end up underwater in such a scenario. The researchers weren't surprised to find that the entire ice sheet could eventually melt, but were surprised to discover that half of the melting could take place in just 1,000 years, causing seas to rise about one foot per decade ( around 10 times faster than it's currently rising ) and causing mass chaos as people evacuated coastal areas. \" i didn't expect it would go so fast, \" says a study co-author. \" to melt all of antarctica, i thought it would take something like 10,000 years. \" at the rate fossil fuel use is currently rising, the estimated deposits would be gone by the middle of the 22nd century. \" what we are doing right now might change the face of the earth for millennia to come, \" says the lead author. Adds the co-author, \" if we don't stop dumping our waste carbon dioxide into the sky, land that is now home to more than a billion people will one day be underwater. \"",

            "* antarctica could disappear over thousands of years * total thaw would raise seas by 50 metres - study * use of small fraction of fossil fuels brings risks of thaw by alister doyle oslo, sept 11 ( reuters ) - burning all the world's fossil fuel reserves could thaw the entire antarctic ice sheet and push up world sea levels by more than 50 metres ( 160 feet ), over thousands of years, an international study said on friday. Such a melt, also eliminating the far smaller ice sheet on greenland, is a worst case of climate change that would inundate cities from new york to shanghai and change maps of the world with much of the netherlands, bangladesh or florida under water. \" burning the currently attainable fossil fuel resources is sufficient to eliminate the ( antarctic ) ice sheet, \" the scientists wrote in the journal science advances. Antarctica contains ice equivalent to 58 metres of sea level rise. Even current emissions from oil, coal and natural gas could make the west antarctic ice sheet unstable, they said, if continued for 60-80 years. That would account for just 6-8 percent of fossil fuel reserves. \" what we are doing right now might change the face of the earth for millennia to come, \" lead author ricarda winkelmann of the potsdam institute for climate impact research in germany told",
            "The more basic finding that the whole ice sheet could eventually melt is less surprising, at least to scientists who specialize in studying the history of the earth. \"as a paleoclimate person, i don't feel like this is necessarily a shock to me, \" said robert e. Kopp, a professor of earth system history at rutgers university, who studies sea level but was not involved in the new research. Paleoclimatologists have established that antarctica was once a lush, green continent, icing over only in the past 35 million years, amid a general cooling of the world's climate. Moreover, rates of sea level rise like those outlined in the paper have occurred in the past. Human civilization is built on the premise that the level of the sea is stable, as indeed it has been for several thousand years. But the deeper history of the earth reveals enormous shifts, on the order of a hundred feet or more within a few thousand years. Sea levels far higher than those of today have been documented at more than a thousand sites around the world. Along the east coast, seashells from just 3 million years ago can be dug up by the shovel-full a hundred miles inland from the current shore.

Sea levels far higher than those of today have been documented at more than a thousand sites around the world. Along the east coast, seashells from just 3 million years ago can be dug up by the shovel-full a hundred miles inland from the current shore. Studying this evidence, scientists concluded long ago that the great ice sheets are sensitive to small changes"

        "summary": "As the political war across the country over voter-id laws rages, one crucial battle began today in the swing state of pennsylvania. A state court will decide whether tough new rules disenfranchise low-income voters. The trial will likely last seven days, but the outcome will probably not be the final word. Even the judge himself says, \" i am really a weigh station to the supreme court, \" reports the philadelphia inquirer. Voter-id laws have been passed in dozens of states over the past two years, ostensibly to combat voter fraud. Opponents say the real motive is for republican legislatures to discourage many poor and elderly voters, who are likely to vote democratic but who do not have the financial ability to meet the new requirements. Legal challenges are being argued in courts in various states ahead of the 2012 election, and the washington post notes that state courts have proven more helpful to the anti-voter-id cause ( such as in missouri and wisconsin ) than federal courts, the traditional setting for civil rights issues.",

        "summary": "Scientists seeking a quick and affordable way to detect thyroid cancer have trained a dog to smell it on people, with really good results. In a us study, a german shepherd mix named frankie detected thyroid cancer ( or lack thereof ) in urine samples with nearly 90 % accuracy, medical news today reports. Trained to lie down if he smelled cancer and turn away if he didn't, frankie got it right 30 out of 34 times in patients who'd already undergone biopsies and diagnostic surgery for abnormal thyroid nodules. The study's top investigator, donald bodenner, tells discovery that frankie was nearly as accurate as thyroid biopsies done with a needle. He's also cheaper and less annoying. \" we would like to know what frankie is smelling, [ but ] nobody knows, \" bodenner tells the bbc. His research team now plans to work with veterinarians in training two other dogs who already sniff bombs to detect thyroid cancer. Researchers also want to figure out what the dogs are smelling and possibly design \" electronic noses \" to do the job. All this would help people avoid invasive diagnostic procedures that \" often yield uncertain results, \" bodenner says, which lead to \" a large number of thyroid surgeries performed unnecessarily. \" meanwhile, thyroid cancer is spiking worldwide as the death rate remains stable, meaning doctors may be spotting thyroid growths that don't need treatment, the guardian reports. Bodenner's dog-sniffing approach has worked before — with ovarian and prostate cancer — because, as pbs notes, a dog's sense of smell is up to 100,000 times better than ours.

Usually the audience ignores the spots, but one highlighting brookfield office properties, the owner of the park where occupy wall street took root last year, has led to a nascent protest by a small group of filmmakers and their supporters. At issue is brookfield's role in clearing occupy wall street from zuccotti park in november. The filmmakers, including laura poitras ( \"the oath \" ), zach levy ( \"strongman \" ) and astra taylor ( \"examined life \" ), are dismayed by the festival's association with a company that, they argue, didn't support the first amendment rights of the occupy wall street protesters.

Scientists observed a male seal unsuccessfully attempting to mate with a penguin in 2006, but dismissed it as a one-off. But researchers says they inadvertently observed the same thing on at least three separate occasions. \" honestly i did not expect that follow-up sightings of a similar nature to that 2006 one would ever be made again, and certainly not on multiple occasions, \" says a study co-author. It's believed to be the first instances of pinnipeds — which include seals, fur seals, and sea lions — having sex across biological classes, as the bbc notes, \" in this case a mammal trying to have sex with a bird. \" some of the seals are believed to have penetrated the penguins, and one instance turned bloody, with the seal killing and eating his victim, though that's not unusual. It's not clear what's driving the behavior, though scientists speculate that it's a learned behavior; that would explain the increase in sightings. \" i genuinely think the behavior is increasing in frequency, \" says the co-author. Other theories include the seals blowing off sexual frustration, or using the weaker birds to practice. \" all in all it's difficult to say really, \" says the co-author.

Even more impressive: tumors completely disappeared in another 11 % of women given both drugs. \" it's absolutely intriguing, \" one researcher says. \" it is so fast. \" if further studies confirm the results, thousands of women every year could potentially avoid chemotherapy and the long-term side effects it brings with it. Herceptin, specifically, is usually given to her2 positive breast cancer patients only after surgery and chemotherapy. This trial shows those initial steps could potentially be skipped in some patients. Even better, since results to the drug combo are seen so quickly, doctors would quickly be able to shift to surgery and chemotherapy if necessary. It's a result that's being called \" dramatic \" and \" unexpected \" for researchers who were only trying to see how the drugs affected tumors between diagnosis and surgery. ( this gene test can tell who needs chemotherapy and who doesn't. )",

The post reports loudoun county school system's last verified case of bacterial meningitis was in january 2013. The head of the county's health department says the public is not in danger; the bacteria is spread through the direct exchange of saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus, as from kissing or sharing personal items like utensils or lip balm. David goodfriend adds that a limited number of people nearest to small are under observation. Symptoms include fever, severe headaches, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting. There is no indication an outbreak is beginning, but goodfriend warned against sharing personal items in general, reports wusa9. A press release from the health department also advises that children complete the recommended vaccine schedule. A vaccine is available for the bacteria that causes meningococcal disease, but goodfriend tells the post it's only required for college-bound teens.

Every christmas day, the friends of washington crossing park have reenacted george washington's daring dash across the delaware river, drawing thousands of onlookers. Organizers worried abnormally low water levels would prevent them from crossing by boat this year. But with the help of six rowboats donated by philadelphia waterborne, a nonprofit that teaches boat building to philadelphia students, the crossing is back on. Philadelphia waterborne's boats are smaller and lighter than the historic durham boats typically used for the reenactment. Thanks to their nimble design, the rowboats can safely cross the delaware at its current water levels. Philadelphia waterborne is the passion project of former philly teacher nicholas pagon, who visits a rotation of local schools weekly to help students build rowboats. The work encourages students to mix the abstract knowledge they learn in math class with the tangible skills it takes to craft a water-ready vessel. Since its founding four years ago, philadelphia waterborne students at seven schools — richard allen preparatory charter school, wissahickon charter school, girard college, aim academy, george washington carver high school of engineering and science, st. Peter's school, and maritime academy charter school — have built 35 boats. Pagon happened to be storing six of those boats at glen foerd on the delaware, a riverfront estate in northeast philadelphia, not too many miles downriver from where the crossing happened. While hanging around at the boathouse, pagon met a volunteer with the friends of washington crossing park. That friendship birthed a partnership when it became clear the durham boats wouldn't make it across the delaware this year. \"ours should be able to do it, \" said pagon.

Every christmas day, the friends of washington crossing park have reenacted george washington's daring dash across the delaware river, drawing thousands of onlookers. Organizers worried abnormally low water levels would prevent them from crossing by boat this year. But with the help of six rowboats donated by philadelphia waterborne, a nonprofit that teaches boat building to philadelphia students, the crossing is back on. Philadelphia waterborne's boats are smaller and lighter than the historic durham boats typically used for the reenactment. Thanks to their nimble design, the rowboats can safely cross the delaware at its current water levels. Philadelphia waterborne is the passion project of former philly teacher nicholas pagon, who visits a rotation of local schools weekly to help students build rowboats. The work encourages students to mix the abstract knowledge they learn in math class with the tangible skills it takes to craft a water-ready vessel. Since its founding four years ago, philadelphia waterborne students at seven schools — richard allen preparatory charter school, wissahickon charter school, girard college, aim academy, george washington carver high school of engineering and science, st. Peter's school, and maritime academy charter school — have built 35 boats. Pagon happened to be storing six of those boats at glen foerd on the delaware, a riverfront estate in northeast philadelphia, not too many miles downriver from where the crossing happened. While hanging around at the boathouse, pagon met a volunteer with the friends of washington crossing park. That friendship birthed a partnership when it became clear the durham boats wouldn't make it across the delaware this year. \"ours should be able to do it, \" said pagon. Philadelphia waterborne's 12-and-a-half-foot rowing skiffs are flat bottomed and draw just a few inches of water",
            "Washington crossing, pa. ( ap ) — george washington and his troops ' annual christmas day trip across the delaware river has been saved by boats made by children. Organizers had feared monday's crossing would have to be canceled because low water levels in the river between pennsylvania and new jersey would have made it impossible for re-enactors to navigate their wooden durham boats. But philadelphia waterborne, a nonprofit that teaches boat-building skills to middle- and high-school students, is lending the organizers six handmade, 12-foot rowboats for monday's crossing. The boats only draw about six inches of water, meaning they can get across the river under current conditions. The crossing is the highlight of the annual event that draws thousands of people to the banks of the river in washington crossing, pennsylvania, and titusville, new jersey."

In other campaign coverage: in another tweet sunday, trump called for \" crooked hillary \" to release detailed medical records and said he would have no problem releasing his own, cnn reports. Trump's doctor recently revealed that he spent just five minutes writing a letter praising the candidate's health. The new york times reports that the democrats are working to make the most of trump's unpopularity by targeting house seats to flip in an effort to reduce the gop's 30-seat majority — and even regain control if his poll numbers continue to slide, dragging gop candidates down with him. According to politico, trump may have already switched focus from trying to win to trying to poison clinton's presidency, portraying her as \" a brain-damaged crook who stole the election and will spend the next four years selling out the government from her deathbed. \" the ap reports that the trump campaign has made its biggest ad buy yet: $ 10 million in nine swing states, including new hampshire, virginia, iowa, colorado, and nevada. The ads are expected to start airing as soon as monday. The washington post looks at the voting group trump has the biggest problem with: catholics. Polls show that there has been a massive 25-point swing to the democrats among catholic voters, compared to 2012. Those numbers probably weren't helped by his feud with pope francis.",

They could be multiple wives of the deceased — a scribe and another man named ramesu — or maybe the tomb was used by further generations of the same family. Among other items in the tomb: shabti figurines to do the deceased's work in the afterlife, and a heart-shaped amulet likely related to an egyptian belief that after death, a person's heart was weighed against truth and justice.

Britain's healthcare system, including hospitals, doctors ' offices, and ambulance companies, was majorly impacted. \" we have no idea what drugs people are on or the allergies they have, \" one doctor tells the bbc. \" we can't access the appointments system. \" surgeries were disrupted and ambulances were diverted. The ransomware hit telecommunications companies and hospitals elsewhere, as well, with most of the affected computers in russia, ukraine, and taiwan. Security experts say the vulnerability exploited by friday's cyberattack was first found by the nsa. Shadow brokers, a group that's been leaking nsa hacking tools since last year, leaked this one last month. Microsoft released a fix for the vulnerability last march, but friday's targets hadn't updated their systems yet. The ransomware attack came with a message demanding about $ 300 worth of bitcoin to release victims'data. The message warns the ransom demand will double after three days and will be taken off the table after a week, the washington post reports. It's unclear who's behind the cyberattack.

        "summary": "Forensic experts in sri lanka have been handed the awful task of tracing more than 230 bodies in the country's largest known mass grave. Uncovered in mannar in march by workers digging a foundation for a building, the grave had produced 90 skeletons by august, though that number has since grown to 232, per colombopage. To be sent to florida to undergo radiocarbon dating and other tests, the remains found at \" a former co-operative depot near the main bus terminus \" are believed to belong to victims of a 26-year civil war during which at least 100,000 people were killed, reports the bbc. Showcasing photos of several missing people, the guardian reports another 65,000 disappeared between 1983 and 2009, when fighting ended between sri lankan security forces and separatist tamil tiger rebels. Locals say hundreds of people disappeared from mannar specifically. The town dominated by ethnic minority tamils was under government control for most of the war, with rebels occupying its surrounding areas, per the bbc, which adds that the remains of nearly 100 people were found in another mass grave in mannar in 2014. It's still unclear who was placed there and by whom; the army denies solders were involved. With partial funding from the office on missing persons, an independent body set up by the government this year, forensic experts now hope to unravel a second mystery hidden within the latest \" chaotic \" grave. It's \" very difficult to trace the stature of the bodies \" as bones are scattered or missing, lead archaeologist raj somadeva tells the bbc, noting porcelain, ceramic, metal objects, and jewelry were also found.

        "summary": "What makes the high plains so darned high? well, geologists say, maybe the earth just got lighter and floated up like a plank of wood for millions of years. In the journal geology, experts say water beneath the western us may have infiltrated an area of the continental plate and made it light enough to rise some 6,000 feet, the ap reports. It started millions of years ago when the west was mostly at sea level. The farallon oceanic plate had slid under north america and, the theory goes, reacted to pressure from above and heat from below by releasing water. That water rose up into densely packed minerals, turning them into minerals so light that the earth's crust slowly \" floated \" and became the high plains. But it's still just a theory, says co-author craig jones. \" do we think this is'the ' answer? no, \" says jones, a geology professor at the university of colorado boulder. Yet the mystery is an awkward one for colorado geologists: \" we probably need to figure this one out, guys, because it's kind of embarrassing, \" jones once said in a tv interview. The problem is that no deformations like volcanic activity or major faults are there to explain the high plains, he tells science daily. \" what we suggest is that by hydrating the lower crust, it became more buoyant, and the whole thing came up, \" he says. \" it's like flooding colorado from below. \" seismic studies support the theory, too, saying the earth's crust is lighter and more hydrated at higher elevations.

Six serious flaws have left 95 % of android phones vulnerable to data-stealing attacks that, in some cases, can be delivered via \" silent \" text messages. \" all devices should be assumed to be vulnerable, \" drake says, estimating 950 million android phones are at risk ( he says the only safe ones are those below version 2.2 ). At fault is a media playback tool called stagefright, which despite its name, contains aggressive \" remote code execution \" bugs that let hackers pull out info accessible by stagefright — meaning they can ostensibly record audio and video, look through photos, and break into bluetooth, per forbes. \" make no mistake about it: this is a bad exploit, \" android central notes. One of the more sneaky aspects of the attacks: if a user opens the exploit code somewhere like google hangouts, it triggers \" immediately before you even look at your phone … before you even get the notification, \" drake says, and the text message can be deleted before the user opens it, meaning they'd be unaware the attack even took place. Zimperium alerted google about the vulnerabilities in april, and offered patches, which google agreed to, per android central. But it's not clear if google has actually implemented the fix into its nexus phones, or if manufacturers such as samsung, htc, and motorola have sent patches to their customers.

Given that samaras himself was just released from the hospital today following eye surgery and will miss this week's eu summit, germany is working to lower expectations that the summit will make much progress on greece. Outgoing finance minister giorgos zanias will attend; he technically still holds the position since rapanos was not sworn in before becoming ill.",
