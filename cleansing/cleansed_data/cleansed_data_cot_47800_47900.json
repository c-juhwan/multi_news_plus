The government uses those reports to help make hiring decisions and decide who gets access to national security secrets. In addition to mr.

        "summary": "Just how ancient is a newly discovered solar system? \" by the time the earth formed, the planets in this system were already older than our planet is today, \" university of birmingham researcher tiago campante tells the bbc. The solar system — a star named kepler-444 that's orbited by five planets — was uncovered via an analysis of data gathered by the kepler telescope over a four-year period. The work was published yesterday in the astrophysical journal. Why the find is attracting so much attention: it's being described as a \" replica \" or \" twin \" solar system of our own. In terms of size, the planets fall between mercury and venus, making it the \" oldest known system of terrestrial-sized planets, \" per the study. But likely not a life-sustaining one: the planets are too close to the star to permit life, with orbits about 10 % of the distance earth is from the sun. As far as age goes, the solar system came into being 11.2 billion years ago, a determination researchers made using asteroseismology ( sound waves trapped within the star cause natural resonances that spur tiny changes in the star's brightness; age is measured from these variations, reports yalenews ). And as far as distance goes, it's 117 light-years away. How the researchers frame the significance of the discovery: \" we thus show that earth-size planets have formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8 billion year history, leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy. \" that leads discovery news to ask, \" could alien life have already come and gone in our galaxy's history? \" ( another noteworthy find: the coldest spot in the universe. )",

People younger than 18 are allowed to marry in all 50 states, though some states, including new york and texas, have recently adopted laws increasing the minimum age. While the age of consent in ohio is 16, an adult could be charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sex with someone between the ages of 13 and 15; they would face rape charges for sex with anyone younger. The daily news story highlighted a case of a pregnant ohio 14-year-old who married a 48-year-old man in 2002. They remain married and have three kids. Tessi siders, now 29, says in a text message interview she doesn't regret having married at such a young age but likely wouldn't allow her kids to do so. And she said ohio should change its law to make the minimum age for marriage 18. \" yes, some get pregnant before 18, but if the father truly loves her, he [ waits ] the years to marry her, \" she wrote.",

The minute-long ad shows a bunch of young people living in a house together, starting their mornings with a \" wake-up playlist \" that includes camila cabello's \" havana \" — a song that apparently yanks the aforementioned doll out of its own deep sleep and sets it off on what appears to be a killing spree. No gore is shown ( the doll just starts unnervingly showing up in unexpected places ), but that it's up to murder is assumed. The advertising standards authority didn't like the overall feel of the ad, especially when it comes to kids watching it. \" the implied threat of violence [ and ] the fact the ad was set inside the home, including a bedtime setting, and featured a doll \" is particularly troublesome, the group says, adding it's \" likely to cause undue distress to children. \" the asa got pulled into the fray after a parent complained their kids saw the ad on a youtube video-game channel and became upset. Spotify says most of the people who saw the ad were adults ( the target audience ) and that viewers could opt out of it after five seconds — seven seconds before the doll makes an appearance. Still, in a statement it notes \" regret \" for causing distress, adding: \" we take our responsibilities as a marketer very seriously. \" et canada and joe.co note the asa's role in keeping other ads off the air, including one for the horror film the nun and a breast reduction ad that ran during the series love island.

Just when her stash of dry cat food started to look appetizing, help arrived.

Included in that chaos: people not paying admission, littering, and enraging the farm's neighbors. \" one of my neighbors told me that he caught two people going to the bathroom in his front yard in his bushes, \" bogle, who runs the farm with his parents, tells the post, adding to the new york times: \" they were knocking down sunflowers and taking flower heads with them. … [ it was ] a zombie apocalypse. … we went from a week of amazing to that. \" what had spurred the giant crowd, unbeknownst to the bogle family: viral photos of their sunflowers that had spread on social media.

But hamilton, which is an hour outside of toronto, has its picturesque bloom too. \"for years, we've had people stopping alongside the road to take pictures, \" said brad bogle, who, along with his parents, harvests sunflower seeds for bird food on their farm, bogle seeds. In the summer of 2015, the bogles invited tourists to roam through the fields. They had such a swell time — and it was such a success — the family decided to welcome guests for a visit last month.

The ap reports the 21-year-old man from eritrea was trying to smuggle himself into switzerland aboard a train from italy. Guards boarded the train to check passenger documents and immediately became suspicious of the suitcase, which was traveling with the man's friend, according to the telegraph. \"it was not hard to know there was a person inside, given the weight and the movement of it, \" the telegraph quotes a border guard spokesperson as saying. Guards removed the suitcase from the train, then watched as the man started unzipping himself from inside of it. His attempted smuggling was even more impressive for the fact that he's 6 feet tall. Guards, who had to help the man fully extricate himself from his luggage, say they've never seen anything like it. After deciding not to request asylum in switzerland, the man was promptly sent back to italy. More than 3,400 migrants have been arrested attempting to enter the ticino region of switzerland from italy since the end of may.",

        "summary": "With many big cities upping the minimum wage, restaurant owners have to contend with higher labor costs — which has led some to abandon the practice of tipping in favor of raising menu prices or adding a mandatory service fee. At dirt candy, a manhattan eatery, a 20 % administrative fee is added to the bill in lieu of tipping — and servers are paid $ 25 per hour. ( new york will require tipped workers be paid at least $ 7.50 starting at the end of this year. ) \" i think that restaurants will have to do this, \" the owner tells the new york times. \" how else do you compensate for this extra money you ' ll have to pay? \" plus, while tips are not shared with those who work in the kitchen, the revenue from higher prices and fees can often be shared with all employees. \" we saw there was a fundamental inequity in our restaurants where the people who worked in the kitchen were paid about half as much as the people who worked with customers in front of the house, \" explains the co-owner of ivar's, a seattle restaurant that raised prices 21 % and eliminated tipping after the first stage of the city's $ 15 minimum wage took effect. Though some restaurateurs worry that servers will be put off by the idea of no tips, a server at a san francisco restaurant that also pays $ 25 per hour says she earns as much as she always did at her new rate of pay — but now she earns the same amount per shift even if a night is particularly slow. Another concern is that diners simply aren't ready for the change. At ivar's, credit card slips now include this line: \" if you insist on leaving a tip, write it here. \" earlier this month, the ap reported that ivar's no-tipping experiment has been a success, with some staff wages as much as 60 % higher than before.",

Under a cap-and-trade plan, farmers will receive aid from the $ 50 million or so raised via polluter fees, which they can then put toward machinery that uses methane to create energy they can in turn sell to electric companies. The state's air resources board can also now regulate bovine flatulence, as long as there are practical ways to reduce the cows ' belching and breaking wind. Under the bill, emissions from hfcs also must be reduced by 40 % from 2013 levels by 2030, while black carbon emissions will have to get to 50 % below those levels by the same year.

            "Being bullied as a child can result in long-lasting psychological scars for both boys and girls, according to a u.s. Study. Reviewing more than two decades of data, the researchers found that bullied children, regardless of their sex, face an elevated risk of developing anxiety disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts in later years. \"we were surprised at how profoundly bullying affects a person's long-term functioning, \" the lead researcher, william copeland, a clinical psychologist and epidemiologist at duke university in durham, n.c., said in a statement. \"this psychological damage doesn't just go away because a person grew up and is no longer bullied. This is something that stays with them. If we can address this now, we can prevent a whole host of problems down the road. \" an earlier study, carried out in finland, came to slightly different conclusions. Bullied boys seem to suffer few long-term problems, but the girls showed evidence of lasting psychological harm. The finnish study relied on health-system data, but did not have access to individual case histories. The u.s. Researchers said their new study, published wednesday in the journal jama psychiatry, is \"most definitive to date in establishing the long-term psychological effects of bullying. \" they said they used \"a much richer data set \" than the finnish researchers.

        "summary": "One of the three suspects in the london bridge attack was known to police. Khuram shazad butt, who may have had links to jihadist group al-muhajiroun, had been the subject of a metropolitan police investigation beginning in 2015. However, the investigation was \" prioritized in the lower echelons \" because \" there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned, \" a rep tells the bbc. A man and a woman living in east london had both contacted police about butt, with the woman suggesting he had tried to radicalize her children. According to the times, butt had links to both radical islamic preacher anjem choudary and mohammad sidique khan, who planned the 2005 london bombings. Khan worked at an ilford fitness center that butt, a 27-year-old father of two, would frequent to try and radicalize youth, the times reports. Butt also appeared in a 2016 channel 4 documentary about islamist extremists with ties to choudary. He was seen arguing with police after carrying an islamic state flag. Yet butt still managed to get a job with the london underground. The uk citizen born in pakistan served as a trainee customer service assistant for almost six months in 2016, per the bbc. \" people are going to look at the front pages today and they are going to say ' how on earth could we have let this guy — or possible more — through the net, ' \" foreign secretary boris johnson says, per buzzfeed. Police previously identified rachid redouane, 30, who claimed to be moroccan and libyan, as another of the attackers. On tuesday, they named the third: youssef zaghba, 22, believed to an italian national of moroccan descent, reports the ap.

According to the virginian-pilot, an 11-year-old boy dubbed it \" shelly island \" for the abundance of seashells found in the sand, while his grandmother described the new formation as \"just a little bump \" in april. The \" little bump \" now stretches a mile long and \"three football fields wide, \" and the newspaper reports that obx's ever-shifting coast means the new island could either disappear or grow even bigger by next year depending on storms and currents. But local experts warn that getting to the island can be dangerous and that beach-goers should not attempt to walk or swim there because of unsafe rip currents. In fact, the news &amp; observer of raleigh reports that such currents have claimed the lives of four people off the north carolina coast since june 10. Other concerns include old fishing hooks lurking below the sand and sea creatures surrounding the new formation, including five-foot long sharks and enormous sting rays. \"we're worried about shark bites, \" says north carolina beach buggy association president bill smith, \"but we're more worried about drownings. \" ( another outer banks beach ranked third in 2017's best list ).",

An army spokeswoman tells the bbc that harper-mercer, who was 26 at the time of last week's rampage, was discharged in 2008 after less than a month in basic training, but under privacy rules, the reason cannot be disclosed. He did not receive a dishonorable discharge, which, under federal law, would have prevented him from buying firearms, the journal reports. The six firearms harper-mercer was found with at umpqua community college were legally purchased by him or a relative. Harper-mercer's rampage was the deadliest in the us in two years, and police say it could have been even worse if not for the heroic actions of two plainclothes officers who arrived at the scene, reports reuters. Police say sgt. Joe kaney and detective todd spingath, who were not wearing bulletproof vests, ran at the gunman as he stood in the doorway of a campus building, shooting at them with a handgun. Harper-mercer was wounded in an exchange of fire and retreated before killing himself in the same classroom where he had killed a teacher and students, the new york times reports. \" these men saved lives this day, \" the local da says. \" they were under fire, and they ran toward it. \" ( the gunman left behind writings complaining about his lack of a girlfriend. )",

The analysis is based on data from the gallup-healthways well-being index ®, a definitive measure and empiric database of real-time changes in well-being throughout the world. More than 178,000 interviews nationwide fueled the 2013 analysis, which examined americans ' perceptions on topics such as physical and emotional health, healthy behaviors, work environment, social and community factors, financial security, and access to necessities such as food, shelter and healthcare to create a composite well-being rank for each state, community and congressional district. Launched in 2008, the well-being index provides unmatched, in-depth insight into the well-being of populations. Gallup conducts 500 telephone interviews a day with americans to gather their perceptions of well-being, for a resulting sample that represents an estimated 95 percent of all u.s. Households.

How his entrance is being framed: realclearpolitics has huckabee currently sitting sixth out of 14 current and potential gop presidential candidates. Writing for the washington post, karen tumulty notes a few things in huckabee's favor ( he's a \" gifted communicator \" with solid name recognition ), but sees the path as challenging. Though he won the 2008 iowa caucuses, his funds soon petered out, and this time he ' ll face \" credible \" opponents, some of whom \" are challenging him for the financial and political support of conservative christians. \" at the new york times, trip gabriel frames 2008 as the easier race. \" the biggest question in voters ' minds about mr. Huckabee... May be why he has returned to the fray. Although american politics is full of stories of the ultimate triumph of also-rans, from richard m. Nixon to ronald reagan, mr. Huckabee would seem to face greater obstacles than during his first presidential campaign, when he battled only a couple of rivals for the party's conservative base. \" how an npr headline puts it: \" can huckabee overcome the ' new car smell ' of other candidates? \"",

But the convicted georgia murderer was granted a stay of execution just 30 minutes before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection, the guardian reports. Hill, 53, also saw a scheduled execution halted last year, but this time around things are different: now every medical expert who has evaluated him agrees he is mentally retarded, including three experts who initially refused to diagnose him as such in 2000. They recanted last week, admitting their work had been sloppy. That would seem to satisfy georgia's near-impossible and unusual requirement that a prisoner's mental retardation be proved \" beyond a reasonable doubt. \" still, earlier in the day, the state parole board, the supreme court of georgia, and the us supreme court all declined to stop the execution. It was the 11th us circuit court of appeals whose judges agreed to further investigate hill's mental status. Writing for the atlantic, andrew cohen hopes this case reaches the high court. That's because hill \" presents the justices with an opportunity to strengthen — to save, really — the letter and the spirit \" of their 2002 ruling that established that mentally retarded prisoners should not be executed, he writes. \" in that case, they tried to be all things to all people. It was a mistake. Even as they announced a national standard, the justices announced that states could weasel out of the new rule by identifying for themselves who is and who is not mentally retarded. \"",

Hill, 53, had already taken an oral sedative of ativan to help calm himself for the gurney before he learned of the stay of execution from the federal appeals court for the 11th circuit.

        "summary": "Robin thicke got the cops involved in the custody dispute between himself and ex paula patton, tmz reports. After the couple's 6-year-old son told his mother and his school that thicke spanks him painfully, the la county department of children and family services opened an investigation. Patton also filed for an emergency order asking that thicke be limited to monitored daytime visits with julian; on thursday, a judge denied that request. But when thicke tried to get a hold of patton to take julian for an overnight visit thursday, she went \" radio silent, \" per tmz, and on friday, thicke, who says he has not had physical contact with julian since dec. 31, showed up at her malibu home with la county sheriff's deputies. But, though the court custody order allows thicke access to julian, patton refused to send him out and deputies didn't force him to come out. Tmz says they went inside the home and spoke to the boy, who reportedly said he was scared of thicke and didn't want to leave with him. The incident was caught on video obtained by tmz, though thicke himself is out of frame and cannot be seen in the video. Deputies assure patton that they will not take a child against his will. \" basically we had a call to respond for a civil matter, \" a sheriff's department rep tells us. \" no action was taken on our part, no report was written. It was completely civil. \" but a rep for the department does confirm to people that the incident \" involved a child not wanting to go with someone. \" ( also in a custody battle: uma thurman. )",

Then the facebook co-founder ponied up another $ 5 million in mid-october to a hillary clinton super pac ( as well as $ 10 million more to other political advocacy and nonpartisan efforts ), per forbes. This nabbed the 32-year-old billionaire the no. 1 spot on the list of democrat mega-donors and has him now serving, as politico frames it, as an antidote to gop bigwigs like sheldon adelson.

Moskovitz's sudden political interest has thrown many for a loop, with politico noting a few democrat officials it contacted replied \" who? \" when his name was mentioned. Moskovitz himself has been publicly stoic: he wouldn't talk to politico about his donations; the only public references he's made were in two medium posts, including the latest one in which he noted \" further investments are warranted \" and that \" the events of the past few weeks have only deepened my conviction that hillary is the best choice for america. \" politico adds the operatives it talked to think moskovitz's abrupt aggressiveness on the political front may be completely trump-driven.

        "summary": "What would you say if you were about to be executed? there's a good chance your last words would be on the positive side. At least that was the case for 407 death row inmates executed between 1982 and 2015 in texas, according to a new study published in frontiers in psychology. German researchers compared the inmates ' final statements to a database of written and spoken content from more than 23,000 people, along with samples from students told to think about their own deaths and real suicide notes. The result: \" the inmates ' last words contained a significantly higher proportion of positive words, \" new york reports. And that, according to the study authors, reflects \" the emotional processes of coping with mortality \" by \" maintaining self-esteem and acquiring meaning in life. \" the findings fall within the framework of \" terror management theory, \" which claims that people use a \" wide range of cognitive and behavioral efforts \" to reduce anxiety in the face of impending death. For instance, one of the final statements used in the study read in part: \"even though i lay on this gurney, seconds away from my death, i am at total peace. May the lord jesus christ be with me.... I am still a proud american, texas loud, texas proud. \" others turned to their families, who may or may not have been present at executions. \" i love my family, \" said one, per yahoo. \" it's my hour. It's my hour. I love you. Stay strong. \" another said he hoped his death would bring \" closure or some type of peace \" to family members, adding, \" this has been a long journey, one of enlightenment. It's not the end, it's only the beginning. \" ( a witness tries to explain what it's like to watch an execution. )",

Although these studies provide important insights into the psychological dynamics of mortality salience, it remains an open question how individuals cope with the immense threat of mortality prior to their imminent actual death. In the present research, we therefore analyzed positivity in the final words spoken immediately before execution by 407 death row inmates in texas. By using computerized quantitative text analysis as an objective measure of emotional language use, our results showed that the final words contained a significantly higher proportion of positive than negative emotion words.

In one study, approximately two-thirds of breast cancer patients lost less than half their hair; in the other study, approximately half of breast cancer patients lost less than half their hair. The new york times reports 5 % of patients kept all their hair. The differences in effectiveness between the studies could have to do with the cooling caps being used, the medical centers applying the caps, and the chemo drugs involved, according to healthday news. The studies were funded by two different companies that manufacture cooling caps. Cooling caps are affixed to patients ' heads before, during, and after chemo; a machine cycles cooling liquid through the caps. While researchers aren't exactly sure how the caps prevent hair loss, npr reports, one theory is they restrict blood vessels in the scalp, reducing the amount of chemo that reaches the hair follicles. About half of breast cancer patients say hair loss is the most daunting part of chemo, and 8 % say they would turn down chemo in order to keep their hair. One breast cancer survivor who used a cooling cap says it has psychological benefits. She tells the times that losing their hair makes people \" think they're sicker than they actually are. \" ( a dose of magic mushrooms had a big effect on cancer patients. )",

With hugo chavez clinging to life, it was vice president nicolas maduro who today announced the government's move. He said one of the americans, identified as an air force attache named david delmonaco, had been meeting with military officers, spying on the military, and plotting against the government, reports the ap. Venezuela later said a second air force attache, still unidentified, also was being expelled on espionage charges. That wasn't all the bluster from maduro in comments made to reporters today, notes cnn: he asserted that the \" scientific proof \" would one day emerge to prove that chavez was poisoned by \" the historical enemies of our heartland. \" he likened the poisoning to what happened to yasser arafat.

            "In junior high school and elementary school, one of the worst things somebody can tell you is that you're a nerd. In many cases, being labeled a nerd is the kiss of death. By being designated a nerd or a geek, your social circle instantly shrink. Your social prospects, as well as how people relate to you change overnight. The good news is that as socially limiting and potentially problematic being nerdy may be in elementary school, junior high school or even high school, the reality is that nerds run the world. If you want to get a good idea of nerds that shaped the world in profound ways, you only need to look at bill gates and the people that invented the internet. These are guys that would just hangout in their cubicles and work on computer codes for several hours at a time. Growing up, they were very socially awkward and they tend to be focused on a limited range of interests. The reason nerds run the world, whether in the world of finance, software, technology, even policy is because being nerdy enables them a kind of freedom that helps them transcend social boundaries. Here are some key reasons why it's good to be nerdy. Nerds aren't limited by social expectations in elementary school, junior high and high school",

At the time, relisha had been living in a room with her mother, shamika young, her mother's longtime boyfriend, antonio wheeler, and her three brothers at dc general, a homeless shelter in washington, dc. Relisha apparently disliked the shelter so much that she was allowed to stay with relatives and even a shelter janitor, kahlil tatum, who was the last person to see her alive and who weeks later took his own life, reports al jazeera. Still, detectives have found no trace of relisha, and no evidence linking tatum to her disappearance, though court documents show he may have been posing as a doctor to excuse her repeatedly from school. And while some have blamed the police for not doing enough to find her, or young for raising her daughter in the environment she did, others say it's time to refocus on finding relisha. One of young's ardent supporters, brenda brown, organized a church service yesterday to \" do a revival for this girl, \" reports the washington post. \" people are focusing on the wrong things, \" she says. \" people are focusing on the innocence or guilt of the mother.

        "summary": "The number of women locked up in jails around the country is increasing at a level not matched by the male jail population, according to a report released by the macarthur foundation and vera institute. The guardian reports there were 14 times more women in us jails in 2014 than in 1970. Most of the increase comes from jails in small, rural counties, where incarceration rates for women nearly doubled between 2000 and 2014, according to the new york times. The number of women in jail in the most populous counties actually declined during that time. One of the report's authors tells npr the reason may be that rural counties lack resources besides jail for women with mental illnesses and other issues. The report found about one-third of jailed women have a serious mental illness — approximately double the rate for jailed men. Women are also two-thirds of the victims of sexual abuse by jail staff despite being only 13 % of the jail population. For these and other reasons, the report's authors conclude jailed women are more vulnerable than their male counterparts. Furthermore, they are largely jailed for minor infractions that don't impact public safety, such as failing to appear in court for a citation. There were about 110,000 women in jail on misdemeanor charges in 2014. Meanwhile, the number of men in jail — not to mention the overall crime rate — has been declining.",

( only those of the same sex ) asexual ( i think thats the right word ) - no romance options ever appear. Secondly - make every single romancable companion bisexual, this is crucial for this to work and you will see why in a moment. Thirdly - when the romance options normally appear the game does a quick check to see the characters preference and acts accordingly.

She left, and over the next few years, \" he created a very hostile work environment, where i felt sexualized, objectified, and unsafe. \" she says he made lewd comments and tried to kiss her, among other things; once, during a work trip to dc, she says he \" told me he'd spent the night with his ear next to the wall, listening to my movements in my hotel room. \" dreyfuss responded to teich's story, saying he was \" an asshole \" back then and \" flirted with all women, \" but he \" emphatically \" denies exposing himself to teich.

Local police and fire and rescue were able to remove the bird without incident and turn it over to the nearby bird emergency aid and kare sanctuary, whose owner, cynthia mosling, says the 7-year-old male will be released if all looks good post-checkup, reports cnn. He's been dubbed matthew, after the storm. Mosling, who herself had evacuated inland earlier in the week, says a driver saw a weird shape at an intersection in the grille of an oncoming car, but then noticed that it was moving and chased after the car. After telling the driver there was a bird in his grille, they called 911. Rescuers think the eagle likely flew into the parked car's grille while chasing prey, reports 6 abc. The sheriff's office says \" great job by all involved \" in a facebook post that includes several photos of the rescue.

The bbc reports maria do céu silva and 11 others made it through the fearsome blaze by hiding for more than six hours in the water tank outside her home in nodeirinho, which sits adjacent to the ic8 motorway that ended up littered with bodies of those trying to flee. Silva says the idea came to her after she was unable to get her 95-year-old disabled mother in a van to exit the area. More than 2,000 firefighters continue to battle the fires, one of which killed 62 people some 90 miles north of lisbon, as authorities are coming under mounting criticism for not doing more to prevent the tragedy, reports the ap. Portugal's leading environmental lobby group, quercus, issued a statement monday blaming the blazes on \" forest management errors and bad political decisions \" over recent decades. The association rebuked authorities for allowing the planting of huge swathes of eucalyptus, the country's most common and most profitable species — but one that's often blamed for stoking blazes. Emergency services have been criticized for not closing a road where 47 of the deaths occurred as people fled the flames. Wildfires are an annual scourge in portugal: between 1993 and 2013, portugal recorded the highest annual number of forest fires in southern europe, per a 2016 report by the european environment agency.

        "summary": "Fbi agents and government lawyers treated monica lewinsky so disgracefully that even a prosecutor said it had an \" unsettling effect on his own state of mind, \" according to a government report obtained by the washington post. The review conducted by government lawyers in 2000 describes how lewinsky repeatedly asked to see a lawyer or parent after she was first confronted by authorities and was \" crying, sobbing, regaining her composure, screaming \" during the 12 hours in a hotel room that prosecutors spent trying to persuade her to wear a wire against bill clinton. They tried various strategies to discourage the \" hysterical but very focused \" 24-year-old from contacting her lawyer. Earlier this week, lewinsky gave her own account of the 1998 encounter, describing how she was \" ambushed \" in a food court at a dc mall, how she was threatened with up to 27 years in prison if she didn't cooperate, and how authorities threatened to prosecute her mother as well. The report — which can be seen in full here — concludes that the actions of lawyers from kenneth starr's office fell short of professional misconduct, but the encounter \" could have been handled better. \" it's not clear why it has been out of sight for 14 years, though most key players in the case, including lewinsky, believed it had been sealed by the courts, the post notes.

It wasn't until the family moved in with a relative who wasn't on flint's water system that sophia's blood began returning to normal, the first evidence the family had that the service line under the street -- and not their home -- was the culprit. Now, with sophia facing an uncertain future, her parents are filing a lawsuit against the city and a raft of government officials they say lied to flint's residents and put children like her in harm's way. \" it's a crying shame they had to put all these children through this, \" luke waid told nbc news on monday. \" it's heartbreaking because my daughter doesn't have a voice of her own. \" sophia rodriguez waid, 2"

Washington, part of new hampshire's white mountain range, and since records began in 1849, some 150 people have died there. In february 2015, kate matrosova became one of them. Faced with winds of up to 140mph and a temperature of 35-below at the summit, the 32-year-old seasoned outdoorswoman died of exposure before rescuers could reach her. ( the boston globe wrote about the tragedy in depth. ) \" god only knows why she didn't turn back, \" one of those rescuers, steve dupuis, tells siler. The pair hiked mt. Washington recently, and before they hit the trail, a state cop told them about canadian francois carrier, who hadn't been seen since starting up the mountain earlier this month in flip-flops and a t-shirt. The search for carrier has been suspended, wmtw reports. The day after it was called off, siler notes, the temperature on the mountain was 20-below — and that's one part of the answer to the question of why mt. Washington is so deadly. \"mount washington sits at the intersection of several major stormtracks, \" a weather observer says, which creates extreme, unpredictable weather. On may 16, gusts on the mountain reached 109mph, per npr. ( see video here. ) the record, set in 1934, was 231mph. In addition to the weather, siler writes, mt. Washington consists of tough terrain, and the danger of avalanches and icefalls looms. Noting that the mountain, treacherous as it is, is easily accessible to inexperienced hikers, siler comes to the conclusion that, \" on washington, it's lack of preparation, not the mountain, that kills. \" ( the remains of a climber lost 16 years have been found in tibet. )",

That's why the chain's ceo has decided to let individual owners decide whether they want to offer the sandwich at that price to their customers, per usa today. Trevor haynes tells the paper that, after hearing complaints about how little franchise owners profited from selling the discounted sandwich — largely because of the high cost of the deli meats used to make them — they can now each decide if it makes economic sense in their area to hawk the footlong for just half a sawbuck. \" if you look at california, there's a very different cost of business than in arkansas, \" haynes says, adding the company wants to help each owner achieve \" a value proposition that fits with their economic model. \" other changes are also in the works, some of which are noted on the subway site. Among them: a store redesign and \" some more exotic tastes, \" including a spicier chicken sandwich. There's also a trial run for paninis underway in california. Haynes mentions one more challenge the chain faces: \" burger chains are big competitors, \" he says. \" we need to make sure we're playing in that arena as well. \" for much of sunday, in fact, subway's twitter feed was dedicated to bashing burgers, suggesting they're \" boring \" and \" routine. \" one restaurant consultant tells usa today the chain's revamps may be too little, too late. \" nothing has happened at subway essentially in 10 years, \" he notes. \" bold flavors and spices have been a big deal in restaurants for at least five years.

It's old news, but it became big news this week when variety revisited the case and reported for the first time that the woman involved took her own life in 2012 at age 30. The woman, who received a $ 17,500 settlement from penn state, had said parker and his roommate, jean celestin, raped her while she was drunk and unconscious. Parker and celestin said the sex was consensual. Parker was acquitted in 2001, while celestin was convicted of sexual assault, a ruling that was later overturned. Another factor in the controversy: celestin co-wrote the birth of a nation, which includes a gang rape as a pivotal scene. With talk of a boycott growing, parker is not shying away from the controversy, notes the los angeles times. In a facebook post, he expressed his \" profound sorrow \" upon learning of the suicide. Parker also says he welcomes discussion of the case, noting \" violence against women is not taken seriously enough. And the dialogue and the discourse isn't loud enough. \" but \" i was cleared of everything. At some point i have to ask myself, ' how often am i willing to relive it? ' \"",

        "summary": "The stakes just got even higher on the korean peninsula: north korea says the missile it test-launched early tuesday was an intercontinental ballistic missile, not the intermediate-range missile that us and south korean authorities initially said they detected. North korea's military described the launch of the hwasong-14 as the \" final step \" in creating a \" confident and powerful nuclear state that can strike anywhere on earth, \" though other nations have yet to confirm that the missile really was an icbm. The latest: authorities in japan and south korea did not comment on whether they now believe the launch, thought to have been pyongyang's most successful yet, was an icbm, the ap reports. Confirmation may require retrieving parts of the missile, which landed in the sea of japan. If the missile is confirmed to have been an icbm, pyongyang could now be capable of striking the us and will have a much stronger hand in dealing with washington, reports the guardian. According to us pacific command, the missile flew for 37 minutes on a very high trajectory, landing in waters japan considers to be part of its exclusive economic zone. In a look at the technical issues involved, cnn reports that pyongyang aimed the missile high to test it without causing a major international incident. Japan's prime minister shinzo abe said he will ask the leaders of china and russia to do more to help stop pyongyang's missile program, reuters reports. \" leaders of the world will gather at the g20 meeting. I would like to strongly call for solidarity of the international community on the north korean issue, \" he said. David wright of the union of concerned scientists says the missile could have reached 4,160 miles on a standard trajectory, which \" would not be enough to reach the lower 48 states or the large islands of hawaii, but would allow it to reach all of alaska. \" but experts believe that pyongyang still lacks the technology to target a place accurately or miniaturize a nuclear warhead to fit on an icbm, the bbc reports. Jeffrey lewis, director of the east asia nonproliferation program at the middlebury institute of international studies, tells the new york times that the missile appears to be the longest-range one north korea has ever tested. \" it's a very big deal — it looks like north korea tested an icbm, \" he says. \" even if this is a 7,000-km-range missile, a 10,000-km-range missile that can hit new york isn't far off. \" ( after the launch, president trump called for a \" heavy move \" from china. )",

Nyu researchers determined that 10 % of people suffer short-term complications such as a rash, infection, or swelling that last for days or weeks.

In the study published in contact dermatitis, the research team suggests it's time to set up a national database and a protocol for reporting problems. Those steps could help determine what's causing the reactions, such as particular chemicals in the ink, say the researchers. One nugget from the 300-person study is that red ink was used in 44 % of the tattoos that caused chronic problems, the highest percentage of any color. That didn't surprise the president of the alliance of professional tattooists, who, while calling rashes \" uncommon although not unheard of, \" tells today.com that \" some folks ' bodies do not like red pigments. \" no federal regulations cover tattoo ink, notes cnn, and it quotes a dermatology professor not involved with the study who praises it for calling attention to the subject.

Sanders, who had maintained his innocence, had been in jail since april 2016 but was released days after his sept. 11 trial was to have commenced following a phone call between prosecutors and the mother of sanders ' kids, cassie wright. On aug. 23, wright said her son had admitted to hitting 2-year-old ellie with a pillow with a heavy object inside. In an interview on aug. 29, the boy told prosecutors he had rolled the pillow onto ellie's head but couldn't get it off. It remains unclear how ellie suffered bruises and what appeared to be adult bite marks found afterwards on her body, but sanders ' lawyer says \" it's my understanding that [ the case is ] over; there will be no more charges coming out of it. \"",

        "summary": "Tangerine surprised audiences at the sundance film festival by depicting the gritty life of transgender prostitutes in hollywood. Another revelation: the acclaimed film was shot almost totally on an iphone 5s, the verge reports. Indie writer/director sean baker says it was a budgetary choice that came with other advantages. For one thing, the 5s allowed him to make easily improvised camera movements, like circling the actors while filming on his bicycle. They used \" all the benefits that thing has — the size, how light it is, how inconspicuous it is, \" baker tells los angeles magazine. \" we had to embrace it. And it quickly became an aesthetic choice. \" an iphone 5s film, aesthetic? yep, he says, if you know how to use it. What you need: an $ 8 app called filmic pro that offers careful control of color temperature, aperture, and focus; a steadicam to keep the iphone from shaking; and anamorphic adapter lenses, like the moondog labs prototypes used by baker's team. Still, the iphone-film concept was so new that his cast needed reassurance. \" i ' m like, jesus christ, man, i was on the wire, \" says james ransone, who plays a pimp in tangerine. \" i've ended up in iphone movies! \" but he came to appreciate the phone's flexibility — like shooting in public areas without permissions or restraints, slashfilm reports. Small downside: an argument between characters appeared so real that a bus driver called the cops. ( for more on iphones, read about a guy who strapped 94 of them to his body. )",

        "summary": "The us will soon have a dicey decision to make in regard to the failed coup in turkey. The government of president recep tayyip erdogan has formally requested that the us extradite the man it says is responsible for the uprising, moderate islamic cleric fethullah gulen, reports usa today. The 77-year-old gulen lives in small-town pennsylvania, 5,000 miles away from turkey, and continues to insist he had nothing to do with the coup. So who is this cleric? some related coverage: npr provides some quick basics: gulen used to be allies with erdogan until a falling out in 2013. Erdogan apparently suspected gulen was behind a corruption inquiry into his government. The guardian profiles gulen's life in tiny saylorsburg, pa., where he arrived in self-exile in 1999 and is seen as a friendly neighbor to the locals. He lives at a complex where his hizmet religious movement is taught. Gulen's followers are estimated to number between 1 million and 8 million worldwide. Cnn says his personal living quarters \" consists of little more than a bed and bookshelves. \" he gave a rare interview to the atlantic in 2013, expressing fears that democratic reforms in turkey would be reversed. \" i find it more tranquil here, \" he said of pennsylvania. Turkish followers of gulen are said to have created math and science charter schools around the world, including 160 that are publicly funded in the us. However, any official connection between the schools and gulen is denied. The washington post takes a look. Education week has more on the subject, rounding up investigations of the schools in multiple states. Critics, for example, have objected to the near-exclusive hiring of turkish educators, even though the schools get public money.",

Packing peanuts are also covered by the ban, although they will still be allowed in packages sent to the city from elsewhere. Nonprofits and businesses with under $ 500,000 in revenue can get exemptions if they can prove the switch will cause them financial hardship, although many establishments are expected to simply raise prices to cover the cost of the more expensive containers. \" the cheapest one is the foam.

Video from security cameras inside the beta theta pi frat helped authorities piece together the final hours of timothy piazza's life. Those findings, which penn state's president calls \" sickening, \" were released friday. According to nbc news, it started with a drinking competition called \" the gauntlet \" in which piazza and other pledges drank copious amounts of alcohol — despite beta theta pi supposedly being a dry frat. Videos show piazza unable to open a door and needing help to walk. Doctors estimate he had a bac of nearly 0.40, the ap reports. After stumbling around, piazza falls head first down a flight of stairs. Frat members carry him to a couch and attempt to wake him up, pouring water on him, slapping him, falling on him, and putting a backpack full of books on him. Prosecutors say frat members may have made piazza's injuries worse. When one frat member says they need to take piazza to the hospital, he is slammed against a wall and told to leave. Over the next 12 hours, piazza would fall twice, hitting his head at least once, before falling down the flight of stairs a second time. Upon finding him at the bottom of the stairs in the morning, frat members waited 40 minutes before calling 911. During that time they were allegedly planning how to cover up what happened. \" this did not have to happen, \" piazza's father said friday.",

        "summary": "Comcast is about to makes its residential internet service a lot more like smartphone data plans for millions of customers, the washington post reports. Starting nov. 1, comcast will be capping the internet usage of customers in 18 markets — including 12 whole states — at 1 terabyte. According to ars technica, comcast has had a data cap in place in some markets since 2012. For comcast customers who exceed the 1tb monthly limit, comcast will charge a $ 10 fee per additional 50 gigabytes up to $ 200. To avoid the data cap, customers can either pay an extra $ 50 per month for unlimited data or $ 300 per month for comcast's gigabit pro fiber-optic service. A list of markets that will be impacted by the data cap is here. Comcast claims the data cap is \" based on a principle of fairness \" — the people who use the most internet will pay the most for it. But engadget argues that doesn't make complete sense, as in only the most extreme cases does someone using more internet impact anyone else's internet usage. A comcast executive has also acknowledged that the data cap is a \" business policy, \" not a technical necessity. Comcast says 99 % of customers don't use more than 1tb of data — enough to stream up to 700 hours of video or play 12,000 hours of online games — per month. But that may not be true for long, with the increasing prevalence of hd and 4k games and videos that use more data.",

They were built in the 1960s and 1970s to send soviet cosmonauts to the moon, the guardian reports. Why use them? \" there are not many other options around the world in terms of using power plants of this size, certainly not in this country, \" says frank culbertson, an exec with orbital sciences. Concerns about the engines have previously been raised, both by congress and rival spacex. \" their rocket honestly sounds like the punchline to a joke, \" boss elon musk said in 2012. A similar engine exploded during a test in may, reuters reports, but the rocket has taken off four times before without accident. Other developments: culbertson says things appeared to be going wrong with the 14-story rocket within about 10 seconds of liftoff — it's just not clear what. \" we will understand what happened — hopefully soon — and we ' ll get things back on track. \" though no lives were lost in the explosion, hundreds of millions of dollars in cargo was, the guardian notes, pointing to \" classified cryptographic \" equipment. Nothing \" absolutely critical \" is gone, says a nasa official. But a meteor tracker, 32 mini-satellites, and a school experiment testing the growth of pea shoots in space were also lost, usa today adds.

        "summary": "The narwhal's distinctive tusk is actually a tooth, one that can grow to nearly 10 feet in length. It's almost never found on females, and researchers have a new theory as to why: it may communicate a male's fertility to its tusk-less counterparts. Researchers pored over anatomical measurements taken of 144 narwhals that were legally killed by inuits between 1997 and 2008. What they discovered was what phys.org terms a \" very clear correlation \" between the mass of their testicles and their tusk length. Quite simply, bigger testicles and bigger tusks seem to go together. As science explains, testicle mass is an \" indicator of fertility. \" so by extension, the narwhals with the longest tusks are likely the most fertile. The team suggests the tusk could be used to attract females, who would be able to judge which male would make the best mate. And in terms of mating, the size correlation was found only among mature males, not juveniles. As further evidence of their theory, the researchers note ( via io9 ) that \" captive female narwhal have been observed becoming excited by the presence of a tusk-shaped object such as a pole or broom handle in their pool, butting the object, and jockeying for position close to it. \" science notes that the tusk may serve other functions — it's been suggested as a sensory organ and weapon — but writes that \" the fact that it is not needed by females indicates it is not critical for survival. \" ( scientists recently defrosted an incredible sea creature. )",
