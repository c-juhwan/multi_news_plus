Alaska airlines flight attendant jenny stansel was one of the first people to come by, with a lasagna in hand. \" she said, ' you don't know me but here is some love, ' \" harskamp recalls to abc news.

They flew their first post-transplant flight together on july 23. Their friendship has grown since the transplant, with stansel on hand at the finish line of the mount marathon race in alaska june 24, during which harskamp climbed a 3,000-foot mountain. Her sign read: \" my kidney's other half is on that mountain. \" they're also working together to educate others on the importance of organ donation. It's a mission that is particularly important to harskamp, whose mother was passionate about organ donation but was unable to donate any of her own organs because she died of brain cancer, ktuu reports. \" there is nothing more fulfilling as a human being than to help another human being live, \" harskamp says.",

One intelligence source calls the fumble straight \" out of the keystone cops, \" but it also raised alarm bells about whether the report would be preserved for possible future release. The report is rooted in contention on capitol hill. It was only written after the cia admitted in 2007 to destroying videotapes of waterboarding detainees. After a 500-page summary of the report was released in 2014, revealing harsh interrogation techniques and so-so results, sen. Dianne feinstein had the full report sent to the cia and other agencies; sen. Richard burr then tried to get it sent back congress, which doesn't have to release documents under the freedom of information act, the hill notes.

        "summary": "Just days after the korean peninsula's top us military commander warned that north korea's nuclear production capability remains intact, some slightly more encouraging news: the country appears to be dismantling its main satellite launch site, the bbc reports. Us-based monitoring group 38 north reported monday that satellite images of the country's sohae station, believed by the us to be a test site for launching intercontinental ballistic missiles, appear to show that north korea has started dismantling \" key facilities \" at the site. And an official from south korea's presidential office said tuesday that seoul has also been detecting dismantlement activities at the site, the ap reports. 38 north calls it \" an important first step towards fulfilling a commitment made by kim jong un at the june 12 singapore summit \" with president trump, during which kim reportedly agreed to denuclearize. But analysts say that unless the entire sohae site is dismantled, north korea's military capabilities won't be diminshed. And sources tell cnn that north korea expects the us to reciprocate in the form of agreeing to a permanent peace treaty with pyongyang, that ensures the survival of kim's regime, if negotiations are to continue. Multiple sources recently told the washington post that trump, who has publicly been urging patience with the denuclearization process, has privately been expressing frustration with the perceived slow pace. But trump hit back at that report monday, tweeting, \" a rocket has not been launched by north korea in 9 months. Likewise, no nuclear tests. Japan is happy, all of asia is happy. But the fake news is saying, without ever asking me ( always anonymous sources ), that i am angry because it is not going fast enough. Wrong, very happy! \"",

            "Daniel rosenbaum for the new york times jamie dimon, jpmorgan chase's chairman and chief executive, testified before the senate banking committee about the multibillion-dollar trading losses incurred at his firm's chief investment office. Mr. Dimon has maintained that the loss was an \"isolated event \" without broader repercussions for customers or taxpayers. He has said that risk was necessary in banking, and said jpmorgan had the necessary strength to withstand the losses, which could eventually swell to $ 5 billion. During the hearing, mr. Dimon faced questions about how jpmorgan's chief investment office failed to clamp down on a complex derivatives trade that metastasized into an unwieldy and hard-to-unwind gamble that failed. He addressed queries about whether the firm's losses should prompt even tougher banking regulations, something mr. Dimon has long opposed. Here was dealbook's live blog of the hearing. With mr.

But now astronomers say that another star came five times closer about 70,000 years ago, they write at eureka alert. The red dwarf known as scholz's star came within 0.8 light-years of the sun when it passed through something known as the outer oort cloud, described as a region at the edge of our solar system filled with comets. Assuming the calculations described in astrophysical journal letters are correct, this is the closest any star has ever come to us, explains nbc news. The distance of 5 trillion miles is considered \" astronomically close. \" in fact, it came so near that our ancestors could have seen flare-ups lasting minutes or hours if they happened to glance up at the night sky. While a fly-by this close has the potential to create havoc, it appears that scholz's star did no such thing. \" there are trillions of comets in the oort cloud and likely some of them were perturbed by this object, \" a lead researcher from the university of rochester tells the bbc. \" but so far it seems unlikely that this star actually triggered a significant ' comet shower. ' \" as for that trivia question, proxima centauri is still the safe answer: scholz's star, formally known as wise j072003.20-084651.2, continued on its way and is now 20 light-years from us.

No more. This year the crown has gone to serena williams, who the huffington post reports is the first \" individual female athlete \" chosen since track's mary decker got the honor in 1983. Her friend sheryl: you can, and should, read si's full piece. But if you don't have the time, time excerpts a fascinating and poignant aspect to williams ' off-court life: her friendship with facebook's sheryl sandberg. Time describes williams as one of sandberg's \" key supporters \" in the wake of husband dave goldberg's accidental death. \" i just kept getting these messages from serena, literally every couple of days — for months, \" says sandberg. Her not-perfect diet: also in the \" don't have time \" category: sports illustrated itself pulls out five things it learned via its own cover story, which was written by s.l. Price. On its list: she loves chik-fil-a, and is a picky eater in general. From price's piece: \" she's sitting in her breakfast nook in bel air, eating an indeterminate bowl of takeout. Could be chick-fil-a; williams says she's addicted. \" about that horse: the selection of williams may be a win for women, but it's apparently a huge loss for the animal kingdom. The los angeles times reports that \" a lot of people seem to be upset \" about her win, and had apparently been gunning for triple crown winner american pharoah to be named top sportsperson. The lat runs down some of the problems with that. Perspective, people: in the end, it doesn't matter that much, writes chris chase in a for the win column for usa today. \" frankly, it's an overwrought award, \" he argues, pointing out that \" in 1987, the award was presented to eight ' athletes who care.'so let's not act like this thing is the end-all, be-all of sports awards. It has to be picked with sales and attention in mind and serena williams in a sexy pose is far better than another picture of american pharoah. \"",

A neighbor who knew him tells le figaro that lubitz \" was completely normal. He was very happy to have his job. He had attained his dream of having become a professional pilot. \" lufthansa ceo carsten spohr, speaking at a press conference today, per the guardian, said the revelation that the crash was intentional \" leaves us absolutely speechless. I [ wouldn't ] have been able to imagine that the situation would have got even worse. \" here's what else is known about lubitz: he was an avid runner and a member of montabaur flight club called lsc westerwald. Lubitz began his training in 2008; he completed it after an unexplained interruption of several months, per cnn. Spohr says there was nothing unusual about that, or the results of his training, but the company says it will look into it. Lubitz initially worked as a flight attendant. An american law enforcement official tells cbs that part of lubitz's training took place in phoenix between july and november 2010; lubitz was last in the us in october. Lubitz had passed all flight and medical exams and had been deemed \" 100 % fit to fly, \" spohr said. \" this is a shock. We select cockpit personnel carefully. \" spohr declined to discuss whether lubitz committed suicide, the guardian notes, saying, \" we can only speculate what might have been the motivation of the co-pilot. \" then rather more succinctly, per cnn: \" if a person kills himself and also 149 other people, another word should be used — not suicide. \"",

Per the bbc, health officials in the uk have set new guidelines regarding the bacterial infection mycoplasma genitalium, or mg, out of fear improper treatment could lead to antibiotic resistance. Huffington post uk reports the british association of sexual health and hiv ( bashh ) wants the public and healthcare providers to be aware of mg because it's not one of the infections sexual health officials commonly test for and, if untreated, it can lead to serious and lasting problems, especially in women. For them, untreated mg can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which can in turn make it difficult to get pregnant. Men can experience discharge and inflammation of the urethra. It is not known whether mg affects a man's fertility. Scientists have known about mg since the 1980s, however it wasn't until 2015 that the bacteria was shown to be transmitted sexually between partners. While rare ( only around 2 % of people in britain are believed to carry it ), mg is difficult to treat and often has no symptoms. Britain's new guidelines specify that healthcare providers should use a nucleic acid amplification test to diagnose mg and that, should testing not be possible, a patient should be treated as if they do have the disease. Per the telegraph, the guidelines stipulate that mg is to be treated with a week-long course of the antibiotic doxycycline followed by a second antibiotic course with azithromycin. ( health officials are afraid mg could join the ranks of what the cdc calls \" nightmare \" superbugs. )",

The investigation was jump-started in may 2017, after the hospital reported a higher-than-normal mortality rate in its neonatal unit housing preemies and infants with special needs. Medical experts tried to assess the situation but came up short for a conclusive explanation as to why the babies died. The police were then commissioned to \" rule out unnatural causes of death, \" per cbs. \" asking the police to look into this was not something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened here and get the answers we and the families so desperately want, \" the hospital's medical director, ian harvey, says, per the post. Still, harvey notes the neonatal unit is \" safe to continue in its current form, \" though it now transfers babies born before 32 weeks to other hospitals.

According to jezebel, photos mcdougal included in a \" throwback thursday \" tweet in 2015 seem to confirm anecdotes about the affair contained in the journal's report. The journal states mcdougal appeared ready to go public with the affair, signing a $ 150,000 contract with american media inc., owner of the enquirer, for exclusive lifetime rights to her story. But the enquirer never ran it. The journal reports this is a practice called \" catch and kill \" that tabloids use to keep certain stories from getting out there. As part of the contact, which the journal saw, mcdougal, who sources say expected the enquirer to run the story, was not allowed to talk about the affair with anyone else. American media, whose ceo is friends with trump, tells the journal it never \" paid people to kill damaging stories about mr. Trump. \" it claims the contract was for mcdougal to write a monthly column, among other things.

Alfred demaria, the state epidemiologist at the massachusetts department of public health and an author of the new report. \"traditionally there's no evidence that the drugs themselves can do this. \"",
            "A neurologist in massachusetts noticed the pattern about a year ago. He had seen four patients come in with amnesia — three who tested positive for opioids ( heroin or prescription painkillers ) and a fourth with a history of heroin use. Memory loss from drug use is not unusual, but when he peered inside their brains with a mri scan, he saw something really strange. All four patients had the same problem: little or no blood was flowing to their hippocampi, two slivers of tissue deep in brain, one on the left and one right, involved in memory. And the effect was symmetrical. Whatever had damaged the brains of these patients seemed to specifically attack the hippocampus neurons. With their hippocampi impaired, the patients couldn't form new memories. This is not how opioids are supposed to work. Could this be a rare undiscovered effect from existing opioids or"

Spider dog costumes also make a fun way to prank your friends, as evidenced by the popular youtube video from sa wardega featuring chica the dogspider chasing strangers in a furry homemade spider costume. The video shows wardega \"lifeless \" in an elevator with chico the dogspider standing over him and a large spider web that appears to have human limbs stuck in it. To make your own spider dog costume, you ' ll need some black velvet material, a purchased spider decoration, and a dog life vest. Fake fur can also be added to the legs of the spider for a more realistic touch, if desired. Craft stores such as hobby lobby and michaels crafts are a good place to look for spider decorations to use for your homemade dog costume. You will want to pick one that is slightly smaller than your dog, since a decoration that is too big will make it hard for your dog to move. Cover the dog life vest with the black velvet material. Cut off the legs of the spider decoration. Carefully sew them on to the sides of the vest.

The costume, which almost engulfs the dog, has a large, furry body with big, long protruding legs attached to it, and bounces around in an unnerving manner when the dog trots along. Wardega has filmed the dog in various situations, where it is unleashed in its spider-guise, at night, on unsuspecting passers-by. In one instance, wardega appears slain at the bottom of a lift, with the dog stood is on top of him, causing two women to run screaming out of a building when the doors open. Wardega has used suitable music for video too, reminiscent of a horror film, adding to the uncomfortable viewing of the prank – especially when a man walks out from an underpass to find a set of dummies wrapped up in rope and trussed up as though they were flies. In this instance, the man attempting to flee the scene becomes trapped in a make-shift spider-web created out of rope.

            "If your pampered pooch is truly one of the family, making a spider dog costume is an excellent way to include him in the halloween festivities. Spider dog costumes also make a fun way to prank your friends, as evidenced by the popular youtube video from sa wardega featuring chica the dogspider chasing strangers in a furry homemade spider costume. The video shows wardega \"lifeless \" in an elevator with chico the dogspider standing over him and a large spider web that appears to have human limbs stuck in it. To make your own spider dog costume, you ' ll need some black velvet material, a purchased spider decoration, and a dog life vest. Fake fur can also be added to the legs of the spider for a more realistic touch, if desired. Craft stores such as hobby lobby and michaels crafts are a good place to look for spider decorations to use for your homemade dog costume. You will want to pick one that is slightly smaller than your dog, since a decoration that is too big will make it hard for your dog to move. Cover the dog life vest with the black velvet material. Cut off the legs of the spider decoration. Carefully sew them on to the sides of the vest. If you have a little extra time, you can make your own spider legs for the costume using black felt and polyester fiberfill.",

            "Tony hayward says bp was ' not prepared ' for the gulf oil spill please turn on javascript. Media requires javascript to play. The former boss of bp tony hayward has admitted that the company was \" not prepared \" to deal with fallout over the deepwater horizon drilling rig disaster in the gulf of mexico and the media \" feeding frenzy \" surrounding it. In his first interview since resigning tony hayward said as the face of bp he had been \" demonised and vilified \", but he understood why. The blast on 20 april killed 11 workers and caused one of the worst environmental disasters in us history. It took five months for the well to be completely sealed. Bp was widely condemned for its slow response to the leak, which pumped out around half a million barrels of oil in to the gulf during the first month. Every day crude oil was still leaking into the ocean, us anger towards bp mounted. The world looked to bp's leader mr hayward for reassurance that the spill would be stopped as quickly as possible to limit the environmental and financial damage.

He somehow pieced together a makeshift radio out of a coat hanger and some wire to place a mayday call to the coast guard, which had stopped looking for the 67-year-old more than a week earlier, reports nbc news. The radio on his 25-foot sailboat was wrecked by the same rogue wave that broke both his masts, ingraham says. \" i thought i was going to die, \" ingraham said after he was picked up by a navy boat on tuesday. \" i hung in there. It took mental discipline. But these guys are real heroes and they save people's lives. I owe it all to them. \" the fish he survived on \" wasn't as good as a sushi bar, but that's how i hydrated, \" says ingraham, who kissed the ground when he made it back to hawaii yesterday. His son zakary says his father \" managed to macgyver a way to make that last call, and it saved his life. \" the 43-year-old lives in missouri with his family and hasn't seen his father for more than 15 years. \" i always wanted to find him and get in touch with him, \" he tells the ap, but since his father lives on a boat and has no email address or phone number, that wasn't an easy task. But now, he says, \" i ' m going to do everything i can to get out there as soon as possible. \"",

Trump supporters should \" treat the situation like you would if you'd put star wars wallpaper up in the kitchen: ' all right, i got caught up. I was excited, i made a mistake, and now it needs to go, ' \" he said, per the new york times. Kimmel suggested trump be promoted to a king with no power. \" we need to set him up in a castle... Lead him to the top and then lock the door to that castle — forever. \" other reactions: stephen colbert. The late show host played a clip of trump saying \" i think there's blame on both sides and i have no doubt about it and neither do you, \" and quipped: \" the only thing i ' m doubting right now is if you're still going to be president by friday, \" mediaite reports. Colbert also poked fun at trump for saying the white nationalists in charlottesville had a permit for their protest. \" you've got to give it to the nazis, \" he said. \" they always do their paperwork. \" james corden. The cbs host mocked trump for saying he waited until he had all the facts before commenting on charlottesville. \" it's true, he only makes a statement when he has the facts, \" he said. \" you know, like when he told us how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history. Or that time he told us meryl streep was a bad actress. \" seth meyers. Meyers introduced a new segment called \" breaking crazy \" to deal with what he described as a \" clinically insane \" performance. \" trump is like a bad waitress in a crappy diner who's trying to get fired so she can go to a concert, \" he said. \" congress, isn't this enough? cut bait on the president. \" conan o ' brien. \" in the press conference, president trump said that steve bannon was a good friend and not a racist, \" o ' brien said, per the washington post. \" then he said, ' oops, i meant to say, ' a good racist, and not a friend. ' \" the daily show. The most-quoted remark from the show was a tweet hours before airtime: \" today is the day donald trump became president of the confederacy. \"",

        "summary": "The democratic debate in flint, mich., on sunday night turned out to be a pretty good night for almost everybody involved, analysts say: neither hillary clinton nor bernie sanders had any disastrous moments, the city kept its devastating water crisis in the national spotlight, and the party could boast about a debate considerably more substantive than the last republican effort. On balance, more commentators say clinton was the winner, despite sanders spending more time on the attack than usual. Sanders \" didn't knock clinton off her game in any meaningful way, \" making the debate a loss for him, according to chris cillizza at the washington post. On \" guns, on failing schools, and on flint, \" clinton \" was confident and effective, \" writes cillizza, who was disappointed by sanders'dismissive \" excuse me, i ' m talking \" rebuttal to \" someone trying to become the first female presidential nominee in either party. \" with the delegate math on her side, all clinton had to do \" was avoid saying anything so tremendously, galactically stupid that she would sabotage her own success, \" and she succeeded with a smart and engaging performance, according to dara lind and libby nelson at vox. But sanders — who \" appeared more comfortable speaking about race and racism than he ever has before \" — also succeeded with a performance that would have made a very good impression on viewers previously unfamiliar with him, they write. Most clinton-sanders exchanges could be considered a draw, but she came out on top when it came to gun control, an issue where the senator from vermont is seen as vulnerable, writes glenn thrush at politico. She complained that when it came to a measure to make gun companies liable for killings, \" he had voted to grant ' absolute immunity ' in the senate, \" writes thrush. Sanders'response — \" what you're really talking about is ending gun manufacturing in america \" — will be spun by the clinton camp as standing up for the gun lobby, he predicts. With michigan voting march 8, clinton scored vital points by launching an effective attack over sanders ' opposition to the auto bailout, writes eric bradner at cnn. Overall, he writes, the debate was a big win for the democratic base, with both candidates spending so much time defending \" government spending and intervention, teachers ' unions, gun control, clean energy programs, and efforts to fight climate change \" that there was barely time to mention the republicans.

Lawyer sunkari janardhan goud filed a complaint in the southern indian city of hyderabad that claims the new england brewing company's \" gandhi-bot \" beer — an india pale ale that's branded with a robotic-looking depiction of the late pacifist leader — is \" condemnable \" and should be punished according to indian law, the bbc reports. Although the \" aromatic and fully vegetarian \" beer is described on the brewery's website as \" an ideal aid for self-purification and the seeking of truth and love, \" goud contends that the use of gandhi's likeness mars his image and violates the prevention of insults to national honour act, the hindustan times reports. Part of the problem: gandhi shunned liquor. In a letter up for auction last year from the leader to his oldest son, he wrote, \" i wish that you better die rather than resort to alcohol in any manner, \" the times of india reported. In a saturday facebook post, the brewery addressed the issue, stating that \" we take great care in creating a product we hope will not be abused in the manner that mahatma gandhi spoke of when referencing alcohol. \" the company adds: \" we apologize to any indian people that find our gandhi-bot label offensive. Our intent is not to offend anyone but rather pay homage and celebrate a man who we respect greatly. \" the post then claims that \" gandhi's granddaughter and grandson have seen the label and have expressed their admiration \" — though, as the bbc notes, no one's really sure which grandkids those may be. ( gandhi's blood was for sale back in 2013. )",

            "Vaccinia immunization, as given to prevent the spread of smallpox, produces a five-fold reduction in hiv replication in the laboratory. Researchers writing in the open access journal bmc immunology suggest that the end of smallpox vaccination in the mid-20th century may have caused a loss of protection that contributed to the rapid contemporary spread of hiv. Raymond weinstein, a family doctor turned laboratory scientist at george mason university, manassas, virginia, worked with a team of researchers from george washington university and ucla. The researchers looked at the ability of white blood cells taken from people recently immunized with vaccinia to support hiv replication compared to unvaccinated controls. They found significantly lower viral replication in blood cells from vaccinated individuals. Weinstein said, \" there have been several proposed explanations for the rapid spread of hiv in africa, including wars, the reuse of unsterilized needles and the contamination of early batches of polio vaccine. However, all of these have been either disproved or do not sufficiently explain the behavior of the hiv pandemic. Our finding that prior immunization with vaccinia virus may provide an individual with some degree of protection to subsequent hiv infection suggests that the withdrawal of such vaccination may be a partial explanation. \" smallpox immunization was gradually withdrawn from the 1950s to the 1970s following the worldwide eradication of the disease, and hiv has been spreading exponentially since approximately"

            "Vaccinia immunization, as given to prevent the spread of smallpox, produces a five-fold reduction in hiv replication in the laboratory. Researchers writing in the open access journal bmc immunology suggest that the end of smallpox vaccination in the mid-20th century may have caused a loss of protection that contributed to the rapid contemporary spread of hiv. Raymond weinstein, a family doctor turned laboratory scientist at george mason university, manassas, virginia, worked with a team of researchers from george washington university and ucla. The researchers looked at the ability of white blood cells taken from people recently immunized with vaccinia to support hiv replication compared to unvaccinated controls. They found significantly lower viral replication in blood cells from vaccinated individuals. Weinstein said, \" there have been several proposed explanations for the rapid spread of hiv in africa, including wars, the reuse of unsterilized needles and the contamination of early batches of polio vaccine. However, all of these have been either disproved or do not sufficiently explain the behavior of the hiv pandemic. Our finding that prior immunization with vaccinia virus may provide an individual with some degree of protection to subsequent hiv infection suggests that the withdrawal of such vaccination may be a partial explanation. \" smallpox immunization was gradually withdrawn from the 1950s to the 1970s following the worldwide eradication of the disease, and hiv has been spreading exponentially since approximately"

Police, meanwhile, have since arrested the three men.

I told them, ' if you touch me again, you ' ll get beaten up, ' \" says puja. \" they called a friend on the phone and told him to ' come over because we have to beat up some girls. ' \" the hindu reports that the girls began fighting when the men began harassing a pregnant passenger, too. It was the pregnant woman who recorded the altercation on her phone. The girls were eventually forced off the bus and say they fended off the trio yet again. The pregnant woman got off at the next stop and accompanied the sisters to the local police station in the northern state of haryana. Puja's view: \"a woman's rape starts the moment she withstands the dirty looks of such men. If you hit back hard, then only you can survive. \" the incident resonates in light of the gang rape of a young indian woman on a bus in 2012.",

        "summary": "Sick of missing appointments by milliseconds because of inaccurate atomic clocks? researchers say they could use quantum physics to create a timekeeper so accurate it could help explain some of the mysteries of time itself. The \" quantum superclock \" would involve multiple atomic clocks, each in its own satellite orbiting the earth and each carrying pairs of linked particles entangled in such a way that \" measuring a property of one of them instantaneously determines the same property for the other, \" nature explains — a phenomenon known as \" quantum entanglement \" that albert einstein called \" spooky action at a distance, \" notes forbes. In the case of these satellites, a central satellite would fashion its clock particles in an entangled state, then extend the entanglement to another satellite, and so on, until the quantum network is created. The linked clock would be far more accurate than anything that exists today, allowing for precise linking of financial markets, better space navigation, and even the detection of subtle shifts in space and time. The researchers say that in addition to measuring time, the quantum timepiece could measure the earth's terrain so accurately that somebody digging a tunnel under the us-mexican border could be spotted from space, science news reports. Much research remains to be done before such a superclock can become a reality, but \" we're trying to be a little bit visionary, \" says harvard physicist eric kessler. \" all the building blocks have been demonstrated in principle, and we want to show what might lie ahead if all these fields merge together. \" in the meantime, the us has unveiled what it says is the most accurate clock in the world.",

His testimony is significant because the defense team has insinuated kronk may have tampered with the placement of caylee's remains to snag a reward, notes ap. Lee anthony: casey's brother says he argued with their mother when she decided to send a private investigator, on a psychic's tip, to search on suburban drive. \" it was the first time i heard anyone in my family offer up they were willing to look for a deceased caylee, \" he said. The testimony appears to contradict cindy anthony's earlier testimony that she never sent private investigators to the area where caylee's body was eventually found. George anthony: casey's father denied having an affair with a woman known as krystal holloway or river cruz, though he did admit to texting that he \" needed her \" in his life. He also denied telling the woman, who was a volunteer working on the case, that caylee's death was accidental but \" snowballed out of control. \" click for more on the trial.",

The move, which brings the range to between 1 % and 1.25 %, had been seen as almost a certainty, and investors were more intrigued by fed chief janet yellen's plan to start rolling back the $ 4.5 trillion balance sheet, which it packed with government bonds and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to offset the crisis, the street reports. It was below $ 900 billion in 2007. Yellen said the balance sheet would be gradually rolled back in a process that would be as exciting as \" watching paint dry. \" the interest rate hike \" reflects the progress the economy has made and is expected to make toward maximum employment and price stability, \" yellen told reporters wednesday, pointing to job gains and moderate rises in economic activity. The fed admitted that inflation is below its 2 % target and is likely to stay there in the near term, forbes reports. Analysts tell the washington post that many people are unlikely to notice the effects of the rise in rates, though people with large mortgages or a lot of credit card debt may start to feel the pinch. \" for those where budgets are tight and their debt burdens have been growing the last few years, this is where the signs of strain begin to emerge, \" says greg mcbride at bankrate.",

Prosecutors in the city of vladivostok in russia's far east opened an investigation after drone video was released showing dozens of beluga whales and orcas crammed into holding pens in srednyaya bay, cnn reports. Prosecutors believe around 90 beluga whales and 11 orcas are being kept in the pens, likely for illegal sale to aquariums and theme parks in china. Cbs reports that some of the whales have been in the pens since july. International law has banned the capture of whales for anything but scientific and educational purposes, which would make the alleged russian sales illegal. Activists say at least some of the captured beluga whales appear to be calves, whose capture for any reason is banned. After an investigation, novaya gazeta said at least four russian companies were selling orcas and belugas to china. It accused them of plundering russia's resources as well as treating whales cruelly. \" where is it written that the biological resources of the country can be scattered left and right? \" the paper wrote, per cnn.

Eleven orca and 90 beluga whales are being held in the pens, and activists fear they are illegally being sold to chinese water parks and aquariums, contravening laws on the capture of wild whales. Some of the animals have been in containment since july, cbs news correspondent debora patta reported on wednesday. A video shared on social media on monday shows a whale being lifted out of a small container by a crane in preparation, activists believe, to ship it to china. It is illegal to capture wild whales except for educational and scientific purposes following a worldwide ban on commercial whale hunting in 1982. However, orca whales, or killer whales as they are often called, can fetch as much as $ 6 million at theme parks in china. Russian newspaper novaya gazetta has reported that the four companies that own the containers exported 13 whales to china between 2013 and 2016. Between 2012 and 2015, the companies allegedly involved were granted permission to capture ten orcas in the wild for educational purposes. However, seven of those whales were exported to china, where one was valued at over $ 1 million on a customs form. Earlier this year, russian authorities called on the interior ministry to launch a fraud investigation over the capture and sale of the seven whales.

My dad was a test pilot flying vulcan bombers and i wished i could be an adventurer like him. So in 1982, i saved up and planned my first trip across the north-eastern brazilian rainforest. After five months of trekking, being passed from one indigenous tribe to another, not really knowing what i was doing, i came across some goldminers who attacked me in the night. I was only 22, naive and very scared. In the darkness i fled towards my canoe. With me was a dog i'd found in a village a few months before; i'd healed its paw, and it had become my companion. But in the chaos, the canoe capsized and i lost everything. I ended up walking on my own, lost in the rainforest with only the dog for company. As we walked we got steadily weaker and, after about three weeks, i was starving to death; i had malaria and i was delirious. But the dog had become incredibly",

A federal jury in ohio found that dupont's contamination of the ohio river contributed to plaintiff carla bartlett's kidney cancer and ordered the company to pay her $ 1.6 million in compensatory damages, the columbus dispatch reports. Her lawyers argued that dupont knew c8 could cause cancer and showed \" conscious disregard \" for the public by downplaying its dangers after dumping the chemical into the river from a plant near parkersburg, w. Va., the ap reports. \" they made the ohio river their personal toxic dumping ground so they could make more money on teflon, \" an attorney said in closing arguments, per bloomberg. The thousands of plaintiffs in west virginia and ohio say they contracted one of six diseases linked to c8, which was used at the plant for decades, reports reuters. The bartlett case was the first of two test cases to go to trial, and bartlett's attorneys tell the dispatch that since this was the one that dupont picked, considering it among the weaker cases, the company is in deep trouble. A litigation analyst, however, tells bloomberg that the company actually \" dodged a major bullet \" because the jury decided not to award punitive damages, which could have been much higher. Dupont plans to appeal the case, and experts believe the company will probably end up settling with the plaintiffs — but not until there have been a few more trials.

        "summary": "Archaeologists who've spent five years digging up an ancient city in iraq's kurdistan region have finally learned its name — and it's legendary. Mardaman, once the capital of a mesopotamian province and its own independent kingdom, is believed to have begun as early as 4,800 years ago and is cited in sources dating to the akkadian empire, the first empire in history, report smithsonian and heritage daily. Archaeologists from germany's university of tübingen, however, didn't know the site they were working on top of until last year, when they discovered 92 cuneiform tablets inside a vessel covered in clay while excavating a ruined palace in bassetki. Deciphered from assyrian, the 3,250-year-old tablets identify the city as mardaman, then an important commercial hub in the middle assyrian empire, connected by trading routes to mesopotamia, anatolia, and syria, reports live science. It was also the administrative seat of an unknown assyrian province, headed by governor assur-nasir, per the tablets, which date to the time the palace was destroyed. \" all of a sudden it became clear that our excavations had found an assyrian governor's palace, \" lead researcher peter pfälzner says in a statement. While it isn't clear why the palace was destroyed — mardaman was repeatedly razed and rebuilt — the tablets appear to have been purposefully hidden afterward. \" perhaps the information [ contained ] was meant to be protected and preserved for posterity, \" says pfälzner. He adds the tablets, revealing assur-nasir's \" administrative and commercial affairs, \" show the city \" achieved a final significance as a middle assyrian governor's seat \" after its heyday between 1900bc and 1700bc, though it would keep flourishing for perhaps another 800 years, per live science.

The elder grosvenor was the third richest man in britain and the 68th in the world, according to forbes. Along with the fortune, the title of seventh duke passes to the baby-faced tycoon, who has reportedly made a splash only once: when he threw himself a $ 6.5 million \"black tie and neon \" bash at the family estate for his 21st birthday. Friends called the fair-haired duke down to earth and low key, though one news outlet found a photo of him wearing a pink teddy bear onesie at a costume party, notes the times. The new fortune is not without pitfalls, at least according to prince william. \" i do feel sorry for hugh, \" mused the future king, who picked grosvenor to be godfather to his firstborn. \" he's a lucky boy to be given all the material things in life, but he ' ll need to be robust mentally to survive. \" the british press is buzzing about the tax bill to come.

Courtesy of clem schultz clem schultz was sure the tornado weather forecasters were warning about was going to miss him, but he knew based on experience his fairdale home would lose electricity. So he went to an upstairs bedroom to get camping lanterns he and his wife, geri, would surely be using early on the evening of april 9 last year. He looked out a window and spotted a tornado to the west. He speculated it would stay south of his community, population around 150, about 19 miles northwest of dekalb. He decided to record its passage on his cellphone camera. But that black monster had other intentions, hopping the railroad tracks a block away. There was no time for the 85-year-old to hurry back downstairs to the kitchen where geri was. There was no point in getting in the cellar, which was basically a hole barely big enough to hold their furnace. In an instant the tornado passed right through -- literally -- his house. Schultz rode the debris from the collapsing chimney down, losing his grip on the phone, getting entangled in a bedsheet, and becoming buried. Moments later a neighbor was",

The house was completely destroyed, burying him in rubble. Though injured, he survived. But his wife, geri, was killed, as was a neighbour, with 20 others injured. Now, almost a year later, footage he shot of the tornado has emerged on vimeo, showing the massive twister slowly edge toward his home, first engulfing a neighbour's house before falling upon him with full force. Schultz told the daily herald he was upstairs getting lanterns when he spied the tornado. It seemed as though it would stay south of the community, so he pulled out his phone and hit record.

        "summary": "Nearly 190 sea turtles died off cape cod in a way no one wants to go — slowly freezing to death. The mass audubon wildlife sanctuary says the turtles were found \" incapacitated \" along the coast of massachusetts early friday, nbc news reports. \" a lot of the turtles were found frozen in the water still, \" says mass audubon's director, bob prescott. \" i picked up two to three myself that were still in the water, the slushy water. \" researchers say the turtles — among roughly 400 found this season — are fooled by warming waters that entice them to migrate further north. \" so when we get these quick swings from warm to cooler, the turtles that haven't made it south definitely get into trouble, \" says sea turtle biologist wallace nichols. Two nights of single-digit temperatures were enough to kill the turtles, which — like other reptiles — can't regulate their body temperatures because they're cold-blooded, accuweather reports. Water below 50 degrees fahrenheit immobilizes them and makes them float to the surface, wash ashore, and slowly freeze. On the upside, conservation efforts have improved their population rates and helped them migrate further than they have in years, but they're unprepared for sudden temperature shifts in those areas. Sadly, several critically endangered kemp's ridley sea turtles were among the dead. \" climate change is impacting sea turtles very clearly, \" says nichols. ( meanwhile, the us released a dire climate report in a way possibly meant to sideline it. )",

Baumgartner was planning to take a record-setting 23-mile dive today that would have given scientists their first look at the effect breaking the sound barrier would have on a human body, but the stunt was called off amidst winds that were too high for the massive-but-fragile balloon he was to dive from, the ap reports. The launch was originally delayed from yesterday to today in the hopes of avoiding such problems. Baumgartner will try again, but it's unclear when. The balloon can only fly in winds of 2 mph or less, and today's winds reached as high as 20 mph. Even at the right winds, there are plenty of ways baumgartner could die during the stunt, which is being sponsored and broadcast by red bull. \" i ' m not nuts, \" he tells cnn. \" of course i ' m afraid of dying. \"",

Then he tries to leave and walks smack into the closing doors.

            "Mike vega points to the area of sidewalk in madison, wis., wednesday, feb. 15, 2012, where he discovered a starving 15-year-old after she escaped from her abusive father and stepmother last week. The severely malnourished teenager had been forced to stay in an unfinished basement for years and an alarm would sound if she went upstairs, police records say. The teen told authorities she ate what she could find in the garbage and on the floor of her father and stepmother's madison home. Sometimes she was made to eat her feces and drink her own urine, according to a police affidavit. ( ap photo/todd richmond ) this photo released by the montgomery county police dept shows zakieya latrice avery, 28. Montgomery county police charged 21-year-old monifa denise sanford and avery with murder in the deaths of two of avery's children, a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old. The women are also facing attempted murder charges for injuring the children's siblings, ages 5 and 8. ( ap photo/montgomery county police dept. ) carnes reportedly left her 1-year-old son standing next to a mailbox outside the home where she though the boy's father lived in palmetto, fla. Police say carnes not only left her baby and his belongings at the wrong house, but that the 27-year-old mom hadn't told the father she was giving him their child. She was jailed and charged with child abandonment in manatee county, near tampa bay. In this undated photo provided by the philadelphia police department, carmen ramirez is seen. Police say the parents of a disabled 3-year-old philadelphia girl who died weighing just 11 pounds have been charged with murder in what authorities are calling her starvation death. Police say the parents, 30-year-old carlos rivera and 27-year-old ramirez, also face counts of involuntary manslaughter, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal conspiracy in the death of nathalyz rivera."

        "summary": "A 13-foot-high fence that stretches 109 miles along its border with serbia is hungary's plan for keeping in check what the washington post calls an \" unprecedented migrant crisis. \" \" hungary cannot afford to wait any longer, \" the country's foreign affairs minister said at a press conference wednesday, per reuters, which notes that hungary is a visa-free zone that lures \" tens of thousands \" of migrants from the middle east and africa who access the eu via the serbia-hungary route. Just this year alone, more than 53,000 migrants have asked for hungarian asylum, with more than 70 % of those seeking asylum over the past three months coming from syria, iraq, and afghanistan, the ap notes. Not everyone is thrilled with this plan. Serbian pm aleksandar vucic said on state tv yesterday that he was \" shocked and surprised \" by the idea, the post reports. \" we don't want to live in an auschwitz, \" he said. And, in what the paper notes seems to be a reference to the berlin wall, a european commission spokeswoman said yesterday, \" we have only recently taken down walls in europe. We should not be putting them up. \" but the hungarian prime minister points out there are already similar fences along turkey's borders with greece and bulgaria, both eu member states, the ap reports — though it's a protection that some don't think works. A rep from the belgrade center for human rights, for one, doesn't think the hungary-serbia fence will do much good. \" no wall has ever stopped migrations. They are unstoppable, \" he tells the ap.",

According to court records, fields traveled to charlottesville to participate in a \" unite the right \" rally, which was advertised on social media as a gathering of white supremacists and other sympathizers protesting the removal of a statue of robert e.

Fields, 21, of maumee, ohio, is accused of driving his car from the top of a hill down a narrow, one-way street toward a group of counter-protesters that was chanting and carrying signs in support of equality and protesting racial and other forms of discrimination. According to the daily progress, prosecutors say that when fields got to the \" racially and ethnically diverse \" group, he backed his car up to the top of the hill and then hit the gas and drove down the hill directly into the crowd. He allegedly struck and killed 32-year-old heyer and injured more than a dozen others before fleeing the scene. Fields is also facing 10 state charges that include first-degree murder and malicious wounding. He is slated to go on trial in november in charlottesville. In announcing the charges, which carry a possible sentence of life in prison, attorney general jeff sessions said, \"today's indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in america that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation, \" per the new york times.",

        "summary": "Kudzu plants have been choking the southeast for years, so at first blush it would seem that the 2009 arrival of the kudzu-eating kudzu bug from asia would be a blessing. No so much. It turns out the bugs favor a second crop as well: soybeans. And on the heels of new research, scientists fear the bugs could do serious damage to soybean farms far beyond the southeast, reports lab spaces. It explains how the quirks of the bugs ' life cycle are fanning fears: eggs laid in the spring develop into bugs ( generation a ) that eat only kudzu plants while they are young, and can move on to soybean plants only as they mature. These mature bugs lay more threatening eggs that hatch in summer ( generation b ) and can feast on soybean crops from the get-go. Given the diet limitations of the immature generation a bugs, researchers figured they wouldn't be able to migrate to areas without kudzu, the northern and western us. But using a greenhouse lab, north carolina state university researchers observed immature generation a bugs eating... Soybeans alone. The new research suggests \" kudzu bugs are potentially capable of spreading into any part of the us where soybeans are grown. And soybeans are grown almost everywhere, \" says study co-author dr. Dominic reisig, who notes they bugs are likely spreading by attaching themselves to planes and cars. Takepart reports while the bug has no natural predator here, insecticides are fairly effective in wiping them out — but that obviously means dousing crops in more chemicals. Bringing in a parasitic wasp from japan could hasten their undoing, but getting the ok to import an exotic species can take years.",

But there's just one problem: the kudzu bug is also rather fond of eating soybeans, and new research shows it can complete an entire life cycle on soybean plants, devastating whole fields of the legume. It also has no known natural predators in the united states.

        "summary": "What happens when an octopus takes ecstasy? apparently, the same thing that happens to humans — at least according to a new, admittedly small study run by gül dölen, a neuroscientist at the johns hopkins school of medicine. Ecstasy, also known as mdma, makes people feel more sociable, less defensive, and more interested in and loving toward other people; it causes similar effects in rats and mice. But the architecture of an octopus brain is completely different than that of a human, rat, or mouse, so dölen wondered if the drug would affect an octopus differently, the atlantic reports. To find out, she and a colleague looked at five californian two-spot octopuses. First, they established how social they were while sober ( octopuses are known to be solitary creatures ), and then they dosed them by submerging them in an mdma solution which they then absorbed through their gills. The first dose was too high ( the octopuses \" freaked out and did all these color changes, \" dölen says ), but after a lower dose, the octopuses spent more time near a trapped male octopus they had avoided while sober. \" they had this very relaxed posture. They floated around, they wrapped their arms around the chamber, and they interacted with the other octopus in a much more fluid and generous way. They even exposed their [ underside ], where their mouth is, which is not something octopuses usually do, \" dölen says. She tells npr \" they were essentially hugging \" the other octopus. But she admits the study should be repeated with more subjects, and experts not involved with the study point out some possible drawbacks: it's possible the ecstasy simply messed with the octopuses ' ability to detect a potential mate's chemical cues, says one; another notes that the octopuses could simply have been acting differently since they were more familiar with the environment by the time they were dosed.

But while the cause may still be disputed, the fact that 500 dead sea lions ended up on a peruvian beach is not. Both young and old sea lions were found rotting on anconcillo beach about 250 miles north of lima, the bbc reports. City workers removed the corpses — which were so decomposed that authorities couldn't immediately determine the cause of death — and dropped them at a local dump, rt.com reports. The governor of the samanco district has the most nefarious suspicion about the deaths: he wrote a letter to local police claiming the sea lions, which approach the shore looking for scallops and seafood, were poisoned by fishermen and marine farmers. Peru is no stranger to mysteriously dead masses of sea creatures. In 2012, close to 900 dead dolphins turned up on peru's northern coast, with an official saying they died of \" natural causes, \" cnn reported. In october of this year, 117 sea lions were found — believed to have died of starvation — in northwestern peru, while in early november, 187 dead sea lions ( as well as dolphins, pelicans, and sea turtles ) were found in the piura region, rt.com notes. Local officials have said they're going to investigate the latest slew of deaths. ( san francisco's famous sea lions suddenly disappeared in 2009. )",
