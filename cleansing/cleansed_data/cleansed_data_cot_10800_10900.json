        "summary": "Nightmares after a traumatizing experience might not have anything to do with stress. That's just one surprising finding to come out of what new scientist calls \" one of the largest ever studies of nightmares in the general population. \" to better understand why some people who've suffered trauma have bad dreams and some don't, oxford researchers gathered information on 846 people — including alcohol intake, amount of sleep, life struggles, and tendency to worry — then asked them to answer questions about the frequency and severity of their nightmares. They discovered that worrying before sleep boosted the chance of a person having a nightmare. But so did too much sleep, per the study in social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology. The researchers discovered that occurrence of nightmares increased with more than nine hours of sleep per night, which suggests nightmares aren't simply caused by a negative experience. As study author stephanie rek explains, sleeping in long stretches may result in more rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep, which is when nightmares usually happen, per the sun. In fact, the scientists theorize that it may be the disruption of sleep from one nightmare that aggravates worries and causes people to sleep longer on subsequent nights — resulting in even more nightmares. In another surprise, however, the survey showed alcohol, which also results in more rem sleep, was not associated with nightmares. This \" warrants more attention, \" rek says, per new scientist.

For the next three decades, eoanthropus dawsoni — better known as piltdown man, named for the location it was discovered — was seen as an important step in human evolution, a \" missing link \" between apes and humans. In reality, it was \" arguably the greatest scientific crime ever committed in britain, \" paleoanthropologist isabelle de groote writes in scientific american. In a study published wednesday in royal society open science, de groote and her team believe they've finally solved once and for all who faked piltdown man by combining, carving, and dyeing human and orangutan bones. After new scientific methods proved piltdown man was a fake in 1953, blame was placed alternately at the feet of dawson, a british paleontologist, a priest who helped with the excavation, and sir arthur conan doyle, creator of sherlock holmes — or some combination thereof, science reports. An expert says conan doyle's motivation would have been to get revenge on \" the scientists who mocked him for expressing a belief in spiritualism. \" but de groote's research puts the blame solely on dawson, who likely worked alone. She says piltdown man shows \" evidence of one hand, one maker, one signature. \" that maker is probably dawson, who was found to have committed at least 38 forgeries and desperately wanted to be recognized by the scientific community.

His \"ghost cats \" story in the december 2013 issue of national geographic opens with a surprising image of a big cat, not in the wilds of india, but in a location arguably as challenging for photographing his subject — downtown los angeles. Winter's task was to illustrate cougars — also known as mountain lions — in an urban environment. His research led him to biologist jeff sikich, whose work with a mountain lion population in the santa monica mountains national recreation area on the outskirts of l.a. Seemed promising. \"science-wise, this guy really knew what he was doing, \" says winter. Winter knew that if l.a. Was his city, he wanted movie stars. He had worked with big cats for many years and knew the importance of connecting these cats to something immediately recognizable. Having heard through the grapevine that a cougar was once spotted in cher's backyard, he quizzed sikich about the particulars of the mountain lion population's comings and goings. Winter recalls saying to sikich, \"wouldn't it",

Though the home had reached saskatchewan, robertson was told it had to be taken back across province lines in order to have permits reissued — \" so it's quite a surprise to see my house on your land, \" she wrote. Robertson says she has since learned the house mover was instructed to leave the house behind and tried but failed to contact maze and his neighbors. Maze now says the home is expected to leave his property thursday. And though he joked that he might be able to keep it \" under ' finders-keepers ' laws, \" he says its departure will bring a \" happy ending. \" ( a canadian couple accused neighbors of copying their house. )",

The straits times reports the first pelting happened at the end of february ( though china daily says it happened in early april ), when gawkers decided to throw bricks and pieces of concrete at kangaroos at the fuzhou zoo in fujian province to get them to hop around. A 12-year-old female marsupial was struck on her left foot, per abc australia, but although zookeepers tended to the animal's bleeding limb, they apparently didn't account for internal injuries. The kangaroo died a few days later, and a vet's report says it was probably from a ruptured kidney. Then, in mid-april, a repeat of the projectile-throwing, this time resulting in minor injuries to a 5-year-old male kangaroo who is expected to be ok. Per asiaone, the zoo's breeder says the kangaroos tend to rest for most of the day, with only a window of a few hours where they're active, and so visitors have on occasion thrown objects at them to spur them out of sleep or just get them to move around. The zoo does have cameras near certain animal enclosures, but they're usually turned toward the animals, not the visitors; staff is now vying for money for high-def surveillance cameras after these incidents. Meanwhile, the zoo will now only allow three kangaroos out at a time for public viewing, and it plans on stuffing the dead kangaroo and putting her on display.

        "summary": "The city of phoenix is on edge as president trump plans to visit for a tuesday evening rally. The hill frames the matter thusly: will there be more supporters inside the city's convention center — it holds 29,000 — or opponents outside it? one question in the balance is whether trump will publicly pardon ex-maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio for criminal contempt charges at the rally. Trump has publicly raised the possibility of a pardon, and any such decision surely won't sit well with protesters. Arpaio, for his part, tells kpnx that he doesn't plan to attend the rally, which begins at 7pm local time. \" my wife and i will watch it at home on channel 12, \" says arpaio. Nbc news, meanwhile, reports that vp mike pence will accompany trump to the rally. One factor that might not help the volatility factor of any protests: it's expected to hit 106 degrees tuesday afternoon, and temperatures should remain north of 100 right up until the rally begins, reports the arizona republic. Phoenix mayor greg stanton, a democrat, had asked trump to skip the rally, given the tense atmosphere in the wake of the unrest in charlottesville, va. The city's police chief promises \" maximum staffing \" to help keep things peaceful.",

        "summary": "The prevailing question the morning after donald trump's stunning victory is: how did so many get it so wrong? an \" absolutely unreal \" \" chance of winning presidency \" graphic on the new york times ' forecasting page tuesday evening showed trump ascending from a 20 % chance of winning the white house to near certainty within a few hours. Usa today says the upset dealt a \" devastating blow \" to the nation's leading pollsters, which had clinton mostly ahead overall in the months leading up to the election, including in battleground states. Some ideas as to why: the director of usc's center for economic and social research tells usa today human pollsters may have been at a disadvantage. \" there's some suggestion that clinton supporters are more likely to say they're a clinton supporter than trump supporters are to say they're a trump supporter. \" the president of the british polling council agrees, telling the telegraph — which makes the inevitable brexit comparison — that the uk has witnessed a similar phenomenon in that those who don't like to reveal their \" political sympathies \" are more often conservative than liberal. Politico offers a couple of possible reasons for the surprise switch, including surveys that maybe undersampled non-college-educated whites, as well as the \" surge in momentum \" trump got when the fbi announced it was looking into clinton-related emails just days before the election. The economist gets deeper into the numbers weeds, noting there can be a significant mismatch when trying to figure out two important variables: the demographics of the electorate, and the anticipated vote for each group. To wit: \" rural america is basically screaming at us, saying,'stop overlooking us! ' \" said nbc news ' chuck todd tuesday night, and the network reports that was backed up. Clinton hit her mark in cities, while trump exceeded expectations in rural and formerly urban districts. Australia's abc documents some of the pollsters \" now eating humble pie. \" among them: a \" reflective \" nate silver and princeton ace sam wang, who in mid-october tweeted, \" it is totally over. If trump wins more than 240 electoral votes, i will eat a bug. \" meanwhile, those who reported on the polling results are also taken to task by the new york times, which notes the news media \" by and large missed … the story of a lifetime, \" including the \" boiling anger \" of a good number of americans upset with their perceptions of the economy, the dc establishment, and the mainstream media.

        "summary": "Before aerys ii targaryen, the man known as the \" mad king \" was britain's king george iii, prone to bouts of mania that left him foaming at the mouth and writhing on the floor. There have been no shortage of theories as to what afflicted george iii, from psychotic to physiological disorders. Now, new research shows the king, who ruled britain and ireland from 1760 to 1820 ( yes, america successfully revolted under his watch ), was indeed suffering mental illness in his later years. Researchers examined hundreds of the king's handwritten letters, live science reports, comparing earlier scribblings from when he seemed healthy with those from later in his 60-year reign when his manic episodes flared. The team programmed a computer to recognize writing characteristics of those with mental disorders using 29 markers, including sentence structure, vocabulary, and word repetition. The loquacious king \" wrote very differently when unwell, \" co-author peter garrard of st. George's university of london says in a statement. \" in the manic periods, we could see that he used less-rich vocabulary and fewer adverbs. He repeated words less often, and there was a lower degree of redundancy, or wordiness, \" garrard says. A 1969 study said the king suffered a metabolic disorder called porphyria that turned his urine blue ( a theory borrowed by the madness of king george ), while another said exposure to arsenic aggravated his condition, per live science. Writing in the journal plos one, the authors lay out their finding: \" acute mania now appears to be the diagnosis that fits best with the available behavioral data. \" ( this american claims he is the rightful next king of england. )",

Metropolitan areas examined the american middle class is losing ground in metropolitan areas across the country, affecting communities from boston to seattle and from dallas to milwaukee. From 2000 to 2014 the share of adults living in middle-income households fell in 203 of the 229 u.s. Metropolitan areas examined in a new pew research center analysis of government data. The decrease in the middle-class share was often substantial, measuring 6 percentage points or more in 53 metropolitan areas, compared with a 4-point drop nationally. The shrinking of the middle class at the national level, to the point where it may no longer be the economic majority in the u.s., was documented in an earlier analysis by the pew research center. The changes at the metropolitan level, the subject of this in-depth look at the american middle class, demonstrate that the national trend is the result of widespread declines in localities all around the country. This report encompasses 229 of the 381 \"metropolitan statistical areas \" as defined by the federal government. That is the maximum number of areas that could be identified in the census bureau data used for the analysis and for which data are available for both 2000 and 2014 ( an accompanying text box provides more detail ).

        "summary": "South korea is embroiled in a complex political scandal that threatens to bring down president park geun-hye. Park has been caught seeking input on key speeches from soon-sil, a personal friend with no official government position. Quartz describes soon-sil as a cult-like figure, a \" rasputin-like mystery woman \" who exerts a powerful spiritual influence over park. While park has admitted to and apologized for seeking soon-sil's opinion on her speeches, the wall street journal reports that the scandal goes beyond that. Allegations are flying that soon-sil had access to official government documents and exerted an unusual level of control over park, down to telling the leader what colors she was allowed to wear. The story goes back almost 40 years, to soon-sil's father, choi tae-min. Choi founded a cult-like sect in korea called the church of eternal life and had close ties to park's father, former president park chun-hee. He has long been accused of meddling in politics and wielding a spiritual, almost unworldly influence over park's family. The new york times quotes a 2007 leaked diplomatic cable that described a rumor that choi \" had complete control over park's body and soul during her formative years and that his children [ including soon-sil ] accumulated enormous wealth as a result. \" now, critics and opponents of the current government say soon-sil is assuming the same behind-the-scenes role her father occupied. Thousands gathered in seoul on saturday to call for park's resignation over the scandal. So far, five senior aides have resigned.",

        "summary": "Five members of an \" unsanctioned \" fraternity at the state university of new york at albany have been charged in the hazing death of a pledge. Olaf jablonski, yuval sucov, jonathan maldonado, steven vila, and keith rosengarten, 20 to 22, are charged with first-degree hazing after 19-year-old trevor duffy died after an initiation ritual for zeta beta tau on nov. 15, 2014, reports nbc news. Police say duffy and other pledges were forced to drink 60 ounces of vodka. A student says she found duffy passed out in a shower with rosengarten — his \" big brother \" who was monitoring his intake, students allege — standing over him around 1am. An hour later, duffy's lips were bluish purple, she says, per the albany times union. She adds she yelled for someone to call 911, but several men debated whether to do so. They eventually moved duffy outside to keep police from entering the residence. Duffy was rushed to a hospital, where his blood alcohol level registered.583 — more than seven times the legal driving limit, reports the wall street journal. He died nov. 17. One of four other students taken to the hospital says he was told his blood tested positive for various drugs, though he didn't knowingly take any. A suny albany rep says 24 people were sanctioned after a university investigation, and some were expelled, including rosengarten, who petitioned the state supreme court to reverse the ruling. Court documents show frat members had assured duffy that no one ever died in hazing rituals just hours before. The university says zbt lost recognition as a campus frat in 1997 but kept an underground presence. A zbt chapter that reformed on campus in 2011 was separate from the one linked to duffy's death. ( five frat members face 20 years over this hazing death. )",

Prosecutors claim gray died from a spinal injury while in the back of a police van. In his first chance to defend himself, porter says he didn't call for an ambulance despite gray's repeated requests for a medic because gray \" was unable to give any reason for any kind of medical emergency \" and didn't show signs of having one, reports the baltimore sun. He says he heard gray claim he couldn't breathe during his arrest but not while in the back of the van. Overall, porter and his defense attempted to paint a picture of an officer who was trying to do what was right but \" didn't know what the situation was, \" the sun reports. Porter demonstrated how he helped gray off the floor of the van during one of its stops. He also claims he told the van's driver — who had \" primary responsibility \" — they needed to take gray to the hospital but couldn't order the driver to do so. He says when he found gray unconscious during another stop, he tried to stabilize his airway and waited with him until a medic arrived. \" it was a very traumatic day for me also, \" porter says. \" just seeing him in the neighborhood every day, then calling his name and not getting a response. \" as for why gray wasn't wearing a seatbelt in the van, porter says in hundreds of incidences he's never seen arrestees belted in.",

            "What led to mistrial for officer william g. Porter in freddie gray case prosecutors and defense lawyers have sparred for days on many issues in the trial of officer william g. Porter, who faced four charges in the april death of freddie gray. Jurors have not specified why they were deadlocked, but here's a summary of key conflicts that confronted jurors: when gray's injury occurred: dr. Carol allan, the assistant state medical examiner who performed the autopsy on gray, said he was injured between the second and fourth stops. She would not have ruled the death a homicide, she said, had porter or the van's driver, officer caesar r. Goodson jr., sought medical care for gray at the fourth stop. A defense witness, dr. Vincent dimaio, said gray's catastrophic injury must have occurred between the fifth and final stops of the van. Had it occurred any earlier, gray would not have been able to ask for help, kneel, or move his body in any way. Seat-belting: prosecutors argued that baltimore police department rules clearly require officers to seat-belt arrestees. Porter's lawyers argued that police rarely seat-belted prisoners and that the departmental rule — updated just weeks before gray died — was not well-known. Medical care: prosecutors argued that departmental rules require officers to provide medical care"

Per a dhs document reuters saw, the agency has pored over the \" existing funds and resources \" president trump said would be tapped to pay for a wall along the country's border with mexico, and it only came up with about $ 20 million — or $ 21.58 billion short of the $ 21.6 billion it's expected to take to erect a wall and accompanying fence along the entire stretch. The report, which dhs is said to have presented to congressional budget staff last week, notes that amount could get some signatures on contracts for wall prototypes, but it wouldn't cover breaking ground on any structures. Mic notes that, based on dhs estimates, the newly found reserves would pay for \" one whole mile of wall \"; the us-mexico border spans about 2,000 miles, per cnbc. Trump's wall plans, spelled out in a january executive order, stated that the us would pay for the wall with government funds and that reimbursement would later come from mexico ( though mexico has said repeatedly it won't be paying a cent ). Fox news notes that trump initially said the wall would cost just $ 12 billion; he said at the time that wall-building would begin in just \" months. \" that timeline may need to be tweaked as the president likely goes to plan b for making up the shortage: asking congress for the rest. Speaker paul ryan has previously indicated he'd work funding for the wall, which he estimates would cost between $ 12 billion and $ 15 billion, into the next fiscal year's budget.",

Simon lewis adds. Not only did his crew have to deal with wet feet during their three-week trek: they also faced gorillas, crocodiles, and elephants en route, and had to build platforms whenever they wanted to set up camp, reports the guardian. Satellite photos suggested the bog's existence, but it was the researchers ' journey that confirmed it. The bog has an area of between 40,000 and 80,000 square miles, and its peat is as much as 23 feet deep. The result is billions of tons of the stuff, the bbc reports. Because peat is typically \" a big carbon sink, \" lewis says, scientists want to learn more about how the giant bog has affected the world's climate. They're bringing samples to britain for analysis, which could reveal new information about a changing climate over 10,000 years. Interesting side note: less than 3 % of the planet's land is covered in peat, but those lands could house twice the carbon that all of earth's forests do.",

Attorney larry army jr. Also said at a wednesday presser that kennedy would eventually reveal the \" nature and extent \" of his relationship with the ex-patriots player. But sources tell tmz the third letter was actually penned to hernandez's lawyer, jose baez, who issued a statement tuesday via nbc's profootballtalk bashing whispers of a letter \" to a gay lover, in or out of prison \" as \" false \" and calling the rumors \" malicious leaks used to tarnish someone who is dead. \" per the boston globe, however, army says the letter may have been written in a kind of prison code, and that his client may have been referred to by his prison nickname. Army also revealed hernandez had referenced suicide weeks before his death in a different letter to kennedy, writing, \" i think i ' m going to hang it up. \" he adds his client wants a $ 47,000 watch he says hernandez gave him, the ap reports. Rumblings about the men's relationship began after a newsweek story claiming the third letter was left to hernandez's \" prison boyfriend, \" subsequently id'd by the daily mail as kennedy, who's serving a sentence for armed robbery.

            "San francisco — for apple, the hard part — making a smartwatch — is nearly over. Soon it will be time for the harder part: selling the long-anticipated apple watch to consumers who, so far, are not very excited about the idea of wearing computers on their bodies. The first batch of smartwatches from companies like samsung electronics, motorola and lg did not sell well, nor were they particularly well reviewed. And wearable devices like the google glass eyewear that got mainstream attention — if not sales — were greeted with considerable skepticism. But apple has been in this situation before. Most consumers didn't care about computer tablets before apple released the ipad, nor did they generally think about buying smartphones before the release of the iphone. In both cases, the company overcame initial skepticism. The apple watch"

The must-see tv was dialogue-free, reports the new york times, and filming it was not without its drama. The goal was to shoot it in a single take, and the first two efforts at doing so flopped, due to too much smoke and a burnt-out light bulb. The commercial aired at 1pm saturday on my9, a station in duluth, minn., and wrapped up at 2am sunday with quite the climax: the previously shut door to the smoker opened, the brisket was removed, and the sandwich was made. Why duluth? the town's news tribune asked that, and got a sort-of answer from a rep for the company, which says a commercial of that length \" required that we cast a pretty wide net. There were very few folks who could do this the right way, and we had the most confidence in working with my9. \" the commercial then aired a single time online, and will next head to youtube.

            "Television commercials have grown shorter over the decades, with 60-second spots the norm at the dawn of the medium, 30-second spots growing popular in the 1970s, and 15-second spots catching on in the 1980s. The number of 15-second ads grew more than 80 percent between 2008 and 2012, according to nielsen, which notes the popularity of mobile devices, where commercials must impress quickly as users toggle among apps. Arby's, however, is about to air a commercial long enough to tax the battery life of even the heartiest of mobile devices — 13 hours. When it appears once on a single television station in duluth, minn., beginning saturday afternoon, it is expected to enter the guinness book of world records, shattering the record for the longest television commercial of 60 minutes, held by the nivea brand for a spot that ran in switzerland in 2011.

The survivors were \" severely traumatized, \" per a police official; global news reports one lost an eye. Calgary mayor naheed nenshi came to winsport's defense, saying it \" has been running this facility for many, many years with enormous safety and sometimes there's a point where there's no more you can do. \" as for the red-headed twins, their family describes them as generous high-achievers: straight-a students who participated in a robotics contest ( evan ), could walk a dog while atop a unicycle ( jordan ), and both worked to help refugees settle into their new lives in canada. While police have not explained how the teens gained access to the track, the globe and mail notes that \" because of cop's size and purpose, intruders can easily access parts of the complex. \"",

In her piece for the cut, gann says that when the woman she was conversing with asked her what she would have done had prenatal tests revealed dudley had cf, she thought: \" i do know exactly what it is i would have done. \" she says she and her husband, tag, had discussed their options even before she became pregnant, and they'd jointly agreed they would have an abortion if something was wrong with the fetus. Which leads to the unique situation gann now finds herself in: trying to save her son's life by showing she would've ended it before it started. That's because she and tag have filed a wrongful-birth lawsuit, a complaint against a practitioner for failing to diagnose or inform parents-to-be about the possibility of a severe condition. When plaintiffs win these cases, the awarded funds go toward the often \" astronomically high \" costs of the child's medical care. \" in other words, a mother desperate to help her child declares that she would not have had that child, \" gann writes. She documents the pushback from anti-abortion activists for this type of suit, her \" biological remorse, \" and the hatred she sometimes feels for mothers who choose to not even get tested. This, despite her concession that advances in cf have extended life spans and furthered patients ' hope: \" it's something almost beyond me to imagine, looking into dudley's eyes and saying, ' i ' m sorry i didn't save you, from your own life.

        "summary": "\" he has been gasping for more than an hour, \" lawyers said in an emergency appeal to halt the botched execution of arizona inmate joseph rudolph wood yesterday. \" he is still alive. \" as the hour mark passed, wood's lawyers filed an appeal to a district court and even called supreme court justice anthony kennedy, the new york times reports. Kennedy declined to halt the execution, while the district court didn't respond until after wood had died, almost two hours into a process that usually takes around 10 minutes. Gov. Jan brewer has ordered an investigation into the execution of the 55-year-old who murdered his estranged girlfriend and her father in 1989. State officials say wood was comatose and didn't suffer during the execution. \" he was snoring, \" says a spokeswoman for the arizona attorney general. \" there was zero gasping or snorting, and that's just the truth. He was asleep. \" members of the press who witnessed the execution, however, say they heard a lot of gasping: \" he gulped like a fish on land, \" writes michael kiefer at the arizona republic. \" the movement was like a piston: the mouth opened, the chest rose, the stomach convulsed. And when the doctor came in to check on his consciousness and turned on the microphone to announce that wood was still sedated, we could hear the sound he was making: a snoring, sucking, similar to when a swimming-pool filter starts taking in air. \" \" wood's jaw dropped, his chest expanded, and he let out a gasp. The gasps repeated every five to 12 seconds, \" writes astrid galvan at the ap. \" they went on and on, hundreds of times. An administrator checked on him a half-dozen times. He could be heard snoring loudly when an administrator turned on a microphone to inform the gallery that wood was still sedated, despite the audible sounds. \" wood's lawyer had sought to delay the execution over concerns about the source of the lethal-injection drugs and the qualifications of the executioners. A federal judge who ruled on the case called the lethal-injection system \" inherently flawed \" and argued for a return to firing squads.",

The post has racked up more than 300,000 facebook \" reactions, \" just eight of them \" angry, \" and thousands of comments — most of them supportive, fox 8 notes. Of course, not everyone has been completely on board with knaack; one commenter, for example, wondered why knaack hadn't used the money to start saving to buy a house, while another wondered why she doesn't have a better-paying job. In an update thursday, knaack said that she never expected to go viral, but made her post public in case her friends wanted to share it. \" as of january 3rd i celebrated 3 years clean, \" she wrote, and she thought perhaps \" a recovering addict would see it and see that life off the streets is possible and for any single moms to ( know ) it is possible to survive on ( your ) own. \" ( this single mom donned a mustache for her kid. )",

Miguel morin was 8 months old when he disappeared with a woman, who his mother considered a friend and who was the child's godmother. Krystle rochelle tanner was supposed to watch miguel for only one night, but they disappeared in november of 2004. The distraught mother said she called police and did everything to find her baby. \" i prayed every night that he was safe, loved and he would come home one day, \" said champion-morin.

Jimmy, a 7-year-old bloodhound, and hector, a 4-year-old belgian malinois, were left in the back of officer nelson enriquez's suv all day wednesday after they finished a midnight shift, the miami herald reports. Police say enriquez, a 13-year veteran of the force, was home by \" mid-morning \" and called them around 7pm after he discovered the dogs, who had died after hours alone in the hot vehicle in his driveway. Enriquez lived with the dogs and has been their only handler since they were donated to the force, local 10 reports. Enriquez has been suspended with pay while the deaths are investigated by police in hialeah and in davie, where the officer lives. The dogs \" lived in the house with the officer, \" hialeah police sgt. Carl zogby tells local 10. \" they're full members of the family. In fact, i ' m hearing his children wouldn't go to sleep if the dogs weren't in the house. \" zogby tells the herald that enriquez, whose shift had lasted a few hours longer than usual because jimmy was needed in the search for an elderly person, is \" extremely distraught. \" the bloodhound, who was named after murdered 9-year-old jimmy ryce, was donated to the department by the jimmy ryce center for victims of predatory abduction, reports the miami new times. Ryce's father, who founded the center, says he's \" deeply saddened \" to hear of the deaths. ( last week, a police dog rescued an ambushed officer in mississippi. )",

        "summary": "Russia has been dropping bombs on syria for nearly a year now in its bid to help president bashar al-assad win his civil war, but tuesday marked an important first in the fighting: russian bombers took off from a base in iran for strikes on aleppo and two other provinces. This marks the first time russia has used a third country for its syrian strikes, and \" it is virtually unheard of in iran's recent history to allow a foreign power to use one of its bases to stage attacks from, \" observes the ap. Related coverage: the move \" is a demonstration of the growing warmth in ties between moscow and tehran, the syrian government's two closest allies, \" reports the bbc. But the move also comes amid reports that russia is reaching out to the us for help in lifting the siege of aleppo, where 2 million people are trapped in newly intensified fighting. Reuters has details. Given that the us and russia essentially back opposite sides in the war, any such agreement would be extremely difficult to pull off, explains the new york times. Their one common foe: isis. But \" the developments suggested that russia wished to avoid the appearance of responsibility for the suffering in aleppo, the once-thriving commercial epicenter of northern syria that has been a strategic battleground for much of the war. \" human rights watch says russia and syria have repeatedly used incendiary weapons in civilian areas in recent weeks. A q&a at bloomberg explains why aleppo is so important: if anti-assad forces are pushed out, it could turn the war. Nbc news provides a look at an underground hospital for kids in aleppo. Doctors in aleppo have pleaded for help from president obama.",

Mohammad hossain said he and the fellow university of illinois at chicago freshman who accused him of rape had consensual sex on feb. 21, and a court found there was not enough evidence to move ahead with the case. But after the february encounter, he also allegedly sent four pictures of his accuser — nude in two of them, partially nude in the other two, and \" blindfolded and gagged, \" a prosecutor says — to some of his friends. The woman said she didn't consent to or know about the photos, and hossain turned himself in and was arrested tuesday. Uic has suspended him, nbc chicago reports. The pictures were discovered in march after uic police got a search warrant for hossain's facebook page, the chicago tribune reports. Hossain has been charged with illegally taking and distributing the photos, but his attorney says he's confident the law is on their side: the statute in question says, \" it is unlawful for any person to knowingly make a video record or transmit live video of another person in that other person's residence without that person's consent, \" and the pair was in hossain's dorm room at the time, the attorney points out. During the feb. 21 encounter, hossain's accuser has said that she consented to being tied up — she had just seen fifty shades and notes that she and hossain were \" friends with benefits \" who'd slept together before — but did not agree to sex. She says hossain beat her as well, as she begged him to stop. Before allegedly distributing the photos of her afterward, police say, hossain posted publicly on facebook: \" i ' m finally satisfied...

Nicaraguan bismarck espinosa martinez, a 32-year-old security guard who'd been staying in the apartment next-door to stefaniak, was arrested after making conflicting statements to police, report the bbc and cnn. Early reports suggested a security guard had seen stefaniak leave the airbnb in a car around 5am on nov. 28, her 36th birthday, though that now seems unlikely. Investigators say suspected blood was found inside the airbnb, while stefaniak's body — showing neck lacerations and blunt force trauma to the head, per the ap — was partially buried some 200 feet away. \" carla's father confirmed that the body belongs to carla, \" reads a post on a facebook group set up to help find stefaniak, noting family members \" will release critical digital leads of the investigation \" and \" continue asking questions about the involvement of others in carla's murder \" in the coming days. Stefaniak had arrived in costa rica on nov. 22 with her sister-in-law, who returned to the us on nov. 27, a day before stefaniak was to fly home to miami. She seemingly vanished after complaining about a power outage at the \" sketchy \" airbnb in san jose's san antonio de escazu neighborhood. Officials say martinez was detained after surveillance video from the apartment conflicted with his statements. Considered a flight risk, he's being held in jail, per cnn.

        "summary": "Toronto police have a strange mystery on their hands: someone dug an impressive tunnel near york university, but they have no idea who or why, reports the bbc. In fact, a police tweet sums things up: \" if you built a tunnel near rexall centre in toronto give us a call, k? \" it was no amateur effort: at 33 feet long and nearly 7 feet high, the tunnel had reinforced walls, a gas generator, extension cords, moisture-resistant light bulbs, and a sump pump to remove water. The builders ( police think it likely involved more than one person ) used a pulley system to remove dirt as they dug the tunnel, which has since been filled in. One other find: a rosary tacked to the wall, with a poppy attached. \"i don't have any evidence that suggests criminality at this point, \" said deputy police chief mark saunders. \"but bear in mind i don't have the intent behind this at this point, that could change. I ' m open to anything right now. \" the toronto star notes that the tunnel was about 30 yards from the fence of the campus'rexall centre, which will be hosting tennis events for the pan am games this summer. But police say the tunnel didn't appear to be leading to the facility, or to anywhere else for that matter. The national post, meanwhile, observes that \" york university has an engineering school, but not one with the pranking history of other canadian institutions. \" all of which has left cops perplexed: as saunders says, \" there's no criminal offense for digging a hole. \"",

The research team says it expects the bats feast at night, entering bedrooms through open windows and holes in roofs, and say it's time to monitor them for diseases they are known to carry, including rabies and hantavirus.

From the baltimore sun and ap: his legal name is antonio martinez, though he refers to himself as muhammad hussain. He recently converted to islam and is a naturalized us citizen, but it's not clear where he was born. He graduated from a baltimore high school.

But it actually makes sense, because drought has caused the water level to fall 82 feet in the nezahualcoyotl reservoir, revealing a church that was flooded during construction of a dam nearly 40 years ago, the ap reports. Known as the temple of santiago, the building is about half-way visible in the watershed to the grijalva river. This isn't the first time the church has resurfaced: in fact, the water level got so low in 2002 that people could actually walk inside: \" the people celebrated. They came to eat, to hang out, to do business. I sold them fried fish, \" says a fisherman who's now offering temple of santiago boat tours. The church harks back to colonial times, when the spanish friar bartolome de las casas showed up with a group of monks who built the temple of santiago, the independent reports. Las casas, the first bishop of chiapas, initially believed in subjugating the native people, but later argued for abolishing slavery and helped persuade king charles of spain to grant the natives their freedom, notes latin american history. But when conquistadors and settlers revolted, charles reversed much of the new legislation. As for the church, it was abandoned during plagues of the 1770s, an architect says. Re-discovered in the 20th century, he says, it contained \" a large ossuary of the victims of the plague that depopulated the area. \" ( in the us, drought is causing lake mead to give up a few secrets, too. )",

Scott walker, and some of them could prove highly damaging. Some key facts, as per the milwaukee journal-sentinel, the washington post, and the huffington post: the emails link walker, then county executive, to a secret email system used by his taxpayer-funded staff to break campaign law by communicating directly with his 2010 campaign for governor during business hours. \" consider yourself now in the ' inner circle, ' \" his administration director told another county employee. \" i use this private account quite a bit to communicate with skw and nardelli, \" she wrote, referring to walker by his initials. The emails show that walker appears to have been \" aware that laptops were being used in the county executive's office for accessing things on non-county networks, \" the chief investigator says, a sign that use of the private email system was widespread. Several highly racist emails were forwarded among walker's staff, including one recounting a \" nightmare \" of waking up \" black, jewish, disabled, gay with a mexican boyfriend. \" walker ordered staff to get rid of a doctor at the county's behavioral health division who had worked as a thong model. \" get rid of the md asap, \" walker wrote after being told the modeling wasn't \" pornographic, but is quite suggestive. \" the walker affair hasn't received as much attention as chris christie's traffic jam scandal, though both feature gop governors with \" national profiles and national ambitions, allegedly using their public office to boost their political standing, all the while distancing themselves from the work their staffs sullied themselves with, \" writes emma roller at slate, predicting the emails will haunt him through next year's tough re-election fight and beyond.",

Bob hoover, a world war ii fighter pilot who escaped the nazis by stealing one of their planes, died of congestive heart failure tuesday near los angeles, reports the washington post. He was 94. Born in tennessee, hoover was flying by age 15 and soon learned how to perform loops and dives, reports cnnmoney. He put those skills to use in 58 combat missions during world war ii before he was shot down in 1944 and spent 16 months in german pow camp stalag luft i. He eventually arranged for a mock fight to break out, scaled a barbed wire fence while guards were distracted, and jumped into a nazi plane, which he flew to the netherlands. He didn't have a map, but \" i knew that if i turned west and followed the shoreline, i would be safe when i saw windmills, \" he once said. His triumphs didn't end there. In 1947, he was chuck yeager's wingman as he broke the sound barrier for the first time. He then became a premier test pilot before flying in more than 2,500 air shows around the globe. Among his greatest tricks: pouring a glass of iced tea during a barrel roll. Gen. Jimmy doolittle once described hoover as the \" greatest stick-and-rudder man who ever lived, \" but \" he was every pilot's icon, \" a family friend tells legacy.com. \" he has influenced more individuals than probably … any single person in aviation, \" a rep for the national aviation hall of fame adds, per the dayton daily news.
