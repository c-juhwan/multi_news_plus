        "summary": "How does one confirm that the universe is slowly dying? for starters, you use \" as many space and ground-based telescopes as we could get our hands on. \" that according to simon driver, a principal investigator with the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) project. Driver explains that the group used those telescopes — including powerful ones from nasa and the european space agency and at the paranal observatory in chile — to measure the energy generated by more than 200,000 galaxies. It's a measurement unprecedented in its precision, and a press release explains that this \" most comprehensive assessment \" shows that the energy produced in that corner of the universe has been halved over 2 billion years. Each of those 200,000 galaxies had its energy output measured across 21 wavelengths, spanning from the ultraviolet to the infrared. Energy production is flagging across all wavelengths. \" the universe is slowly dying, \" as the release puts it. That's actually not the first time such a statement has been uttered: scientists have been aware of the fading for nearly two decades, but it's the all-wavelength determination that makes this data — presented by the gama project yesterday at an international astronomical meeting in hawaii — noteworthy. \" this pretty much closes the case, \" ohio state university astronomer john beacom tells npr. \" yes, it's coming to an end. \" he paints the universe as becoming \" a bleaker and bleaker place to live. \" but take solace in the fact that the lights won't go out for a few billion years more.

            "An international team of astronomers studying 200,000 galaxies has measured the energy generated within a large portion of space more precisely than ever before, discovering that it's only half what it was 2 billion years ago and fading – the universe is slowly dying. Researchers from the international centre for radio astronomy research ( icrar ) in western australia used seven of the world's most powerful telescopes to observe galaxies at 21 different wavelengths from the far ultraviolet to the far infrared. Initial observations were conducted using the anglo-australian telescope in new south wales and supporting observations were made by two orbiting space telescopes operated by nasa and another belonging to the european space agency. The research is part of the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) project, the largest multi-wavelength survey ever put together. \"we used as many space and ground-based telescopes we could get our hands on, to measure the energy output of over 200,000 galaxies across as broad a wavelength range as possible, \" says icrar professor simon driver, who presented the findings at the international astronomical union's general assembly in honolulu.

Back in 2014, officials said they used tear gas on six youths who were rioting. The footage shows only one of those teens was even out of his cell; two were calmly playing cards when they were gassed. Guards could be heard laughing as the teens choked. Australian prime minister malcolm turnbull tells the guardian he was \" deeply shocked... And appalled \" by the footage. \"the important thing is to get to the bottom of what happened at don dale and there may be other matters connected to that to be looked into, \" turnbull says. Those other matters include the fact that 96 % of young detainees in the northern territory, where don dale is located, are indigenous youths. Officials are blaming a \" culture of cover-up \" within the justice system, but rights groups aren't buying it, arguing instead that the problem has been ignored by officials for years because the victims are indigenous people.

The atlantic reports that after looking at data from nearly 51,000 americans, researchers concluded that a person in 2006 eating and exercising the same as someone of an identical age in 1988 had a bmi about 2.3 points higher, meaning they'd be about 10 % heavier. \" our study results suggest that if you are 25, you'd have to eat even less and exercise more than those older to prevent gaining weight, \" jennifer kuk of york university in toronto says in the story. Researchers have three thoughts on why that could be, the atlantic reports. First, we're exposed to more chemicals nowadays, which could be inducing weight gain. Second, prescription drug use is way up, and antidepressants especially have been linked to weight gain. Finally, hormones, antibiotics, or artificial sweeteners in meat and other foods could be changing the bacteria in our guts and hampering weight loss. Kuk says this research is a good reason to be more empathetic to people of all body types. \"ultimately, maintaining a healthy body weight is now more challenging than ever, \" she says in a york press release.

        "summary": "Almost one-fifth of americans'spending on utilities goes toward keeping cool, but the total doesn't have to be that high, reports usa today. With most of the us in the grip of a heat wave, some pointers for becoming less reliant on less air-conditioning and lowering your electric bill: get wet: running cool water over pulse points in your wrists and splashing your face or temples can lower your body temperature. Dress lightly: cotton, linen, and seersucker are fashion staples in hot climates for a reason. Eat lightly: multiple small meals ask less of your body than a single heavy chow-down. Spice heavily: break out the peppers to break a sweat — the evaporation process has a cooling effect. For more tips, including pointers from the epa, click here.",

        "summary": "Back in 2011, a pair of biographers argued that the accepted theory of vincent van gogh's death may have been wrong. He didn't commit suicide, they suggested; instead, it was a local teen who killed him. Their theory was met with some serious pushback, but they stand behind it, and they're offering more evidence in vanity fair. The article, by steven naifeh and gregory white smith, notes scant evidence in favor of a suicide: why, for instance, would a suicidal person shoot himself in the stomach, leading to a long, painful death? what's more, they argue, accounts supporting the suicide theory come from questionable sources, including a girl who was only 13 at the time, and didn't tell her story publicly for decades. The vanity fair piece also focuses on the work of noted forensics expert dr. Vincent di maio, who worked on george zimmerman's trial. Di maio finds, based on accounts of van gogh's injuries, that the muzzle of the gun that shot the artist \" was more than a foot or two away ( closer to two rather than one ). \" he concludes that, \" in all medical probability, the wound incurred by van gogh was not self-inflicted. \" so why has the suicide account survived so long? at artnet, lorena muñoz-alonso suggests it's because it's a good story. His \" earlobe episode … plus his history of nervous breakdowns and alcoholism made him the perfect artist maudit: a troubled, unpredictable, erratic genius. \" ( that famous ear, by the way, has been re-created. )",

She can also challenge the eventual selling price that the city decides on."

So says a study in the journal animal behavior. [ david a. Luther and elizabeth p. Derryberry, \" birdsongs keep pace with city life: changes in song over time in an urban songbird affects communication \" ] researchers compared white-crowned sparrow songs recorded in 1969 and 2005. Over that time span, ambient noise levels went up. And the bird calls were essentially the same — but the more recent one was higher in pitch. The change presumably allows the song to better penetrate the traffic noise. The modern calls carry more weight with the birds, too. Because when male sparrows heard the 2005 recordings played back in their territory, they responded more aggressively — swooping in on the speaker with a \"get outta here \" chirp and flapping their wings at the suspected intruder.

Most studies of this process use current comparisons of environments that vary in ambient noise; here, we evaluate over time the effects of the urban environment on signal structure and salience. We show that white-crowned sparrow, zonotrichia leucophrys, song increased in minimum frequency between 1969 and 2005 in san francisco, california, u.s.a., coincident with rising levels of traffic noise. A higher minimum frequency is less likely to be masked by low-frequency ambient noise and thus is more likely to be effective as a communication signal. To test whether this change in song affects receiver response, we presented territorial males current ( 2005 ) and historical ( 1969 ) local songs. Males responded more strongly to current than to historical songs, suggesting that current songs communicate more effectively in the current local environment.

Participants can expect titanic-level luxury during the eight-day trip. A helicopter or seaplane ride will take them from st. John's, newfoundland, to a yacht above the site where the ship hit an iceberg and sank. Weather permitting, the little sub can take up to three people down to the wreck, day and night, accompanied by a pilot and deep ocean expert. The trips will mark the first time since 2005 civilians have been permitted to visit the exclusive site, which the telegraph notes has seen fewer visitors than have traveled to space or mount everest.

Problem is, truffles are neither long-lasting nor convenient — which is part of what makes them so exciting and expensive, reports priceonomics. Well, it turns out the oil, often marked as \" made in italy \" and \" 100 % natural, \" is indeed too good to be true, because there's not even a trace amount of the rare namesake ingredient in truffle oil, or at least in the $ 6 bottle at your local grocery store. Turns out it's merely truffle-scented, a laboratory concoction made from olive oil and 2,4-dithiapentane, a compound from which truffles get some of their smell. For several years now the dirty secret has been out ( the atlantic wrote about the \" dark side of the truffle trade \" in 2014 ), and chefs and servers alike have taken to shunning the oil. In fact, in a recent reddit thread about which items restaurant workers would never eat, the sun reports that fine dining server rez357 wrote: \" truffle oil. It has no truffle in it. The truffle smell is synthetic.... Servers judge you as trash for eating it. \" one writer has gone so far as to say that \" comparing truffle oil to real truffles is like comparing sniffing dirty underwear to having sex. \" it's not that using science to construct affordable luxury items is problematic, priceonomics adds, but that the end product fails and is marketed as something it isn't. And thus the con. ( see why these grapes sold for $ 11,000. )",

And that's without most residents knowing that washington state has no plan for dealing with a nuclear attack — because it's illegal to make one. A 1984 law prohibits washington state's emergency plans from including \" preparation for emergency evacuation or relocation of residents in anticipation of nuclear attack. \" it wasn't always that way. Kiro reports the state had a nuclear-attack plan — including bunkers inside seattle bridges — in place in the 1950s and 1960s. Then the 1984 law was passed to promote peace in the wake of the cold war. Now, state sen. Mark miloscia tells king the law is \" silly \" and irresponsible. He says it \"puts like a big stop order on any sort of planning we have to do to prepare for the unthinkable. \" miloscia has introduced a bill to repeal the old law, but — unfortunately for nuke-nervous seattleites — it won't be considered until january.",

Analysts believe that as in similar cases, khattalah will be interrogated on an american ship before he is brought to the us for trial. \" the only question in my mind is how slowly they ' ll be moving that ship, \" a new york university law professor tells politico. More: the washington post looks at khattala's life, much of which was spent in moammar gadhafi's prisons for involvement in islamist movements. He is in his early 40s, says he has never left libya, and those who have met him describe him as eccentric but friendly. He emerged as leader of a small islamist militia during the 2011 uprising that toppled gadhafi and later became an ally of the fiercely conservative ansar al-sharia militia. With khattala living openly and even giving interviews to us news organizations until last year, the obama administration is facing questions over why it took so long to capture him, cnn finds. Officials say building a criminal case against a foreign terror suspect takes time. \" what matters is not that it took a matter of time to get him, but that we got him, \" a pentagon spokesman says. \" and i can't speak for his living habits. But let's just say for argument's sake he was living in plain sight. He's not anymore. \" the pentagon and state department both described the raid as a \" unilateral us action, \" and officials say the libyan government was not told about it until khattala was already in american custody. \" it was very clean, in and out, with no one hurt, \" one official tells the new york times. Another official describes the operation as \" textbook, \" with no shots fired as khattalah was stuffed into a vehicle and taken away. Delta force soldiers provided the muscle, officials say, but it was treated as a law enforcement operation and fbi agents were on hand to make sure evidence was preserved and interrogation procedures were followed.",

It's very revealing, however, \" tweeted trump critic and former beijing professor patrick chovanec, per the new york times.

Washington for extinct creatures like dinosaurs known only from fossils, it is notoriously difficult to differentiate the males from the females of a species because sex distinctions are rarely obvious from the skeletons. But in the case of the well-known jurassic dinosaur stegosaurus, a study published on wednesday may provide a handy how-to guide on telling the boys from the girls based on the shape of the big bony plates protruding from its back. Stegosaurus, which roamed the western united states about 150 million years ago, was a large",
            "The first convincing evidence for sexual differences in a species of dinosaur has been described by university of bristol msc student, evan saitta, in a study of the iconic dinosaur stegosaurus, published today in the scientific journal plos one. Stegosaurus, a large, herbivorous dinosaur with two staggered rows of bony plates along its back and two pairs of spikes at the end of its tail, lived roughly 150 million years ago during the late jurassic in the western united states. Some individuals had wide plates, some had tall, with the wide plates being up to 45 per cent larger overall than the tall plates. According to the new study, the tall-plated stegosaurus and"

Norman casiano, 25, tells the new york times that he huddled in a crammed bathroom stall after shooting erupted. He says gunman omar mateen laughed after he entered the room and opened fire on people begging for their lives. \" all i heard was a laugh, \" casiano says. \" he laughed like an evil laugh, something that's just going to be imprinted in my head forever. \" mateen apparently later barricaded himself in another bathroom, where a survivor named orlando says he heard him speaking about isis in surprisingly calm 911 calls. Orlando says he played dead at the end of the standoff with police, when mateen began executing hostages. In other coverage of the mass shooting and its aftermath: police officers give harrowing accounts of the end of the standoff and some heroic rescues to the orlando sentinel. The new york daily news has the story of brenda lee marquez mccool, a 49-year-old mother of 11 who died protecting her son when mateen opened fire. The white house announced monday night that president obama will visit orlando on thursday \" to pay his respects to victims ' families, and to stand in solidarity with the community as they embark on their recovery, \" usa today reports. The washington post reports on the effect the shooting — which took place on the nightclub's \" latin night \" — has had on the local hispanic community. Many of the victims are believed to be from the orlando area's fast-growing puerto rican community. The orlando sentinel has a full list of all of the victims, and the stories of many of them, including 18-year-old akyra murray, who was in town celebrating her high school graduation.

In one of the most comically romantic movie exchanges i've seen in a long time, they turn each other on with the emblems of their corporate loyalty ( avis and budget and hertz, oh my ). These two don't know the language of love. Ryan and alex speak expedia ( \"they've got multiples at sdf. You think you could push? \" ). This wholly artificial world exists on the once-bloated underbelly of the dot-com bubble.

He says he looked up the name on the sign and emailed the realtor to let them know it had arrived, though it was \" not in best shape after the crossing. \" he offered to send it back to the realtor, who plans to frame it as a memento. Oceanographer curtis ebbesmeyer tells the new york times that the sign's journey was likely even longer than it might appear. He believes it crossed the atlantic three times before it was found. \" there is a great gyre of water that runs from new jersey to northern europe down to spain and back to new jersey and takes 3.3 years on average, and it takes about a year and a half to drift across the north atlantic one way from new jersey to france, \" he says. \" so five and a half years is just about right. \"",

I was still breastfeeding when i performed the revel shows in atlantic city in 2012. After the twins, i approached things very differently. I was 218 pounds the day i gave birth to rumi and sir. I was swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month. My health and my babies ' health were in danger, so i had an emergency c-section. We spent many weeks in the nicu. My husband was a soldier and such a strong support system for me. I am proud to have been a witness to his strength and evolution as a man, a best friend, and a father. I was in survival mode and did not grasp it all until months later. Today i have a connection to any parent who has been through such an experience. After the c-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery. Some of your organs are shifted temporarily, and in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery. I am not sure everyone understands that. I needed time to heal, to recover. During my recovery, i gave myself self-love and self-care, and i embraced being curvier. I accepted what my body wanted to be. After six months, i started preparing for coachella. I became vegan temporarily, gave up coffee, alcohol, and all fruit drinks. But i was patient with myself and enjoyed my fuller curves.

            "Pregnancy &amp; body acceptance after the birth of my first child, i believed in the things society said about how my body should look. I put pressure on myself to lose all the baby weight in three months, and scheduled a small tour to assure i would do it. Looking back, that was crazy. I was still breastfeeding when i performed the revel shows in atlantic city in 2012. After the twins, i approached things very differently. I was 218 pounds the day i gave birth to rumi and sir. I was swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month. My health and my babies ' health were in danger, so i had an emergency c-section. We spent many weeks in the nicu. My husband was a soldier and such a strong support system for me. I am proud to have been a witness to his strength and evolution as a man, a best friend, and a father. I was in survival mode and did not grasp it all until months later. Today i have a connection to any parent who has been through such an experience. After the c-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery. Some of your organs are shifted temporarily, and in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery. I am not sure everyone understands that. I needed time to heal, to recover. During my recovery, i gave myself self-love and self-care, and i embraced being curvier. I accepted what my body wanted to be. After six months, i started preparing for coachella. I became vegan temporarily, gave up coffee, alcohol, and all fruit drinks. But i was patient with myself and enjoyed my fuller curves. My kids and husband did, too. I think it's important for women and men to see and appreciate the beauty in their natural bodies. That's why i stripped away the wigs and hair extensions and used little makeup for this shoot. To this day my arms"

They're already being used to make wrinkle creams, and now german scientists have developed a machine that uses the foreskin of young boys to grow artificial skin, reports the local. For now, the researchers hope their innovation can be used for testing consumer products, replacing animal testing — but the technology's longer-term potential is much more ambitious, and could be used for creating artificial corneas and for research into cancer and a whole host of illnesses. The process works by extracting skin cells from donated foreskins using a 23-foot-long skin machine capable of extracting up to 10 million skin cells per foreskin; those cells then multiply hundreds of times. The new cells are mixed with collagen and connective tissue to become \" real \" skin. One month's output clocks in at about 5,000 skin samples, though they're not yet being used in testing. \" there are complicated international safety standards, these procedures can't just be changed, \" said a pharmaceutical spokesman. But he believes that \" cells from artificially cultivated skin are indeed comparable with real skin. \" click for more on the \" skin factory. \"",

According to kpho, former mesa police department officer philip brailsford was found not guilty thursday of murder and reckless manslaughter in the january 2016 death of 26-year-old daniel shaver at a la quinta inn in mesa. Police were called to the hotel for reports of someone pointing a gun out a window. The weapon later turned out to be a pellet gun shaver used for his pest-control job and which he was showing off to a woman in his hotel room, the washington post reports. When police arrived at the scene, shaver was ordered to lie down in the hallway, put his hands in the air, and crawl toward officers. As shaver crawled toward officers, he reached toward his waistband. Brailsford, who testified he believed shaver was reaching for a gun, shot him five times with an ar-15 with \" you're fucked \" etched in the side. Authorities have since said it appears shaver was trying to pull up his basketball shorts, which were falling as he crawled. And an investigator says there's no apparent reason the officers couldn't have just handcuffed shaver, who was unarmed, while he was on the ground. A judge sided with brailsford's lawyers and blocked the release of brailsford's body-cam footage to the public. It was released this week upon his acquittal. Shaver's family has filed wrongful-death lawsuits against the city of mesa. Brailsford was fired from the mesa police department after two years on the job for violating department policy.",

The colony of chinstrap penguins relies for food on krill, which depend on algae that attach to ice, which is rapidly disappearing, scientists note. The team from madrid's national museum of natural sciences tallied chinstrap penguins in the vapour col colony of deception island in the antarctic's shetland islands, and photographed nests in 19 subcolonies from 1991 to 2009. The number of occupied nests in that time period plummeted by 36 %, with the steepest declines occurring since 2000. The population of a nearby chinstrap colony on bailey head has plummeted by 50 %, according to the team's findings in polar biology. The population declines \" constitute a general pattern \" in the south shetlands, and are particularly troubling as \" population changes of top predators provide key indications of environmental quality, \" writes lead researcher andres barbosa. \" this is an example of how the human activity far from the poles can affect life thousands of kilometers far from our homes, \" he tells msnbc. \" a more responsible use of the energy and fossil fuels is necessary to preserve the planet, and antarctica. \"",

Cox denied the claims in a statement issued on saturday but admitted making mistakes in a previous role with the charity save the children. \"i want to apologise deeply and unreservedly for my past behaviour and for the hurt and offence that i have caused, \" he said in the statement. \"in the aftermath of jo's murder, i promised that i would dedicate my life to two things, firstly loving and protecting our children and secondly fighting the hatred that killed jo. \" jo cox, a labour mp, was shot and stabbed outside her constituency office in west yorkshire by a far-right extremist during the eu referendum campaign in june 2016. In the statement, cox said: \"while i do not accept the allegations contained in the 2015 complaint to the police in cambridge, massachusetts, i do acknowledge and understand that during my time at save the children i made mistakes. \" cox, who married his wife in 2009, was reported to police in the us in 2015 for inappropriate touching while on a trip to harvard. A woman alleged he had bought her drinks, grabbed her hips and and forced his thumb into her mouth in a sexual manner, the mail on sunday reported. Cox denied the accusations and called some of the allegations against him a \"massive exaggeration \". Jo cox's sister, kim leadbeater, said in a statement on sunday that it was another very difficult day for the family but that they would"

        "summary": "Apple is about to make sound waves: the company that brought you itunes is expected to announce a paid streaming service at its annual developers conference in san francisco today, reports the ap. The wall street journal, which broke the news, reports the subscription will cost $ 10 per month. Though most music sales happen via digital stores like itunes, some 41 million people pay to stream music from outlets like spotify. Apple plans to attract users with a three-month free trial, with ideally 100 million subscribers sticking around. Afterward, only a few songs will be available to stream for free. The paid service will also include curated playlists and suggestions from djs and musicians — dj zane lowe and drake are rumored — reports techcrunch. Apple will eventually shift 303,000 users of beats music, which will be shut down, to the new service and advertise to itunes users. However, as the average itunes user spends $ 30 per year, it isn't clear how buyers will receive the $ 120-a-year service. The announcement comes as subscription revenue jumped 39 % last year alone to $ 1.6 billion, while download sales slid 8 % to $ 3.6 billion. Techcrunch reports the announcement might actually be good news for tidal as it could promote the mainstream user-base concept. However, apple may be interested in acquiring tidal for its register of artists. Apple is also expected to unveil a streaming-video package for apple tv, new features for iphones, ipads, and macs, upgrades to apple pay, and new tools for building apps on the apple watch.",

The villagers were evacuated early friday to a building on higher ground and told to watch for falling ice, which has the potential to displace seawater that, in turn, could inundate the town some 600 miles north of the capital of nuuk. While residents hope winds help dislodge the iceberg and move it away from their community, the cbc reports that a danish royal navy ship is standing by to provide assistance. Last month, another greenland iceberg made waves both physical and literal.

Vignarajah also suggested mcclain's alibi letter may have been crafted with syed's help. That's \" the most convoluted conspiracy theory i have heard put forward by a prosecutor, \" syed's lawyer said. In a statement, syed said \" the events of the past 16 months have filled me with a great sense of hope, and i intend to keep fighting to prove my innocence. \"",

        "summary": "Is mylan ceo heather bresch the next martin shkreli? based on public reaction to the bloated costs of her company's epipen, the 671 % pay raise she's reaped as those costs rose, and the recently publicized fact that her dad is a us senator, the initial answer may seem to be \" yes. \" but the woman the new york times calls america's \" new pharmaceutical villain \" refutes comparisons to the roundly reviled shkreli, noting to the paper that mylan's price spikes aren't in the \" same hemisphere \" as that of shkreli's daraprim and freely admitting hers is a for-profit business. \" i am not hiding from that, \" she says. And some note she has, to an extent, helped bring about positive change in the industry: the director of the knowledge ecology international ngo, for example, says bresch helped his group fight tpp provisions that would have made it more difficult for people overseas to obtain certain drugs. The admittedly brash bresch says high epipen prices are necessary to pay back the company for the expensive investment it's made in the device. She adds that the health insurance industry is also to blame, calling its raising of fees that consumers have to foot \" unconscionable. \" but the times notes other questionable items swirling around bresch — including her receiving a since-rescinded mba from west virginia university without earning it, as well as mylan's 2014 tax-sheltering move to the netherlands. And some are calling her hypocritical, considering she was recently elected to head the board of directors of the generic pharmaceutical association, whose mission is to help patients gain access to affordable, high-quality meds, per a release. \" it's like talking out of both sides of your mouth, \" a generic drug advocate notes to the times of the increasingly monopolistic practices of companies like mylan.

The 23-year-old san diego woman pleaded guilty last week to defacing rock formations in seven parks, and for the next two years, she's persona non grata on 524 million acres of public land, the los angeles times reports. That accounts for about 20 % of the us, notes the guardian. She ' ll also have to perform 200 hours of community service and pay restitution; the amount will be settled in a future hearing. Acting us attorney phillip talbert cited nocket's \" lack of respect for the law and our shared national treasures \" and said cleanup efforts are complete at five of the parks. Not that it's been an easy task: a national parks service rep said workers have to meticulously scrape away each layer with just hot water and plastic spatulas, per the san jose mercury news. Nocket went on her 26-day tagging spree in 2014, drawing faces — including that of a woman smoking a cigarette — on rocks in acrylic paints and markers and signing them with her instagram handle, \" creepytings. \" what did her in: her own postings on social media, which led to outraged activists creating a petition for the white house to slap her with \" the most serious of charges, \" per trailmob. On nocket's no-visit list, per fox 13, are any public lands overseen by the nps, us forest service, bureau of land management, and army corps of engineers. \" this case illustrates the important role that the public can play in identifying and sharing evidence of illegal behavior in parks, \" the nps ' head of law enforcement tells the mercury news.

An expert with france's national museum of natural history told the guardian last year that \" all snails in europe could be wiped out, \" adding that \" it's worth pointing out the effect that this will have on french cooking. \" it takes the worms awhile to move into a new habitat — they've got to be accidentally carried in in soil or plants, the post notes — but once they infiltrate, they can wreak havoc on a region's ecosystem by taking snails out of the food chain and removing earthworms ( another of their preferred meals ) from their job of maintaining our soils and other needed agricultural tasks. ( another invasive creature that has ecologists worried: a \" walking \" fish that can choke birds that try to eat it. )",

That's the conclusion of a new study published in jama psychiatry that finds the suicide rate of troops deployed there was only a bit higher than that of troops who've served either in the us or elsewhere: 18.86 deaths per 100,000 for the former, 17.78 per 100,000 for the latter, the new york times reports. But something's behind the increasing suicide rate in the military — the times notes it's nearly doubled since 2005 — and researchers say more research is needed. \" as the wars went on, the suicide rates also went up and it was very tempting to assume deployments must be the reason, \" says lead author mark reger. \" our data don't support that. \" the study, said to be the largest of its kind, looked at the paperwork for 3.9 million troops who served from 2001 to 2007; among those service members, there were 5,041 suicides by the end of 2009, reuters reports. What the study did find: the suicide rate for army and marine crews — which the times notes took on most of the iraq and afghanistan fighting — was about 25 % higher than that of the other branches, though the suicide rate in those two branches didn't differ much between those deployed and those who weren't. Another find: that troops who left before serving four years had almost double the suicide rate of those who stuck around; it was three times as high for service members who received a disciplinary involuntary discharge.

Under city code, residents are not allowed to keep wild animals without a permit. Paul desjardin says their insurance company is handling the lawsuit, which was filed this month. Felice's lawyer could not be reached for comment. ___ information from: the virginian-pilot, http://pilotonline.com"

Leston lawrence, 35, was known to set off the mint's metal detectors more often than most, but he always passed a search with a hand-held wand, according to prosecutors. They say that's because lawrence smuggled coins and 18 unmarked gold nuggets out of the mint hidden in his rectum, then took them to a gold buyer, where he received checks for about $ 5,000 per piece between november 2014 and march 2015, reports the ottawa citizen. After noticing the high number of checks, however, a bank teller discovered lawrence worked at the mint and alerted authorities, prosecutors say. The mint — where \" gold is left sitting around in open buckets, \" says lawrence's lawyer, gary barnes — could find no record of the alleged thefts, but investigators say they found four nuggets in lawrence's possession after executing a search warrant. The nuggets are in the shape of the mint's \" dipping spoon, \" which is not available commercially, notes the newspaper. Investigators also found vaseline in lawrence's work locker. A security employee proved one could pass a security check with a hand-held wand while smuggling gold via the butt, investigators say. Still, barnes argues there's no proof lawrence's gold came from the mint, per the toronto sun. He's charged with theft, laundering the proceeds of crime, possession of stolen property, and breach of trust. A decision is expected nov. 9. ( your butt is welcome to touch this gold toilet. )",

        "summary": "With senate leadership changing, john mccain appears poised to be the new head of the armed services committee — and that could have big implications for us defense, reuters reports. Mccain has a history of criticizing what he sees as excessive spending on some weapons programs; as chair of the committee, he ' ll have more control over how the pentagon spends its cash. Defense contractors are expecting to spend more time responding to questions from capitol hill. Among mccain's concerns have been a $ 399 billion f-35 fighter jet program, as well as the continued use of russian-made rocket engines. Another favorite target of mccain's has been president obama's foreign policy; now he ' ll have a \" megaphone \" with which to address the subject, the national journal reports. He's called, for instance, for greater us support for ukraine's military and boots on the ground against isis. But though he holds strong views, he's also known as a negotiator on issues like immigration, the national journal notes. \" with senator mccain, what you see is what you get. It's part of his charm and persona, that he is a maverick — he is an outspoken maverick — that tells it like it is to anyone of any party, \" says an analyst.",

Senator john mccain ( r-az ) at a campaign stop at the american legion post #3 in nashua, new hampshire october 27, 2014. Washington senator john mccain's voice just got a whole lot louder. One of president barack obama's noisiest detractors, mccain is expected to take the helm of the powerful armed services committee in the new republican-controlled u.s. Senate when the u.s. Congress convenes in january. The arizona senator, a critic of the $ 399 billion lockheed martin corp f-35 fighter jet program, is likely to push for tougher congressional scrutiny of costly u.s. Weapons programs, defense analysts say. He has in the past launched investigations into waste in the u.s. Defense industry and shaped legislation to end cost overruns on major arms programs as a senior member of the senate committee. Mccain, a former navy pilot and vietnam war prisoner who lost to obama in the 2008 election, has also criticized the administration on everything from fighting islamic state militants to arming moderate syrian rebels, while seeking a tougher u.s. Response to russian aggression in ukraine. As committee chairman he could summon pentagon officials to public hearings to explain their strategy on syria. He has challenged the u.s.

Mccain, the republican party's presidential nominee in 2008, has decades of experience in foreign policy and defense issues in the senate, where he was first elected in 1986.
