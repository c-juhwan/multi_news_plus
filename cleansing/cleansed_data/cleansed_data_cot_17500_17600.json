        "summary": "The federal reserve's first policy meeting since donald trump won the election wraps up wednesday, and analysts say the fed is almost certain to raise interest rates for just the second time in a decade — though they also said trump was almost certain to lose the election. Beyond the expected rate hike, market-watchers are hoping the fed will give some clues as to whether it plans to step up the pace of interest rate hikes next year to keep the economy from overheating and driving up inflation. The fed is expected to release forecasts and market data at 2pm est, followed by a press conference from fed chair janet yellen at 2: 30pm. A roundup of coverage: the ap reports that a rosy forecast for the economy will be a strong predictor of more rate rises in 2017. One big clue will be whether the word \" roughly \" is dropped from last month's statement that \" near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, \" which would signal an improved forecast. The wall street journal predicts that if rates do go up, the fed will tweak its policy statement to drop last month's statement that the case for rate increases has \" continued to strengthen. \" analysts will be watching to see whether the fed predicts an unemployment rate next year lower than the current 4.6 %, which is below the 4.8 % that was considered \" full employment \" in september. Jim caron from morgan stanley investment management predicts that the fed won't discuss trump plans like tax cuts because he hasn't said much about exactly how he plans to implement them. \" i think too much is unknown. They're not going to involve themselves in that, \" he tells cnbc. \" they're going to do what they can do based on the economic evidence at hand. \" the ap notes that investors will also be watching the \" dot plot \" where the 17 members of the fed's policy committee predict where rates might go, though it isn't an especially reliable indicator: last year, the \" dot plot \" predicted four rate increases but there hasn't been one yet. The financial times predicts that yellen will \" present studied neutrality \" when asked about trump's plans for a mix of tax cuts and fiscal stimulus. The times notes that markets are now beginning to pay more attention to trump's plans than to the fed's policies, and wednesday may mark the day when the \" baton \" in the search for economic growth passes from central bankers to politicians. The new york times looks at how the fed's anti-inflationary policies could",

        "summary": "With election day looming tomorrow, president obama and mitt romney are making their final cases: both have rallies scheduled in that oh-so-important of states, ohio, today. Obama is also visiting wisconsin and iowa, while romney will hit florida, virginia, and new hampshire, the ap reports. Romney has also been making a last-minute push for a pennsylvania upset, and drew thousands to a rally there yesterday — though the cold drove quite a few to leave early. The washington post notes that between the two candidates, there are a total of 14 events in eight states scheduled today. Final polls are coming into alignment, writes nate silver in the new york times. Obama looks set to enter election day with what silver calls \" a very modest lead \" nationally. Click for more on the most recent polls. Many are warning that the outcome of the race may not be determined tomorrow. The new york times takes a look at some of the legal battles that are already under way — one in florida, where there were problems with early voting; one in iowa, where democrats have been accused of getting older voters to fill out illegal absentee ballots for relatives; and another in ohio, where voters are being forced to attest what form of identification they provided. Republicans are defending the requirement in court today; critics say it could cause thousands of provisional ballots not to be counted. Similar problems could emerge in other states, especially those where the race is close. The media is determined not to mess this up, like in 2000 when florida was prematurely called for al gore. The new york times has a rundown of the precautions that are being taken, and notes that while many websites are sure to call the race early, the networks and newspapers are waiting until west coast polls close at 11pm eastern. The times also has two portraits worth reading, one of obama waxing nostalgic about his final campaign, and the other of romney relishing the feeling that, as one senior adviser puts it, \" the presidency is within his grasp. \" both candidates are surrounding themselves with longtime advisers and friends in their campaigns ' final hours. The ap notes that celebrities are coming out for the homestretch, but mostly for obama: pitbull endorsed him in florida; stevie wonder played a song for him in ohio; bruce springsteen and jay-z will appear at rallies today. As for romney, the marshall tucker band played for him in pennsylvania. For the superstitious: the washington redskins lost yesterday. Since 1936, whenever that has happened, the incumbent party also lost the white house — with one exception, in 2004.",

Star wars: the last jedi, the first in the series from writer-director rian johnson, is sure to kill at the box office regardless of reviews. But disney will be happy, anyway. Critics say the last jedi, with a 93 % rating on rotten tomatoes, is one of the best star wars flicks yet. A spoiler-free round-up of opinions: \" the last jedi is almost as thrilling and memorable as the empire strikes back \" and \" that's a sentence this sci-fi fan never thought she'd write, \" says karen d'souza at the san jose mercury news. \" the movie is so good, maybe even great, it makes words like epic seem puny. \" there's wit, suspense, unpredictability, and potency, not to mention \" the biggest mind trick ever, \" she writes. It all combines for a film \" that's flat-out exhilarating. \" it's \" truly for everyone, \" carrying \" a sense of humor about itself and a sense of joy, \" writes stephanie zacharek at time. \" but its emotional generosity, even in the midst of all the extravagant green-screen work, is its best special effect. \" and while it sometimes feels \" cluttered, \" johnson \" makes the most of individual scenes, shaping each with care and vigor. And he does well by every character. \" the film \" [ relies ] on familiar tropes a bit more than it should … but it's still a pretty damn good movie, arguably the best the franchise has offered since empire, \" writes christopher orr at the atlantic.

Peter travers continues the trend: \" the last jedi ranks with the very best star wars epics, \" he writes at rolling stone. It's \" simply stupendous … bursting at the seams with knockout fun surprises, marvelous adventure and shocking revelations that will leave your head spinning. \" johnson \" eases into epic filmmaking like a pro \" and \" makes sure you leave the multiplex feeling euphoric, \" he adds, commending mark hamill on \" the performance of his career. \"",

            "A terrified french motorist who set out on a short trip to the supermarket, has had a lucky escape after his renault laguna 3 refused to slow down, the brakes failed, and he travelled more than 200km at 125mph. Frank lecerf's high speed ordeal finally ended in a ditch in belgium after his malfunctioning car ran out of petrol after almost two hours on the road. The frenchman, who suffers from epilepsy and drives a specially-modified car that has controls on the steering wheel to operate the throttle and brake, has filed a legal complaint against the vehicle's manufacturer. \" my life flashed before me, \" the 36-year-old told local newspaper le courrier picard. \" i just wanted it to stop. \" he was unhurt but says he has had two epileptic seizures since the incident. The guardian reports that lecerf left his home in pont-de-metz in the somme and was travelling at about 60mph when the car's speed regulator began to malfunction. Each time he hit the brakes the vehicle accelerated, \" eventually reaching 125mph and sticking \".

As live science reports, at 60, men with at least one child had a 1.35 % chance of dying within a year; for childless men, it was 1.41 %. That's a 4 % increased risk for the latter group. But by age 90, the risk for the childless group was 9 % greater. Some other findings: the gender of the child had no bearing on things, and the difference in death risks ws a bit larger for men than for women. The association was also greater when looking at the unmarried, perhaps because a spouse can provide \" care and support, whereas the non-married and widowed would be more exclusively dependent on their adult children. \" still, researchers say other factors may be at play, including the possibility that parents practice healthier habits than nonparents.

The debris spotted by the ship will be analyzed to verify its source and to attempt to find clues in the nereus'demise. Among the standout details of the vehicle, which was built in 2008: it is one of just four submersibles to ever reach the deepest part of the ocean in the mariana trench; it has collected specimens of animals previously unknown to science; and it explored the world's deepest known hydrothermal vents along the caribbean's cayman rise.

The results are correct for the simple tax scenarios we're laying out, but most americans have some factor that complicates their tax situation and can result in lower overall tax burdens, leading to smaller changes when tax law is amended. Analyses that use data from real taxpayers as their starting point – like the calculator put together by the new york times – produce lower estimates. Other calculators like the one put together by the wall street journal produce similar results to ours. For example, a household in d.c.

Assad met with president vladimir putin on monday in the black sea resort of sochi, in what was presented as a bit of a victory lap. \" i would like to introduce you to people who played a key role in saving syria, \" putin said to assad in the presence of russian generals; the bbc reports russia has for two years been running an air campaign in support of assad. At this point the syrian government controls more than 50 % of the country ( earlier this year it was 19 % ), and as the ap puts it, \" no force on the ground is capable of driving assad out at this stage. \" as such, putin suggested russia would be backing out, saying, \" regarding our joint operation to fight terrorists in syria, this military operation is indeed coming to an end. \" the ap notes putin has made such pronouncements before and not followed through. The meeting preceded a summit in the same location with the heads of syrian allies russia and iran, as well as turkey, which has backed the rebels. Cnn reports putin said he would be calling president trump on tuesday to fill him in on the discussion. The ap notes that the eighth round of un-sponsored peace talks between syria and the opposition are slated to begin in geneva, but \" no negotiated resolution is likely to lead to assad's ouster. \" its piece examines how assad has managed to hang on to control for six years, and why that's likely to continue to be the case.

The film touches on \" female friendships, female rivalries, tabloid notoriety, the loss of privacy in the internet age, high culture versus low, and, of course, cinema itself, \" writes manohla dargis at the new york times. Stewart shines as she \" gives herself completely over to her role \" and \" easily holds both her own and the screen... Delivering the kind of emotionally translucent performance that first got her noticed \" in into the wild. Clouds of sils maria is \" a complete, perfectly crafted, fixed object that, upon reflection, remains in perpetual motion, \" tomas hachard writes at npr. Its \" script, performances, cinematography, and pacing \" are all outstanding, \" and as for one of its biggest loose ends, \" it's the magic of the best art that it can satisfy while leaving the conflict unresolved, \" hachard says. He adds stewart tops binoche in what is \" arguably the more difficult role. \" the film is \" a multi-layered, femme-driven meta-fiction that pushes all involved — including next-gen starlets kristen stewart and chloe grace moretz — to new heights, \" writes peter debruge at variety. \" moretz is fine, \" but he lauds stewart as \" the most compellingly watchable american actress of her generation. \" as for the film, it's a \" rich and tantalizingly open-ended psychological study. \"",

State-run xinhua news agency called it ' china's 9/11. ' a woman and child passed by armed paramilitary policemen on patrol near the kunming railway station in western china's yunnan province on sunday, march 2, 2014. More than a dozen knife-wielding assailants killed 29 people at the station on saturday. Ap for more than a year, the chinese media have published regular reports of deadly violent incidents in the predominantly muslim province of xinjiang, in china's far west. More than 100 people died last year in clashes between the police and ethnic uighurs identified by the government as terrorists seeking independence from beijing. Saturday night's attack in the southwestern city of kunming, however, which officials attributed to xinjiang separatists, appears to have been of an entirely different order. The assault by more than a dozen knife-wielding men and women who killed 29 people at the train station waiting to buy train tickets, and wounded 140 more, was the most violent episode ever involving uighurs outside xinjiang. It illustrates that despite heightened police surveillance of suspected xinjiang terrorists, there is little the authorities can do to prevent attacks by determined opponents, as they cannot maintain the level of security across the country that they seek to impose in xinjiang. \"it was china's 9/11, \" said a commentary published by the chinese state-run news agency, xinhua. \"a nationwide outrage has been stirred.",
            "The death toll from the attack rose to 33 with four of the perpetrators among the dead. One suspect is in custody, a woman, who was reported to be hospitalized. The perpetrators were said to be uighurs, a turkic-speaking muslim minority from northwestern china's xinjiang region. Chinese authorities showed on a television station a black flag recovered at the scene which they said was calling for independence for the region that some uighurs refer to as east turkestan.

More than a dozen knife-wielding assailants killed 29 people at the station on saturday. Ap for more than a year, the chinese media have published regular reports of deadly violent incidents in the predominantly muslim province of xinjiang, in china's far west. More than 100 people died last year in clashes between the police and ethnic uighurs identified by the government as terrorists seeking independence from beijing. Saturday night's attack in the southwestern city of kunming, however, which officials attributed to xinjiang separatists, appears to have been of an entirely different order. The assault by more than a dozen knife-wielding men and women who killed 29 people at the train station waiting to buy train tickets, and wounded 140 more, was the most violent episode ever involving uighurs outside xinjiang. It illustrates that despite heightened police surveillance of suspected xinjiang terrorists, there is little the authorities can do to prevent attacks by determined opponents, as they cannot maintain the level of security across the country that they seek to impose in xinjiang. \"it was china's 9/11, \" said a commentary published by the chinese state-run news agency, xinhua. \"a nationwide outrage has been stirred.",
            "The death toll from the attack rose to 33 with four of the perpetrators among the dead. One suspect is in custody, a woman, who was reported to be hospitalized. The perpetrators were said to be uighurs, a turkic-speaking muslim minority from northwestern china's xinjiang region. Chinese authorities showed on a television station a black flag recovered at the scene which they said was calling for independence for the region that some uighurs refer to as east turkestan. Photos: knife attack in china the stabbing spree, which started after 9 p.m. Kunming time saturday, is one of the worst attacks of its kind in china. According to multiple sources, about 10 assailants dressed in black swept through the crowds stabbing and hacking people with knifes that they had concealed in their clothing. \" it was a typical terrorist attack and also a severe crime against humanity. It was china's 9/11, \" the communist party-affiliated global times wrote in an editorial published sunday morning.

Google trends tweeted there was a 250 % spike in just one hour for that search term after the polls had closed. And friday morning, even more confused people didn't seem to understand what had gone down the day before, with google trends reporting a 2,450 % spike in the somewhat panicked \" are we in or out of the eu? \" other after-the-fact queries that saw a boost included: \" what happens to foreigners if we leave the eu?, \" \" what happens if we stay in the eu?, \" and the search term that ars technica dubs to be perhaps the most worrisome: \" what is brexit? \" all of this leads the verge to ponder why such a \" wildly complex \" issue of the uk defecting from the eu was left to a people's referendum instead of in the hands of \" independent experts \" who may have had a better grasp on the issues. \" referendums are a brute-force political engine, a numbers game designed to spit out a yes or no answer on a simple question, \" the site notes. But uk residents had apparently \" had enough of experts \" — at least according to the country's justice minister, michael gove, who had recently made controversial comments comparing pro-eu economists to nazi sympathizers, per the guardian.

That story is now getting pickup, and it involves prime minister justin trudeau and an incident that allegedly happened at a british columbia music festival. The guardian and cbc report that in 2000, the 28-year-old trudeau, then a teacher, attended the kokanee summit fest to raise money for avalanche safety ( his brother michel was killed in an avalanche in 1998 ). But an un-bylined editorial in the creston valley advance shortly after the festival claimed trudeau had done more than listen to some tunes at the event, accusing him of \" groping \" and \" inappropriately handling \" a female reporter there. The writer says trudeau apologized the day after the fest, saying, \" if i had known you were reporting for a national paper, i never would have been so forward. \" trudeau was asked about the incident sunday. \" i remember that day in creston well, \" he told reporters. \" i had a good day that day. I don't remember any negative interactions that day at all. \" the cbc made contact with the alleged victim, believed to have written the editorial herself, earlier this year, and she told the outlet not to id her or contact her again about the story. Valerie bourne, the publisher of the advance at the time, says she remembers that the reporter was \" unsettled \" about the alleged incident. \" it was a brief touch, \" bourne notes. \" i would not classify it or qualify it as sexual assault. \" the paper's former editor, brian bell, meanwhile, deems the reporter of \" high character. \" \" i don't recall that the reporter was … traumatized or distraught about it, but definitely that, whatever … had occurred in that moment was definitely not welcome and definitely inappropriate, \" he says.",

        "summary": "Florida hasn't put anyone to death since january 2016. That's slated to change thursday, along with one other thing: the drug cocktail used to do so. Mark james asay, 53, is scheduled to die by lethal injection, with the increasingly difficult to obtain anesthetic midazolam being replaced by etomidate, which has never been used in a us execution. The use of the latter was oked by the florida supreme court, which in denying a stay of execution for asay noted that it's not always possible to eliminate pain from executions. Asay's lawyer tells reuters that pain can occur as etomidate is administered, and that it can cause the body to writhe, making it tough \" to know when the guy is unconscious. \" after the etomidate, the paralytic rocuronium bromide will be injected, followed by the heart-stopping potassium acetate. The ap reports that potassium acetate has only been used in one prior execution — mistakenly, it turns out — in 2015 in oklahoma. In what the washington post calls a \" largely symbolic move, \" the johnson &amp; johnson-owned janssen, which invented etomidate, issued a statement saying its innovations save lives, and it \" doesn't condone \" such a use for its drug. But at this point it's off-patent and made by a number of generic manufacturers. Should the supreme court deny asay's final appeal, his execution will take place after 6pm. Asay is set to be the first white man put to death in florida for killing a black man, 34-year-old robert lee booker; asay also killed robert mcdowell in a separate incident, also in jacksonville in 1987.",

Staff sell goods outside a supermarket during power outages after typhoon hato hit in macau. Reuters/tyrone siu rescuers on thursday searched submerged cars for trapped people in the former portuguese territory, while overwhelmed emergency services scrambled to respond to crisis calls. Some casinos shut down while others were relying on back-up generators. Many residents and tourists complained that the government was woefully unprepared for typhoon hato and its destructive winds of more than 200 kph ( 124 mph ). Macau's government broadcaster tdm said typhoon hato, a maximum signal 10 storm, was the strongest since 1968 to hit the world's biggest gambling center, home to around 600,000 people. \"the city looks like it was just in a war, \" said one civil servant, who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media. Hato on wednesday hit the nearby financial hub of hong kong, uprooting trees, flooding streets, forcing hundreds of airline flights to be canceled and halting financial trading.

Instead, it was seemingly another odd twist in an odd story. Mira feticu, an author who penned a novel inspired by the heist, received a letter on nov. 6 telling her where she could find the \" harlequin head \" painting, which is thought to be worth north of $ 900,000. The new york times reports that, as instructed, she found it wrapped in plastic under a rock and a bit of soil in a romanian forest and handed it over to authorities on saturday. On sunday, though, she told the afp she had been duped as part of a stunt staged by a belgian theater company, whose directors emailed her to say the letter was part of a project examining the \" value of truth, \" as the bbc puts it. The project, called true copy, is apparently inspired by dutch master forger geert jan jansen, who for decades duped unsuspecting buyers into purchasing his forgeries, which included, yes, works by picasso. His scheme was discovered in 1994. The production company says it wishes to talk to feticu before commenting further, but \" will be back with more details... Within the next few days. \" the times quotes her as saying, \" i feel angry and sad if this is truth. \" as for the 2012 heist, four romanians were jailed for the crime, but the works remain unaccounted for. The mother of the alleged ringleader in 2013 claimed to have burned the paintings, then said she didn't.

        "summary": "Police say the two mysteries were one — but 120 miles separated them. Now, investigators believe they know what happened to mary ann perez, a 33-year-old mother of three who disappeared after meeting friends at a new orleans-area country-western bar on march 26, 1976. As wkrg explains, just eight months after her disappearance, a set of female remains were found by hunters in alabama's mobile county near the mississippi border, but in the pre-computer age, the 120 miles that separated the two cases proved too great: no one put one and one together. Four years later came a revelation, but not one big enough to solve the mystery. In 1980, a man arrested in kansas confessed that he and his wife had killed multiple women, including one they picked up at a country-western bar, reports the washington post. It sounded like perez. But there was a problem. David courtney revealed the location of the bodies to cops, and those remains were found. All except one, that is: the new orleans woman, whom the advocate reports the courtneys say they saw having car trouble. She accepted their offer for a ride, and david said he strangled her and deposited her somewhere along the mississippi border. But no body, no crime. Things went nowhere for decades, until det. Jt thornton of the mobile county sheriff's office started looking into cold cases, came across the jane doe, and then learned about perez. He met with her family, who told her perez had a partial dental plate due to a traffic accident — as did the remains found more than 40 years ago. Those remains are now being dna-tested to confirm the mystery has indeed been solved. Courtney is serving a life sentence in kansas; his wife, donna, served 10 years and died in the ' 90s.",

The remains were found on november 28, 1976, off old pascagoula road. The discovery left investigators with a few decent clues. \"the skeleton still had the clothing and it was mostly intact and there was also a partial dental plate the skull of the female indicated pre-existing injuries from traffic collisions, \" said det. J.t. Thornton, with the mobile county sheriff's office. Eight months before the skeleton was found in mobile county, 33-year-old mary ann perez, a wife and mother of three, disappeared, her car found at a bar near her home in chalmette, outside new orleans. But prior to the computer age, communication between law enforcement agencies was so poor, that no one in 1976 made a connection to the \"jane doe \" skeleton found in south mobile county. Unaware of the new orleans disappearance, in 1977, mobile county shipped the skeletal remains to a lab in oklahoma that used the skull to construct images of what the woman might have looked like. Those images, however, produced no leads and the case quickly went cold. Then in 1980, detectives got a break. A drifter named david courtney was arrested in kansas. He admitted that he and his wife, donna, killed five women in several states, including mary ann perez in new orleans. But he couldn't pinpoint where they had dumped perez ' body. \"all the bodies he had presented in different locations, had been located, \" thornton said. \"the last one he presented ( perez ), they hadn't found her. So that was questionable at that time. \" without a body, thornton said, some of perez ' family held out hope that she was still alive. More than 35 years after courtney's confession, thornton was investigating another unidentified body found in mobile county. \"i actually went to investigate another jane doe that was found in '76, \" thornton explained. \"and behind her, i found jane doe x2. So i thought there might be some correlation so i started investigating and found there was no correlation. \" but through his investigative work, thornton met a detective in harrison county, mississippi who remembered the perez case. Thornton went to new orleans and spoke to perez ' husband and children. \"they advised me"

But prior to the computer age, communication between law enforcement agencies was so poor, that no one in 1976 made a connection to the \"jane doe \" skeleton found in south mobile county. Unaware of the new orleans disappearance, in 1977, mobile county shipped the skeletal remains to a lab in oklahoma that used the skull to construct images of what the woman might have looked like. Those images, however, produced no leads and the case quickly went cold. Then in 1980, detectives got a break. A drifter named david courtney was arrested in kansas. He admitted that he and his wife, donna, killed five women in several states, including mary ann perez in new orleans. But he couldn't pinpoint where they had dumped perez ' body. \"all the bodies he had presented in different locations, had been located, \" thornton said. \"the last one he presented ( perez ), they hadn't found her. So that was questionable at that time. \" without a body, thornton said, some of perez ' family held out hope that she was still alive. More than 35 years after courtney's confession, thornton was investigating another unidentified body found in mobile county. \"i actually went to investigate another jane doe that was found in '76, \" thornton explained. \"and behind her, i found jane doe x2. So i thought there might be some correlation so i started investigating and found there was no correlation. \" but through his investigative work, thornton met a detective in harrison county, mississippi who remembered the perez case. Thornton went to new orleans and spoke to perez ' husband and children. \"they advised me"

The agency announced monday that it was no longer investigating the famous 1971 hijacking in which a passenger known as db cooper jumped out of a plane over washington state with a parachute and $ 200,000 in cash, reports kiro in seattle. It is the only such unsolved hijacking in us history, and it appears that it will stay that way. \" following one of the longest and most exhaustive investigations in our history, on july 8, 2016, the fbi redirected resources allocated to the'db cooper ' case, in order to focus on other investigative priorities, \" says an fbi spokeswoman. It's not clear what prompted the fbi statement, but it comes just after a documentary aired on the history channel in which former fbi detectives claimed to have cracked the case. They name 72-year-old robert rackstraw, who now lives on a boat in a yacht harbor in san diego bay, reports the monterey herald. Rackstraw — who allegedly tried to fake his own death in 1978 by, yes, bailing out of a plane — denies the allegations through his attorney. \" he's not db cooper, \" says the lawyer, though he acknowledges that his client may have floated the claim himself over the years. Of course, this isn't the first db cooper theory and probably won't be the last. Some think cooper never survived the jump, pointing to the discovery of some of the cash by the columbia river in 1980, notes the new york daily news. But \" the fbi exhaustively reviewed all credible leads, \" says the fbi spokeswoman. Still, she adds, if hard evidence emerges, investigators would be back on the job.

Martinez, an accomplished 37-year-old mountain climber from argentina, is currently stuck at around 10,000 feet, about halfway up yukon's mount logan, until rescuers can get to her via helicopter — which may not be until friday, thanks to bad weather. \" things are not settled yet, and another aftershock is possible, \" martinez's partner, who has been keeping in touch with her via satellite phone, tells the cbc. The weather network reported tuesday that more than 100 aftershocks had hit the area in the wake of the 6.2- and 6.3-magnitude quakes, with some of the aftershocks hitting magnitudes as high as 5.7. When the first quake hit early monday morning, martinez felt \" like the mountain was falling apart, \" her partner says. \" she felt that all the ground under her camp subsided and moved a lot, and of course she was very scared. \" her tent was surrounded by serac falls, chunks of glacial ice that are often unstable, but she was able to retreat down the mountain to a more stable location, ctv news reports. \" hopefully everything that was loose came down already, but there could be other dangers that are kind of lurking there that are just on the edge of going, \" notes a rep from the tour outfitter that flew martinez to the area. She's dealing with high winds, and on monday night she had to leave the tent every few hours to dig out so that her camp wouldn't be buried by blowing snow, but her partner and another friend say she is well-equipped to handle the emergency.

        "summary": "News that president obama pulled in $ 400,000 for a wall street speech triggered an initial wave of criticism, but now a backlash appears to be surfacing in his defense. Trevor noah is among those stepping up to back the former president, even as a new report suggests he picked up another enormous payday. Here's the latest: the new york post reports that obama got paid another $ 400,000 thursday night when he sat for a 90-minute interview by historian doris kearns goodwin in an event sponsored by a&e networks in manhattan. The payday hasn't been confirmed. During the interview, the post notes that obama issued a subtle zinger toward president trump. Asked how he handled frustrating moments as president, obama responded, \"for starters, by not having a twitter account. \" on the daily show, noah said critics need to calm down. \" so the first black president must also be the first one to not take money afterwards? \" noah asked. \" make that money, obama. \" he said critics might instead focus on the lax regulations that allow wall street banks to have so much money to dole out in the first place. See the video here. At the root, michael harriot sounds a similar theme. Critics complain the big payday feels wrong. Well, \" maybe asking a man to work for eight years cleaning up the sloppy mess some white guy made, and then telling him he shouldn't ask for money, just feels racist. \" elizabeth warren was among those criticizing obama for his cantor fitzgerald payday. \" i was troubled by that, \" the massachusetts senator said on the siriusxm, per abc news. Bernie sanders, meanwhile, said \" it is unfortunate that president obama is doing this, \" when people are so frustrated with wall street, per the hill. Aaron blake ticks off four reasons in the washington post why taking the money is a bad idea, including its continuation of a \" dubious precedent. \" he also quotes from obama's own book on the dangers of special-interest money. Michael mcgough at the los angeles times has a point-by-point rebuttal of blake's piece. He concludes that obama's decision is \" tacky \" but not immoral. Also criticizing the critics, while not exactly defending obama, is ed krayewski at reason: \" the increasingly bipartisan populist rhetoric against wall street and corporations in general helps deflect attention from the role of government power in creating the problems in the first place while ensuring that nothing is done to change it. \" an op-ed in the new york times traces the history of these fat paychecks for former presidents, noting",

Israeli authorities say refaeli lied about her residency in order to skirt taxes on millions in income from abroad; she's also suspected of failing to report benefits ( like free luxury accommodations and cars ) worth $ 257,000. Refaeli's mother was also arrested on suspicion of evading taxes. The arrests came about during a raid wednesday after an undercover investigation; refaeli and her mother were released on bail thursday. As afp explains, israeli citizens don't need to report income from outside the country if they are not residents of israel, and the tax authority is accusing refaeli and her mother of making it appear as if the model did not live in israel for that reason. Refaeli is suspected of living in apartments registered under the names of her mom and her brother. She also allegedly drove a range rover and a lexus for free, without registering them in her name, in return for allowing herself to be photographed in them, and she and her mother are suspected of failing to report \" celebrity discounts \" they've received as income. Refaeli denies the allegations, the bbc reports, and her lawyer says \" there is no drama \" and \" it will all clear up soon. \"",

The minneapolis police department on sunday night released body camera footage of the incident that led to the death of thurman blevins, a black man killed by white police officers. There had been conflicting reports as to whether the 31-year-old had a gun, but the footage shows an officer kicking away what police say is a handgun that falls to the ground after blevins is shot, the st. Paul pioneer press reports. Blevins \" fled from the officers with a loaded handgun, refused to follow their commands for him to stop and show his hands, and then took the gun out of his pocket and turned toward the officers, \" the hennepin county attorney said monday in his announcement that the officers would not be charged. The washington post has background on the june 23 incident: police were responding to reports of a man firing a gun in public when they came across blevins, who was reportedly sitting on the curb with his girlfriend and baby, and saw that he allegedly had a gun. As they exited their patrol car and approached him, he fled; as they chased him on foot and ordered him to stop, he yelled, \" please don't shoot me. Leave me alone. \" he also insisted he hadn't done anything wrong and denied having a gun. The county attorney's announcement that no charges would be filed was interrupted by protesters, cbs minnesota reports, and reaction to the video has been mixed. Per the post, some say the officers should have done more to de-escalate the situation and accuse them of shooting blevins in the back as he ran from them. \" he didn't deserve to die, \" says a cousin.",

In a just released interview conducted a day after the election, obama tells rolling stone that \" michelle will never run for office. \" \" she is as talented a person as i know. You can see the incredible resonance she has with the american people. But i joke that she's too sensible to want to be in politics, \" he adds, per the ap. He did acknowledge that the first couple will \" continue to be very active \" on a grassroots level after leaving the white house. Back in march, the first lady said she \" will not run for president. No, nope, not going to do it. \" but the comments aren't likely to deter at least three pacs formed in the last month which are banking on obama changing her mind, especially as gambling site bovada claims she has the best odds of any democrat to win in 2020, though donald trump, mike pence, and paul ryan currently have better odds, reports the wrap.

        "summary": "Kim jong un on saturday said nuclear tests would no longer be conducted at the underground punggye-ri nuclear test facility; a new report from the wall street journal suggests the move may not be as benevolent as it appears. It flags an about-to-be-published study by chinese researchers who say that much of the facility below mount mantap is actually useless following the country's last detonation, which the seismologists say caused a partial cavity collapse. This isn't exactly new news: satellite images taken before and after the country's sixth nuclear test on sept. 3 show the 7,200-foot-tall mount mantap actually lost elevation. Reports at the time suggested \" tired mountain syndrome, \" which has previously been observed at other nuclear test sites in the us and soviet union, was at play. It essentially means a mountain is under such stress that the collapse of cavities or tunnels is possible. The journal reports the upcoming study and another published this month provide more evidence that such a collapse did occur. Using data captured by chinese seismic monitoring stations, they arrived at the same conclusion: that a 6.3-magnitude quake caused by the test led to a collapse inside the mountain that caused a 4.1-magnitude temblor 8.5 minutes later. The second study didn't comment on whether the facility is still usable, and a commentary at 38 north asserts \" there is no basis to conclude \" it isn't. Yes, the \" north portal \" might be damaged, but there are two portals \" located in more pristine competent rock \" that the site believes would be appropriate for testing.",

Following pyongyang's sixth nuclear test in september 2017, one area at the site — the north portal, located at mount mantap where the last five underground nuclear tests had been conducted — was apparently abandoned.

A different report cited by the atlantic puts the chance of a human extinction event happening in the next 100 years at 9.5 %. That means you're nearly 12 times more likely to be killed by, say, a terminator or a super-virus than in a car crash during your lifetime. \" the international community needs to work together and do more to address these threats, \" sebastian farquhar, director of the global priorities project, writes for the huffington post. \" doing nothing is not an option.

He envisions turning mvezo into a tourist destination, and his critics say he's just trying to cash in on his grandfather's legacy.

Police spokesman mzukisi fatyela told the bbc officers would investigate allegations of illegal grave tampering. A public prosecutor would then decide whether to press charges, he said. It involves the bodies of three of the ex-president's children, who were allegedly moved from a family graveyard about two years ago by mandla mandela. In a separate case, 16 mandela family members are seeking to move the bodies back to the graveyard in the village of qunu, where mr mandela, who is critically ill in hospital with a recurring lung infection, wants to be laid to rest.

Police spokesman mzukisi fatyela told the bbc officers would investigate allegations of illegal grave tampering. A public prosecutor would then decide whether to press charges, he said. It involves the bodies of three of the ex-president's children, who were allegedly moved from a family graveyard about two years ago by mandla mandela. In a separate case, 16 mandela family members are seeking to move the bodies back to the graveyard in the village of qunu, where mr mandela, who is critically ill in hospital with a recurring lung infection, wants to be laid to rest.

A nasa spacecraft that sent space samples back to our planet in 2006 captured an astounding find that's just coming to light: seven specks of stardust believed to be the first from outside our solar system. Finding the teeny fragments, captured in the spacecraft's trays of aerogel, however, was no easy task. Some 30,700 citizen scientists, or \" dusters, \" have been combing over digitized images of the trays in the hopes of finding \" tracks \" left behind from dust motes. A canadian man who discovered a track — which looked \" like a carrot growing in the ground, \" he tells the cbc — guesses he spent a thousand hours on the project. Finally, his work has paid off. He helped discover orion, one of two stardust motes revealed by the citizen scientists. ( the others were found by actual researchers. ) orion, and the other mote, hylabrook, are both pretty large, new scientist points out. However, even large specks of stardust are pretty tiny: about one-16,000th of an inch, reuters reports. The cbc adds they look like \" tiny fluffy clumps, \" with \" geometric crystals on the inside and a shapeless, glassy material on the outside that was likely generated by heating and melting followed by sudden cooling. \" scientists say the stardust may have come from exploding stars but first they must confirm it did in fact come from beyond our solar system. That may mean waiting for more advanced technology so as to not risk destroying the tiny specks, a researcher explains.",

            "Emboldened by its meteoric rise in greece, the far-right golden dawn party is spreading its tentacles abroad, amid fears it is acting on its pledge to \" create cells in every corner of the world \". The extremist group, which forged links with british neo-nazis when it was founded in the 1980s, has begun opening offices in germany, australia, canada and the us. The international push follows successive polls that show golden dawn entrenching its position as greece's third, and fastest growing, political force. First catapulted into parliament with 18 mps last year, the ultra-nationalists captured 11.5 % support in a recent survey conducted by polling company public issue. The group – whose logo resembles the swastika and whose members are prone to give nazi salutes – has gone from strength to strength, promoting itself as the only force willing to take on the \" rotten establishment \". Amid rumours of backing from wealthy shipowners, it has succeeded in opening party offices across greece. It is also concentrating on spreading internationally, with news last month that it had opened an office in germany and planned to set up branches in australia. The party's spokesman, ilias kasidiaris, said it had decided to establish cells \" wherever there are greeks \". \" people have understood that chrysi avgi [ golden dawn ] tells the truth,"

But when she became pregnant again in 2013, a bladder issue that arose during her first pregnancy had her going even more frequently and urgently — so much so that stopping to clock out would have caused her to have an accident.

The oregonian reports that in june 2013, steckmann's supervisor and the hr manager called her into a meeting, chided her for not clocking out, and fired her. She claims the hr manager said that she could have been watching movies during her frequent breaks, and that her supervisor equated her bathroom behavior to stealing because \" not clocking out to use the restroom is stealing from the company. \" the paper notes that steckmann's managers are male and that she had gone to the ceo with complaints about gender bias against her supervisor in april 2013. Steckmann is seeking $ 406,000 in lost wages and damages, and she wants her job back, too: she worked as a fabrication technician making $ 18.76 an hour.

        "summary": "While consumers were fighting over fancy televisions on black friday, the us government was fighting over consumers. The new york times reports richard cordray suddenly left his position as director of the consumer financial protection bureau on friday — a week ahead of schedule. One of his final moves before heading out the door was to name his chief of staff, leandra english, as deputy director. Cordray says that would legally make her acting director until such a time as president trump nominates a new director and gets that nominee approved by the senate. Instead, trump immediately named budget director mick mulvaney as acting director of the cfpb, which regulates companies that lend money to consumers. It's now completely unclear which acting director will be in charge of the bureau come monday morning. Citing the 1998 federal vacancies reform act, administration officials tell reuters that trump has the power to install his own acting director and that the administration expects mulvaney to be in charge with english working under him next week. But in a facebook post, sen. Elizabeth warren — who was responsible for the creation of the cfpb — says trump \" can't override \" the dodd-frank act, which states the cfpb deputy director becomes acting director until a permanent replacement is approved. The battle of who controls the cfpb has real stakes, as trump has been on a mission to mold financial regulators to his liking and republicans have been trying to kill the cfpb since its formation. In fact, mulvaney once called the bureau — which has punished banks, student lenders, and others over predatory lending practices — a \" sad, sick joke. \"",

But results from the competition indicate that even ' bots have biases, the guardian reports. Forty-four winners were chosen out of about 6,000 entrants from all over the globe who uploaded pics to youth laboratories'site, allowing the \" robot jury \" to make its assessments based on supposedly objective criteria such as facial symmetry and how many wrinkles and pimples a person had, tnw.com notes. But the winners had one thing in common: they were mostly white. The five-robot panel selected only a few asian contestants and just one dark-skinned entrant in the women's 40-49 age category. So what gives? alex zhavoronkov, chief science officer for the microsoft-supported project, says there simply weren't enough models of minorities to contribute to the attractiveness-measuring algorithms — and that lack could have been caused by deep biases the engineers didn't even realize they had. A computer science professor at haverford college says there are ways to cut down on droid bias ( keeping a closer eye on entered data, for one ), and beauty.ai says it's going to work on the issues for the next contest.

The demonstration came after the university's animal care and use committee voted earlier this month to continue the practice through november 2020. The protocol used by the university says the eight residents accepted each year for the three-year program need six pigs for every six-month session to complete the training. Each pig is anesthetized before training begins and then subjected to eight procedures, which include opening the chest to reach the heart and cutting an airway into the throat. The columbia daily tribune reported in july the pigs either die during the course of the procedures or are killed before the last part by the residents, who perform a post-mortem technique in which fluid is drained from the sac around the animal's heart. But retired er physician kerry foley said none of the training requires a pig. She said it would be more helpful for students to learn on clinical anatomy models. \" you can now obtain things called perfused cadavers, which are very lifelike and true to the experience of working on real patients, \" foley said as she picketed outside the hospital.

Through the rec act, the bureau of economic analysis will come up with official numbers for the outdoor recreation industry's economic impact. That includes its contribution to the gdp, how many jobs it creates, and the consumer spending it generates. In its own study a few years ago, the industry estimated its own value at $ 646 billion, including 6.1 million jobs and $ 80 billion in taxes. But with official government numbers, the outdoor recreation industry will be able to \" even the playing field, \" in the words of one outdoor advocate, with other industries competing for the use of public lands, including mining and timber. While those industries have \" concrete federal statistics \" to back up their arguments, outdoor recreation advocates had been stuck with anecdotes. Outdoor recreation can be immensely important to local economies, the chattanooga times free press reports. One expert found rock climbing alone brought $ 7 million into a single tennessee county last year. Protecting natural resources is vital to that. One sponsor of the rec act says he ' ll be able to tell other legislators: \" look at the incredible contribution to your wyoming/montana economy from outdoor recreation.

        "summary": "The california department of forestry and fire protection has put 16 state firefighters on paid leave — though it's not totally clear why as officials sift through preliminary results of an investigation into something of a sordid mess. As the sacramento bee reports, at the heart of the allegations is 56-year-old orville fleming, a former calfire battalion chief and fire academy instructor who in may was charged in the grisly murder of 26-year-old sarah douglas, a former escort and fleming's live-in girlfriend. Fleming's estranged wife, meagan, at the time told sacramento county sheriffs that she had seen a video of douglas having sex with her husband and other firefighters aboard firetrucks. Calfire asked the california highway patrol to investigate. And while a calfire rep says \" allegations of a sex tape are unfounded, \" and that the suspensions were due to \" a variety of policy violations unrelated to allegations of a sex tape, \" the full results of the chp investigation won't be released until early january, notes the ap. Meagan fleming further alleged that orville fleming and other firefighters had sex with prostitutes on firetrucks; a calfire rep calls that determination \" something we are waiting for \" from the investigation. \" i think everyone was taken by surprise with this, \" says a calfire union rep. \" this ( is a ) very unfortunate situation that the employees of cal fire — all of us — are now having to deal with. \"",
