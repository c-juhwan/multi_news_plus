Today, it admitted that actually, it had been — which, according to the minneapolis star tribune, makes the stolen cards significantly more likely to be fraudulently cloned. But target says it's \" confident that pin numbers are safe and secure \" because they were tightly encrypted. That means to read them, thieves would need a key that target says never even existed in its system — the second customers put in their number, it was encrypted and sent to a third-party payment processor. An independent security expert tells cnnmoney that it would be \" difficult or impossible to decrypt \" target's algorithm without that key. But an anonymous executive for a major us bank tells reuters that they're worried nonetheless, and jpmorgan and santander have both lowered their limits on atm withdrawals as a precaution.",

Caa, which lured cosby away from the william morris agency in 2012, \" quietly dumped \" him late last year, leaving him with no representation in hollywood, insiders tell deadline. But with dozens of women accusing cosby of sexual misconduct — and with the possible release of more cosby testimony — him losing representation at this point is probably a formality, \" like the way you might throw away a burned-out light bulb, an empty bottle of ketchup, or a formerly beloved comedian who turned out to be a huge creep, \" writes sam barsanti at the av club. Cosby stands to lose more than hollywood representation: a sexual assault awareness group wants to see him stripped of the presidential medal of freedom he was awarded by george w. Bush in 2002, usa today reports. \" certainly it would be an unprecedented event to take this away, \" the founder of promoting awareness, victim empowerment says. \" but it's also an unprecedented moment in our nation's history that such an iconic figure, a legend, be accused by 40 women of sexual violence. \" in philadelphia, a father's day mural from 2008 featuring bill cosby was already on a list of works for decommissioning, and authorities tell the ap that \" recent headlines \" have moved it a lot further up the list.

            "The investment arms of the cia and google are both backing a company that monitors the web in real time — and says it uses that information to predict the future. The company is called recorded future, and it scours tens of thousands of websites, blogs and twitter accounts to find the relationships between people, organizations, actions and incidents — both present and still-to-come. In a white paper, the company says its temporal analytics engine \"goes beyond search \" by \"looking at the 'invisible links ' between documents that talk about the same, or related, entities and events. \" the idea is to figure out for each incident who was involved, where it happened and when it might go down. Recorded future then plots that chatter, showing online \"momentum \" for any given event. \"the cool thing is, you can actually predict the curve, in many cases, \" says company ceo christopher ahlberg, a former swedish army ranger with a phd in computer science. Which naturally makes the 16-person cambridge, massachusetts, firm attractive to google ventures, the search giant's investment division, and to in-q-tel, which handles similar duties for the cia and the wider intelligence community. It's not the very first time google has done business with america's spy agencies. Long before it reportedly enlisted the help of the national security agency to secure its networks, google sold equipment to the secret signals-intelligence group. In-q-tel backed the mapping firm keyhole, which was bought by google in 2004 — and then became the backbone for google earth. This appears to be the first time, however, that the intelligence community and google have funded the same startup, at the same time. No one is accusing google of directly collaborating with the cia. But the investments are bound to be fodder for critics of google, who already see the search giant as overly cozy with the u.s.

            "The investment arms of the cia and google are both backing a company that monitors the web in real time — and says it uses that information to predict the future. The company is called recorded future, and it scours tens of thousands of websites, blogs and twitter accounts to find the relationships between people, organizations, actions and incidents — both present and still-to-come. In a white paper, the company says its temporal analytics engine \"goes beyond search \" by \"looking at the 'invisible links ' between documents that talk about the same, or related, entities and events. \" the idea is to figure out for each incident who was involved, where it happened and when it might go down. Recorded future then plots that chatter, showing online \"momentum \" for any given event. \"the cool thing is, you can actually predict the curve, in many cases, \" says company ceo christopher ahlberg, a former swedish army ranger with a phd in computer science. Which naturally makes the 16-person cambridge, massachusetts, firm attractive to google ventures, the search giant's investment division, and to in-q-tel, which handles similar duties for the cia and the wider intelligence community. It's not the very first time google has done business with america's spy agencies. Long before it reportedly enlisted the help of the national security agency to secure its networks, google sold equipment to the secret signals-intelligence group. In-q-tel backed the mapping firm keyhole, which was bought by google in 2004 — and then became the backbone for google earth. This appears to be the first time, however, that the intelligence community and google have funded the same startup, at the same time. No one is accusing google of directly collaborating with the cia. But the investments are bound to be fodder for critics of google, who already see the search giant as overly cozy with the u.s. Government, and worry that the company is starting to forget its \"don't be evil \" mantra. America's spy services have become increasingly interested in mining \"open source intelligence \" — information that's publicly available, but often hidden in the daily avalanche of tv shows, newspaper articles, blog posts, online videos and radio reports. \"secret information isn't always the brass ring in our profession, \" then cia-director",

So we thought, 'this man deserves an honorary doctorate from us! ' he should have gone here. He would have been a perfect saic student — he likes to shake people out of complacency. \" \" hip-hop is the cultural expression of the moment and here is kanye, who is delivering in a way something like a 21st-century version of the realists, \" she continues. \" the man is a radical, so we said, 'let's do this.

Sample twitter reaction: \" it frightfully casual how readily saic is willing to devalue my #bfa. \" and an art magazine editor complains to the trib, \" the school does not have a music program, it has a fashion program, and i suppose you could honor kanye west for his contributions to fashion, but... I don't know if that make[ s ] sense. \" west, for the record, is already a college lecturer.

Tuesday's vote, largely along party lines, was 227-203 and capped a gop sprint to deliver a major legislative accomplishment to president trump. In a last-minute glitch, however, the senate parliamentarian ruled that three provisions in the bill, including one that would allow parents to use college savings accounts for home-schooling expenses for young children, violate senate budget rules. House majority leader kevin mccarthy said the house would vote on the package again on wednesday, after the senate removes the problematic provisions and passes the bill, per the ap. The senate, for its part, is expected to pass the measure tuesday night or early wednesday. The massive $ 1.5 trillion package would touch every american taxpayer and every corner of the us economy, providing steep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy, and more modest tax cuts for middle- and low-income families. The standard deduction used by most families would be nearly doubled, to $ 24,000 for a married couple, while those who itemize would lose some deductions. The plan also would push the national debt ever higher. \" today we are giving the people of this country their money back, \" said house speaker paul ryan, per the hill. \" you're lying! \" shouted a woman in the public visitors ' gallery, one of several who interrupted the proceedings.",

        "summary": "Republicans may be crowing about their victory last tuesday, but the election's real winners weren't so much partisan as all-business: as the washington post reports, the bank-busting 2010 campaign pumped an estimated $ 4 billion into the whimpering us economy it revolved around ( for a little context, cash for clunkers came in around $ 3 billion ). The big winners? your pals in the media, who raked in some $ 2.5 billion to subject you to that inescapable barrage of advertising. One national broadcaster scored $ 41 million off the campaign — a 35 % increase over 2006. Elsewhere, candidates spent some $ 50 million on catering and booze, $ 3.2 million at country clubs, and a cool half-million on campaign fuel like pizza and coffee. \" it's helped everyone get back on their feet, because last year was terrible, \" says a media analyst. \" it's a really good thing there was a big election this year. \" ( but brian palmer, writing for slate, thinks that $ 4 billion may not help the economy at all.

        "summary": "A small window into the rwandan genocide of 1994 has played out in a new hampshire courtroom, resulting in the loss of us citizenship for a woman who came here after the massacre. A jury ruled that beatrice munyenyezi, 43, covered up the role she and her family played in the genocide when she gained citizenship a decade ago, reports the guardian. Witnesses testified that munyenyezi herself singled out tutsis at a notorious roadblock to be raped and murdered. Her mother-in-law was a high-ranking hutu who, along with munyenyezi's husband, was convicted by an international tribunal of crimes against humanity. Both are serving life sentences. Munyenyezi, who came to the us with her three daughters, is now behind bars in new hampshire. She faces a 10-year sentence along with likely deportation to rwanda, a fate her lawyers equate to a death sentence. The jury forewoman says she and fellow jurors sobbed over the verdict, which came after nine days of chilling testimony about the mass murders, reports ap. Munyenyezi may not have been as heavily involved as her husband and mother-in-law, but at the very least she checked ids at the roadblock, she says. \" i do feel we made the right decision, but it weighs so heavily on us. \"",

A new video shows how terrifying it can be, albeit very slowly terrifying ( an expert told the los angeles times over the weekend that lava was flowing away from one fissure at \" significantly less \" than 1mph ). The video, shot by mississippi natural disaster chaser brandon clement on sunday, shows lava slowly crossing a road in the leilani estates community and then engulfing a ford mustang on the other side. \" it looked like the movie [ the ] blob, but on fire, \" he tells cnn. He watched the lava build up behind a gate, eventually forcing it open, before taking about 10 minutes to cross the 20-foot-wide street. He estimates it moved 300 feet in 35 minutes. As of early tuesday, a dozen fissures, or lava vents, had opened in the area, and lava had destroyed 35 structures, the ap reports. Gov. David ige has called the white house and the federal emergency management agency to inform officials he believes hawaii will require federal help. Khon reports volcanic activity has slowed and lava is no longer coming from the fissures, but officials say the danger hasn't passed yet. \" this is not over, \" a usgs geologist tells hawaii news now. \" there's still magma within the rift zone.

In fact, the average american consumes 2 pounds of almonds a year, a stark difference from the ' 70s, when it hovered around a quarter-pound, reports the washington post. Experts propose a few reasons behind the surge. \" the recent rise in popularity has certainly been helped along by the negative press surrounding dairy and soy milk, \" an almond milk producer tells good food. There's also less concern with nuts ' fat content than there was just a few years ago, and as more people eschew red meat — at least 3 % of americans now claim to be vegetarian — almonds are an attractive alternate protein source. Heavy marketing, as well as several studies finding health benefits in almonds, have also raised awareness and consumption of almonds in multiple forms — including oil, flour, and milk, with almond milk accounting for almost 5 % of us milk sales.

Fager was let go wednesday amid growing pressure from sexual harassment allegations from multiple women as reported by ronan farrow in the new yorker. Cbs news president david rhodes said wednesday that fager was fired for violating company policy. Fager issued a statement referring to the text message he sent correspondent jericka duncan after she reached out to him for comment on sunday, the day farrow's latest expose was published. According to farrow's report, fager has been accused of groping or inappropriately touching female cbs news staffers at company events. Duncan reported on the situation with fager on wednesday's edition of \"cbs evening news. \" she read from fager's text message: \"if you repeat these false accusations without any of your own reporting to back them up you will be responsible for harming me, \" fager wrote, per duncan. \"be careful.

There are people who lost their jobs trying to harm me and if you pass on these damaging claims without your own reporting to back them up that will become a serious problem. Earlier on wendesday, after cbs news announced fager's exit, effective immediately, fager said in a statement that cbs had \"terminated my contract early because i sent a text message to one of our own cbs reporters demanding that she be fair in covering the story. \" \"my language was harsh and, despite the fact that journalists receive harsh demands for fairness all the time, cbs did not like it, \" fager said, complaining \"one such note should not result in termination after 36 years, but it did. \" announcing fager"

Below are five celebrities you can literally order off a menu. The \" martha stewart \" hot dog: a hot dog is not exactly the kind of haute cuisine you'd expect to be associated with the queen of homemaking, but for $ 6.95 at pink's hot dogs in los angeles, you can get a 9 \" inch dog topped with relish, onions, bacon, chopped tomatoes, sauerkraut, and sour cream. Martha has even stopped by to try it herself! the \" lady gaga \" sushi roll: various japanese restaurants across the u.s. Have named sushi rolls after the singer, including at least one that features bbq eel. Considering lady gaga reportedly installed a $ 70k japanese fish collection, it seems an appropriate homage. The \" avril lavigne \" pizza: at la pizzeria in the canadian singer's hometown of napanee, ontario, you can order a pepperoni, mushrooms, and green olive pie in honor of avril, who, for the record, no longer eats those toppings. The \" joaquin phoenix \" vegan sandwich: the actor has been a committed vegan since the age of 3, so it's fitting that his sandwich at two beards deli in grand rapids, mi contains \" curry tofu salad \" and veggies. The \" alyssa milano \" chicken sandwich: at lioni italian heroes in brooklyn, ny, there are numerous sandwiches on the menu named after celebrities, but the \" alyssa milano, \" a chicken cutlet hero with prosciutto, mozzarella, and basil, is a favorite among regulars. As one yelp reviewer put it: \" let's describe alyssa milano at lioni's... She's beautiful in person, she has a nice tan, perfect size and packing quality meat.

Just 38 % thought he should. Moment passed? at the washington post, chris cillizza includes biden on his list of debate losers. If the vp were hoping clinton would stumble, he miscalculated. \" i think it's reasonable to ask whether, by not announcing before the debate, biden may have missed his moment to strike when clinton was at her weakest. \" a longer shot: biden was \" perhaps the biggest loser \" of the night, observes john zogby at forbes. \" while his draft committee ran a powerful ad showing the person and his values in mr. Biden's own voice, the fact is that mrs. Clinton was just commanding. \" filing deadlines will soon force biden's hand, but \" i don't see how he chooses to run now. \" smart move: a pre-debate analysis at the christian science monitor made the case that it was wise for biden to sit out the debate, because it would allow him to assess his chances. \" if he thinks her performance is not particularly compelling, or if he thinks that she signals anything to him that suggests she might have a problem in the general election, i think that's what convinces him to throw his hat in, \" says one analyst.

Seeker reports thousands of the frogs — scientific name telmatobius culeus — have been found dead and floating along 30 miles of peru's coata river, a lake titicaca tributary, in recent days. The scrotum frogs, so named because of the baggy skin that helps them breathe in the thin air of their natural habitat, are \" critically endangered, \" according to cnn. Experts say the scrotum frog population has shrunk by 80 % over the past 15 years due to habitat destruction, the introduction of north american trout into lake titicaca, and locals over-harvesting the frogs for food. But no one is quite sure what's behind the recent mass die-off. Environmentalists, who brought 100 dead scrotum frogs to the regional capital's town center in protest, blame sewage runoff from a town near the river. Sludge and solid waste have been seen where the frogs live. \" they have no idea how major the pollution is, \" seeker quotes the leader of the protest as saying. \" the situation is maddening. \" the committee against the pollution of the coata river says the government has ignored residents'demands for a sewage treatment plant in the area, the bbc reports.

        "summary": "A painting will hit the block at christie's in new york on nov. 15, and it's tough to say what's more interesting: that it could fetch $ 100 million, or the story behind it. As the wall street journal reports, getting to nine figures would be an auction record for a painting by an old master — that is, a european who painted before about 1800. But not just any old master: leonardo da vinci. His \" salvator mundi, \" or the savior of the world, is one of fewer than 20 da vincis known to exist, and all the others are held by museums. It's currently owned by russian billionaire dmitry rybolovlev, who will likely be selling it at a loss. He bought it in 2013 for $ 127.5 million, and per his rep, \" the forthcoming auction of this work will finally bring to an end a very painful chapter. \" the pain he's referring to relates to rybolovlev's dealings with swiss art dealer yves bouvier, who counted rybolovlev among his clients. Bouvier himself had purchased the work privately for $ 80 million; the 60 % increase in price spurred allegations of fraud and ongoing court cases. But the drama began before then, with what christie's calls \" the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 21st century. \" it says it's known the painting belonged to both king charles i of england and king charles ii, but the painting was lost from 1763 until 1900 when the work — which had \" extensive repainting \" over jesus ' face and hair — was purchased as a work attributed to one of da vinci's followers. It sold at auction in 1958 for what quartz reports was $ 60. A group of art dealers bought it in 2005, painstakingly restored it, and announced their find, the first da vinci to be discovered since 1909. ( this recent da vinci discovery involves a nude mona lisa. )",

Both columns of supposedly elite troops and armored vehicles sent to the region surrendered without a fight yesterday in the face of peaceful resistance from civilians, a defeat so humiliating that one kiev politician tried to pretend it was actually cunning ploy in which the vehicles had opted to fly russian flags in a clever bid to sail past the crowds. In what the new york times calls a \" tactical error, \" the vehicles didn't have accompanying crowd-control forces. So the column en route to slovyansk, unwilling to fire on its own people, was helpless when confronted by drunken, rowdy civilians, backed by well-armed militiamen. \" i am a soldier. I protect the people. I won't shoot you, \" one soldier said, removing his rifle's magazine. Within minutes the column had surrendered. Militiamen paraded the vehicles into slovyansk, spun them for the crowd, and parked them under russian flags. A second column on the outskirts of kramatorsk had the same problem, eventually striking a deal with the militia to hand over their guns in exchange for passage back the way they had come. Meanwhile and elsewhere: kiev's defense ministry initially refused to acknowledge that its vehicles had been taken, and fatherland party leader sergei sobolev said it was actually a crafty \" guerrilla approach \" to infiltrate slovyansk. It wasn't. Residents in slovyansk, expecting an attack at the hands of ukrainian forces, tell the guardian they were surprised — and in some cases relieved — to see the vehicles. \" we were very afraid. Now we are reassured. The tanks are here to protect us, \" one woman said. But another said he was \" suspicious \" of the masked gunmen. \" i ' m ukrainian. This should be ukrainian territory. \" the gunmen didn't try to hide their allegiance. \" i ' m russian, \" one said. Not all confrontations were so bloodless. Three separatists were killed and 13 wounded last night while attacking a ukrainian national guard headquarters in mariupol, reuters reports. \" they came here around 8: 15pm, demanding that we surrender our weapons and join the people, \" a police major said. \" then they used a truck to break through the gate. \" a separatist representative described the mariupol incident as a \" peacefully rally, \" though he admitted that \" some people came with molotov cocktails. \" one russian news portal is reporting that deposed president viktor yanukovych, who is currently living in russia, will return to eastern ukraine this weekend.

She disappeared on nov. 2 last year and was next seen 22 days later, when she flagged down a passing car 150 miles south of her redding home. She had been beaten and shackled and weighed just 87 pounds. On wednesday, police released sketches of the two spanish-speaking women that papini says abducted her, people reports. \" it has taken time for sherri to recover to a point to be able to provide accurate details to the sketch artist, \" the shasta county sheriff's office said. Police also revealed that although papini said she was kidnapped by two women, a man's dna was recovered from her clothing and a woman's dna from her body. Sgt. Brian jackson says the male dna didn't match that of papini's husband. He tells the sacramento bee that papini was branded with \" obscure letters \" on her right shoulder during the disappearance. Jackson says the information is being released now in the hope of generating new leads. No evidence of sexual assault was found, and authorities haven't disclosed a possible motive for the alleged kidnapping. Authorities say a male acquaintance from michigan that papini had been texting in the days before her disappearance is not a suspect, the los angeles times reports. Papini and her husband, keith papini, have both passed polygraph tests, police say. ( a 2003 police report raised suspicions about the disappearance. )",

A balding, gray-bearded man in a suit knocked on a door at 11: 30am yesterday, witnesses told police. When 59-year-old music teacher ruthanne lodato opened the door, he shot her, as well as a caregiver inside the home, and then fled, cbs dc reports.

Kirby was shot in his home in broad daylight three months ago, nothing was stolen, there was no sign of forced entry — and he lived just about a mile away from lodato.

All of the newly discovered bees come from the perdita group of more than 700 species and subspecies of bees in the southwestern united states and mexico and are useful for pollinating and spreading the seeds of desert plants. But two species — p. Prodigiosa and p. Pilonotata — are particularly fascinating \" with distinctive ant-like males \" that look nothing like their mates, reads a zootaxa study, per gizmodo. \" it's unclear why these males have this unique form, but it could indicate they spend a lot of time in the nest, \" says entomologist zach portman of utah state university. Next up will be further study of the nesting habits of the new bees. They create their homes by gnawing holes in sandstone in areas like mesa verde in colorado and california's death valley, reports tech times. The bees typically head out in direct sunlight during the hottest periods of the day, perhaps as \" a way of avoiding predators \" who would rather move in cooler temperatures, portman says in a release. If the bees do encounter predators, their various stripes and spots may act as \" camouflage or a form of mimicry, \" portman adds. Also of note: some of the new bees have what scientists call a \" hair basket, \" tiny crooked hairs on the back of the head that collect pollen while they're in flowers.

The first bite, on thompson's left shoulder, was consistent with a right-handed person deliberately allowing the bite, according to the report, per kvue. The report — which notes cobra venom leads to paralysis, respiratory failure, and death within 30 minutes — adds thompson \" had a history of suicidal ideation. \" shortly before he died, thompson had posted a message on facebook reading, simply, \" i ' m sorry, \" per the new york daily news.

The desire to cash in on alcohol sales outstripped founder walt disney's belief that the park, founded 63 years ago, should be a wholesome, booze-free environment, per the register, which adds that alcohol is a big moneymaker at other disney properties, including the adjacent california adventure park.",

        "summary": "It's beginning to look a lot like 2008. The new york times reports americans had $ 12.7 trillion in household debt during the first quarter of 2017 — a record high beating out the previous peak, which came immediately before the financial crisis. The new record was announced wednesday by the federal reserve of new york. While it means many americans have rebuilt their credit since the recession and are feeling optimistic enough to take out loans, the record also comes with risk. The debt held by american households could keep them from buying houses and other large purchases that spur economic growth and possibly trigger another round of defaults, as happened in 2008. The record debt \" is not a marker we should be super excited to get back to, \" says the executive director of a liberal think tank. But a research officer at the federal reserve tells the los angeles times the record is \" neither a reason to celebrate nor a cause for alarm. \" in fact, there are a number of differences between 2008 and 2017. For one, mortgage and credit card debt is lower than it was before the recession, with the difference being made up by an increase in student loan and auto debt, cbs news reports. There are better employment levels now, and more loans are held by older, typically wealthier americans. Consumers are delinquent on only 4.8 % of the total debt, compared to 11.9 % in 2009. Finally, current household debt makes up less of the us economy than it did in 2008.",

Nicola, who had his first detention review tuesday in front of the country's immigration board and will have another next week, was believed to have arrived in canada from sudan in november, on the day he then said was three days before his 17th birthday; he claimed to be searching for a better life. \" i don't know how many of [ my friends ] have a clue of how it is in africa, \" he had told the star back in january. But during his five-month stint on the school's basketball team, his size raised eyebrows. \" i did think he looked older than a high-schooler, \" another student who played against nicola in a december tournament tells the new york daily news. \" basketball skill-wise he was all right, but his height is what made him better than everyone. \" nicola's coach, whom he lives with, said in the january star article that \" i think this kid will have a chance at the nba. I have never said that about any kid from windsor. \" the school is remaining tight-lipped about nicola specifically, with a spokesman telling the star that there's \" really not a whole lot to say \" while the probe is ongoing and insisting there's a \" system of checks and balances \" the school relies on for incoming international students to make sure all paperwork is on the up-and-up.

Cusumano insists nicola's ability to grasp things as quickly as he does is unheard of, especially considering he was basically at ground zero when he began the season. \"he's never played organized ball, \" cusumano said.",

When he spots an obviously stolen bike, he then sets up a meeting to buy it.

        "summary": "Congratulations to science on discovering an even more terrifying spider. Ok, so chimerarachne yingi isn't quite a spider and lived 100 million years ago. But still. The discovery of the apparent spider ancestor — four individuals of which were found trapped in amber from myanmar — was revealed in a paper monday in nature ecology &amp; evolution. While c. Yingi shares a lot of characteristics with modern spiders — eight legs, fangs, silk-producing spinnerets — it has one noticeable trait missing from its descendants: a hairy tail longer than its body, according to a press release. National geographic reports the creature may have used the tail to sense its environment. The paper's co-author, bo wang, says tails may have disappeared as spiders transitioned from hunting their prey to waiting for it in webs. Researcher paul selden says the 2.5-millimeter-long c. Yingi is interesting because it represents a bridge between the tail-having uraraneids from 290 million to 380 million years ago and modern arachnids. No living spiders have tails ( though the ones in your nightmares may after reading this story ), but spider-like animals called vinegroons — described by the washington post as \" a group of nightmarish scorpion-looking creatures \" — do. Selden adds that it's possible c. Yingi still has tailed descendants living in myanmar because of the remote area where the amber was collected. \" we haven't found them, but some of these forests aren't that well-studied, and it's only a tiny creature, \" he says. ( meanwhile, a study last year found spiders eat more meat than all humans combined. )",

Per usa today, the alabama state canvassing board certified jones ' win in the dec. 12 special election, which was held to find a replacement for jeff sessions, who vacated the seat to become the us attorney general. Jones, the first democrat from alabama to take a us senate seat in a quarter century, issued a statement noting he's ready to \" [ go ] to work for the people of alabama \" and that he ' ll serve as an \" independent voice \" who works to find \" common ground with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \" the ap reports. Moore, who the new york times notes lost the election to jones by nearly 22,000 votes, had refused to concede and was still soliciting donations from supporters. Late wednesday, he filed what the atlantic calls a \" last gasp \" lawsuit to keep alabama from certifying jones, citing voter fraud and intimidation, but montgomery circuit judge johnny hardwick ruled thursday the certification was not to be halted while moore investigates the alleged voting irregularities. The times notes moore still hasn't conceded losing his 2006 and 2010 runs for governor in the state, either. \" you win with class, you lose with class, and he just can't do it, \" a gop strategist says.

        "summary": "Ohio has another creepy captivity case on its hands. Three people have been charged with forced labor after allegedly holding a woman with cognitive disabilities and her child prisoner for two years, reports the plain dealer. According to an fbi affidavit reviewed by the mansfield news journal, jordie callahan, 26, and jessica hunt, 31, convinced the woman ( referred to in the affidavit as se ) to come live with them, then allegedly forced her to do house and yard work. She and her child ( no age is given ) were watched via baby monitor and kept in a padlocked room with a concrete floor, in an arrangement that the us attorney called \" modern-day slavery. \" the suspects allegedly kept their captives in line by beating them and threatening to kill them and using pit bulls and pythons to frighten them. They also took se's monthly public assistance payments. Among the many horrifying details in the affidavit: se's child was kept in a single room all day, and she was not permitted to feed the child fruits or vegetables — though she was ordered to feed those items to an iguana. The affidavit also states that callahan and hunt intentionally injured se ( in one case, striking her hand with a rock ) so she would be prescribed pain medication they could take. Police were clued into the situation in october, when se stole a candy bar from a family dollar while shopping for her alleged captors — and asked authorities to take her to jail. When police questioned her, she revealed that the people she lived with were \" mean, \" and police launched an investigation. Woio reports they today raided the apartment in ashland, which is located about an hour outside of cleveland. Callahan, hunt, and daniel j. Brown, 33; face a variety of additional charges, including abduction and kidnapping; court records show an unnamed fourth person was charged.",

Officials gave a handful of alternate scenarios to the wall street journal: a store clerk could have handled materials later used in the bomb, or a female hair could have innocently ended up on it. The journal notes that fbi agents were seen leaving the home of tamerlan tsarnaev's in-laws today. Tsarnaev's widow, katherine russell, has been staying there since the bombings, and one official says the agents were there to get a dna sample from her to see if it matches the one found on the bomb. Meanwhile, dzhokhar tsarnaev has another lawyer. Judy clarke, who was also on the defense team for jared loughner, has been appointed to join the three federal public defenders already assigned to tsarnaev, politico reports. That's because she has a lot of experience with death penalty cases; her appointment will probably lead some to speculate that she ' ll be able to negotiate a plea bargain with a life sentence rather than death, as she did for loughner. The atlantic wire notes that tsarnaev's attorneys have represented quite a few bombers, terrorists, and other well-known criminals, including zacarias moussaoui and the unabomber.",

The bikers were stuck from behind, and wanninkhof was declared dead at the scene, reports news 9. Anderson, 22, suffered a leg injury; morris was unharmed. Wanninkhof's bike &amp; build profile paints the picture of an impressive man with bicycling in his dutch blood: he followed a degree in materials engineering with three years of teach for america work and a masters in teaching adolescent physics. The florida native was working as a teacher in the bronx, and wrote that his belief \" that all my students needed to do was work harder and success would follow \" was shaken \" when a student told me that she and her mom had been moving between relatives houses every week after they couldn't pay rent. How on earth could i expect her to give her all to newton's laws when she wasn't sure where she'd be sleeping that evening? \" newson6 reports the experience inspired his ride. No word yet on whether morris will face charges. ( another driver who killed a cyclist had her phone taken away. )",

Both lampley, 24, and alligood, 19, had pleaded guilty to murdering 23-year-old carey and later 67-year-old steve carter. During a preliminary hearing, angold, 25 — who took a plea deal in exchange for testimony against the pair, per nbc bay area — said the three were using marijuana, heroin, meth, and lsd leading up to their crimes, which began when they stole a handgun from an unlocked truck in san francisco. The group then befriended carey with the goal of robbing her, angold said. But after alligood got her to the ground, angold said he heard gunshots and lampley told him, \" she's dead, dude. Don't worry about it. \" three days later, lampley shot and killed carter, whom the group had targeted for his station wagon, as he hiked with his dog in marin county, angold said. Authorities soon after tracked the vehicle to a soup kitchen in portland, ore., where the suspects were arrested. Lampley was sentenced tuesday to 100 years in prison for first-degree murder. Alligod received 50 years but will be eligible for youthful offender parole in 25 years. Angold was given 15 years for second-degree murder.

Now espn just has to hope the motion picture academy views the series — which uses oj simpson to look at race relations in the us — the same way. \" making this eligible for an oscar sends a larger message: the old definitions of who can produce films, and how long they should be, and even what we call them, are irrelevant. The best work is the best work, and should be eligible for the highest prizes, \" the times states.

Basically, it's a new world for everyone, with new questions. And no one yet knows the answers. What's especially unique about the \" o.j. \" instance is how it strikes right at the heart of the oscars so white debate that gripped the entertainment world this past award season.

Although simpson was acquitted of those murders in 1995, it's a testament to how many people still believe in his guilt that a series like this is even relevant.

That's because a measure passed last month has made france the first country to ban single-use plastic plates, cups, and utensils, the ap reports. The move comes after a plastic-bag ban issued in july, per the washington post. Manufacturers have until 2020 to get up to speed, meaning these throwaway items will have to be made of biologically sourced materials that can be tossed in the compost pile. The goal: to get rid of plastic that doesn't degrade quickly, as well as cut down on the energy needed to process these items ( and the waste that's a byproduct ). Plastic is also a hazard to wildlife: because it doesn't disintegrate but merely breaks down into tinier pieces, animals and birds can scoop it up, thinking it's food. But while this move is being heralded by environmental advocates, some say it's violating eu laws that allow for the free movement of products. \" we are urging the european commission to do the right thing and to take legal action against france for infringing european law, \" eamonn bates, the secretary general of a euro packaging manufacturers group, tells the ap. Some, including france's ecological minister, say it could also hurt poor families that often use plastic dishware, and the australian, via science alert, says some manufacturers claim it's either too expensive or they're not equipped to go biodegradable. And bates argues biodegradable-only products could actually lead to more litter because people will think it's \" ok to leave this packaging behind in the countryside after use \" — an assertion that science alert calls a \" bit of a stretch. \" ( can this bacteria devour plastic trash? )",

Abu ghaith appeared in federal court in new york. The development follows a report by nbc news, which spoke to us officials who say that though the cia picked up abu ghaith in jordan, he had spent years in iranian captivity. Following the 9/11 attacks, bin laden sent a group of al-qaeda bosses, including abu ghaith, to iran. Bin laden hoped they could bribe iranian officials to let them in. Instead of seeing the al-qaeda leaders as sunni terrorists, bin laden believed those officials might consider them the \" enemy of my enemy, \" a us official says. But iranian authorities soon nabbed the group; local officials said they were \" in jail, \" though the us was uncertain of the details. \" it was the blackest of black boxes, \" one us source says. After that, the us heard little from the group, other than intercepting some \" non-operational \" messages. Iran may have been using the detainees as hostages against al-qaeda attack, some in the us believed. Ultimately, washington officials saw the group — out of the al-qaeda loop for years — as little threat. It's unclear whether abu ghaith escaped or was released.",

        "summary": "One hundred times more potent than the drug that played a role in killing prince and 10,000 times stronger than morphine, carfentanil is the strongest opioid commercially available — an animal tranquilizer so lethal it can kill if absorbed through the skin and permanently take out a 7-ton elephant, per the washington post. But in two counties near the ohio-indiana border, several dozen drug overdoses were reported this week — up to 60 of them over a 48-hour stretch — and local officials fear the ods may have been caused by heroin that drug dealers have been cutting with carfentanil, fentanyl, and even rat poison to offer a more powerful high and to make their supplies last longer. \" this is clearly going to … kill a lot of people, \" the health commissioner in ohio's hamilton county said in july, per wcpo, when officials started warning people about possibly tainted heroin after nearly three dozen ods that resulted in six deaths, cnn reports. Indiana's jennings county has also been hard hit, with a dozen or so ods ( with one death ) reported tuesday; hamilton county registered between 36 and 50 ods and two deaths during the same period. One of the antidotes used to combat heroin ods is naloxone, aka narcan — but the antidote's effectiveness may be weakened if the drug causing the overdose is a mix, meaning users need to take more narcan than usual to get it to work, if it works at all. Besides the difficult job of law enforcement trying to root out local dealers — hamilton county cops say there's likely more than one seller in their area, and that at least one is giving the deadly mixture away for free — health officials have an equally monumental task: trying to help those who are addicted. \" we're using horses against tanks, \" a kentucky doctor with st. Elizabeth physicians tells cincinnati.com, noting the logistical challenges of offering effective treatment programs. Other states reporting issues with carfentanil: kentucky, florida, and pennsylvania. ( in a west virginia city, 27 ods in just five hours. )",

Now, however, a large health insurer in utah has employed a novel approach to take advantage of the price discrepancy: phep is offering members a cash incentive to go to mexico and buy the cheaper drugs, reports the salt lake tribune. The insurer covers about 160,000 public employees and their families, and those who need certain drugs to treat cancer, ms, and autoimmune disorders can get free transportation plus a cash payout of $ 500 if they make the trip. The story uses the example of the ms drug avonex, which costs $ 6,700 for a 28-day supply in the us, but only $ 2,200 in mexico. Even with the mexico travel expenses figured in, it's a big cost saving. \" why wouldn't we pay... To go to san diego, drive across to mexico, and save the system tens of thousands of dollars? \" says state rep. Norman thurston, sponsor of legislation calling for such incentives. \" if it can be done safely, we should be all over that. \" avonex is one of about a dozen drugs covered under the policy.

        "summary": "The us tennis association fined serena williams $ 17,000 sunday for her outburst in the us open final as tennis legend billie jean king and the national organization for women rallied to her defense, the washington post reports. The tournament referee's office said the 23-time grand slam champion was being fined $ 10,000 for \" verbal abuse, \" $ 4,000 for the warning about coaching, and $ 3,000 for breaking her racket, per fox news. The money will be taken from her $ 1.85 million runner-up prize money. The 6-2, 6-4 victory saturday by naomi osaka, the first female japanese player to win the us open, was marred by controversy when williams and chair umpire carlos ramos argued and he docked her a game. \" several things went very wrong during the u.s. Open women's finals today, \" tweeted king on saturday. In her view, \" coaching on every point should be allowed in tennis \" and williams shouldn't have been penalized for arguing: \" when a man does the same, he's ' outspoken ' and there are no repercussions. Thank you, serena williams, for calling out the double standard. \" williams, who was penalized after calling ramos \" a thief, \" said after the match that \" he's never taken a game from a man because they said'thief. ' \" the national organization for women echoed the sentiment, saying ramos should be fired: \"... In actuality men stretch the rules all the time and are lionized for being ' bad boys ' while women are benched, \" says now president toni van pelt. ( a post column argues that ramos also ruined the moment for osaka. )",

Williams shot back at the umpire and insisted she was not receiving coaching and that she would \"rather lose \" than cheat. Williams received a second violation when she smashed her racket in frustration. She lost a point due to the violation, causing the player to argue with the umpire again about the initial penalty. \"i didn't get coaching, \" williams said multiple times. \"i don't cheat! i didn't get coaching.

I have never cheated in my life! \" the third violation — verbal abuse — came when she called the umpire a \"thief, \" leading to an automatic game loss. \"you will never, ever, ever be on another court of mine as long as you live.

Two-thirds of those deaths were the result of bombings attributed to al-qaeda in iraq and other terrorist or sectarian groups. Us troops were tied to 32 of the deaths, down from 64 last year. The drop was most pronounced after the us announced the end of combat operations in late august: the toll dropped by half in the first month, and remained depressed for the rest of the year, reports bloomberg. But with the good, the bad: year-over-year improvement is slowing; the 15 % drop is significantly lower than 2009's 50 % drop over 2008, and 2008's 63 % drop over 2007. \" the 2010 data suggest a persistent low-level conflict in iraq that will continue to kill civilians at a similar rate for years to come, \" said iraq body count, which places the total number of civilian deaths since the invasion at 108,391.
