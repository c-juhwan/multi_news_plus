Lohan's bail bondsman will have her out on bail later today, but the actress could now wind up spending up to 18 months in prison; the judge set a hearing for nov. 2 to decide her fate, tmz reports. Sautner, who noted with frustration that prison overcrowding made a jail sentence unlikely, also ordered lohan to complete 16 hours of community service at the morgue before that hearing. The judge expressed complete disgust with lohan's failure to show up at the downtown women's center for community service, reading incredulously from a probation report in which lohan said she didn't find the center \"fulfilling. \" and she scoffed at excuses that lohan had to leave town to work, saying she'd warned lohan to do the service quickly in case she got a movie role — \"i mean, she is supposed to be an actress, from what i hear. \" click for more.",

        "summary": "Congratulations, your adult brain isn't meekly withering into a useless mass after all — it is instead generating new neurons all the while. Scientists have long debated whether the brain keeps growing into adulthood, and new research in cell seems to have settled the mystery. What's more, the swedish researchers who accomplished the feat have an unusual factor to thank — nuclear fallout from the cold war. As science explains, all those above-ground atomic tests in the 1940s and ' 50s left a lot of carbon-14 in the atmosphere that ended up in humans. Scientists looked for that isotope in autopsied brains and — because it decays at a known rate and because those atomic tests occurred in a known span of years — were able to conclude that the brain does indeed produce new cells as it ages. In fact, this happens in the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory, reports ars technica. So why do you keep forgetting where you left your keys? \" unfortunately, the rate of renewal doesn't make up for the rate of cell death, which is also going on constantly — and the new cells live for a far shorter time than our original hippocampal neurons, \" writes michael d. Lemonick at time.",

When atomic bombs were tested between 1945 and 1963, radioactive particles were released into the earth's atmosphere. Among the isotopes created was carbon-14, which is commonly used in radio carbon dating. As cells divide, they incorporate carbon from the environment, and some of that carbon comes from the atmosphere. That's why carbon-14 released by the atomic bombs found its way into the dna of multiplying cells.

Republican leaders were twice forced to postpone final voting, first until friday and then punting it to next week, as negotiators made a last-ditch push for support, the ap reports.

House majority whip steve scalise of louisiana said thursday evening they would keep trying to find consensus on the legislation. The house voted 231-193 to defeat a more conservative version that would have authorized border wall funds but not a path to citizenship for the young immigrants. All democrats and 41 republicans opposed the legislation. Rather than help push the compromise bill to the finish line, trump's mixed messages reinforced his role as an unreliable partner for house republicans in the immigration debate. First, he had distanced himself from the negotiations. Then, he interjected that he didn't like what they came up with. Then he reversed course and said he would back the compromise. But then he tweeted thursday that whatever passed in the house was surely dead in the senate: \" what is the purpose of the house doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by democrats in the senate, and the dems are only looking to obstruct ( which they feel is good for them in the mid-terms ). \"",

A new study of mice has found 25 % of brain cells died off after prolonged sleep loss, meant to duplicate night shifts or long hours at the office — the first evidence of its kind and a scary find if it applies to humans. \" we now have evidence that sleep loss can lead to irreversible injury, \" a researcher told the bbc, noting that when the mice lost a little sleep, they were protected by an energizing protein, but brain cells began to die off when sleep loss became a habit. \" this suggests to us that we are going to have to look very carefully in humans. \" if you don't get the recommended six to eight hours of sleep per night but substitute extra hours of snores later to catch up — like on weekends — that may not make up the difference either, researchers say, as the damage may already be done, cnn notes. While more research is needed — the group plans to study the brains of shift workers after death to look for nerve damage — there may also be a silver lining to look forward to: the team notes its research may eventually lead to medicines that help people deal with irregular sleep patterns caused by odd work hours.",

        "summary": "You don't have to be a lexicographer to have a pretty ample lexicon — but your word knowledge still may not be as ample as you think. At least, that's according to a ghent university study published in the frontiers in psychology, said to be the largest ever of its sort. It estimates that by the time average native speakers of american english turn 20, they know about 42,000 lemmas — basic, \" uninflected \" dictionary words — and build that vocabulary by about 6,000 more of those words by the time they hit 60, or about one new word every couple of days. That doesn't count proper names and variations of those original inflected words, which the study says accounts for often-inflated numbers of known vocabulary words, with some estimates reaching 200,000 words — eliciting a \" deep sigh \" from linguistic scientists when asked how many words people know. The english test, which has been shared on social media and resulted in the test being taken by more than 1 million people so far, was based on the researchers ' original test in dutch, per a release. Drawing from a list of 62,000 words, the test includes 70 words and 30 sequences of letters that look like words but aren't. Participants — who are also asked for their gender, age, and native language — are then shown one word or letter sequence at a time on a computer screen and asked if it's an actual word, giving researchers a large data set to work with to figure out the 42,000-word average. A similar test has also been administered in spanish, and study leader marc brysbaert hopes to expand the exam to up to 75,000 words. \" i can imagine future language researchers will be interested in this database to see how english has evolved over 100 years, 1,000 years, and maybe even longer, \" brysbaert says.

The numbers range from 27,000 lemmas for the lowest 5 % to 52,000 for the highest 5 %. Between the ages of 20 and 60, the average person learns 6,000 extra lemmas or about one new lemma every 2 days.

Hicks was arrested in detroit tuesday morning after more than 14 years on the lam. Hicks didn't show up on the opening day of his june 2003 trial on federal drug conspiracy charges, which stemmed from allegations that hicks ran a rip-off crew that would rob drug dealers of cash and drugs, the latter of which his crew would allegedly sell to other dealers. The tribune dives into the allegations against hicks, who nbc chicago reports was a member of the force for 29 years, and who authorities claim received tips from a big-time cocaine dealer whose own bust in 2000 led the dealer to spill the details of the arrangement. The fbi then set up two dummy drug houses on chicago's south side outfitted with surveillance equipment; it claims that as two chicago police department civilian employees broke in and stole cash, hicks was outside keeping watch and advising via cellphone. Per the sun-times, hicks and his crew allegedly made use of fake cpd badges, unmarked cpd cars, and forged search warrants. The sun-times recounts one incident that seems ripped from hollywood: hicks and his crew allegedly raided an alsip, ill., apartment in april 1999 using a fake search warrant. As alsip police came upon the scene, the crew fled the apartment, telling the police they were members of a dea task force. Hicks, now 68, agreed to be transferred to chicago during a tuesday court hearing in detroit.",

With \" too much \" of the previous year's product idling in warehouses, \" there wasn't enough room to get 2017 toys into the stores, and the toy trade is driven by newness, \" a company spokeswoman says.

Too much inventory, though, may not be the only reason for flagging sales. Tom espiner lists a litany of possibilities for the bbc, including the high price of legos ( which the company says is warranted due to the bricks ' high quality ), a lack of \" imagination \" that has kids following specific instructions in themed sets rather than coming up with their own creations, and not keeping up with trends, or the times. The latter is one area where christiansen says the company will be focusing, especially in regard to syncing up legos with digital devices. \" we see this as a way of keeping children interested for a longer time, also for later age groups, \" he says, per the times.

Now the 30-year-old is serving a life sentence, but he made an unusual — and successful — plea to the court, reports the cbc. Garnier argued that he has ptsd as a result of the murder he committed, and the government is now paying for his treatment. One more twist: the bill is being covered by veterans affairs canada even though garnier himself is not a vet. His father served in the military, however, and that qualifies him for coverage. \" i find it really hard to chew on that we're spending taxpayers ' money like that to help someone when we also have veterans that are having a really hard time getting treatment through vac, \" says a retired sergeant and activist for veterans ' causes. \" it's the best we can expect in the warm fuzzy manner of sentencing in canada, \" writes the aunt of campbell, 36, who was a halifax police officer. \" prison sentences are the only thing i admire that the usa does. \" garnier's defense team raised the ptsd during a hearing to determine when he would be up for parole, per the canadian press. They said the ptsd should be a mitigating factor, and the argument seems to have helped. Garnier is now eligible for parole in about 13 years, on the low side of the 10- to 25-year range. He maintains that he killed campbell accidentally during rough sex after they'd met at a bar. \" the message should be sent that mr. Garnier should forever be remembered as the person who stole ms. Campbell's future for no reason, and then treated her remains like garbage, \" said prosecutors.",

A yale psychiatry professor interviewed steven hayes several times and told the court today of his attempts. Though his lawyers are fighting for life in prison, hayes said he'd prefer the death penalty, reports abc news. His testimony came a day after a jury deciding on the punishment heard journal entries from his accused partner, joshua komisarjevsky, who faces a separate trial. Attorneys for hayes say the entries show komisarjevsky was the ringleader, and they're tough to take. He refers to 11-year-old victim michaela as the \" angel of my nightmares \" and to 17-year-old hayley as a \" fighter. \" he praises the \" courage \" of the mother, jennifer hawke-petit, but insults the father, william petit, who was beaten unconscious, as a \" coward. \" responded petit outside court: \" i really don't want to dignify the ravings of a sociopath. \" click here for more on the case.",

The index runs from one to four; the aforementioned wasp's sting comes in at a four, and schmidt likens it, per npr, to this scenario: \" a running hair dryer has just been dropped into your bubble bath. \" compare that with the mud dauber wasp, whose sting is akin to \"jalapeno cheese when you were expecting havarti \"; it registers as a one, to the common honeybee's two. In addition to providing colorful, connoisseur-grade descriptions of the pain caused by stings, the sting of the wild provides all sorts of information about stinging insects. For instance, stingers evolved from the tubes through which eggs are laid, ovipositors, so only female insects can sting. Male insects fake it, schmidt tells national geographic, by \"curling their abdomen around and jamming it into you, \" in hopes you ' ll let them go. Butterflies, moths, and other insects that don't sting don't need to, another entomologist tells national geographic. They lay their eggs on the surface of plants, in a process that doesn't require an ovipositor, hence, no stinger. When asked whether he wants to be stung, schmidt tells npr, \" want is kind of a dual word. I want the data, but i don't want the sting. \" ( another researcher has determined the most painful spot to get a bee sting. )",

Some of the more dubious claims from the candidates, via the ap, the washington post, and the new york times: marco rubio: \" welders make more money than philosophers. \" this is way off, according to payscale. The pay analysis firm says philosophy majors have starting salaries of around $ 40,000, which is close to the median for welders throughout their careers, the times notes. But by the time the philosophy grads are mid-career, they're taking in an average of $ 81,200. Ben carson, talking about syria: \" you know, the chinese are there, as well as the russians, and you have all kinds of factions there. \" the carson campaign declined to clarify this statement to the post, but there have been no reports of chinese troops active in syria. Donald trump: \" i will tell you, i don't have to give you a website because i ' m self-funding my campaign. I ' m putting up my own money. \" trump is no longer self-funding his campaign: according to his most recent campaign finance filing, he gave his campaign $ 100,000 in the most recent quarter. It received another $ 3.8 million in unsolicited donations. Carson again: \" every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases. \" economists are split on whether raising the minimum wage to $ 15 will be a job-killer, the times reports, and six of the 11 minimum-wage hikes since 1978 were followed by job growth, according to a politifact analysis. Jeb bush: \" we have to recognize that small businesses right now, more of them are closing than are being set up. \" that statistic is out of date now, and it was out of date when marco rubio used it in the last debate, the post notes. A brookings institution report in 2014 found that more businesses closed than opened between 2008 and 2011, but the trend started to reverse in 2012.

            "It was only three carries that didn't amount to much as far as yardage is concerned. However, jennifer welter made history when she suited up at running back for the texas revolution of the indoor football league. The 5 ' 2 \", 130-pound ball carrier gave every player, coach and fan in attendance a reason to consider women playing against men in professional football. After all, that was the entire purpose of her decision to become the first woman to play a position other than placekicker in a men's football league. Even though i don't agree with someone as small as welter getting crushed by men three times her size, i still believe it's great for the sport. The reason for that is because it shows women are just as passionate about football as men are which is what welter was trying to show. The revolution",
            "Football history was made rather quietly over the weekend in texas. During an indoor football league game between the texas revolution and the north texas crunch, 36-year-old jennifer welter got three carries, making her the first woman to play a non-kicking position in a pro football league. Welter, who has starred at linebacker for a decade for the dallas diamonds of the women's football alliance, got her first carry midway through the third quarter. She took a handoff from two yards out of the end zone and scampered around the left tackle. But the 5-foot-2, 130 pound welter was met by 6-4, 245-pound defensive lineman cedric hearvey for a one-yard loss. Somehow, welter was unfazed by the hit. \" i said, ' is that all you got? ' \" welter asked hearvey. \" i didn't want them to think i was intimidated. \" via louis",
            "Allen -- when the moment finally came, with 6: 20 left in the third quarter, jennifer welter took a handoff and tried with every fiber in her 5-2, 130-pound frame to score from 2 yards out over left tackle. And north texas crunch defensive lineman cedric hearvey hurled his 6-4, 245-pound body and bore his helmet and shoulder pad into welter's left hip, whacking her down for a 1-yard loss. With that, 36-year-old welter on saturday became the first woman non-kicker or placekick-holder to play in a men's pro football game, albeit in this case a preseason game in the 8-on-8 indoor football league. \"i said, 'is that all you got? ' \" welter said she told hearvey after the first of her three carries for the texas revolution. \"they ( crunch players ) were getting all alive, and i had to say something. I didn"

Researchers found that species are vanishing around 10 times faster than previously believed — and 1,000 times faster than they did before humans emerged, the ap reports. A mass extinction on the scale of the one that wiped out the dinosaurs is close, and \" whether we avoid it or not will depend on our actions, \" says the lead researcher. Habitat loss is the main factor causing species to disappear, but climate change, overfishing, and the spread of invasive species also play a role. But the situation isn't completely hopeless: modern technology and \" citizen scientists \" are helping biologists locate endangered species, aiding efforts to save their habitats, the study author tells national geographic. Thanks to mobile apps like inaturalist and online crowdsourcing, \" we know where the species are, we know where the threats are, and — even though the situation is very bleak — we are better able to manage things, \" he says. What can the average citizen do? a scientist not involved in the study suggests encouraging lawmakers to connect nature reserves to each other, and the study author notes that extinction rates of mammals, birds, and amphibians are 20 % lower than they would be without protected refuges. About 13 % of the planet's land has been designated as such; the same holds true for only about 2 % of the ocean.",

One passenger has been diagnosed, and that person flew on the following flights: flight 5 from dallas love airport to houston's hobby airport on aug. 21; flight 9 from hobby to the harlingen airport on the same day; and then, on aug. 22, flight 665 from harlingen to hobby, and on flight 44 from hobby back to dallas love. Per abc13, the diagnosed passenger is from north texas and didn't visit any restaurants or other venues during the connections in houston, instead hanging out in a waiting area for about an hour each time. A doctor tells abc that people who were near the affected passenger in the airport are at lower risk than those who were on the planes. Those fellow fliers are now being advised to look out for measles symptoms, which include high fever, cough, runny nose, and a rash. Per the cdc, measles is so contagious that 90 % of people who aren't immune will get infected if they're close to a person who has the illness, the fort worth star-telegram notes.

Cnn reports that the reforms, contained in two \" motu proprio \" ( \" by his own initiative \" ) documents, are threefold: there's no longer a second review required by a cleric; bishops can fast-track and even grant the annulments themselves ( for instance, in a situation of domestic abuse ); and there's no longer any cost beyond a modest administrative charge. The changes are set to be part of catholic canon law effective dec. 8 — the start of the \" year of mercy. \" church teaching holds that catholics can remarry only if their first marriage is declared invalid by a church tribunal. Catholics have long complained that it can take years to get an annulment — at a cost of as much as thousands of dollars — if they can get one at all, and cnn notes that the pope echoed that sentiment in 2014: \" some procedures are so long and so burdensome, and people give up. \" reuters notes that a vatican official today explained that the last time annulments were so drastically altered was under benedict xiv, who was pope from 1740 to 1758.",

And meets with throngs of admirers at a catholic charities feeding event for the homeless. Yahoo global anchor katie couric hosts coverage. Yahoo news visits all the personal stops that pope francis will be making during his u.s. Visit including catholic charities'saint maria's meals program in d.c., our lady queen of angels school in new york, and curran-fromhold correctional facility in philadelphia. On thursday, september 24th, pope francis will arrive at john f. Kennedy international airport in new york. Yahoo global news anchor katie couric spoke with anthoula katsimatides and paula grant berry, who were selected along with 20 other families to meet and pray with pope francis when he visits the national september 11 memorial &amp; museum. Ben carson's church believes the united states government will bring about the end times. According to mainstream seventh-day adventist doctrine, the second coming of christ will occur after the u.s. Government teams up with the catholic church. Adventists believe the church is the 'babylon ' of the book of revelation, with the pope being the antichrist. They believe the government will compel adventists and others to worship on sunday, rather than saturday. That may seem like a small hook on which to hang the fate of the world,"

Case chairperson for immediate news release august 8, 2016 hawaiian petroglyphs revealed by shifting sands on waianae coast experts believe rarely seen panels are 400+ years old ( honolulu ) – on a warm july evening, visitors lonnie watson and mark louviere from the ft. Worth, texas metro area did what they normally do during their frequent visits to hawaii. They wandered out to the coastline to watch the setting sun. On this particular day they spotted something that they say has humbled and blessed them. Watson explained, \"for some reason there was a beam of light … just a beam … it landed right on one of them and for some reason i just turned my head. I said, look, it was just a stroke of luck. \" what they saw was a large petroglyph, etched into the sandstone. Upon further investigation, they discovered at least 10 figures, stretching over roughly 60 feet of beach.

        "summary": "In the late 1980s, william linder, a healthy 40-year-old doctor, came home from a vacation fatigued and with swollen legs. By 1996, he was dead, with the cause officially listed as \" unknown. \" the years in between were full of gruesome symptoms: swelling squeezed some of his veins so they almost closed, while others filled up with extra blood and almost burst. His organs nearly fused as his body swelled. A creamy white fluid had to be pumped out of his body by the liter. Eventually, a geneticist found a gene mutation — a seemingly tiny, single-gene error that nbc news compares to a \" one-letter typo \" — that seemed to be at the root of the disease. She did extensive research and could find no other cases — but the linder family eventually realized the same mysterious ailment had killed four other ancestors. The geneticist eventually determined the founder was william linder's grandmother, which made the new disease shockingly \" young \" — and convinced the linders to do all they can to keep the illness from hurting another family. William linder's daughters, joselin and hilary, are, as far as they know, the only two people in the world living with the disease — and they're committed to halting its spread. They've had three abortions over fears related to passing along the disease, and hilary had her twin daughters only after undergoing a form of ivf that tests embryos for disease and implants only healthy ones. \" what if the first carriers of every disease knew it and chose not to pass it on? \" writes tony dokoupil for nbc. \" would we have cystic fibrosis or huntington's? \" but controversy swirls around what the linders are doing: some states have banned abortions based on genetic ailments, and critics say the type of ivf hilary used could eventually be used to screen out all sorts of characteristics. Click for nbc's full piece. On her website, joselin says, \" i've been trying to get a platform for this story for five years... Because my sister and i are in the fight of our lives for resources and attention. \"",

Guntv — courtesy of california couple valerie castle and doug bornstein — will air from 1am to 7am et starting jan. 20 and will sell \" a vast array of firearms, \" ammunition, holsters, and other gear, reports the new york times.

It might seem like a smart business venture considering that gun sales could set a record this year, but critics are speaking out, particularly after the san bernandino shooting, some 50 miles from where guntv will be filmed. Entrepreneurs are \" trying to profit off of the out-of-control culture of gun violence, \" says a rep for the coalition to stop gun violence. Buying a gun is \" not a decision you should be making at 3 in the morning, \" another critic tells the desert sun. Perhaps with criticisms in mind, castle and bornstein are calling guntv's parent company the social responsibility network. A proposed schedule notes that eight minutes of every hour will be dedicated to safety psas, per the times, and the sun reports there will be three minutes of education and safety training per hour. \" we saw an opportunity in filling a need, not creating one, \" castle says. \" i don't really know that it's going to put more guns on the streets. \" the channel says that any guns ordered will be sent to a gun retailer near the buyer so a background check can be performed before the purchase is final.

That's a 20-year high for a heat wave death toll, the guardian adds. Climate change is probably partly to blame, cnn reports, but the area's high mountains also halt cool air from the northeast, a meteorologist says. Hot and dry winds from pakistan and northwest india, known as the loo winds, have turned the region arid. India's dense population isn't helping; in less-crowded pakistan and afghanistan, temperatures are more bearable. To make matters worse, a third of india's population doesn't have electricity, which means no air conditioning or refrigeration. So what are indians doing to beat the heat? some were spotted taking a dip in the arabian sea and in water tanks, while authorities warned people to stay indoors, wear light clothing, and drink lots of fluids, the guardian reports. A monsoon scheduled to hit the country soon should bring some relief. Experts predict india, particularly its southern regions, will see more heat waves in the future.

And it's no one-off: the report says such transfers have happened 30 times since october. The financial times reports that diplomats have confirmed the allegations. The transfers would be in violation of a security council resolution passed in september prohibiting ship-to-ship transfers of oil and other goods to north korea. The big question, however, is whether the central government in beijing knows about the deals and is turning a blind eye. If so, that could have consequences, according to bill bishop of axios: \" if the trump administration views beijing as not faithfully implementing what it agreed to then new sanctions against more chinese individuals and firms, including a major oil company and a large financial institution, are increasingly likely. \" the transfers appear to have picked up after the security council imposed tough new limits on the amount of oil north korea can import.

This tweet shows he's still openly mocking mainstream climate change science, even without directly questioning it. President trump mocked the idea of global warming in a tweet thursday, making one of his first ( if not the first ) such public comments on the topic since entering the white house almost a year ago. Fast facts: most scientists agree human activity, primarily through the burning of fossil fuels, has been the primary contributor to earth's aggregate temperature going up this past century. That does not mean, though, that freezing cold weather, like the east coast is experiencing right now, won't happen in the future in many parts of the world. Climate change science is much more complicated than that, but citing cold weather is still a favorite line of politicians and others who doubt climate change is happening. Sen. James inhofe, republican from oklahoma, threw a snowball on the senate floor in february 2015 to mock global warming. One level deeper: trump's tweet was also mocking the paris climate deal, a global accord virtually every country in the world except the united states supports. It calls on countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but as it stands the commitments wouldn't cut emissions to the levels most scientists say is needed. America's commitment under president obama was actually relatively moderate -- up to 28 % cut in such emissions by 2025 based on 2005 levels, but the trump administration pointed to conservative groups'studies showing it could cripple the u.s. Industrial economy while other countries, notably china, were called on to do less. Between the",

However, the source said, the temporary protection from the u.s. Capitol police is not a full-blown, around-the-clock detail as is provided to top congressional leaders. According to the source, this sort of temporary detail is provided at times to members of congress if there is a reasonable threat to their safety. Advertisement advertisement the protection detail was first reported by politico. The concern about the safety of bachmann, r-minn., stems from a video released by the islamic state that features a clip of bachmann speaking about the rise of radical islam. In the video, bachmann's voice is heard but her image is blurred. Sources speculated to fox news that bachmann's picture could have been distorted for the video because she is a woman and was not wearing what they considered proper attire. This sort of protection detail is assigned to rank-and-file members of congress several times a year. One example of a congressman being assigned the protection is republican mississippi sen. Roger wicker, who last year was given a detail after a ricin scare.",

Thai police arrested 27-year-old factory worker thanakorn siripaiboon near bangkok on tuesday after he liked a doctored image of 88-year-old king bhumibol adulyadej showing the leader in a negative light, reports the bangkok post. Siripaiboon then \" shared it with 608 friends, \" a military official tells afp. Insulting the king, queen, heir, or regent is a prisonable offense in thailand under the country's lèse-majesté law, with each offense carrying a maximum sentence of 15 years; there is no possibility for an appeal, reports mashable. Siripaiboon — a member of an alleged anti-monarchy group on facebook — also shared an infographic accusing officials of corruption linked to the construction of a multi-million dollar tourist attraction, rajabhakti park, officials say. The infographic implicated several government figures including prime minister prayut chan-ocha and his wife, reports the post. An official says siripaiboon — who is officially charged with sedition and computer crimes — admitted he \" posted the infographic of rajabhakti park to incite members of the group \" to oppose the military. Siripaiboon faces up to 32 years in jail. His case, however, is hardly unique. Another man was sentenced to 30 years in prison in august for defaming the thai monarchy on facebook. His sentence is the longest term handed down to date. Quartz reports the us ambassador to thailand, glyn davies, is also under investigation for violating thailand's lèse-majesté law in a speech last month, during which he criticized the heavy penalties military courts deliver in lèse-majesté cases.

That's essentially what medical errors are doing, according to an analysis of four studies on the topic that was published in the bmj on tuesday. It finds that about 9.5 % of americans who die each year are killed by a medical error, making it the no. 3 cause of death behind heart disease and cancer. Combine all annual deaths from guns, suicide, and car accidents, double them, and that still wouldn't add up to the 251,454 people the johns hopkins researchers estimate fall victim to medical errors each year. And that number may be underplaying things. \" we believe this understates the true incidence of death due to medical error because the studies cited rely on errors extractable in documented health records and include only inpatient deaths, \" reads the study. Those records are hampered by the way we report medical errors: poorly. The cdc doesn't track these, and the new york times notes it is not a cause of death that would appear on a death certificate.

Manning tweeted a photo monday of a letter from canadian authorities describing her as \" inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality \" because of her conviction under the us espionage act, the cbc reports. The letter states that the offense manning was convicted of in the us \" would equate to an indictable offense, namely treason \" in canada, which would be punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Canadian law bars foreign nationals who've been convicted of offenses that would get them more than 10 years in prison in canada, reports the national post. Manning, who tried to enter quebec at a border crossing in upstate new york last week, was detained overnight by the canadians before being returned to the us, reports the guardian. She had been planning to visit montreal and vancouver. Supporters say manning, who was convicted of passing military documents to wikileaks, was a whistleblower, not a traitor, and that will form the basis of her appeal against the canadian decision. Canadian authorities have declined to comment on specifics, and prime minister justin trudeau, when asked about the case monday, said he's looking forward to seeing more information.

Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to usa! \" the problem, according to cnn, is that trump's tweet came just 15 minutes after the release of the new jobs report. A federal rule from 1985 requires officials to wait an hour before commenting on a newly released jobs report. Marketwatch reports the purpose of the rule is to keep some distance between the \" policy-neutral release of data by statistical agencies and their interpretation by policy officials. \" back in february, both reince priebus and sean spicer tweeted about the the new jobs report too quickly, as did trump by retweeting a drudge report tweet. Jason furman, former top economic adviser to president obama, says the rule may need to be changed due to how quickly modern information moves, but it's not up to trump to decide on his own to ignore it. Friday's jobs report showed the addition of 209,000 jobs in july and the unemployment rate dropping from 4.4 % to 4.3 %, the new york times reports. The number of jobs added was above wall street expectations, and improvements in trump's first six months as president are in line with improvements in the final six months of obama's presidency.",

        "summary": "Kevin james'rent-a-cop moves from a suburban shopping mall to a las vegas casino in paul blart: mall cop 2, the sequel to the 2009 flick that topped the box office. Sadly, critics are wishing james never hopped back on the segway. Here's what they're saying: the first flick was mildly funny, but this sequel is a \" painfully unfunny, slapdash follow-up in which the title character is so relentlessly obnoxious that you ' ll be cheering for the villains, \" frank scheck writes at the hollywood reporter. James tries hard to be funny, but \"he's completely adrift here. He also has to bear a large part of the blame since he co-wrote the screenplay. \" sara stewart describes the flick as \"a blur of weak slapstick, one over-dyed mustache, and vague sexism, ageism, and sizeism. \" a barely-there plot — in which blart's daughter is kidnapped by a corrupt nsa agent — is only there so that blart can repeatedly \"bluster, then screw up humiliatingly, \" which is \"just not funny nearly often enough, \" she writes at the new york post. To top it all off, the script is \" is running on the fumes of better movies. \" and the bashing continues: donald clarke at the irish times says mall cop 2 is \" so mordantly witless that it has the quality of a bleak art-house tragedy \" and \" adds to the looming sense that mainstream us cinema comedy is deep in a dark age. \" if any moviegoer \" emerges from the cinema with thumbs still opposable and frontal lobes intact then it should be accounted a small victory, \" he writes. \" it's not that the film is particularly loathsome, or that blart is an overweeningly horrible character, \" writes robbie collin at the telegraph. \" what rankles is that he's barely anything at all; a stereotype of a stereotype; a half-remembered punchline; a stomach with a mustache and wheels. \" plus, the physical comedy \" isn't physical at all, but computer-generated, or at least augmented, \" he writes. \" as you watch the film, it's already forgotten. \"",

With a 5-1 vote last month, madison heights ' city council adopted \" hit free zones \" in at least 10 public areas in an effort to stop violence of any kind, including children hitting other children. But councilman david soltis says spanking was forefront in his mind when he proposed the resolution, which comes with no penalty for violators, reports the detroit free press. A former emergency medical technician, soltis says he was stunned to learn how many children are hit by adults; 76 % of adult males and 66 % of adult females support spanking on some level, according to 2016 study by childtrends.org, reports wfie. Signs at the library, police station, recreation center, and city hall aim to send a clear message to parents. But they aren't without detractors. \" current state law allows parents to spank their children, and i do not believe it is the role of the city to dictate how people discipline their children, \" says councilwoman roslyn grafstein, a mother of two who opposed the move. Councilwoman margene scott agrees, though she supported the resolution. In some cases, spanking children \" can be the only way to get their attention, \" she says.

The buyer apparently overpaid. Sotheby's now says the artwork is a fake, not painted by parmigianino in the 16th century but by a forger within the last 100 years, reports npr. Before its sale, some had suspected st. Jerome was painted by an associate of parmigianino, but all agreed it was 400 years old. When research lab orion analytical revealed a $ 10 million dutch painting supposedly by frans hals to be a fake in october, however, it put all other artworks connected to the same dealer into question, including two others that turned out to be fakes, per artnet and the art newspaper. The dealer, giuliano ruffini, had also owned st. Jerome. A technical analysis by orion analytical's researchers found 21 areas of the painting contained the synthetic green pigment phthalocyanine green. It was \" first used in paints nearly four centuries after parmigianino died \" and was not the result of a restoration, according to sotheby's complaint. Sotheby's is now demanding st. Jerome's consignor, lionel de saint donat-pourrieres, repay $ 672,000 he received from the 2012 sale. Meanwhile, ruffini — who is under investigation in france but has not been charged with a crime, per the new york times — says he has his doubts about the st. Jerome analysis, citing \" experts and curators from the metropolitan museum \" who vouched for its age. ( a work by raphael may have been ignored for generations. )",

Jeffrey e. Stern wades through the weeds of the mysterious 2012 death of alexander perepilichny for the atlantic, detailing the russian immigrant's evolution from dna scientist, to computer coder and black-market distributor ( a dangerous stint that proved extremely lucrative ), to what he had hoped would eventually be a career as \" an aboveboard entrepreneur \" who wouldn't have to \" hide from thugs behind his apartment door. \" and yet despite that yearning to apply his business acumen to growing a legitimate corporate empire, perepilichny fell into what stern deems a \" perhaps … inevitable \" world of \" corruption and graft. \" and that world ended up involving russian crime syndicates, a slew of deaths under \" mysterious circumstances, \" and a link to us investor and millionaire bill browder, who colluded with vladimir putin to manipulate stock prices in russia and reap the profits. Browder also served as a \" cheerleader \" for putin against his enemies — until he himself fell out of the russian leader's graces and fled to the uk. The story relays how one man's death ended up tying browder to the quiet, ambitious, perepilichny, and how falling on the wrong side of the kremlin ( perhaps making \" an enemy of putin himself \" ) may have been perepilichny's unwitting undoing, complete with whispers of a highly structured assassination and an exotic toxic plant once wielded into weapons in a lab built by lenin.

With their flair, selfless team spirit and different ethnic backgrounds, they were ambassadors of a new germany. Two weeks ago, shortly before midnight in durban, where germany would later lose to spain, i encountered two white men and a black woman in a hotel elevator. The two men were wearing england jerseys, and the woman was scantily clad. It had been a long day of football, and the englishmen had apparently started drinking beer early on. That day, i had watched the netherlands wrestle down slovakia at the magnificent stadium in durban, and i later saw brazil defeat chile in the fan park on the beach. I was ready for bed. The trio in the elevator couldn't decide whether to get off or stay on. Finally, one of the men jumped out and pulled the woman with him, while the second man and i continued riding the elevator upward. He was teetering precariously and fell on his backpack between the third and fourth floors. \" where are you from? \" he asked from his position on the floor. \" germany, \" i replied. \" sorry, i know it was a goal. \" \" oh, to hell with the goal",

        "summary": "Men are allowed to go topless at the pool, so why are women ( usually ) not allowed to? that's the question leading one ontario woman, whose name has not been released, to file a complaint with the human rights tribunal of ontario. The woman's lawyer tells the cbc her client called around to a few hotels when looking for somewhere to stay for her husband's birthday, asked if she could swim topless there, and was told she could not. She filed the complaint after that on the basis that ontario's human rights code says everyone has a right to be treated equally when it comes to services, goods, and facilities, regardless of their sex or gender. Women are allowed to go topless in public in ontario ever since a 1996 court ruling. \" it's very simple. At all of those facilities a man could show up without a top, and he would be allowed to swim that way, \" says the woman's lawyer. \" but they discriminate against women because of some type of different conception of the woman's breast versus man's breast. \" at least three of the hotels named in the woman's complaint have since changed their policies and will allow women to swim topless, but the calypso theme waterpark, also named in the complaint, is sticking to its guns. \" we are an amusement park for kids and family, and so we want to stay with that mission, \" the ceo told radio-canada this week. Per the toronto sun, he said the park is simply respecting the wishes of its clientele. The woman's lawyer, however, says that if the theme park allows men to be topless, women should be subject to the same rules.",

After sentencing nassar to up to 175 years in prison, aquilina said she had signed his \" death warrant \" and \" would allow someone or many people to do to him what he did to others \" were it not for the constitution prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. Wood finds these comments \" unjudge-like \" and harmful to the \" dignity of the proceedings. \" \" subjecting nassar to a lifetime of rape is not my idea of justice, and fantasizing about it is not my idea of judicial temperament, \" he writes. That's not to say nassar doesn't \" deserve to be raped 150 times \" — it's possible he does — but a judge shouldn't say it. Wood also says anyone who claims that criticism of aquilina's choice of words is tantamount to sympathy for nassar is revealing their own \" twisted sympathies. \" wood wonders if it would be comforting for nassar's victims \" to know that a horrific act of abuse... Is being done to correct the wrong against \" them. Read the full piece here. ( wood isn't alone. Rachel marshall at vox also says aquilina went too far as a victims advocate, betraying her role as a judge.

The prosecutor said one of the players passed out condoms and assaulted her. Thurman said one of the former players urinated on her and made a racial statement. Three of the ex-players are black and one is white. The victim is white. \" and after hearing all the proof you will be convinced they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, \" thurman said. Four former players are accused of raping the unconscious coed in a dorm on the nashville campus in june 2013. All have pleaded not guilty. The trial takes place amid a roiling national debate about the prevalence of rapes at u.s. Colleges and universities, with investigations under way at dozens of colleges around the country and the obama administration launching its own campaign to end sexual assault on america's campuses.

Alley, who is herself still not at her stated target weight of 140 lbs, has been shilling for her new venture on oprah, and it features heavily ( pun intended ) in her upcoming a&e reality series, kirstie alley's big life ( pun intended there too, we're sure ). Anonymous have found links between organic liaison llc and scientology — the firm's accountant, saul b lipson, is a known scientologist whose company is approved by the church and based near its headquarters in clearwater, florida. Along with utter quacks like hollywood mystical doctor soram khalsa, the board features michelle seward, an active scientologist. While this is not enough to support anonymous ' claim that money from organic liaison will be channeled directly into the church, it does lend credence to the assertion that the program itself is, to some extent, based on a scientology plan called the purification rundown. This was prescribed by l. Ron hubbard himself, but criticized for being at best bullshit that claims to detox through vitamins, minerals, drinking vegetable oil and sitting in saunas, and at worst dangerous. As it is part of the narconon program, that alley has said helped her break a cocaine addiction, it is fairly safe to presume she has been through it. Organic liaison offers to combine an organic food diet with \" organic and natural diet supplements that replenish your body with essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients without the pangs of starvation or cravings you may have felt on other diet plans. \" it's certainly priced like a scientology scam. Membership costs $ 10 per month, or $ 89 for a year, and the package of supplements, called rescue me, is a whopping $ 139 per month. One you've ordered the kit, it auto-ships and bills your card again every month until you stop it. The kit contains three supplements, rescue me ( claimed detox and appetite suppresser ), release me ( claimed relaxant ) and nightingale ( claimed sleep aid ), featuring many cheaply-available vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs and aids like vitamin c, folic acid, l-tryptophan, fiber, green tea, calcium and magnesium.

Along with utter quacks like hollywood mystical doctor soram khalsa, the board features michelle seward, an active scientologist. While this is not enough to support anonymous ' claim that money from organic liaison will be channeled directly into the church, it does lend credence to the assertion that the program itself is, to some extent, based on a scientology plan called the purification rundown. This was prescribed by l. Ron hubbard himself, but criticized for being at best bullshit that claims to detox through vitamins, minerals, drinking vegetable oil and sitting in saunas, and at worst dangerous. As it is part of the narconon program, that alley has said helped her break a cocaine addiction, it is fairly safe to presume she has been through it. Organic liaison offers to combine an organic food diet with \" organic and natural diet supplements that replenish your body with essential vitamins, minerals and nutrients without the pangs of starvation or cravings you may have felt on other diet plans. \" it's certainly priced like a scientology scam. Membership costs $ 10 per month, or $ 89 for a year, and the package of supplements, called rescue me, is a whopping $ 139 per month. One you've ordered the kit, it auto-ships and bills your card again every month until you stop it. The kit contains three supplements, rescue me ( claimed detox and appetite suppresser ), release me ( claimed relaxant ) and nightingale ( claimed sleep aid ), featuring many cheaply-available vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs and aids like vitamin c, folic acid, l-tryptophan, fiber, green tea, calcium and magnesium. The company also offers other supplements",

        "summary": "Congress has sent its student loan fix to president obama for his expected signature, and it contains a mix of good news and bad news for college students. The good news is that freshmen this fall will pay an interest rate of 3.9 %, down from the 6.8 % that went into effect in july, reports cnn. The bad news is that the rate will be tied to the financial markets, meaning that as the economy improves — which college students would be rooting for in every other way — the rate will rise accordingly, reports ap. Though it will be capped at 8.25 % for regular students, 9.5 % for graduate students, and 10.5 % for parents, consumer advocates say those rates are too high. The measure cleared the house easily this evening by a vote of 392-31. Here's a sample of the differing reaction: pro: \" this is a win for students and taxpayers, \" says republican john kline of the house committee on education and the workforce. \" it saves students and families money, \" says democrat george miller of the same panel. Con: \" the bottom line is that students will pay more under this bill than if congress did nothing, and low rates will soon give way to rates that are even higher than the 6.8 % rate that congress is trying to avoid, \" says an official with the consumer group us pirg.",

He's taking on the threat without help from congress, though lawmakers could potentially seize on a law that lets them overturn executive rules, the new york times notes. Here's what to watch for: for the first time, existing power plants could face carbon-emissions limits, aides say. New plants will see epa fossil-fuel regulations finished by september under obama's plan. Mother jones sees what's likely to be \" the end of conventional coal-fired power in the united states. \" meanwhile, federally-owned lands will see an increase in efforts to harness renewable energy. The white house will work with state and local officials to brace the country for climate change's effects — including, for instance, future roads that are better-prepared for flooding, cbs news reports. Buildings, appliances, and heavy-duty trucks can expect new fuel efficiency requirements. The goal: to reduce carbon emissions by 3 billion metric tons by 2030. Some $ 7 billion will be pledged to help the international community grapple with the effects of climate change, and another $ 8 billion will go to loan guarantees for green projects. The administration will put a wealth of climate information online for the public's benefit. Environmentalists applaud the step forward, but fear it may not be enough — particularly with potential political opposition, politico notes. \" it's unreasonable. What they're doing has never been done, \" says democratic sen. Joe manchin. Also at politico, however, darren goode writes that the president might have \" just enough time to carry out the biggest environmental effort of his presidency — if he starts now. \"",

        "summary": "There's a reason we feel that mixture of dread, excitement, and existential restlessness right before we tip over into the next decade — and scientists say that can be both good and bad. According to a study published in proceedings of the natural academy of sciences, people turning an age that ends in 9 are more likely to take up positive habits, but they may also cheat on their mates and even be more apt to commit suicide, the washington post reports. That's because the approaching round-numbered ages ( e.g., the big 3-0 or 4-0 ) are \" psychologically consequential \" and cause us to take a long, hard look at what we've been doing up to that point and recalibrate, hal hershfield, one of the study's co-authors, tells the post. People want a do-over when they hit certain temporal landmarks like birthdays or new year's day — what a study published in management science calls the \" fresh start effect. \" in the new research, scientists analyzed six studies and found that people the post refers to as \" nine-enders \" are more likely to question how meaningful their lives are, and are more likely to increase both constructive and destructive behaviors, the nyu stern school of business reports. Men who were 29, 39, 49, and 59, for example, were more likely to register on an extramarital affair-focused website, while suicide rates for nine-enders were 2.4 % higher than for others. On the flip side, first-time marathon runners were more likely to have an age ending in 9 ( 25 % ), and runners who were 29 and 39 had a 2 % faster running rate than they did two years before and after those ages. The research underscores the powerful psychological pull that numbers can wield. ( death rates overall seem to spike on birthdays. )",

Details of the hours after dr. Lance capener's boat capsized in the lake, which sits along the utah-idaho border, are still unclear. But it appears that the 46-year-old may have been trying to keep the girls alive until his last breath, the salt lake tribune reports. There had been seven aboard the boat, and capener's wife and two teenage family friends survived the accident. All had life jackets on, but the rich county sheriff's office says they all experienced some degree of hypothermia; the ogden physician was dead by the time rescuers pulled the group from the 53-degree water, the ap reports. His daughters, 13-year-old kelsey and 7-year old kilee, were flown to the hospital, but they died hours later, as did their friend, 13-year old siera hadley. \" he would not come back without his children, \" capener's mother tells the tribune. \" i feel that's why he died, trying to save the others. \" she notes her son was a marathoner and strong swimmer, but adds \" that's a very bad lake; it can come up with squalls. \" the sheriff tells ksl that the ski boat capsized during a storm that created waves up to 10 feet high; the group was in the cold water for at least three hours while rescuers searched the 112-square-mile lake. \" the waves were white capping. … it took a lot of effort to find that boat, \" he says. When they did locate it 6 miles from the bear lake state park marina in utah, \" i actually performed cpr on two of these victims.

In a defiant op-ed in the wall street journal, the nypd chief boasts that there have been 7,383 fewer murders during mayor bloomberg's 11-year tenure than in the 11 years prior, citing it as evidence that the nypd's policies work. \" racial profiling is a disingenuous charge at best and an incendiary one at worst, \" kelly writes. But then he goes on to essentially defend racial profiling, writing, \" in 2003, when the nypd recognized that 96 % of individuals who were shot... Were black and hispanic, we concentrated our officers \" on troubled minority neighborhoods. He also mentions that \" the race of those stopped highly correlates to descriptions provided by victims or witnesses to crimes. \" kelly doesn't directly deny targeting muslims, either, instead writing that monitoring public gatherings is legal under the handschu guidelines, which were modified at the department's request after sept. 11. \" undercover officers and confidential informants do not enter a mosque unless they are following up on a lead vetted under handschu, \" he assures us.
