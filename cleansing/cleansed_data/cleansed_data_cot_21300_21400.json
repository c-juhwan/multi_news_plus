        "summary": "It's another disappointing showing for amy schumer, say critics, who've given new flick i feel pretty a 36 % rating on rotten tomatoes. ( audiences were even less kind, at 26 %. ) alongside other funny females like busy philipps, aidy bryant, and sasheer zamata, schumer stars as a self-conscious woman whose confidence is magically boosted when she hits her head. Four takes: \" the movie is seriously suboptimal, \" writes manohla dargis at the new york times, noting \" the idea that a lack of self-confidence can be essentially bootstrapped away... Is an exhausted, false fairy tale. \" but \" schumer puts out so much energy in i feel pretty that it's hard not to feel charged up \" and \" the laughs land often enough that you can go, if somewhat begrudgingly, with the messy flow, \" dargis writes. Peter howell mostly agrees. Though there's a \" happy conclusion, \" the film \" upholds the hoary hollywood tradition of pretending that a woman turns invisible and unlovable if she's not a candidate for the cover of vogue, \" he writes at the toronto star, though he credits schumer for \" completely and fearlessly buying into the premise, and delivering a few good lines. \" moira macdonald found the movie \" at times depressing. \" the \" body-positive message gets lost \" since the \" humor depends on us finding it funny that a woman who looks like amy schumer ( which is to say attractive and blond ) would be confident about her appearance, \" she writes at the seattle times. The movie \" wears thin \" as it \" rarely addresses … modern-day image issues in an intelligent or even hilarious way, \" mara reinstein puts it at us weekly. \" if a movie is going to put a spin on the transformation comedy, it should be more sophisticated and self-aware. All this entry does is prove the point that the genre itself is in desperate need of a makeover. \"",

A group called the satanic temple has started a push to establish the clubs at public elementary schools as an alternative to christian good news clubs found on thousands of campuses, the washington post reports. \"it's important that children be given an opportunity to realize that the evangelical materials now creeping into their schools are representative of but one religious opinion amongst many, \" satanic temple co-founder lucien greaves says in a press release. But the curriculum won't include donning a hooded robe and chanting in an attempt to conjure demonic forces. Greaves tells the post that satan is merely a \" metaphorical construct. \" the group's actual focuses include scientific rationality and the separation of church and state. A monthly meeting of an after school satan club chapter will include a nutritious snack, puzzle solving, art, and other activities. \" we're not the boogeymen, we are here to help, here to discuss and help learn, \" boston satanic temple chapter founder travis lesaffre tells wfxt. Greaves tells usa today that the group has already contacted school districts in nine states. A rep from the good news club, which has been around since 1937, calls the after school satan club a \" stunt, \" adding that \" schools and parents should not overreact.... If you leave them alone, they ' ll go home. \" ironically, the satanic temple is using a 2001 supreme court decision that found that excluding an after-school club, such as the good news club, from public campuses based on religion violates freedom of speech.",

The sad truth is that the broad policies many people call for, like \" banning assault weapons, \" actually wouldn't save the vast majority of those people, she writes. In the washington post, she delves into specific reasons why — in the case of an assault-weapons ban, gun hobbyists can easily turn a semi-automatic into an assault weapon, while skilled shooters can change magazines so quickly that limiting them might be \" meaningless. \" she also explains why it's actually not useful to compare us gun laws with the strictly tightened laws in britain and australia. So what could work in the us? \" narrowly tailored interventions to protect subtypes of potential victims, not broad attempts to limit the lethality of guns. \" that means individualized attention, like identifying gang members for intervention, putting police priority on women who are endangered by specific men, or getting older men ( who make up the biggest share of gun suicides ) access to care and help. In the end, libresco \" was still anti-gun, at least from the point of view of most gun owners, \" she writes. \" but i can't endorse policies whose only selling point is that gun owners hate them....

Other countries also have tightened gun laws after similar tragedies, leaving some americans wondering if similar changes here could have prevented the shooting in an orlando gay night club last month that killed 49 people. President obama has held up great britain and australia as models for what we might try, and hillary clinton has said on the campaign trail that australia's ban and buyback model is worth considering. But it can be hard to measure how well these reforms have done at preventing mass shootings and other gun violence.

The plaintiffs were on a waiting list to resign their memberships when trump bought the club. It can take years to actually resign from the club, due to rules stating members have to wait for new members to replace them. During that time, members waiting to resign can keep paying dues and using the club. When trump took over, he said he didn't want the members waiting to resign to use the club — telling them \" you're out \" in a letter — and wouldn't charge them dues. But a few months later, the trump national jupiter golf club started charging the soon-to-be-former members dues again — without giving them access to the club. Furthermore, the club also wasn't returning the $ 4.85 million in refundable deposits it owed to the 65 plaintiffs. On wednesday, judge kenneth mara ruled the club had violated its contract with members, politico reports. In addition to the deposits it owes, the club is also on the hook for nearly $ 1 million in interest. The trump organization, which plans to appeal the ruling, argues the golf club was in a bad place financially before trump took over, and the resigning members likely wouldn't have gotten their deposits back anyway.",

Judge kenneth marra of the southern district of florida found that trump's company had breached the membership contract and ruled in favor of 65 plaintiffs who filed a 2013 class-action lawsuit — one of thousands of legal actions trump and his businesses have faced.

            "A federal judge has ordered donald trump's jupiter national golf club to pay more than $ 5 million to former members who sued to get refunds of their deposits and dues after they were barred from the facilities while waiting for their resignations to be accepted.

        "summary": "Over the past 80 years, at least 2,000 square miles of southeastern louisiana's coastline have dropped off into the gulf of mexico — the equivalent of a football field-sized plot of land being swept away each hour, scientific american reports. Unless the state takes action, 1,750 more square miles could be lost over the next half-century, and new orleans could be stranded on a thin strip of land in the gulf by the year 2085, propublica reports. While louisiana does have a \" master plan \" to take on this problem, it is unprecedented in scope. Scientists have to factor in everything from how much sediment they can extract from the mississippi river and future sea-level rise to how to accomplish all this with minimal impact to the energy, shipping, and fishing industries. Money's an issue, too: congress hasn't ponied up much cash, even though half of us oil and gas refineries and pipelines are in the threatened region. Should the increasingly vulnerable port of new orleans be overrun by tropical storms, a shutdown could hurt our economy to the tune of $ 300 million a day, propublica notes. So far there are two viable proposals: pumping sand into the wetlands or bringing in sediment-filled freshwater, which more closely resembles the natural delta-building process but is more expensive upfront and takes longer ( and nothing like it has never been done before ). \" we ' ll have to start … on a small scale, and there will be missteps along the way, \" a coastal geologist tells propublica. \" but we have to succeed, because this, really, is our only hope. \" ( the pacific islands of kiribati are slowly sinking as well. )",

Kellie lynn collins, 31, is charged in the death of curt cain, 41, at a residence on old powderhouse road in aiken. Collins appeared in court tuesday and requested a public defender to represent her, according to the aiken county bond court. No bond has been set for collins, who is also charged with grand larceny. An autopsy revealed that cain was shot and died from loss of blood, according to aiken county coroner tim carlton. He is believed to have died aug. 4. Collins was a democratic candidate for georgia's 10th congressional district seat in 2018 but withdrew for personal reasons and wasn't on the ballot.

Ambulances were seen leaving the scene. The development comes a day after four other boys were successfully rescued, the bbc reports. The massive operation, involving around 90 divers, was put on hold overnight so air tanks could be replaced, reports the ap. The second phase of the operation was launched monday morning local time, with divers returning to the cave system. The boys ( there were a total of 12 ) and the coach will be brought out one by one, with each escorted through the cave network by two divers, authorities say. Narongsak osottanakorn, chief of the rescue mission, says the first four rescued boys have been hospitalized and haven't been reunited with their families yet because of the risk of infection, though they may be allowed to see them through a glass door. He says that water levels in the cave system, where a massive pumping operation has taken place, haven't risen despite rain on sunday, and some passageways are walkable. Authorities decided to carry out the high-risk rescue because monsoons threatened to flood the caves even more, including the dry ledge where the trapped boys and their coach ended up.

The mission which started sunday is a race against the clock with heavy rain expected this week which would again flood the tunnels with fast-flowing, rising water. A crack team of foreign divers and thai navy seals guided four boys on sunday and a further four on monday through narrow, submerged channels from the muddy bank deep inside the tham luang cave where they had been stranded for more than two weeks. \"all four boys have arrived at hospital, all are safe, \" narongsak osottanakorn, head of the rescue mission, told reporters of those freed on monday. Asked whether the remaining four \"wild boars \" team and their coach would come out at the same time in the next rescue effort, he said: \"it depends on the plan... We have set the plan for four people so if they want to take five out ( at the same time ), then they need to change the plan. \" the operation on monday went more smoothly than on sunday and took two hours less as the practice became more refined, he said.

The thai navy seals leading the rescue operation have confirmed that eight boys in total have been extracted. Four boys and their football coach remain inside the caves. Rescuers will try to free them on tuesday. The group became trapped on 23 june after heavy rains caused flooding, and was found last week by divers. Four boys were brought out safely on sunday, but the mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced. On monday, air ambulances were seen departing from the area around the cave system and ambulances were seen arriving at the hospital in the nearby town of chiang rai.

            "Chiang rai, thailand ( reuters ) - eight of the 12 boys trapped with their soccer coach in a labyrinthine flooded cave complex in northern thailand have been freed, authorities said on monday, adding that the time for rescuing the others will depend on the weather. The mission which started sunday is a race against the clock with heavy rain expected this week which would again flood the tunnels with fast-flowing, rising water. A crack team of foreign divers and thai navy seals guided four boys on sunday and a further four on monday through narrow, submerged channels from the muddy bank deep inside the tham luang cave where they had been stranded for more than two weeks. \"all four boys have arrived at hospital, all are safe, \" narongsak osottanakorn, head of the rescue mission, told reporters of those freed on monday. Asked whether the remaining four \"wild boars \" team and their coach would come out at the same time in the next rescue effort, he said: \"it depends on the plan... We have set the plan for four people so if they want to take five out ( at the same time ), then they need to change the plan. \" the operation on monday went more smoothly than on sunday and took two hours less as the practice became more refined, he said. But he added rescuers",
            "Image copyright afp image caption the boys who were rescued on monday are said to be in reasonable health divers have rescued four more boys from a vast cave system in northern thailand on the second day of a complex operation. The thai navy seals leading the rescue operation have confirmed that eight boys in total have been extracted. Four boys and their football coach remain inside the caves. Rescuers will try to free them on tuesday. The group became trapped on 23 june after heavy rains caused flooding, and was found last week by divers. Four boys were brought out safely on sunday, but the mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced. On monday, air ambulances were seen departing from the area around the cave system and ambulances were seen arriving at the hospital in the nearby town of chiang rai. The boys have not been seen in public, but have been pronounced to be in reasonable health.

On thursday, a baltimore judge vacated syed's murder conviction in the death of his ex-girlfriend, hae min lee, in 2000, and granted his request to be tried again, the baltimore sun reports. Judge martin welch wrote in his opinion that syed's attorney was \" ineffective \" when she didn't cross-examine the state's expert about the reliability of evidence based on cellphone tower locations. \" we won a new trial for adnan syed!!! #freeadnan, \" tweeted syed's lawyer thursday. Syed's attorneys had previously argued that the cellphone records were questionable and that a key witness, who could have provided an alibi for syed, was also overlooked by syed's original lawyer. Serial spoke to that witness, but it was undisclosed, a spinoff podcast, that revealed the cellphone tower evidence might be unreliable. An at&t engineer's sworn statements on cellphone data were used to connect syed to the park where lee's body was found, but that engineer has since said his testimony would have been different had he seen a disclaimer about the data that he was not shown, the new york times reports. Syed's brother said the family is \" feeling great \" after the judge's decision.",

The state last weekend shifted responsibility for thousands of parolees and inmates onto local jurisdictions, in part to cut costs and in part to comply with a supreme court order to improve prison overcrowding, reports the wall street journal. \" los angeles has the lowest crime in a generation, the lowest number of homicides since 1967, and a 40 % reduction in the most violent gang crime, \" said mayor antonio villaraigosa. \" all of that could change, starting today. \" he and top cop charlie beck say the state is saddling the city with a huge extra workload but no extra money. The state gave los angeles county $ 124 million for the shift and says it's up to the county to divvy it up appropriately among its municipalities, notes the los angeles times.",

Rising metal prices have made the cost of minting the coins rise to nearly double their face value and this is the third year in a row the loss on small coins has topped $ 100 million, a hit big enough to catch the eye of budget-cutters on capitol hill, the washington post finds. President obama mentioned the possibility of using cheaper metals to make the coins in his budget last week, reuters notes, but he will face stiff opposition from industry groups, especially the zinc producers who provide 97.5 % of what goes into a penny. Some policymakers are looking north of the border for ideas: canadian nickels, which still cost less than face value to make, are 95 % steel and just 2 % nickel, compared to 25 % nickel in the us version, and the country got rid of the penny last year.",

            "In 2013, the cost of making pennies and nickels exceeded their face value for the eighth year in a row. The cost of minting a penny stood at 1.8 cents, nearly twice its face value. Nickels cost twice as much as dimes – 9.4 cents vs. 4.6 cents – despite being worth only half as much. For a better cost comparison, we can look at the price of putting one dollar's worth of each denomination into circulation. The u.s. Treasury spends nearly two dollars for every dollar of nickels and pennies it pumps into the economy. In contrast, the same amount of quarters and dimes costs the government less than 50 cents. A dollar bill is even cheaper, coming in at less than a quarter. Historically, nickels and pennies have always been more expensive on a per-dollar basis than dimes and quarters – this makes sense, since it takes a lot more metal to make 100 pennies than it does to make four quarters. But the government only began losing money on nickels and pennies in 2006. For some historical perspective i obtained 30 years of coin manufacturing costs from the u.s. Mint, which are plotted below on a cost-per-dollar basis. The chart shows that manufacturing costs rose gradually from 1984 until roughly 2005, at which point nickel and penny costs began to spike dramatically. Why the spike?",
            "Washington ( reuters ) - in a budget proposal that aims to make government more efficient, president barack obama on tuesday floated the idea of using alternative metals to make penny and nickel coins. The fiscal 2015 budget, released on tuesday, points out that the coins ' manufacturing and circulation have not changed in decades and that the treasury department has been reviewing the coins ' production. Obama has proposed similar reviews in the past but the measures stalled despite not being partisan points of contention. The budget does not include a specific cost savings figure for the potential changes but it identifies the rise of electronic commerce as a reason to review the coins ' makeup and distribution. Obama's 2014 budget had pegged the cost of manufacturing a penny at two cents and the price of a nickel at 11 cents. Past attempts to change penny and nickel production have faced resistance from interest groups. A 2010 wall street journal report noted the coin laundry association was one such group resisting a change, due to the \" unintended consequences that could deeply impact the small-business owner during a recession. \" the budget, which lays out the president's policy priorities ahead of november's midterm elections, has little chance of becoming law. Still, it provides a path for democrats, who are hoping to retain a majority in the senate"

The budget does not include a specific cost savings figure for the potential changes but it identifies the rise of electronic commerce as a reason to review the coins ' makeup and distribution. Obama's 2014 budget had pegged the cost of manufacturing a penny at two cents and the price of a nickel at 11 cents. Past attempts to change penny and nickel production have faced resistance from interest groups. A 2010 wall street journal report noted the coin laundry association was one such group resisting a change, due to the \" unintended consequences that could deeply impact the small-business owner during a recession. \" the budget, which lays out the president's policy priorities ahead of november's midterm elections, has little chance of becoming law. Still, it provides a path for democrats, who are hoping to retain a majority in the senate"

The senate voted 86-9 monday to confirm robert wilkie as the 10th secretary of veterans affairs, filling a post that was previously occupied by david shulkin. President trump's original pick to replace shulkin, white house physician ronny jackson, ended up withdrawing. Npr describes the 55-year-old wilkie as a \" safe pick \" with a deep military background: he himself is a navy veteran and active member of the air force reserves, and his father was seriously wounded while fighting in vietnam. But the washington post reports what has in the past always been a unanimous vote — with senators looking to show bipartisan support for veterans — wasn't quite there for the first time. Bernie sanders was in the nay category, with npr reporting his vote was more a larger statement against any trump administration moves to privatize the va. But the ap reports the wilkie did indeed vow not to privatize the va. It calls the vote \" a moment of respite from the sharp political divisions engulfing trump's other nominees in the final months before congressional midterm elections. \" the post notes potential 2020 candidates including cory booker, kamala harris, and kirsten giilibrand were among the other nos.

Both hacks occurred last year, with the biggest of the two affecting 21.5 million people — a total that includes people who had sought government background checks, along with spouses, partners, or others who lived with them, reports the washington post. The smaller hack affected about 4 million people, but with overlap between the two, the total number of victims is pegged at 22.1 million. The stolen information includes social security numbers and fingerprints. Pretty much anyone who has had an opm background check since 2000 should consider their information compromised. The post thinks the revised numbers will raise pressure on opm chief katherine archuleta to resign, given that the agency had been warned about its vulnerabilities before the breaches. But archuleta reiterated today that she would not. \" staggering, \" says an official with the national federation of federal employees of the new total. \" not only do federal employees have to worry about their own personal information being exposed — but they must also worry about their spouse and children having their information compromised. \" ( the best guess is that the hackers were from china. )",

But the money in the world trade center health program is set to run out next year, which some fear would leave tens of thousands to deal with medical issues on their own. \" one year from now, there will be approximately 70,000 enrolled patients … who are in that program who have had documented exposures that were certified by the federal government who will no longer have coverage under that program unless it is re-certified, \" dr. David prezant, chief medical officer of the fdny, tells nbc. Exposure to 9/11's toxic chemicals — asbestos and lead among them, nbc notes — has been linked to a long list of ailments, including dozens of cancers, respiratory and digestive disorders, and mental health conditions such as ptsd. \" more than 33,000 9/11 responders and survivors have an illness or injury caused by the attacks or their aftermath, and over two-thirds of those have more than one illness, \" says a statement from ny sen. Kirsten gillibrand, who's vying to reinstate the fund. \" many are disabled and can no longer work. \" about 16,000 of those covered under the fund are first responders — firefighters and ems workers who rushed to ground zero — and prezant predicts many others will develop cancer. Perhaps most amazing: many of those responders don't regret the role they played on 9/11. \" they … say that they would do it all over again, \" prezant tells nbc. ( journalists on the scene that day have also reported health issues. )",

But it's also likely to make them short. Such is the conclusion of a study of roughly 8,000 japanese-american men in hawaii. These men, born between 1900 and 1919, were split into two groups ( 5-foot-2 and shorter, and 5-foot-4 and taller ) and tracked for more than 40 years beginning in 1965, reports popular science. \" this study shows for the first time that body size is linked to this gene, \" says researcher bradley willcox. \" we knew that in animal models of aging. We did not know that in humans. \" about 250 of the study's subjects are still alive today. The situation is not entirely straightforward, however. The authors of the study, published in plosone, point out that although the gene's role in regulating insulin seems to be its key link to longevity, there are a number of complicating factors, and the hypothesis needs to be tested in a more diverse group of subjects. Willcox was categorical in stating of his test subjects that \" the folks that were 5-2 and shorter lived the longest. The taller you got, the shorter you lived. \" but the study points out that conditions in early childhood, diet, and other variables contribute to one's height and health as well. Thus, willcox advises that \" no matter how tall you are, \" living a healthy lifestyle can help offset a less-than-favorable version of foxo3.

Now, after being suspended for six months from nbc for misleading statements about his iraq war activity, the news anchor is being examined for other suspicious tales. One story involves williams ' 2008 claim that \" i was at the brandenburg gate the night the [ berlin wall ] came down \" ( it's widely known tom brokaw was the only american anchor to report live from there, per cnn ). There's also williams ' constantly evolving story about meeting pope john paul ii at catholic university in 1979 — each telling of the tale has become more \" colorful, \" cnn notes. And the huffington post has parsed williams ' contentions that he flew into baghdad with seal team six, that a seal once sent him a knife as a gift, and that he also has a \" piece of the fuselage of the blown-up black hawk \" used in the osama bin laden raid. Readers will have to scan williams'differing accounts of these incidents on their own ( too many variations to get into here ). But regarding the seals flight, a special operations command official told cnn, \" we do not embed journalists with any elements of that unit. \" and brandon webb, an ex-seal who helped train \" american sniper \" chris kyle, isn't buying williams'story about the chopper. \" it seems very strange that professional operators are going to take a souvenir off a classified stealth helicopter and then send it to brian williams, \" he tells huffpo. \" if brian wants to re-establish his credibility, let's have him show us a picture of the piece. \" as the world waits for such evidence, we ' ll have to make do with williams popping up \" forrest gump-style, \" as the los angeles times puts it, in internet memes such as williams at the last supper, involved with the moon landing, and capturing saddam hussein.

        "summary": "Eric donovan loved his job of 17 years at a canadian nonprofit agency that runs group homes and programs for adults with intellectual disabilities. But during the final years of his life, that love turned to stress as donovan felt he was being bullied by nadine hendricken, his supervisor at queens county residential services. The stress got so bad he and his wife, lisa, started fearing for his health. On oct. 31, 2013, he collapsed at home. He died days later of cardiac arrest at age 47. Now, lisa has been awarded benefits after the workers compensation board of prince edward island determined that donovan's death was linked to bullying and harassment in the workplace, the cbc reports. Eric donovan had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused his death, the board heard. The suit also claimed he had been forced to do unsafe work and work extra hours, the guardian reported last year. Donovan's co-workers testified that hendricken was known as a bully, while donovan was known as \" helpful and generous \" to his colleagues and \" conscientious and compassionate \" with group home residents. Per his widow, things got really bad after donovan injured his back during an attempt to restrain an aggressive client on sept. 30, 2013. Lisa alleges that hendricken had called donovan a \" wimp, \" in front of his co-workers, prior to the incident, and that when he returned to work after his medical leave, she \" berated \" him as \" weak, \" again in front of colleagues. Donovan also told his wife that he overheard hendricken telling someone else that she believed he was faking the injury. Qcrs has filed an appeal, and the organization's executive director says donovan never filed a complaint about his alleged bullying. ( a 13-year-old boy who committed suicide left behind a letter on bullying. )",

        "summary": "President obama appears ready to make history by commuting sentences for nearly 80 federal prisoners this month — more than any president has in decades, the new york times reports. His expected clemency will free prisoners put away on non-violent drug charges, and reflects a bigger effort by the obama administration to ease sentences that republicans and democrats alike say are too harsh. The problem is that 30,000 criminals responded to the administration's offer for clemency, creating a ton of red tape and triggering fears that he might release a violent criminal. \" i think they honestly want to address some of the people who have been oversentenced in the last 30 years, \" says an activist. \" i ' m not sure they envisioned that it would be as complicated as it is. \" lawmakers across the political spectrum have been working together on legislation to change sentencing, and more than 9,500 drug offenders ( mostly black and hispanic ) have seen their sentences reduced. But with federal elections closing in, the white house is urging justice officials to hurry up with forwarding clemency applications and not eliminate the borderline ones. Meanwhile, a consortium of lawyers called the clemency project is helping inmates apply and says it has streamlined the process, usa today reports. Obama, who has already reduced 43 sentences, tells the huffington post that he will use his \" pardon power and clemency power more aggressively for people who meet the criteria — non-violent crimes, have served already a long period of time, have shown that they're rehabilitated. \"",

The red and black leather jacket worn by the king of pop in the 1983 video is expected to fetch between $ 200,000 and $ 400,000 at a beverly hills auction later this month, reports the ap. The jacket — worn and signed by jackson — was a gift from the singer to his longtime costume designers. A portion of the proceeds will benefit the shambala preserve, where jackson's two bengal tigers have lived since 2006. Also for sale: the wig jackson wore during the announcement of his \" this is it \" concert series, a fedora and glove he wore onstage, the shirt he wore in the \" scream \" video, and a mailbox from the estate where he died in 2009.",

        "summary": "Farmers in nebraska, minnesota, massachusetts, and new york are staging something of a mechanical revolt. They're attempting to get legislation passed in their states that would enable them, for the first time since the 1998 digital millennium copyright act, to repair their own tractors or get an independent mechanic to help. At the root of the morass is the software that helps run modern tractors and their sensors, diagnostic tools, and other high-tech elements. If farmers so much as open the metaphorical hood to check out the computers they could be violating the federal act, reports modern farmer. Mick minchow, a nebraska farmer for more than 40 years, is among the many who are fed up, reports lincoln journal star. As it currently stands, any problem with his john deere 8235 r requires a trip to the dealer and costs him important time. What he'd like to be able to do, per the paper, is something as simple as looking up the system code to determine if it's a serious problem or something as mundane as replacing a filter. John deere's argument, as reported by wired, is that giving farmers free rein over the software would \" make it possible for pirates, third-party developers, and less innovative competitors to free-ride off the creativity, unique expression, and ingenuity of vehicle software. \" other potential issues that have been floated: the financial hit such a change could wreak on dealerships, and the complications of buying used equipment whose software was improperly changed.

            "It's official: john deere and general motors want to eviscerate the notion of ownership. Sure, we pay for their vehicles. But we don't own them. Not according to their corporate lawyers, anyway. In a particularly spectacular display of corporate delusion, john deere — the world's largest agricultural machinery maker — told the copyright office that farmers don't own their tractors. Because computer code snakes through the dna of modern tractors, farmers receive \"an implied license for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle. \" it's john deere's tractor, folks. You're just driving it. Several manufacturers recently submitted similar comments to the copyright office under an inquiry into the digital millennium copyright act. Dmca is a vast 1998 copyright law that ( among other things ) governs the blurry line between software and hardware. The copyright office, after reading the comments and holding a hearing, will decide in july which high-tech devices we can modify, hack, and repair — and decide whether john deere's twisted vision of ownership will become a reality. Wired opinion about kyle wiens is the co-founder and ceo of ifixit, an online repair community and parts retailer internationally renowned for their open source repair manuals and product teardowns.

            "It's official: john deere and general motors want to eviscerate the notion of ownership. Sure, we pay for their vehicles. But we don't own them. Not according to their corporate lawyers, anyway. In a particularly spectacular display of corporate delusion, john deere — the world's largest agricultural machinery maker — told the copyright office that farmers don't own their tractors. Because computer code snakes through the dna of modern tractors, farmers receive \"an implied license for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle. \" it's john deere's tractor, folks. You're just driving it. Several manufacturers recently submitted similar comments to the copyright office under an inquiry into the digital millennium copyright act. Dmca is a vast 1998 copyright law that ( among other things ) governs the blurry line between software and hardware. The copyright office, after reading the comments and holding a hearing, will decide in july which high-tech devices we can modify, hack, and repair — and decide whether john deere's twisted vision of ownership will become a reality.

The interview is said to have led to the drug kingpin's capture on friday in the city of los mochis in sinaloa. The latest: how penn got his meeting: thank twitter. Mashable reports that penn's co-interviewer, mexican actress kate del castillo, in 2012 addressed el chapo on twitter in a sort of \" open letter \" in which she suggested he \" [ start ] trafficking with love. \" a connection was established: el chapo apparently wanted to send her flowers after the tweet and had one of his lawyers reach out. After his 2014 arrest, the two sent notes to each other regarding a possible guzman biopic. A mutual friend of penn's and del castillo's looped penn in. Did penn cross a legal line? unlikely, at least according to the experts the los angeles times spoke with. In order for an accessory-after-the-fact charge to stick, there would need to be evidence of something beyond a meeting ( the times ' example: like \" offering the fugitive advice on how to avoid detection \" ). Where guzman stands, legally: he very well may be us-bound. Mexico has begun extradition proceedings that would see el chapo face charges that run the gamut from drug trafficking to kidnapping to murder. While mexico pushed back against such extradition in 2014, \" that position changed after he escaped \" in july, per reuters. The when and where: though seven us jurisdictions have open indictments against him, one former dea agent suspects he'd end up in chicago. The ap reports guzman's lawyers have filed six motions to challenge extradition requests; the head of extradition for the mexican attorney general's office puts the extradition timeline at a year. About that sex motel: the guardian has a play-by-play of el chapo's capture, which could have been a non-capture, had guzman's escape following a 4: 30am friday gun battle succeeded. He and his head of security fled via the sewer, \" squelch[ ing ] through the fetid tunnels \" until, it is believed, 10am. They were captured after carjacking a vehicle and heading north, and immediately brought to a \" discreet refuge \": a sex motel.

The ancient animals were still living on a small island off the coast of alaska until about 5,600 years ago — or 5,000 or so years after most woolly mammoths had died off, the alaska dispatch news reports. The study concludes it was a lack of fresh water that finally did in the holdouts on st. Paul island. According to the bbc, rising ocean levels at the end of the ice age not only shrank the woolly mammoths ' island home, but inundated freshwater reservoirs with seawater. The study's author, russ graham, tells the guardian there were probably only two watering holes left for the mammoths at the end, and those were shallower and saltier than before. The problem was exacerbated by more mammoths crowding around fewer water sources, trampling vegetation and eroding sediment into the water. Modern elephants can drink more than 50 gallons of water per day; woolly mammoths would likely have needed even more to keep their hairy bodies cool in a warming climate. With little fresh water left, the st. Paul mammoths were likely killed off by heat stress and dehydration. A professor at the swedish museum of natural history says the study likely makes the mammoths'demise the \" most well-described and best understood prehistoric extinction event. \" ( a michigan farmer was shocked to discover a giant mammoth on his property. )",

Five independent indicators of extinction show that mammoths survived on st. Paul until 5,600 ± 100 y ago. Vegetation composition remained stable during the extinction window, and there is no evidence of human presence on the island before 1787 ce, suggesting that these factors were not extinction drivers.

( associated press ) washington ( ap ) — congress has rejected a veto by president barack obama for the first time since he became president. The house voted 348-77 wednesday to override his veto of legislation and allow the families of sept. 11 victims to sue saudi arabia for the kingdom's alleged backing of the attackers. The senate had voted 97-1 to override his veto. The lawsuit legislation now becomes law despite elements that obama and top pentagon officials warn could put u.s. Troops and interests at risk. Several lawmakers who voted for the legislation acknowledged the defects could trigger lawsuits from people in other countries opposed to u.s. Policies and military actions. But proponents said the bill is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on u.s. Soil.",

The senate took the first step wednesday, voting 97-1 to override obama's veto of the 9/11 bill. The house quickly followed with a 348-77 vote. Story continued below the sweeping popularity of the legislation — known as the justice against sponsors of terrorism act — made it basically inevitable that the measure would ultimately become law, despite fierce objections from the obama administration. The bill, known informally as jasta, sailed through the senate with no objections in the spring and was voice-voted in the house earlier this month. \"this legislation is really about pursuing justice, \" said senate majority whip john cornyn ( r-texas ), one of the chief sponsors of the bill, along with sen. Chuck schumer ( d-n.y. ). \"the families have already suffered too much. They've already suffered untold tragedy, of course, and they deserve to find a path to closure that only justice can provide. \" schumer said \" overriding a presidential veto is something we don't take lightly. \" \" but it was important in this case that the families of the victims of 9/11 be allowed to pursue justice, \" schumer added. \" even if that pursuit causes some diplomatic discomforts. \" the white house -- which had done little in the way of direct outreach with capitol hill, senators said -- unleashed a torrent of anger at congress, with press secretary josh earnest"

The 58-year-old former police officer is credited with shooting the assailant inside the parliament building, just outside its occupied caucus rooms, reports the globe and mail of toronto. Here's a sample of one many tweets, this from veterans affairs minister julian fantino: \" i am safe &amp; profoundly grateful to sgt at arms kevin vickers &amp; our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe. \" ( fantino was in a meeting with prime minister stephen harper inside parliament when the assault took place, reports the toronto sun. Harper is safe, too. ) another member of parliament, craig scott, says he and his colleagues \" owe their safety, even lives \" to vickers, reports the new york times. Cbs news, meanwhile, appears to be the first to identify the gunman, who was shot dead: it quotes anonymous sources naming him as michael zehaf-bibeau, who is believed to have been born in canada in 1982. By most accounts, he fatally shot a soldier standing guard at the nation's national war memorial, then made his way across the street to parliament. The ap includes this quote from a witness: \" i looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice. \" the slain soldier has been identified as 24-year-old nathan cirillo, reports the cbc. A police spokesperson says up to three shooters may have been involved. Three people were being treated for injuries related to the shooting at ottawa hospital.

The new york times highlights a moody's report that points out that, should the triggered cuts occur and the payroll tax holiday end, the deficit would shrink from $ 1.3 trillion to $ 510 billion by 2013, which it calls a \" historically extreme \" reduction. That's a dangerous prospect, according to an economist behind the report: \" you're taking a weak economy and removing a large part of potential demand, which could be enough to tip us into recession. \"",

Tax cuts passed in the bush administration will expire at the end of 2012. By law, the panel's failure triggers new caps on spending, cutting $ 1.2 trillion from the military, education, health care and other priorities over 10 years beginning next fall. The combined impact of higher tax rates and less spending would reverse the growth of annual deficits beginning in 2013, reducing by more than half the current $ 1.3"

        "summary": "Being born without itpr2 may sound like a blessing: the gene regulates sweat production, and having none of it eliminates one's ability to sweat. Swedish researchers identified the rare genetic mutation after zeroing in on five children in one pakistani family who are unable to sweat. What's particularly unusual in the children's case is that the disorder, known as anhidrosis, isn't accompanied by any other skin disorders. But as popular science reports, the condition is effectively a curse: in lacking the ability to sweat, the children can't regulate their body temperature. They live their days in the home's cellar, away from the heat that could render them unconscious, or even kill them. The researchers determined that itpr2 encodes the protein insp3r2, as they explain in their study, published last week in the journal of clinical investigation. Because the children don't have that protein, calcium ions aren't released from cells, reports livescience; without that release, the events that trigger sweating aren't themselves triggered. The finding actually has implications for the 2 % of people who sweat too much, a more common disorder known as hyperhidrosis. Popular science notes the condition can lead sufferers to take measures as extreme as wearing a layer of plastic between their skin and clothing. Adjusting insp3r2 protein levels, perhaps via a drug, may be a more palatable treatment than what is currently typically used: botox injections. Inhibiting the protein's production, says one researcher, \" can reduce peripheral sweating by 60 %. \" ( click to read about five siblings who must walk on all fours. )",

Senators claire mccaskill and elizabeth warren today released a government report showing that student loan debt is escalating rapidly, and tens of thousands of senior americans are currently having their social security benefits cut below the poverty line to recoup defaulted student loan debt. The report, conducted for mccaskill and warren by the government accountability office ( gao ), indicates that in the past ten years the amount of student loan debt among seniors has skyrocketed, as has the number of seniors whose social security benefits are being garnished in order to recoup that debt. Mccaskill and warren both serve on the senate aging committee, where mccaskill is the top democrat. The report's troubling findings included: the cohort of those over 50 in student loan debt, over 7 million americans, is growing much faster than younger cohorts. Since 2005, americans aged 65 and up saw their total student loan debt grow by 385 percent. The number of americans whose social security checks are being garnished by the government to recoup defaulted student loans has increased by 540 percent in the last decade to over 114,000 older borrowers.

But then their adult son and daughter, also members, cut off all communication as part of disconnection, \" a form of hypnosis \" used to separate families to control members, phil tells curbed. The couple tried to reconnect by posting missing posters around their son's workplace. Then they started thinking larger-scale. After raising $ 14,000 on gofundme, the couple has erected a billboard in los angeles reading, \" to my loved one in scientology … call me. \" the goal is \" to make people more aware of scientology disconnection, as well as hopefully entice those in scientology to take that step of calling their loved ones, \" per the gofundme page. Phil and willie are also using a documentary filmmaker to tell their story, per us weekly. \" it is shameful that two people desperate for publicity would hook up with a reality tv producer to shamelessly exploit their two adult children over their choice of faith, \" the church of scientology says, adding that the couple is promoting \" anti-religious hate and bigotry. \" the joneses simply hope their message reaches their son and daughter, the latter of whom reportedly has worked for david miscavige and tom cruise. \" we love you guys so much, and miss you so much, \" says willie. \" we won't stop fighting for you, ever, ever, \" adds phil.

            "Rio de janeiro ( reuters ) - a rio de janeiro policeman confessed to murdering greece's ambassador to brazil in what investigators on friday called a \"cowardly act \" carried out at the direction of the diplomat's brazilian wife with whom the officer was romantically involved. Ambassador kyriakos amiridis, 59, was missing since monday night. Françoise, his brazilian wife and the mother of their 10-year-old daughter, reported him missing to police on wednesday. Officer sergio moreira, 29, confessed to police on friday that he killed the ambassador late monday night in the rio de janeiro home the amiridises owned in nova iguaçu, a hardscrabble neighborhood in the city's sprawling, violent northern outskirts. Investigator evaristo magalhaes told reporters that françoise, 40, and moreira had arranged the murder a few days in advance. Both amiridis ' wife and the officer are in custody. Police have also detained a cousin of the officer, who magalhaes said acted as a lookout while the crime was committed and helped carry the body from the house with the promise that he would be paid 80,000 reais ( $ 25,000 ). \"this was a tragic, cowardly act, but we worked tirelessly to crack this case as soon as possible, \" magalhaes told a news conference. \"it was a crime of passion. \" brazilian president michel temer, in a letter addressed to greek prime minister alexis tsipras, said the ambassador's killing had caused him profound sadness and he extended his condolences to the ambassador's family, friends and the greek people.

        "summary": "A third autopsy has been done in the strange case of a teen found dead in a rolled-up gym mat in january 2013, and this one found evidence of foul play. Kendrick johnson's parents have had two of the three autopsies done, as they continue to insist the 17-year-old's death was no accident, the atlanta journal-constitution reports. The georgia sophomore was found upside down in the mat in his high school's gym; state and local investigators believe he got stuck inside while reaching for a pair of sneakers. The state medical examiner's office found that he died of positional asphyxia, meaning that he suffocated due to the position he was trapped in. The lowndes county sheriff's office classified his death as accidental, and kenneth and jackie johnson have been fighting that finding ever since; they have had their son's body exhumed twice, per the valdosta daily times. The two autopsies done at their request found the teen died of non-accidental blunt force trauma between his neck and abdomen. The johnsons believe their son was killed by two sons of a local fbi agent, though video evidence showed they were not near the lowndes high school gym at the time johnson was last seen alive. A federal investigation was opened into the teen's death and ultimately found no evidence of foul play. Because of that, the journal-constitution says the impact of the latest autopsy will likely be \" minimal. \" but walb reports that in addition to the latest autopsy, the johnsons submitted an affidavit to the local sheriff's office stating that they were told this year someone killed their son by hitting him in the chest with a 45-pound dumbbell and that surveillance footage was edited to remove more than an hour of video. They are hoping to get the case re-opened. ( click for more on the case. )",

            "Results from a third autopsy conducted on the body of kendrick johnson — the second performed at the behest of johnson's parents — have been released, contradicting an earlier conclusion that the 17-year-old's death was accidental. But the new autopsy's impact is likely to be minimal, as a lengthy federal investigation already concluded there was no evidence of foul play. Johnson, the lowndes high school sophomore whose body was found in a rolled-up gym mat nearly six years ago, died from non-accidental blunt force trauma between his neck and abdomen, the third autopsy concludes. That mirrors the findings from the first autopsy, paid for by kendrick's parents, kenneth and jackie johnson, who once again hired william anderson to examine their son's body. In-depth: old wounds, old hatred, new media in valdosta gym mat death related: valdosta teen's second autopsy concludes death no accident previous: kendrick johnson's parents will exhume his body — again the state medical examiner's office found the cause of death to be \"positional asphyxia, \" meaning he became trapped in a position that caused him to suffocate. That finding led the lowndes county sheriff's office to classify johnson's death as an accident. A review of the autopsies commissioned by federal investigators determined the gbi's autopsy was more credible. But the johnsons have never accepted the official line. \"kendrick kj johnson was murdered but we already knew that, \" jackie johnson wrote on facebook friday morning.
