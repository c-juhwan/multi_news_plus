Until now, per the wall street journal, which reports on the league's slipping ratings on major tv networks during the first four weeks of this season. Bloomberg notes that nielsen data shows a 14 % drop in prime-time viewership in the 18-to-49 age bracket. And the networks aren't the only ones flummoxed by the seemingly sudden decline. \" we're scratching our heads, \" says a media buyer for an agency whose clients include gm, who adds that it's \" probably being caused by a confluence of events. \" those factors could include the hyperfocus on this year's presidential election, the absence so far of big-name players like brady and tony romo, and the fact that \" cord-cutters \" may keep up with games via other methods other than on tv. What the nfl's media head doesn't think has any bearing on ratings: hubbub over protests held during the national anthem, despite a wcnc-cited poll suggesting about one-third of americans may decline to watch because of this.

        "summary": "Could the end be near for luxury watch brands like rolex? probably not anytime soon, but the explosion of smartwatches represents the biggest threat to swiss watchmakers since seiko introduced its landmark quartz watch in 1969, business insider reports. Classic analog watches can't match the technology of wrist computers that do everything from play music to turn on your air-conditioning. Contenders such as the apple watch represent the new battleground for watch makers, and swiss brands \" may soon see a large portion of their business threatened, \" says andrea squatrito. A report by his company, re analytics, says high-end makers like rolex have a lot to lose, with 45 % of the company's business coming from their \" lower end \" watches with a starting price point of about $ 2,700. With those upmarket customers in mind, apple turned up the heat when it teamed up with hermes to introduce a sleeker version of the apple watch with a choice of stylish leather bands, starting at $ 1,500. But the future of the smartwatch hasn't always looked so rosy. A steep drop in sales late last year had analysts questioning the future of do-it-all timepieces, per cnn. Consumers surveyed called smartwatches too expensive, big, and ugly, per computer world. Still, the new year began with a flood of new smartwatches in stores — and more on the horizon — ranging from upmarket versions by tag to old standbys like casio, per wareable. Countering the \" ugly \" rap, upmarket brands like kate spade and michael kors introduced hybrid versions blending the look of traditional analogs with smartwatch features.

One \" scary result \" for clinton is a poll that shows donald trump with a 5-point lead in ohio, he writes, though others show little change despite clinton's recent setbacks. But what \" the commentariat has been slow to recognize, \" he writes, is how much the race has already swung toward trump in recent weeks, with clinton's lead shrinking from around 8 points to 3. Silver now gives trump a 37.3 % chance of winning, based on polls. Those are the best odds he has given the republican since july. In other coverage: business insider notes that while silver's model still predicts that clinton will win the popular vote, the electoral math has tightened, with swing states florida, north carolina, iowa, and ohio all now on course to vote for trump. Politico reports that trump is still avoiding mentions of clinton's health, though he did come close at a raucous rally in canton, ohio, on wednesday night, where he repeatedly strayed from his teleprompter script. \" it is hot, and it is always hot when i perform, because the crowds are so big, these rooms were not designed for this kind of crowd, \" he said. \" i don't know, folks, do you think hillary could stand up here for an hour? \" the ap reports that clinton will return to the campaign trail thursday with a campaign event in greensboro, nc, and a speech to a hispanic group.

It's also the first mission for the us air force minotaur v, a ballistic missile-turned-spacecraft. Researchers hope the $ 280 million lunar atmosphere and dust environment explorer ( ladee ) mission will help them explain a fascinating phenomenon: a glow over the moon's horizon, the christian science monitor reports. Astronauts have been aware of it since as far back as the 1960s, though descriptions vary. Decades ago, scientists described the glow as a narrow strip of light; later astronauts reported an array of beams stretching hundreds of miles upward. And in 1994, an orbiter saw nothing at all. \" one of the things ladee wants to try to ascertain is: is this really happening, or is this just somebody's imagination? \" says an expert.

During his speech, obama recognized the challenges faced by the global community in dealing with religious fanaticism. \" no god condones terror, \" he said, as per the ap, calling out those who \" hijack religion for their own murderous ends. \" to make his point that this phenomenon happens across all religions, he then continued, \" unless we get on our high horse and think that this is unique to some other place, remember that during the crusades and inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of christ. In our home country, slavery and jim crow all too often was justified in the name of christ. \" obama's statements were in line with how he's previously addressed the \" exceptionalism \" perception — that our nation is somehow markedly more \" special \" than others — as well as with his efforts to address concerns from a variety of groups: yesterday, for example, he held his first-ever roundtable with muslim-only leaders, the washington post notes. Still, critics didn't take kindly to his lecture. \" the president's comments … at the prayer breakfast are the most offensive i've ever heard a president make in my lifetime, \" former virginia gov. Jim gilmore tells the post. \" he has offended every believing christian in the united states. \" russell moore, president of a southern baptist commission, adds obama's comments were \" an unfortunate attempt at a wrongheaded moral comparison, \" calling instead for a \" clear strategy for defeating isis. \" ( the harsher your life, the more likely you believe in a powerful god. )",

As a new president, he dismissed the idea of american exceptionalism, noting that greeks think their country is special, too. He labeled the bush-era interrogation practices, euphemistically called \"harsh \" for years, as torture. America, he has suggested, has much to answer given its history in latin america and the middle east. His latest challenge came thursday at the national prayer breakfast. At a time of global anxiety over islamist terrorism, obama noted pointedly that his fellow christians, who make up a vast majority of americans, should perhaps not be the ones who cast the first stone. \"humanity has been grappling with these questions throughout human history, \" he told the group,"

Virginia, a state that had voted to elect a democratic presidential candidate only once in 40 years — barack obama in 2008 — was not leaning toward mitt romney as some republicans had predicted it would. Inside the nbc \"sunday night football \" studio that msnbc was borrowing for the night, the stage manager loudly called out, \"here we go. \" ms.

When president obama won virginia and most of the other battleground states on tuesday night, ensuring himself a second term as president, some at msnbc felt as if they had won as well.

        "summary": "A two-and-a-half-year-old pennsylvania girl did something unremarkable while at a walmart — and it almost killed her. The girl ate a mandarin orange while in the store; after experiencing itching and swelling, her parents gave her a dose of benadryl, but her condition worsened, with coughing and spasming lungs. She was having a potentially deadly anaphylactic reaction, which a co-author of a new paper about the case explains occurs when multiple organs are affected by an allergen. A shot of epinephrine is generally administered in these cases; it eases swelling and helps to open airways. Newsweek reports that the toddler required two shots, and then needed to be hooked up to a ventilator for a short time. Doctors were initially stumped. Her parents insisted that the 31-month-old ate only the orange before having the reaction, but oranges rarely cause an allergic reaction to begin with, and when they do, that reaction is usually mild. A press release also notes that the toddler had previously drunk orange juice without issue. Doctors eventually verified an orange was to blame after conducting a skin-prick test, and established she also had a peach allergy. It's the first known case of a severe anaphylactic reaction to the fruit, according to an allergist who points to a protein found in oranges that has a chemical makeup similar to pollen as the likely culprit. The girl was also diagnosed with asthma, which likely worsened the issue; 90 % of kids with asthma also experience allergies.

According to a study presented at the american college of allergy, asthma and immunology ( acaai ) annual scientific meeting, a two and-a-half year-old girl in pennsylvania suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction ( anaphylaxis ) to eating an orange - the first time such a case has been reported in a toddler. \" she ate an orange, and within a few minutes had developed severe anaphylaxis, \" said allergist and acaai member sigrid daveiga, md, study author. \" her lips and tongue swelled, she broke out in hives and couldn't breathe well.

Owens also won gold in the 200-meter dash, the 400 relay, and the long jump, and gave one of his golds to bill \" bojangles \" robinson, who helped the athlete find work in the entertainment field after the games. The ap reports that scp auctions believes the medal could fetch more than $ 1 million; the auction closes saturday and the current bid is $ 172,618. As for the eventual buyer, \" we just hope that it's purchased by an institution where the public could have access to it, a museum or something like that, \" says owens'daughter.",

        "summary": "Authorities in canada investigating the use of a now-discredited drug test have revealed an alarming stat: at least 56 families in ontario were \" broken apart \" from 1990 to 2015 largely as a result of the flawed hair testing, and in only four of those cases were children returned to their families, reports the toronto star. The revelation comes after a two-year investigation into the now-closed motherisk laboratory at the hospital for sick children in toronto. For years, child welfare officials relied on the lab's testing of hair samples to determine whether parents were abusing alcohol or drugs, but those tests have since been declared scientifically unsound. The investigation focused only on the province of ontario, meaning the number of families affected throughout canada is likely much greater, notes the washington post. \"the testing was imposed on people who were among the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society, with scant regard for due process of their rights to privacy and bodily integrity, \" the report by an independent commission states. \" most of the parents who were tested were powerless to resist. They told us that they submitted to the testing under duress, in fear of losing custody of or access to their children. \" the star focuses on the case of one ontario woman whose daughter was taken away in 2011 after a test falsely determined that the mother was drinking heavily. Her 13-year-old daughter finally came home last summer. \" she was so tall, \" says the mother. \" i remember her as a little girl. \"",

But almost 10 years after stephanie lenz posted her young son bopping to prince's \" let's go crazy, \" her video may now appear before the supreme court, consumerist reports. Per a release, the electronic frontier foundation last week petitioned the high court on behalf of lenz to overrule an appeals court decision that gives copyright holders ample leeway in forcing content offline with little to back up that takedown — a form of \" censorship, \" the eff says, that rights holders claim falls under the digital millennium copyright act. In lenz's case, universal music group, which owns the rights to the prince song, informed youtube that lenz's 2007 video was a copyright infringement, and youtube took the video down to avoid a lawsuit. ( consumerist explains third parties can escape liability if they respond to violations in a timely manner. ) but lenz argued her video wasn't for commercial purposes and fell under the \" fair use \" umbrella, and the video was back on youtube six weeks later. Her subsequent lawsuit via eff claimed universal used the dmca in an \" abusive way \" to curb her free expression. The us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled in 2015 that universal should've considered fair use before demanding the video be taken down, but the court also said copyright holders could use subjective criteria to decide, by their own standards, if infringement had taken place — \" no matter how unreasonable that belief, \" per the eff release. It's that part of the court's decision that lenz is hoping gets overturned by the supreme court, with eff legal director corynne mcsherry noting copyright owners who cry infringement \" based on nothing more than an unreasonable hunch, or subjective criteria they simply made up must be held accountable. \" consumerist has the nitty-gritty of the fair-use doctrine.

Underlaid by a bass-heavy beat and heavy on the phrase \" booty poppin ' \" ( which is heard at least 30 times, per wtkr ), the video shows morales and her husband, luis, dancing and rapping throughout the video, with shorter spots featuring their 14-year-old son and young daughters. Her lyrics, per the virginian-pilot, specifically touch upon her physique: \" i ' m summer fine down to my thighs. My stride's right. My abs tight. Let's go for this, right. \" morales tells the pilot the video came about after her son lost a bet with luis, requiring the former to produce an entire song for the latter to perform. \" fast forward, the whole family jumped on the track, \" she wrote on facebook; she and her husband reportedly wrote their own lyrics. But some members of the portsmouth community are perturbed about the video, including \" people's pastor \" barry randall, who wants her recalled from her job. He says morales is setting a bad example \" to display her body in that [ manner ] \" when women are dealing with serious issues like sexual assault. \" she … has every right to pop her booty in her home with her husband, but to do that with a bunch of teenagers who look to her for mentoring … that's a problem, \" he tells wtkr. Morales dismisses his concerns, telling wavy she's promoting a \" positive body image \" and that the video was \" a chronicle of our summer family fun, \" per wtkr.",

        "summary": "And the drone-strike revelations keep coming. A number of us media outlets last night broke their silence about the location of a secret drone base used by the cia to attack al-qaeda in yemen: saudi arabia. And cia director-nominee john brennan's name is all over the reports, just ahead of confirmation hearings tomorrow. As the new york times explains, the counterterror adviser was integral in obtaining the greenlight to establish the base. The base's maiden strike took out anwar al-awlaki in 2011, and it's been since used to target militants on the cia's kill list. And while the pentagon must get an ok from the yemeni government before launching a drone strike, the cia needs no such permission. And here, again, appears brennan's name: he \" plays a role in overseeing all the strikes, \" explains the times, which catalogs five such strikes that have killed at least 24 in 2013. The reports will likely put brennan \" on the defensive \" during his hearings, and will open the door for lawmakers to try to wrest details from the administration about the program, report greg miller and karen deyoung for the washington post. Brennan's nomination \" has drawn the white house into a fight it had sought to avoid, \" they write. As sen. Ron wyden puts it: \" [ brennan ] is the architect of [ the administration's ] counterterrorism policy.

The timing of the leak appeared aimed at intensifying pressure on the white house to disclose more-detailed legal memos that the",
            "Sana, yemen — late last august, a 40-year-old cleric named salem ahmed bin ali jaber stood up to deliver a speech denouncing al qaeda in a village mosque in far eastern yemen. It was a brave gesture by a father of seven who commanded great respect in the community, and it did not go unnoticed. Two days later, three members of al qaeda came to the mosque in the tiny village of khashamir after 9 p.m., saying they merely wanted to talk. Mr. Jaber agreed to meet them, bringing his cousin waleed abdullah, a police officer, for protection. As the five men stood arguing by a cluster of palm trees, a volley of remotely operated american missiles shot down from the night sky and incinerated them all, along with a camel that was tied up nearby. The killing of mr. Jaber, just the kind of leader most crucial to american efforts to eradicate al qaeda, was a reminder of the inherent hazards of the quasi-secret campaign of targeted killings that the united states is waging against suspected militants not just in yemen but also in pakistan and somalia. Individual strikes by the predator and reaper drones are almost never discussed publicly by obama administration officials. But the clandestine war will receive a rare moment of public scrutiny on thursday, when its chief architect, john o. Brennan, the white"

        "summary": "The arctic's current warming trend is the worst it's experienced in at least 44,000 years — and possibly even longer — a new study has concluded. Scientists examining vegetation in the canadian arctic found recently-exposed moss that, based on radiocarbon dating, was between 44,000 and 51,000 years old — meaning the ice surrounding it hadn't melted in at least that long, scientific american reports. \" our study pushes the clock way back, \" says one researcher at the university of colorado. What's more, because radiocarbon dating is only accurate to about 50,000 years, and geological records show a glacial period preceding that, it's probable that current temperatures actually haven't been seen in 120,000 years, the lead researcher tells phys.org. That the ice is melting now, but failed to melt during the extremely warm holocene thermal maximum, is a sign that this isn't natural variance, and is almost surely caused by greenhouse gases, he adds. \" nothing else out there can explain it. \"",

Now, a new study aims to fill the knowledge gap by concluding that recent summer warming in the eastern canadian arctic is unprecedented in more than 44,000 years. Prior research documented melt and temperature dynamics going back about 2,000 to 4,000 years in comparison, said study lead author gifford miller, associate director of the institute of arctic and alpine research at the university of colorado, boulder. The findings, published online in geophysical research letters this week, counter the conclusions of some prior studies suggesting that natural forces -- along with greenhouse gases -- may be contributing to some of the extensive arctic warming. The study also suggests that climate models are underestimating arctic changes, as their past predictions were off by more than 2 degrees celsius. \" our study pushes the clock way back, \" said scott lehman, a research professor at the institute and co-author of the paper.",

Nicholas tartaglione was arrested monday. Tartaglione, 49, of otisville, retired from the briarcliff manor police force on disability in 2008. He rescued dogs and horses on his 65-acre farm and was reported looking for a new job with the mount vernon police department, wcbs 880's alex silverman reported. Tartaglione is accused of killing martin luna, urbano santiago, miguel luna and hector gutierrez. They all disappeared april 11. Surveillance video from that day shows the victims exiting their car outside a chester diner in the same plaza as likquid lounge, a bar owned by tartaglione's brother. Prosecutors believe the former officer murdered the men inside the bar. \"i was appalled, i couldn't believe it, \" said village of chester police department police chief peter graziano jr. \"it's just despicable and heinous you know that a guy who has taken an oath and sworn to protect the people turned around and just because he's no longer a police officer then turns to these kinds of things, whether it's drugs, or money, or murder, \" he added.

Seafood watch, affiliated with the monterey bay aquarium, upgraded the 21 species yesterday to the \" best choice \" or \" good alternative \" categories for eating after improved conservation efforts by fishermen, reports the san diego union-tribune. The area studied by the group had received an \" economic disaster \" designation from the government in 2000 due to overfishing, notes the ap. Before an improved fishery management law was put into effect in 2007, fisherman seeking groundfish — fish that live on or close to the sea bottom — were disrupting the ocean ecosystem by depleting the fish supply and damaging the ocean floor as they swept the waters with their giant nets, according to the los angeles times. Now seafood watch finds that 84 % of the groundfish caught off the west coast qualify for the two best rankings on its list, thanks to more-focused fishing and keeping at-risk habitats intact. \" this is one of the great success stories about ecological and economic recovery of a commercially important fishery, \" the chief of the aquarium's conservation efforts said in a statement.",

Nasa says the asteroid, known as bennu, has a one in 2,700 — or 0.037 % — chance of striking earth in september of that year. While that's not a very good chance — \"please don't print that an asteroid is going to crash into earth, \" a nasa aerospace engineer tells the washington post — that hasn't stopped nasa from putting together a contingency plan: hypervelocity asteroid mitigation mission for emergency response. Details of operation hammer were revealed in a recent study by nasa and the national nuclear security administration published in acta astronautica. One possibility is sending a 9-ton spacecraft to smash into bennu, redirecting it out of earth's orbit. A more likely possibility sees nasa detonating a nuclear device on bennu, armageddon-style. However, there's no current plan for hammer to become a reality. \" we're doing these design studies to prepare ourselves, so if we do find a threatening object, we're better prepared to deal with it, \" the aerospace engineer tells the post.

        "summary": "\" don't risk getting hurt aiding injured wildlife \" was the gentle warning posted on twitter on tuesday by arizona's game and fish department, a warning prompted by an incident this week between a kindhearted motorist and a stubborn owl. The arizona republic expands on the story, which involved a woman who was driving north of tucson just before midnight on monday when she spied a great horned owl on the road that appeared to be injured. The good samaritan picked up the \" essentially motionless \" owl, per game and fish rep mark hart, and placed it in her car so she could bring it somewhere for help. As she was driving, however, the \" dazed \" owl suddenly became much more clearheaded. The owl then proceeded to dig its talons into the steering wheel and the woman's sleeve and not let go, as hart tells it. Trapped in the car with her determined passenger, the woman called her mother, who called game and fish, which advised the motorist to throw some water on the bird. She did, but the tenacious owl simply slurped up the water and continued latching on. The owl finally loosened its grip of its own accord and bounded out of the car, seeming perfectly fine — and was spotted the next day in the same area by the woman's mom, hart says. Although game and fish concedes it's \" human nature \" to want to help wildlife in distress, it advises \" would-be good samaritans \" not to do so. \" she's fortunate she wasn't hurt, \" hart says of the woman.

After najee rivera was given a beating that left him with a fractured bone in his face and one eye swollen shut, girlfriend dina scannapieco canvassed businesses in the area and found security footage that led to rivera's exoneration on charges of assault and resisting arrest and to the arrest of the two officers involved, the philadelphia inquirer reports. Officers kevin robinson and sean mcknight claimed rivera, 23, had fallen off his scooter and then attacked them, but the video shows that their account was almost entirely false, the district attorney says. In the may 2013 incident, rivera did fall off his scooter — after one of the officers reached out of the patrol car and clubbed him in the head with a baton, the da says. The video then shows the pair beating rivera with fists and batons against a wall and then on the ground. He shows no sign of resistance and can be heard screaming for help. Rivera told a grand jury that minutes before the beating, the pair had pulled him over, but he became frightened and sped off when they emerged from their car with batons extended, saying, \" come here. \" the grand jury recommended charges including criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, and tampering with public records for the officers, who were arraigned yesterday, the los angeles times reports.",

A philadelphia grand jury decided to charge officers sean mcknight and kevin robinson after the district attorney presented evidence. The use of prosecutor-led grand juries met deep scrutiny across the country last year after several high-profile investigations resulted in no charges for officers involved in the deaths of suspects in ferguson, mo., and new york city. In philadelphia, charges came after the surprise emergence of a surveillance video that shows two officers pummeling a scooter rider. The scene appeared to contradict the officers ' original account of the incident, in which they had portrayed the suspect, najee rivera, as a violent and vicious attacker. \"the video undermined every aspect of the officers ' account of the incident, \" philadelphia dist. Atty. Seth williams said at a televised news conference thursday, appearing alongside police commissioner charles h. Ramsey. \" as a grand jury found, none of it was true -- except for the blows inflicted on najee rivera. \" on may 29, 2013, mcknight and kevin tried to pull over rivera, who was riding a scooter.

The scene appeared to contradict the officers ' original account of the incident, in which they had portrayed the suspect, najee rivera, as a violent and vicious attacker. \"the video undermined every aspect of the officers ' account of the incident, \" philadelphia dist. Atty. Seth williams said at a televised news conference thursday, appearing alongside police commissioner charles h. Ramsey. \" as a grand jury found, none of it was true -- except for the blows inflicted on najee rivera. \" on may 29, 2013, mcknight and kevin tried to pull over rivera, who was riding a scooter. Rivera told the grand jury that he became frightened and sped away after the officers got out of their car with their batons extended",

( handout photos ) philadelphia police officers kevin robinson( top ) and sean mcknight ( bottom ) have been charged with the assault of najee rivera( right ). ( handout photos ) the day after najee rivera was arrested a year and a half ago, his girlfriend went to north philadelphia's 25th police district and saw his bloodied and broken face - his orbital bone fractured, an eye swollen shut, his face sewn up with stitches and staples. Sitting next to him thursday night, dina scannapieco of south philadelphia said she had asked the dazed, 23-year-old rivera where he had been arrested. \" as soon as i picked him up, we went right over there, \" scannapieco said. He was in a hospital gown covered in blood. Eventually the couple made it to the 2700 block of north sixth street, where he had been arrested the night before - and where two officers were saying rivera had thrown one of them into a brick wall. The two, she said, saw where he was arrested. \" you seen all his blood all over the pavement, \" she said. It was an aftermath of an arrest on may 29, 2013, that was allegedly so"

        "summary": "In an essay at time, cathy young takes issue with those in the \" feminist camp \" who are arguing so strongly that woody allen must be guilty of molesting daughter dylan farrow. The problem is that they're convicting him based on principle rather than on fact, writes young. Women don't make up allegations like this, goes their thinking, and therefore to side with allen is to dishonor all victims of sexual abuse. Young finds it \" appalling \" that so many feminists — she takes particular umbrage with jessica valenti at the nation — dismiss out of hand the particulars of the allen-farrow case that raise questions about his guilt. Young isn't necessarily making the case for allen's innocence, but she's worried that the he-must-be-guilty message will filter into our legal system and into \" our conversation on gender. \" she also equates the \" stand with dylan \" movement to the misguided notions that led to bogus sex-abuse scares in the 1980s and ' 90s. \" perhaps we still haven't learned the larger lesson, \" she concludes. \" a movement that demands belief in one person's accusations against another as a matter of faith, not fact, is not a movement for justice.

Some highlights: petraeus: obama again praised the general for his \" extraordinary career \" but said petraeus fell short of his own personal standards. Asked whether classified information had leaked, obama said he was not aware of any and deferred to the ongoing fbi investigation. \"i have no evidence at this point from what i've seen that classified information was disclosed that would have in any way have had an impact on our national security. \" fiscal cliff: he reiterated that he is \" open to compromise \" but again insisted that tax cuts should not be extended for those making more than $ 250,000 a year. At the same time, he wants congress to immediately pass a bill extending the cuts for those who make less. \"we should not hold the middle class hostage while we debate tax cuts on the wealthy, \" he said, declaring that he had a \" mandate \" on the issue, notes slate. Later, of the looming deadline: \" i believe this is solvable.

Susan rice: he also issued a strong defense of his un ambassador ( and secretary of state contender ), who has come under republican criticism for her initial public response to the benghazi attack. If john mccain \" and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me, \" he said. \"i don't think there's any debate in this country that when you have four americans killed that's a problem.... But when they go after the un ambassador, apparently because they think she's an easy target, then they've got a problem with me. \" climate change: obama said his administration didn't do enough in his first term and pledged to start a \" national conversation \" in his second. Immigration reform: he said work on legislation should start immediately, adding that the heavy latino turnout in the election should \" cause some reflection on the part of republicans, \" reports the new york times.

        "summary": "California has a sex-ed law on the books that bans schools from pushing abstinence alone in teaching about pregnancy and std prevention, and a fresno county judge has now enforced that law, the san francisco chronicle reports. Superior court judge donald black's decision ruled that the clovis unified school district — located in an area deemed a \" hot spot \" for some of the highest teen pregnancy and std rates in california — went against state law. Black also mandated that sex education has to be \" complete, medically accurate, and free of bias \" and include info on all kinds of birth control, std and hiv/aids prevention, gender roles, and sexual orientation, the guardian reports. \" teens deserve complete, accurate health information, \" says the aclu, which calls the ruling a \" huge victory for students. \" the ruling comes after parents — with support from the american academy of pediatrics, the aclu, and the gay-straight alliance — filed a lawsuit in 2012 claiming clovis students weren't taught about various methods of birth control and were mainly informed about abstinence and hetero lifestyles, per the guardian. One video the students watched told them to \" adopt the mantra ' one man, one woman, one life, ' \" while another video compared a woman who wasn't a virgin to a \" dirty, used pair of shoes \" who could give someone foot fungus, the suit alleged. The judge's ruling seems to be in line with what the nation believes: a january yougov/huffington post survey showed that 66 % of the 1,000 adults surveyed believe teens \" should be taught about various methods of birth control. \" ( at a texas school with an \" abstinence-only \" program, this happened. )",

        "summary": "What would have been the first execution since the botched lethal injection of an oklahoma inmate last month has been called off with a last-minute stay issued by supreme court justice samuel alito. Missouri inmate rusty bucklew suffers from a birth defect called cavernous hemangioma that causes unstable tumors in his head and neck, which his lawyers argue could cause a \" prolonged and excruciating execution, \" cnn reports. Alito issued the stay less than two hours before the execution, but missouri could still execute bucklew before midnight tonight if the full supreme court rejects his appeal, reports the ap. Lawyers for bucklew — who shot a man dead in front of his two young sons in 1996 before kidnapping and raping his ex-girlfriend — argue that both his condition and the secrecy surrounding the state's lethal-injection drugs increase the risk of something going wrong. \" i ' m sick about it not working on me, \" bucklew told the guardian earlier this month. \" i ' m afraid that it's going to turn me into a vegetable, that i'd be brain dead. You saw what happened down in oklahoma, \" he said. \" i ' m the next guy up — am i gonna get all screwed up here? are they gonna screw it up? \"",

The main reason, as cited by mashable: dodging emissions cuts now \" means steeper reductions will be required at a later date to reach a given temperature target. \" the report comes ahead of a coal-focused epa proposal to slash carbon dioxide emissions by 30 % by 2030; that plan, which could shut hundreds of coal-powered plants, faces scrutiny this week vis-a-vis hearings across the country.

Fourteen states have legalized same-sex marriage, and a majority of americans believe gay couples should have the right to wed. Advocates still face long odds in getting the legislation to president obama's desk. House speaker john a. Boehner ( ohio ), who leads a gop caucus dominated by social conservatives, reiterated his opposition to the measure monday and said he would not bring it to the house floor regardless of its fate in the senate. But even in the face of obstacles, advocates say the debate has changed radically in their favor. They note that most opponents, including boehner, have focused their concerns on allegations that the legislation would benefit trial lawyers and have shied away from the morality and family-values questions that once dominated the issue. \"there's been a softer tone, and there's been a recognition that anti-gay politics that may have worked in 2000 and in 2004 don't work anymore, \" said jeff cook-mccormac, senior adviser to the american unity fund, a pro-gay-rights group funded by republican mega-donors.

        "summary": "Hurricane irma has made things a lot tougher for florida citrus growers already reeling from the impact of a disease that has cut harvests by 70 % since 2005. The state's eastern seaboard is perhaps the best grapefruit-growing zone in the world, and growers estimate that this year's harvest will be down around 35 % from last year, which was the smallest harvest in at least 50 years, usa today reports. Citrus greening disease, which turns the fruit bitter, has hit the grapefruit crop especially hard. Orange growers statewide, meanwhile, believe the storm, which knocked vast amounts of young fruit from the trees, will cut harvests by at least a third — and with groves flooded, not much of the dropped fruit can be recovered for juice. \" we've had many hurricanes, we've had freezes, but this one is widespread, \" harold browning of the citrus research and development foundation tells the ap. \" we're seeing the kind of damage we haven't seen, ever. \" growers say root rot sets in after citrus trees are underwater for more than 72 hours and they have been struggling to get water out of flooded groves. Florida fruit and vegetable association spokeswoman lisa lochridge says losses of other crops are up to 70 % in some parts of the state, meaning prices may go up around the country this winter. She says this fall's tomato crop will be very light, though strawberry growers are expecting a fast recovery.",

The china-born, us-trained scientist once confided to his former stanford university adviser his interest in gene-edited babies. He told the ap last month that he had been working on the experiment for more than two years — a period in which, by his own account, he concealed information from some medical staff involved in the research, as well as apparently from his own bosses. He took advantage of the loosely worded and irregularly enforced regulations and generous funding available today in china, in some cases skirting even local protocols and possibly laws. On the eve of an international gene-editing summit in hong kong this week, the 34-year-old scientist stunned the world by claiming he had used the powerful crispr gene-editing tool to alter the dna of twin girls born earlier this month. His claim could not be independently confirmed, and it has not been published in a journal, but it drew swift outrage from both researchers and regulators. China's state broadcaster, cctv, reported tuesday that he may be investigated by the ministry of science and technology, if the births are confirmed. Meanwhile, the ap has much more on he, who initially followed a common path for scientists of his generation. But his career trajectory did not follow the expected script.

Instead, dea agents, who asked to search rivers ' bags during a stop in new mexico, seized his life savings still in a bank envelope, suspecting a link to drugs. The 22-year-old, who agreed to the search, told agents he was an aspiring producer and hoped to avoid difficulties withdrawing funds from an out-of-state bank, which his mom confirmed \" nearly word for word \" over the phone, rivers writes on a gofundme page. But he never saw the money again. He's now fighting the seizure agents justified under civil forfeiture laws, which require only a sliver of suspicion that a person is linked to a crime — rather than an arrest or charge. \" we don't have to prove that the person is guilty, \" a dea agent puts it to the albuquerque journal. \" it's that the money is presumed to be guilty. \" in other words, civil forfeiture is legalized theft, argues rivers ' lawyer. Rivers, who is back in michigan thanks to a generous passenger, says he told agents \" i had no money and no means to survive in los angeles if they took my money. They informed me that it was my responsibility to figure out how i was going to do that. \" though agents questioned other train passengers, rivers was the only person searched, which he suspects was because he's black. The dea denies that claim, noting agents look for \" indicators, \" like a pricey one-way ticket paid for in cash or a destination that's considered a hub for drug activity. Had rivers refused the search, agents could have held his bags until they procured a warrant. Still, \" the takeaway from this story: never consent to a warrantless search, \" notes boing boing.

The incident is believed to be the first time anybody has ever been shot and killed by police in iceland, where gun ownership is not uncommon among the population of 322,000 but police do not carry firearms, the bbc reports. Police say they were called to the man's reykjavik apartment after he fired a shotgun inside. After he failed to respond to attempts to contact him, they fired tear gas through the windows. He was shot dead when he fired at police trying to enter the apartment, injuring two officers. \" all available members of the police force were deployed, and they tried to subdue him, but it was not successful, \" the city's police commissioner says, extending his condolences to the man's family. \" the man began to shoot out the window of the apartment and it was decided to take action. \" iceland ranks 15th in the world for gun ownership per capita, with 30.3 firearms per 100 people — the us is first with 101.05 firearms per 100 people — but ownership is strictly controlled and most people who own guns use them for hunting or sport, npr finds. There were four recorded gun-related deaths in the country in 2009; that's 31,343 fewer than the us saw.",

Its 1998 guidance recommended that \" parents be encouraged and assisted in developing methods other than spanking in response to undesired behavior. \" its new guidance, in the form of a policy statement published in the journal pediatrics monday, more explicitly directs parents not to spank or yell at their kids. Specifically, caregivers are encouraged to use \" healthy forms of discipline, \" including positive reinforcement and setting limits and expectations, rather than any form of corporal punishment or yelling at children. In the intervening 20 years, an author of the policy statement explains, research has shown a host of negative effects that can be associated with spanking. The statement notes that spanking has been found to be ineffective and can actually make behavior worse, nbc news reports. The news made waves on twitter, where some were not happy at being told how to raise their kids. \" not on this momma's watch, \" reads one sample response. But, another pointed out, \" clicking on the american academy of pediatrics trending topic shows a steady stream of people mad because they think aap said spanking was bad. Actually, what aap mostly said was that it doesn't work. \" specifically, the new policy statement says corporal punishment can be correlated with aggression, depression, and even less gray matter in kids ' brains, cnn reports.

The uss san diego got there fast: the armored cruiser listed and sank within 30 minutes of an explosion off the coast of long island on july 19, 1918, leaving six sailors dead, per npr. But the cause was slow to surface, though researchers at the naval surface warfare center think they've now solved the puzzle. Dives at the upside-down wreck south of fire island — combined with a sonar scan, computer modeling, and crew accounts — revealed that an attack from outside the ship, rather than sabotage or an accidental coal-dust explosion, was the most likely scenario. However, the damage inflicted wasn't so severe as to suggest a torpedo attack, reports live science. And none of the ship's 17 lookouts reported a torpedo's bubble trail. That left much to draw from charts showing german submarine u-156 off long island at the time, per npr. \" we believe u-156 sunk san diego, and we believe it used a mine to do so, \" maritime archaeologist alexis catsambis announced monday at the annual meeting of the american geophysical union in washington, dc. According to engineer ken nahshon, either a mine was laid via u-156's torpedo tube or unloaded from its deck. Researchers say it's comforting to know crew members weren't to blame for the san diego's sinking, which the ship's captain tried hard to prevent, reports newsday. Those responsible would ultimately suffer. U-156 sank after hitting a us minefield in the north atlantic, per live science.

This month's full moon, known as the full cold moon, peaks this morning, but will shine bright all night. The moon then reaches perigee — its closest point to earth in a given orbit — early monday ( dec. 4 ) at 3: 45 a.m. Est ( 2045 gmt ). Because the moon reaches perigee so close to the full moon, it's considered a supermoon — a full or near-full moon that can appear slightly larger in the sky than usual.

While the moon's average distance from earth is 238,000 miles ( 382,900 kilometers ), its orbit isn't perfectly circular, so that distance varies a small amount. On monday, when the moon reaches perigee, it will be 222,135 miles ( 357,492 km ) away from earth. It will reach apogee — its farthest distance from earth in a given orbit — on dec. 19 at 8: 25 p.m. Est ( 0125 gmt on dec. 20 ) — when it will be 252,651 miles ( 406,603 km ) away."

            "Image copyright danny lawson image caption the \" supermoon \" rising above whitby abbey in yorkshire. Skywatchers have enjoyed spectacular views of this month's \" supermoon \" - when the moon appears larger and brighter in the sky. The supermoon phenomenon happens when the moon reaches its closest point to earth, known as a perigee moon. The moon circuits the earth in an elliptical or oval orbit - a supermoon occurs when the perigee moon is also a full moon. The supermoon was the last opportunity to see one in 2017. Image copyright sean quinn image caption the moon loomed above yeadon, in leeds to observers, the moon appears about 7 % larger and 15 % brighter, although the difference is barely noticeable to the human eye. Last year the moon made its closest approach to earth since 1948 - it will not be that close again until 25 november 2034. Nasa has called this weekend's sighting the first in a \" supermoon trilogy \" over the next two months, with others to come on 1 january and 31 january. December's full moon is traditionally known as the cold moon. The full moon on sunday afternoon - when it sits opposite the sun in the sky - was 222,761 miles from earth, closer than its average 238,900 miles.

        "summary": "All of nearly 1,800 glaciers on an island in canada's high arctic have shrunk since the turn of the century, with three-quarters of them seeing a significant loss, according to a new study warning many could be on their last legs. Three small ice caps disappeared altogether between 1999 and 2015, according to satellite imagery and ground surveys, and others look like they're headed on that same path. \" they all retreated. Nothing is growing, \" says university of ottawa glaciologist adrienne white, who spent seven field seasons on ellesmere island, off the northwest coast of greenland. \" there were some areas i couldn't recognize between years, \" she adds, per the canadian press, describing ice shelves transformed into \" a city of icebergs. \" ice shelves lost 42 % of their size. Overall, the glaciers shrank by more than 650 square miles, or 6 %, over the study period. A previous study of glaciers in the area, excluding ice shelves, uncovered a loss of 360 square miles between 1959 and 2000, \" hinting that the pace of loss may be increasing, \" reports the guardian. It's no surprise why: since 1948, the region's annual average temperature has increased by 3.6 degrees celsius. Until 1995, the average temperature climbed about 0.12 degrees per decade. But from 1995 to 2016, it rose 0.78 degrees per decade, says white, whose research appears in the journal of glaciology. As it's too warm for yearlong snow, ice expansion is out of the question, leaving ecosystems at risk. \" when these glaciers break away... There's nothing holding back these ecosystems that have been growing and developing for thousands of years, \" white tells the guardian. \" they're gone before we even have the chance to study them. \" ( experts say this glacier should concern us all. )",

Romney — who calls on welfare recipients to experience the \" dignity of work \" — is talking about moms, writes ezra klein at the washington post. In romney's view, then, parenting \" does not give poor mothers'the dignity of work. ' \" adds matthew yglesias at slate: \" the phrase'the dignity of work ' is extremely condescending and ignores precisely the point the romney camp was trying to make about ann romney — unpaid household work is still work and it's still hard. \" on top of all that, in 1994, romney pointed out that the world had changed since the 1960s: \" now mom and dad both have to work, \" buzzfeed notes.",

            "Palm beach, fla. — mitt romney went well beyond his standard stump speech at a closed-door fundraiser on sunday evening, and offered some of the most specific details to date about the policies he would pursue if elected. Karen bleier / afp - getty images gop presidential hopeful mitt romney floated the idea of eliminating the department of housing and urban development, the cabinet-level agency once led by the candidate's father. In a speech to donors in the backyard of a private home here, the former massachusetts governor and presumptive gop presidential nominee outlined his plans to potentially eliminate or consolidate federal agencies, win back latino voters and reform the nation's tax code. And even ann romney, the subject of a national debate last week over the role of women in the workplace, was more direct than usual. She sounded like a political tactician when she described a democratic consultant's criticism of her decision to be a stay-at-home mom as \" an early birthday gift. \" romney went into a level of detail not usually seen by the public in the speech, which was overheard by reporters on a sidewalk",
