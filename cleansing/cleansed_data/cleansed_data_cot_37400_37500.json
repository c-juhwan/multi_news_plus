Then he'd look out to the ocean and to the farallon islands two dozen miles away. \" little did i know that george's ship was out there, \" he tells the san francisco chronicle. Almost exactly 95 years after the navy tugboat set out for pearl harbor shortly before winds hit 40mph, \" one of the great unsolved mysteries in navy history \" has been solved. On wednesday, scientists confirmed a wreck found near the farallones last fall was the missing conestoga, which sunk with 56 crewmen on board, including chief petty officer george kaler, who was in charge of the vessel's engine. Confusion surrounded the lost vessel from the beginning. The navy only realized it was missing a month after its departure, then searched near hawaii, though a life preserver and us navy materials were discovered on the california coast. A lifeboat marked with a \" c \" was found off manzanillo, mexico, two months later, per the ap. Finally in october, archaeologists found a wreck near the farallones and confirmed it was the conestoga, based on the location and number of port holes, a 50-caliber gun on the main deck, and two porcelain marine heads, per a release. Experts say the ship might have sunk after a wave flooded the engine room. \" i knew george must have stood by his post, stood by his shipmates, tried to get that engine going, \" hess says. \" we always talked about george and wondered what happened, \" he adds. \" now we know. It's closure. \" ( the ship of a famous explorer has been found, too. )",

After starring together in crazy stupid love and gangster squad, they're wowing audiences in damien chazelle's musical la la land, which has a 95 % approval rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying: \" a crowd-pleaser if ever there was one, \" la la land \" does what the movies have all but forgotten how to do — sweep us up into a dream, \" writes joe morgenstern at the wall street journal. He says stone and gosling are \" perfection from start to finish \" as viewers are treated to \" exuberant dance, lovely music, exquisite lighting and fantastical colors, and a succession of tender, funny or heart-stopping encounters. \" \" hollywood doesn't make these kinds of movies anymore, \" and that's a shame, writes mara reinstein at us weekly. She agrees stone and gosling are \" absolutely dazzling \" with chemistry that \" takes on magical proportions. \" but \" stone, in particular, is a revelation \" and \" lights up the screen. \" overall, the film is one of those rare ones with \" the sheer power to make audiences laugh, weep and feel as if they can float on air. \" james berardinelli describes la la land as \" a fairy tale \" with \" a realistic edge. \" there are \" moments of unabashed euphoria but it's never saccharine. That's the key to its appeal — it allows us to dance with the characters but never feels manipulative, \" he writes at reel views. \" more vibrant than chicago \" and \" more heartfelt than les miserables, \" it's \" the best made-for-the-screen musical to reach theaters in a very long time. \" peter travers goes a step further. Simply put, it's \" sheer perfection \" and \" the movie of the year, \" he writes at rolling stone. The opening scene is \" headed for the cinematic time capsule, \" but \" the passion for cinema and its possibilities radiates from every frame, \" he says. \" you leave exhilarated by chazelle's nonstop inventiveness, dazzled by the performances of emma stone and ryan gosling … and thrilled that they figured out how to make movies magic again. \"",

Trump on monday showed no sign of retreating from this tack, taking to twitter to reaffirm his belief in his original immigration strategy. \" people, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but i am calling it what we need and what it is, a travel ban! \" he tweeted. He also said the justice department should be pushing for a \" much tougher version \" of the ban, not the \" watered down, politically correct \" version that was put before the supreme court. \" in any event, we are extreme vetting people coming into the u.s.

The government set baited hooks near seven beaches in west australia and caught 172 sharks from january to april, when the program ended. It killed the 50 biggest ones, mostly tiger sharks about 10 feet or longer, and released the rest, reports the australian. \" i think the strategy's gone very well, bearing in mind that it's a very broad strategy, and that's basically to protect those people that swim in those popular areas, \" says a government fisheries official. The feds want to extend the program, put into place after great whites killed six swimmers, for another three years. But critics are pouncing on the obvious: \" so we know that the great white shark is the shark that has been implicated in fatalities off our coast, and no great white sharks were captured on the drum lines in this whole program, \" says a member of the opposition greens party.",

Harvard currently provides full tuition support to all ph.d. Students and some master's students, giving roughly $ 45,000 per year to each student, though that amount decreases to roughly $ 12,000 after the first two years of a ph.d program. Depending on how the house proposal is interpreted, these tuition grants could be counted along with graduate students'stipends as taxable income, a change which would push students into a higher tax bracket.

The americans were ordered out and onto the ground, he said. On sunday, he gave a slightly different version of events, saying their taxi was pulled over by the robbers. Lochte also initially said a man put a gun to his forehead, though he now says it was pointed in his general direction. Lochte strongly rejected suggestions that the story had been fabricated. \" i wouldn't make up a story like this nor would the others — as a matter of fact we all feel it makes us look bad, \" he said, as quoted by lauer.

President dilma rousseff is facing impeachment over one scandal, and she just made an audacious move in an apparent attempt to shield former president luiz inacio lula da silva from prosecution in a different scandal. To catch up: the bbc has a primer here, including rousseff's latest big move. She appointed \" lula \" as her chief of staff, which puts him, as a cabinet member, out of the prosecutorial reach of all but the nation's supreme court. The wall street journal floats another theory: \" analysts believe he is effectively replacing ms. Rousseff in all but name, filling the role of a kind of unofficial prime minister \" and essentially priming himself for another run at the presidency in 2018. Meanwhile, a judge released phone recordings between the two that suggest rousseff was concerned with helping lula avoid arrest. And thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets wednesday. The ap has details. As for the scandals, lula is accused of taking kickbacks from energy giant petrobras, allegations uncovered in operation car wash. See the atlantic. Rousseff is accused of illegally borrowing money from state banks to cover budget shortfalls — shortfalls that may have been caused by that petrobras scandal. See the bbc.

India's muslims follow the controversial \" triple talaq \" law, which allows husbands to divorce their wives by merely uttering the word — or writing it, or texting it, or even skyping it — three times. The practice is banned in much of the islamic world, reports the bbc, and now india's supreme court is deciding whether it is unconstitutional, based on shayara's case. \" muslim women have their hands tied while the guillotine of divorce dangles, perpetually ready to drop at the whims of their husbands, who enjoy undisputed power, \" says shayara in her petition to the court. She also wants it to outlaw polygamy as well as a practice called halala, in which a woman who wishes to remarry her divorced husband must for some reason marry a second man first, reports india today. Shayara is under pressure from local islamic leaders to drop the case, but she has no intention to do so. If she succeeds in having her divorce declared illegal, shayara also has no intention of going back to her husband, reports indian express. She will instead seek divorce through legal channels.

They \" need and deserve help. \" war: king famously spoke out against the vietnam war and the us support of \" corrupt \" and \" inept \" governments. And yet here we are propping up hamid karzai, writes bob herbert in the new york times. \" dr. King would be assassinated exactly one year ( almost to the hour ) after his great speech at riverside church.

            "Yesterday, as alex pareene noted, south carolina republican state sen. Jake knotts gave us an unusually frank rendition. Of his party's front-running gubernatorial candidate, state rep. Nikki haley, knotts said, \" we already got one raghead in the white house. We don't need a raghead in the governor's mansion. \" haley immigrated to the united states as a child from india. She is a convert to methodism, from sikhism. You know the pattern. Since the 2008 campaign, every few weeks or months some minor political figure in the gop utters something scandalously racist about the president. The republican party distances itself from the comments. Democrats mutter about how the conservative movement is riddled with troglodytes. Nobody gets anywhere. Sikhs are, of course, not muslims. Hailing from what is now the border area between pakistan and india, sikhism bears some similarities to islam and hinduism both, but is not a sect of either. To lump it in with islam makes about as much sense as an insult as calling a christian a kike. Same geographical origin, very rough theological similarities — close enough, right? anyway, despite the crude literalism of the slur — like many muslims, orthodox sikh men wear turbans — it's fairly clear from the thrust of the insult that knotts thought"

            "U.s. Government scientists were worried that the trump administration would take down federal websites with research and data on climate change, and they took steps accordingly. But it turns out federal agencies under trump have removed or made inaccessible data on all sorts of topics, from resources on housing discrimination to reports on animal welfare abuses and workplace safety violations, the washington post reports. The trump white house has also declined to publish ethics waivers granted to appointees, making it hard to know which officials have, for example, recently lobbied on issues they now oversee in government. The trump administration has removed thousands of massive data sets used by companies, researchers, and others — in january, there were 195,245 public data sets at www.data.gov, while there are now fewer than 156,000 data sets. Some of them were likely removed because they were outdated or consolidated with other data sets, the washington post says, but \" the reduction was clearly a conscious decision. \" other data taken down from federal websites include regulatory enforcement actions, like fined abuses at dog and horse breeding operations and workplace injuries cited by the occupational health and safety administration. The barack obama and george w. Bush administrations had regularly publicized fines levied against companies to encourage workplace safety, but business groups opposed such \" naming and shaming \" disclosures."

Forman also earned an oscar nomination for the people vs. Larry flynt and won acclaim with another american biopic, man on the moon, about andy kaufman. Both of forman's parents died in nazi concentration camps during world war ii, and he wound up being raised by relatives before entering the prague film academy. \" though he blossomed in exile in 1970s america, his memory of totalitarianism would forever be his muse, \" writes gina piccalo at the los angeles times. The hollywood reporter describes forman as an \" anti-authoritarian \" director, noting that his 1967 film the fireman's ball got him into trouble with communist leaders in his then home of czechoslovakia. He achieved international acclaim with the 1975 cuckoo's nest, starring jack nicholson and set inside a mental institution. The film won five major oscars, for best picture, director, actor, actress, and adapted screenplay. About a decade later, forman again scored academy award success with amadeus. The film about mozart earned 11 nominations and eight oscars, including director and best picture. Forman became an american citizen in 1975.",

Five 3-foot-long specimens found in a lagoon full of rotting wood in the philippines were collected by researchers who spotted the distinctive long shells in a youtube video of a local news report. \" it's sort of the unicorn of mollusks, \" university of utah marine biologist margo haygood tells the washington post. Haygood and the rest of her team describe the \" rare and enigmatic \" species in a study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, which contains a video of its dissection. Researchers say they were surprised to discover that the long creatures, which burrow in marine sediment, have relatively tiny digestive systems packed with microbes that help them digest sulfur compounds. \" it's not feeding in any normal way, \" says haygood. They were also surprised by the bivalve's unusual color: gunmetal black, with a pink appendage. Simon watt, president of the ugly animal preservation society, applauded the discovery. \" it might well be monstrous, but that does not mean that it isn't marvelous, \" he tells the guardian, noting that its environment is also \" pretty disgusting. \" \" if you are down living among murky dirt, then aesthetics are surely not your number one priority, \" he says.

            "Significance certain marine invertebrates harbor chemosynthetic bacterial symbionts, giving them the remarkable ability to consume inorganic chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide ( h 2 s ) rather than organic matter as food. These chemosynthetic animals are found near geochemical ( e.g., hydrothermal vents ) or biological ( e.g., decaying wood or large animal carcasses ) sources of h 2 s on the seafloor. Although many such symbioses have been discovered, little is known about how or where they originated. Here, we demonstrate a new chemosynthetic symbiosis in the giant teredinid bivalve ( shipworm ) kuphus polythalamia and show that this symbiosis arose in a wood-eating ancestor via the displacement of ancestral cellulolytic symbionts by sulfur-oxidizing invaders. Here, wood served as an evolutionary stepping stone for a dramatic transition from heterotrophy to chemoautotrophy. Abstract the \"wooden-steps \" hypothesis [ distel dl, et al. ( 2000 ) nature 403: 725 – 726 ] proposed that large chemosynthetic mussels found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents descend from much smaller species associated"

The new figure has nothing to do with shifting plates or melting glaciers, it's simply the result of a more sophisticated radar mapping system used by alaska and the us geological society. The earlier measurement of mckinley, also known as denali, took place in 1952. \" it's still high, it's still hard, it's still cold, \" a climber tells the anchorage daily news, which notes that mckinley is still 686 feet higher than the continent's no. 2 peak, mount logan in canada. Not everyone's on board just yet, however. The us park service, which runs denali national park, says it won't start changing the height on hats, t-shirts, and the like until its own experts examine the new data.

            "Mount mckinley's perch as the tallest mountain in north america just got a little less comfortable. New data collected by a government mapping project has sliced 83 feet from the summit of the continent's tallest peak, taking it from 20,320 feet to 20,237, lt. Gov. Mead treadwell announced wednesday. Climbers can relax -- that's still 686 feet taller than canada's mount logan, the second-tallest peak in north america. \" it's still high, it's still hard, it's still cold, \" said nick parker, a climber and employee at alaska mountaineering and hiking who said he has summitted denali several times. \" as long as it's higher than texas, i don't care. \" treadwell revealed the revisions at a symposium of the international map collectors'society in fairbanks this week, according to a statement issued by his office. The new height comes from radar measurements that were part of a state and federal mapping effort, the statement said. The 20,320-foot measurement was fixed in the 1950s, and a subsequent survey in 1989 actually lopped off 14 feet, bringing the most recent measurement to 20,306. Nonetheless, treadwell compared the new number to the earlier benchmark, since it's still the most commonly cited, said michelle toohey, treadwell's chief of staff. The new height has been accepted by the u.s. Geological survey and is now part of its national elevation dataset, said geographer becci anderson. But kris fister, a spokeswoman for denali national park and preserve, said that the u.s. Park service is still examining the new data and is not making any changes yet. She said park service staffers had found some \" discrepancies. \" \" we ' ll go through the review process and make sure that some of the bugs are worked out, \" she said -- though she did acknowledge the likelihood that \" the t-shirts, and hats, and patches are going to be collectors ' items. \" treadwell made the announcement one day before kicking off his campaign for u.s. Senate seat, and tom heinrichs, a program director at the university of alaska fairbanks and a member of the mapping project's executive oversight group, said he thought the news should have been broken jointly by all the project's participants.

Booth, who still struggles to speak, managed to croak out \" i want taco bell. \" \" that was the very first thing he said. \" his brother jason schwartz tells usa today. It would be 22 days before booth was medically ready to have his request granted. But finally the big day arrived. For his first actual meal in 70 days, booth wolfed down eight and a half crunchy tacos from taco bell. \"we'd all been waiting an entire month for him to eat those tacos, \" schwartz tells usa today. \"it was symbolic of the entire thing — more of a metaphor of him having woken up and being given a second chance at life. \" booth's friend tyler chronister snapped an amazing photo and shared it on reddit with the message: \" i have never seen true happiness until now. \" booth may have gotten his tacos, but he still has a long recovery ahead.

According to nbc news, koza blames shkreli for \" permitting at least three of the nine wu-tang clan portraits to be displayed to the public in a news article, \" referring to a story in vice. Koza is also suing the wu-tang's rza, an auction house, and a wu-tang producer.

The two have gone back and forth online ever since ghostface expressed his unhappiness at the fact that shkreli was shaolin's buyer, and skhreli recently threatened to erase ghostface \" from the record books of rap, \" said he'd like to \" smack him right in the face, \" and demanded an apology for ghostface's insults. On tuesday, ghostface released a video calling shkreli a \" fake peter pan cat \" and a \" soft killer \" for hiking drug prices.

The euro and asian markets rose after the announcement of the latest deal on the three-year-old crisis, which will cut the rates on bailout loans, allow athens to suspend interest payments for a decade, and give the country more time to repay, bloomberg reports. The deal will allow the release of $ 44 billion in bailout funds next month to allow the greek government to continue functioning.

That state was louisiana. I cannot confirm whether the derogatory language was aimed at particular individuals or, indeed, at the government. I can confirm that the next most abusively tweeting state was nevada at 929 tweets per 100,000. The home of freewheeling behavior was closely followed by texas, maryland, delaware, ohio and california.

Louis woman who says she was simply \" respecting mike brown \" is blind in her left eye and can't see well out of her right eye after a police officer shot a round of beanbags at the car she was riding in, kmov reports. Dornnella conner says she and boyfriend de ' angelas lee were trying to leave a ferguson gas station where protests were taking place tuesday morning when cops pulled up. Conner says they were \" blocked \" in and that lee was just trying to get around one of the squad cars when an officer blasted a round of beanbags, smashing the front passenger window and injuring conner. Another police officer on the scene helped conner get medical attention, while lee drove away. \" i didn't have any weapons. I wasn't looting or anything, \" conner tells the tv station. \" i was just out with my boyfriend and we was just riding around just respecting mike brown. \" police dispute her account, saying that lee drove directly toward them ( not around them ), and that the officer who shot the beanbags feared for his own safety; an arrest warrant for lee has been issued with a $ 50,000 bond. Meanwhile, conner's father, donnell, wants to know how anyone could seriously think his daughter could have been a threat that warranted that type of police action. \" i ' m very upset, very disappointed with the tactics that they used, \" he tells kmov. \" i understand they have a tough job, i understand that it was chaos. … but how can a pregnant person, in a car in a seat belt, be causing chaos? \" conner herself yesterday posted on facebook, \" i will have [ justice ] for what they did [ to ] me but [ i ' m ] happy [ i ' m ] alive. \" ( a woman died after she accidentally shot herself with a gun she bought to prepare for ferguson protests. )",

        "summary": "There's still hope that the republican national convention might reject donald trump and nominate somebody — anybody — else, according to a group of delegates. The washington post reports that dozens of delegates, many of them ted cruz supporters, are trying to get momentum behind a plan to alter convention rules and allow delegates to vote for anybody they want instead of being bound by primary or caucus results. They will need to get their proposal past the convention's rules committee when it meets in mid-july, and then have it ratified by a majority of the 2,400 delegates. That could be tough, since many delegates fear they could face retribution, and the rnc has yet to even release a full list of delegates to the july 18-21 convention, which will be held in cleveland. The anti-trump campaign is being led by colorado gop delegate kendal unrah. \" this literally is an ' anybody but trump ' movement, \" he tells the post. \" nobody has any idea who is going to step in and be the nominee, but we're not worried about that. We're just doing that job to make sure that he's not the face of our party. \" sources say cruz has already ruled himself out. Former cruz convention adviser saul anuzis says that if trump's poll numbers remain terrible, the anti-trump delegates could be a \" serious threat \" to his candidacy if they are able to organize and agree on a goal. \" the key is to convince the delegates that they have an option and that it's not over, \" he tells politico. \" if they are successful in doing that, we have a ball game. \" ( some sources claim trump is only running in order to launch his own cable news channel. )",

            "Dozens of republican convention delegates are hatching a new plan to block donald trump at this summer's party meetings, in what has become the most organized effort so far to stop the businessman from becoming the gop presidential nominee. The moves come amid declining poll numbers for trump and growing concern among republicans that he is squandering his chance to defeat democrat hillary clinton. Several controversies — including his racial attacks on a federal judge, his renewed call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states and his support for changing the nation's gun laws — have raised fears among republicans that trump is not really a conservative and is too reckless to run a successful race. Given the strife, a growing group of anti-trump delegates is convinced that enough like-minded republicans will band together in the next month to change party rules and allow delegates to vote for whomever they want at the convention, regardless of who won state caucuses or primaries. The new push is being run by people who can actually make changes to party rules, rather than by pundits and media figures who have been pining for a trump alternative. Many of the delegates involved supported sen. Ted cruz ( tex. ) in the primary race but say they are not taking cues from any of trump's vanquished opponents. \"this literally is an 'anybody but trump ' movement",
            "The longshot effort to dethrone donald trump has been largely written off by party leaders. &#124; getty anti-trump gop delegates start organizing'there are pockets of resistance all over the country,'says one colorado delegate. Dozens of delegates to the republican national convention have launched an effort to dislodge donald trump as the gop's presidential nominee next month.

            "Dozens of republican convention delegates are hatching a new plan to block donald trump at this summer's party meetings, in what has become the most organized effort so far to stop the businessman from becoming the gop presidential nominee. The moves come amid declining poll numbers for trump and growing concern among republicans that he is squandering his chance to defeat democrat hillary clinton. Several controversies — including his racial attacks on a federal judge, his renewed call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states and his support for changing the nation's gun laws — have raised fears among republicans that trump is not really a conservative and is too reckless to run a successful race. Given the strife, a growing group of anti-trump delegates is convinced that enough like-minded republicans will band together in the next month to change party rules and allow delegates to vote for whomever they want at the convention, regardless of who won state caucuses or primaries. The new push is being run by people who can actually make changes to party rules, rather than by pundits and media figures who have been pining for a trump alternative. Many of the delegates involved supported sen. Ted cruz ( tex. ) in the primary race but say they are not taking cues from any of trump's vanquished opponents. \"this literally is an 'anybody but trump ' movement",

If she becomes president, the democratic front-runner says she would declassify files relating to area 51, unless they pose a threat to national security, to \" get to the bottom \" of extraterrestrial rumors. Last month, she said she wasn't sure if she believed in ufos, but she added \" there's enough stories out there that i don't think everybody is just sitting in their kitchen making them up. \" it's a somewhat surprising stance, considering that president obama usually laughs off discussions of extraterrestrials, and has gained clinton the title of the first \" et candidate, \" reports the times. The stance doesn't seem to be simply about votes, though a 2005 gallup poll found 24 % of americans believed \" extraterrestrial beings have visited earth, \" per fivethirtyeight. Clinton has apparently been interested in extraterrestrial life for some time. For example, she was spotted with a copy of are we alone?: philosophical implications of the discovery of extraterrestrial life by paul davies back in 1995. But her campaign chair, john podesta — who has long campaigned for the government to release ufo files — may have influenced her further. \" the us government could do a much better job in answering the quite legitimate questions that people have about what's going on with unidentified aerial phenomena, \" he told cnn last month.",

It's unclear exactly what happened out on the water — mlive reports the boat was hit by a wave, but a witness tells wluc the boat made a sudden sharp turn — but all seven aboard fell in. By the time troopers arrived, a pontoon boat had pulled six people from the water and they were being treated for hypothermia. Louis was nowhere to be found. His body was discovered following a search nearly 24 hours later. A sheriff's department officer says it appears louis had tried to grab the boat but was hit by the propeller. Now his family is left to mourn again. John louis says his brother was \" the kind of guy that would run into a building on fire to help. \" a benefit concert is being held friday in his memory at the american legion in lake orion where he would often play the guitar.

After being stung on the testicle and realizing it didn't hurt as much as one might think it would, smith decided to use himself as the subject of an experiment with the goal of charting the worst places to get stung by a bee. The most painful, according to national geographic, in descending order: the nostril, upper lip, and penis. The least painful: the skull, the upper arm, and the tip of the middle toe. Smith's methods sound pretty awful: he gave himself five stings a day for 38 days, ultimately stinging 25 body parts multiple times. \" some locations required the use of a mirror and an erect posture during stinging ( eg, buttocks ), \" he wrote in his amusing paper on the matter. He rated the painfulness of each sting on a scale from 1 to 10, and found that all of them were somewhat painful, though none of them ranked a 10 ( the nostril was scored as a 9. \" when you get stung there, your whole body reacts, \" smith explains to the bbc ). One body part he didn't test: the eye. \" when i talked to [ my advisor ], he was concerned that i might go blind, \" smith explains. \" i wanted to keep my eyes. \" as for why some body parts experience more painful stings than others? sorry, but it's not clear.

Nor are police shedding light on a possible motive, disclosing only that one of the two men — james white, 38, and justin mann, 24 — knew one of the victims, reports the albany times union. Killed were shanta myers, 36; her children, 11-year-old jeremiah and 5-year-old shanise; and her partner, brandi mells, 22. There might have been one more victim, but myers ' 15-year-old son, isaiah smith, was out of town when the murders took place. Now, a gofundme page has raised more than $ 40,000 to pay for a scholarship for the teen, as well as to cover funeral expenses. Both men face charges of first-degree murder, which could see them sent to prison for life without the possibility of parole. White received 11 years in state prison in 2000 for first-degree manslaughter, while mann got 5 years in 2010 for first-degree robbery, reports the daily gazette. Police sources tell the times union that footage from security cameras around troy led to the arrests. That raises the possibility that the schenectady men used public transportation because local buses have high-res video cameras.

The research, published today, has provoked excitement amongst scientists, with one arguing that it offers farmers a tool in a 170-year-old battle \"that stacks the odds in our favour \". In the trials carried out outside norwich, the desiree potato -a strain developed in the netherlands in the 1960s - was altered by a gene taken from a wild variety of potato, solanum venturii.

Some things to watch: trump vs. Carson: trump has lost his lead to carson in the latest polls ( though he still leads cumulatively ), which means \" the donald will be looking to tear him down, \" notes slate. Will carson's cool demeanor crack now that he's a bigger target as a front-runner? which bush? he has the \" most at stake by far, \" says mike allen of politico, and he needs a strong night to convince backers he's still their guy. The question is whether the bush who shows up will be the relatively subdued bush of the first two debates or more forceful. Rubio vs. Bush: rubio has skillfully become the no. 1 establishment candidate, in part with smart debate performances. One wrinkle wednesday night: \" bush may be looking for a fight \" to reclaim that establishment crown, notes yahoo. Christie as trump alternative? \" this is a debate where christie needs to come out and show that if you like the trump swagger, but you have concerns about the trump electability, i can be your guy, \" according to jonathan martin in the new york times. Wild cards: fiorina \" needs a shot of momentum \" and has gotten one after the first two debates, observes real clear politics. But she and the rest of the pack will likely be struggling to get noticed.

Allen, notes kristof, \" denies the allegations, has never been convicted and should be presumed innocent. \" ( a connecticut prosecutor at the time said there was enough evidence to prosecute allen, but dropped charges to spare dylan. ) allen declined to comment.

This is a case that has been written about endlessly, but this is the first time that dylan farrow herself has written about it in public. It's important to note that woody allen was never prosecuted in this case and has consistently denied wrongdoing; he deserves the presumption of innocence. So why publish an account of an old case on my blog? partly because the golden globe lifetime achievement award to allen ignited a debate about the propriety of the award. Partly because the root issue here isn't celebrity but sex abuse. And partly because countless people on all sides have written passionately about these events, but we haven't fully heard from the young woman who was at the heart of them.

People weighed in on all sides, but one person who hasn't been heard out is dylan farrow, 28, the writer and artist whom allen was accused of molesting. Dylan, allen's adopted daughter who is now married and living in florida under a different name, tells me that she has been traumatized for more than two decades by what took place; last year, she was belatedly diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She says that when she heard of the golden globe award being given to allen she curled up in a ball on her bed, crying hysterically. With everyone else commenting, she decided to weigh in as well.

            "Frances silver ( a note from nicholas kristof: in 1993, accusations that woody allen had abused his adoptive daughter, dylan farrow, filled the headlines, part of a sensational story about the celebrity split between allen and his girlfriend, mia farrow. This is a case that has been written about endlessly, but this is the first time that dylan farrow herself has written about it in public. It's important to note that woody allen was never prosecuted in this case and has consistently denied wrongdoing; he deserves the presumption of innocence. So why publish an account of an old case on my blog? partly because the golden globe lifetime achievement award to allen ignited a debate about the propriety of the award. Partly because the root issue here isn't celebrity but sex abuse. And partly because countless people on all sides have written passionately about these events, but we haven't fully heard from the young woman who was at the heart of them. I've written a column about this, but it's time for the world to hear dylan's story in her own words. ) what's your favorite woody allen movie? before you answer, you should know: when i was seven years old, woody allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim,",
            "When woody allen received a golden globe award for lifetime achievement a few weeks ago, there was a lively debate about whether it was appropriate to honor a man who is an artistic giant but also was accused years ago of child molestation. Allen's defenders correctly note that he denies the allegations, has never been convicted and should be presumed innocent. People weighed in on all sides, but one person who hasn't been heard out is dylan farrow, 28, the writer and artist whom allen was accused of molesting. Dylan, allen's adopted daughter who is now married and living in florida under a different name, tells me that she has been traumatized for more than two decades by what took place; last year, she was belatedly diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She says that when she heard of the golden globe award being given to allen she curled up in a ball on her bed, crying hysterically. With everyone else commenting, she decided to weigh in as well. ( full disclosure: i am a friend of her mother, mia, and brother ronan, and that's how dylan got in touch with me. ) she has written a letter that i ' m posting in full on my blog, nytimes.com/ontheground.

In fact, smokers have a 70 % less chance of getting the job done in 10 treatments, reports the wall street journal. Colors: black and red tattoos come off easier than those with other colors. All-black designs were best. Size: kind of a no-brainer, but if the design is bigger than 12 inches, expect the longer series of treatments. Placement: tattoos on the feet and legs were harder to remove. Better laser? the results were based on the common \" q-switched laser, \" but a smaller study of something called a picosecond alexandrite laser suggested that it works better. It's still mostly in development, however.",

        "summary": "New research suggests an experimental drug can drastically reduce the amount of a troublesome plaque that's found in the brains of alzheimer's patients — though researchers stress that more study is needed. After comparing the brains of elderly people with and without cognitive decline, researchers identified an immune compound and created a drug, aducanumab, as a substitute. Some 165 alzheimer's patients were then given one of four monthly doses of the drug, of varying strength, or a placebo. After a year, the amyloid beta plaque in the brains of patients given aducanumab had been dramatically reduced and had \" almost completely disappeared \" in those given the highest dose, a researcher tells live science. However, there's much more to consider: firstly, some patients with a gene variant linked to alzheimer's experienced pockets of fluid in the brain, which can lead to brain bleeds, per cnn. Secondly, there's no definitive proof that amyloid plaque — which accumulates in the brains of alzheimer's patients, but can be found in most aging brains — causes the disease and isn't simply a side-effect. The study also didn't analyze cognitive performance, though researchers say aducanumab appeared to slow cognitive and functional decline. \" confirmation of a cognitive benefit would be a game-changer, \" an expert writes in an editorial. Otherwise, aducanumab would need to be taken before cognitive symptoms appear. ( weed might also help. )",

            "Ap apple's apology on thursday was an extraordinary move for the company. The iphone maker just doesn't say \" i ' m sorry \" very often, so any apology at all is unusual. But even by other standards, the statement it issued regarding the slowing of iphones with older batteries was an uncommon one — and it could have important implications. Apple isn't apologizing for a hardware flaw, as it did with the antennagate controversy that plagued the iphone 4. And it's not apologizing for lackluster software, as it did in 2012 when the launch of apple maps was a fiasco. No, apple is apologizing for one of its decisions. What apple is apologizing for isn't a bug; it's a feature. Advertisement now that it's been caught, apple has basically been cornered into making the consumer-friendly moves it should have made in the first place. For the next 12 months, it will replace the batteries in customers ' iphones for $ 29 each instead of the previous charge of $ 79. And its ios operating system will get new features that will allow users to monitor the health of their batteries. But more important than those particulars, the apology could fundamentally change a key piece of how apple does business. Iphone ' glitches ' could have been",

Here's what they're saying: bain has been knocked for its failures, but even its successes oft brought layoffs, the washington post points out. Indeed, the three turnarounds romney touts most — staples, sports authority, and domino's pizza — all involved layoffs, and in some cases knocked out smaller businesses as they expanded. All of which is par for the private equity course, the la times says. \" the industry just has had a bad reputation, sometimes deservedly, \" says one exec. During romney's era, slashing costs while loading up on debt \" was an easy way to make money, and a lot of people did it. \" but bain certainly had successes, and some conservatives are coming to romney's defense — including jon huntsman and ron paul, the wall street journal reports. \" capitalism without failure isn't capitalism, \" huntsman said. Rick perry, meanwhile, has joined gingrich in piling on. \" i understand restructuring, \" he said yesterday, \" but the idea that we can't criticize someone for these get-rich-quick schemes is not appropriate. \" ultimately it's nigh-impossible for anyone to analyze bain, because the company is a \" black box \" of secrecy, politico reports.

Some wire highlights: the suspect: he's identified as 21-year-old arif ( or arid ) uka, a kosovo citizen who worked at the airport. His relatives tell ap that he's a devout muslim from a pro-american family. He's been charged with murder and attempted murder but nothing related to terrorism so far. There are conflicting reports on whether he was born in germany or kosovo. The victims: the bus driver and another member of the air force were shot to death, and two others wounded, one with life-threatening injuries. They haven't been identified. The airmen had just arrived from britain and were on their way to the ramstein military base, ultimately en route to afghanistan and iraq. What happened: witnesses say the suspect argued with airmen outside the bus before opening fire and briefly entering the vehicle. He then ran into the airport, where he was apprehended. Terror ties? \"i don't know if he's tied to a group, but there is enough information at this point to indicate that he identifies with islamist terrorist ideology, \" an anonymous us official tells the new york times.

In honor of facebook's 12th birthday and its self-invented friends day, the social network has updated the figure: \" each person in the world ( at least among the 1.59 billion people active on facebook ) is connected to every other person by an average of three and a half other people, \" facebook's research team writes in a blog post. The global average is 3.57, though facebook's heavy number of us users drops the american average to 3.46 degrees. What does that mean? basically, you can now brag that barack obama is something like a friend of a friend of a friend of a partial-friend, per venturebeat. Facebook came up with the number using complex statistical algorithms, but it explains the process fairly simply like this: \" imagine a person with 100 friends. If each of his friends also has 100 friends, then the number of friends-of-friends will be 10,000. \" that's one degree. \" if each of those friends-of-friends also has 100 friends, then the number of friends-of-friends-of-friends will be 1,000,000. \" that's two degrees. And so on. Facebook actually did a similar study back in 2011 and found its 721 million users were separated by 3.74 degrees. In 2008, it was 4.28 degrees, reports the telegraph, meaning our degrees of separation are only shrinking as the site's user base grows. Facebook crunches your own specific number here.

Only schools with accreditation ratings of c, d, or f, will have to do it; those with a or b could do it by choice. The report cards would grade parents on how well they communicate with teachers, how well students prepare for tests and complete homework, and how often the students are tardy or absent, mississippi watchdog reports. But not everyone loves the idea: \" my initial reaction is, this is absurd, \" says mary clare reim, a research associate at the heritage foundation. \" parents should be grading teachers on their performance. Putting grades on parental involvement from the top down is not the way this should work. \" holloway says he got the idea after seeing high parental involvement in high-achieving schools. Tennessee and chicago have tried somewhat similar programs, and florida lawmakers voted against one in 2011. Holloway's bill will next to go the house education committee.",
