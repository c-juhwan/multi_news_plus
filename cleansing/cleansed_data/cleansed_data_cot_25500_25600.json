        "summary": "Ever wished you could to go bed and dream about exactly what you want? the two 30-year-old inventors behind the remee sleep mask say you can. Here's how it supposedly works: the $ 95 mask contains six red led lights that are apparently bright enough to grab your brain's attention while you slumber, yet dim enough to allow you to keep sleeping. Via a website, you set a pattern for the lights to follow when you enter rem sleep — the stage that features the most dreaming, the daily mail reports. The idea is that while you're dreaming, you ' ll suddenly see the pattern — prompting you to realize you're in a dream and, say duncan frazier and steve mcguigan, allowing you to start controlling what's happening. You'd probably be wise to take the invention with a grain of salt: frazier told the mail that it can be tough to have lucid dreams, and that reaching such a state doesn't happen every time. But a lot of people are on board. A kickstarter page set up by the duo in hopes of raising $ 35,000 has brought in $ 572,891 at last count, and more than 6,000 of the backers ' will get a remee mask as part of their pledge, estimated ship date: july.",

A draft report by intergovernmental panel on climate change ( winner of the nobel peace prize in 2007 ) predicts that climate change will cut agricultural production by 2 % per decade through the end of the century. That reduction comes as demand rises 14 % per decade thanks to the ever-growing world population. The panel's previous report in 2007 was more optimistic, notes the times. That one said that while some areas of the world would see less production, those losses would be offset by gains in colder climes. Now, the un scientists predict a net loss, reflecting new research that shows crops are more sensitive than thought to hot temperatures. Another tangible sign of the times: president obama yesterday ordered federal agencies to help state and local governments better prepare for rising sea levels, storms, and droughts, reports the washington post.",

It all started when the elder kenyon was preparing for his extended family's trip from the uk to orlando and filling out electronic system for travel authorization forms, which the telegraph explains are necessary if one is traveling to the us under a visa waiver program. But after filling out five forms for himself and other family members, kenyon mistakenly checked \" yes \" for the question on harvey's form that asked: \" do you seek to engage in or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities, espionage, sabotage, or genocide? \" the family had to cart harvey on a 10-hour round trip from his home in cheshire to the london embassy, where he was apparently cleared of all terrorist ties — though \" he has sabotaged quite a few [ diapers ] in his time, \" his grandpa notes.

        "summary": "Talk about a pr mess: apple's new smartwatch goes on sale friday in stores as the company scrambles to fix a glitch with its biggest new feature, reports the wall street journal. The $ 399 apple watch series 3 with lte is supposed to allow users to connect to cellular networks while on the go, but reviewers have repeatedly run into problems connecting. The upshot is that they were unable to do such basic tasks as making calls, sending texts, or using siri. ( read a first-person account at the verge. ) apple acknowledged the problem wednesday and said it's working on a fix, one expected to arrive in a future software upgrade. The assessments aren't kind. As the washington post notes, it's exceedingly rare for apple to begin selling a product with a major glitch, though the 2012 launch of apple maps also had buggy issues. What's more, the journal sees the watch \" as a bellwether for the company's ability to create new devices that diversify apple's revenue, \" noting that it's the first new product completely under ceo tim cook's reign. And a post at business insider sees a bigger-picture problem: this is a \" sign that apple has lost sight of the principle that led to its meteoric rise: apple doesn't sell technology for technology's sake, \" writes kif leswing. \" it figures out what people want to do...

While those most likely to report initiating unwanted sexual contact in their early to mid-teens were boys, girls were among the perpetrators as the age of respondents increased. Latino and african american youths, and those from low-income families, were less likely to have coerced another person to engage in sex than were whites and those from higher-income families, the study found. And among perpetrators of sexual violence, consumption of x-rated materials -- specifically those depicting physical harm in the context of sex -- was notably more common than it was among youths who did not report efforts to coerce or force someone else to engage in sex. The research, published monday in the journal jama pediatrics, appears to be first to gauge how widespread sexual violence is among americans of high-school and college age.

Emmal said the lanterns were released \" to honor those we have lost, and offer a glimmer of hope to those who are still suffering. \" ( photo: bill roth associated press ) nearly one in 10 young people report being a perpetrator of sexual violence — either coercing or forcing some type of sexual contact upon another, according to a new national study that suggests a connection between such behavior and being exposed to violent x-rated material. The research, published online monday in the journal jama pediatrics, is based on data from 1,058 young people ages 14-21 collected in 2010 and 2011 by the center for innovative public health research, a non-profit organization based in san clemente, calif. About half the participants, 53 %, were ages 18-21, and 47 % were ages 14-17. \" sexual violence can be perpetrated by anybody – a dating partner, a friend or somebody you don't know, \" says michele ybarra, the center's president and director of research. \" we asked perpetrators about their relationship with their most recent victims, and one in four said it was not a dating partner. \" ybarra says this study is important because most research about sexual violence has focused only on dating partners and on college-age",
            "Nearly 1 in 10 young americans between ages 14 and 21 acknowledges having perpetrated an act of sexual violence at least once, and 4 % of a nationally representative sample of american kids reported attempting or completing rape, a new study finds. While those most likely to report initiating unwanted sexual contact in their early to mid-teens were boys, girls were among the perpetrators as the age of respondents increased. Latino and african american youths, and those from low-income families, were less likely to have coerced another person to engage in sex than were whites and those from higher-income families, the study found. And among perpetrators of sexual violence, consumption of x-rated materials -- specifically those depicting physical harm in the context of sex -- was notably more common than it was among youths who did not report efforts to coerce or force someone else to engage in sex. The research, published monday in the journal jama pediatrics, appears to be first to gauge how widespread sexual violence is among americans of high-school and college age. It was based on surveys conducted between october 2010 and march 2012 with 1,058 people ages 14 to 21 who participated in a broader longitudinal study called \" growing up with media. \" drawing upon the u.s. Justice department definitions of sexual violence, the authors of the latest research asked participants whether they had ever engaged in a"

Some eight months later, he was reunited with the iphone, and some precious family photos, after it was discovered by a worker at a feed mill in hokkaido, japan, the ap reports. It had traveled to another grain facility in oklahoma, down the arkansas and mississippi rivers to a depot in louisiana, and across the pacific mixed in with 2 million bushels of grain. The japanese worker mailed the phone back to louisiana, where a manager at the grain depot charged it and was able to get in touch with whitney. The farmer got his phone back in pristine condition, complete with pictures from his daughter's wedding. \" it's crazy, i can't believe it, \" he tells kfor. \" what really shocked me about it all was what a small world it is.

        "summary": "Rebel forces appeared to regain their momentum yesterday, capturing at least three important towns and two major oil refineries in a march that brought them just outside gadhafi's hometown of sirte, the washington post and new york times report. In benghazi, rebels celebrated as rumors spread that sirte had already been taken, firing guns and rockets into the air. But those rumors appear to be unfounded, and dozens of pro-gadhafi fighters were reportedly seen roaming sirte's streets last night. Rebels had tried to take sirte before international forces intervened, but were driven back. But now that they've got the support of american and european airstrikes — which have largely turned to attacking gadhafi's ground troops — the advance proved surprisingly easy. But air cover may be less useful in taking the heavily defended sirte, the times warns, and the battle there could help decide the war.",

I don't go to starbucks and order the newest frappaccino. I don't spend my time vaping with friends. I prefer to stay home and read and reflect and just kind of do calm things that i enjoy doing. It helps me be more mature and feel older than i actually am. \" but at times, he's still a kid. After the six-minute warm-up before his turn to skate, zhou said he sat down backstage. \" i was trying to remember to breath. My entire life ran through my head. \" all 17 years of it. History.

        "summary": "A 31-year-old tech billionaire and stanford dropout has gone from gracing the covers of magazines to defending her revolutionary blood-testing company against charges that its work is inaccurate and misleading, the new york times reports. According to the wall street journal, elizabeth holmes founded theranos 12 years ago because she had a fear of needles. The company sought to use new technology to perform more than 200 types of blood tests using only finger pricks. But last week the journal published two stories calling out theranos for performing only one test — for herpes — with blood from finger pricks and using traditional blood draws and technology for everything else. It also cited former employees who claimed theranos diluted its tiny blood draws to make them work with traditional technology, leading to greater risks of errors. Holmes addressed those claims onstage during a journal-sponsored tech conference wednesday, the times reports. \"we know the integrity of what we've done, \" she told the audience. According to the journal, holmes claimed the company is in a \" pause period \" with its unique blood-testing technology while it awaits fda approval. She denied any faults with performance or accuracy. Business insider reports theranos issued a full rebuttal of the journal's claims thursday. The rebuttal questions the motivations of the pulitzer prize-winning journalist who wrote the original articles, as well as his anonymous sources. \" from his very first interactions with theranos, the reporter made abundantly clear that he considered theranos to be a target to be taken down, \" the rebuttal states. But, as the times notes, the journal isn't holmes ' only trouble; a few other prominent people have also raised questions about theranos tests.

            "The last time these columns were lambasted by a presidential candidate in iowa, he was democrat richard gephardt and the year was 1988. The missouri populist won the state caucuses in part on the rallying cry that \" we've got to stop listening to the editorial writers and the establishment, \" especially about ethanol and trade. Imagine our amusement to find republican newt gingrich joining such company. The former speaker blew through des moines last tuesday for the renewable fuels association summit, and his keynote speech to the ethanol lobby was as pious a tribute to the fuel made from corn and tax dollars as we've ever heard. Mr. Gingrich explained that \" the big-city attacks \" on ethanol subsidies are really attempts to deny prosperity to rural america, adding that \" obviously big urban newspapers want to kill it because it's working, and you wonder, ' what are their values? ' \" mr. Gingrich traced the roots of these supposed antipathies to the 1880s, an observation that he repeatedly tendered \" as an historian. \" the ph.d. And star pupil of futurist alvin toffler then singled out the journal's long-held anti-ethanol views as \" just plain flat intellectually wrong. \" mr. Gingrich is right that ethanol poses an intellectual problem, but it has nothing to do with a culture war between des moines and new york city.",

From the center for public integrity: gingrich was a hired consultant to a major ethanol lobbying group — at more than $ 300,000 a year. According to irs records, the ethanol group growth energy paid gingrich's consulting firm $ 312,500 in 2009.the former house speaker was the organization's top-paid consultant, according to the records. His pay was one of the group's largest single expenditures, as it took in and spent about $ 11 million to promote ethanol and to lobby for federal incentives for its use. In a growth energy publication, gingrich was listed as a consultant who offered advice on \"strategy and communication issues \" and who \"will speak positively on ethanol related topics to media. \" gingrich spokesman rick tyler did not deny gingrich's employment with the group when contacted about the piece. Instead, tyler sent this summary of gingrich's energy policy to national review online: newt gingrich continues to draw a parallel between a sound american energy strategy and keeping america safe.

        "summary": "Less than two weeks after paypal banned infowars, infowars founder alex jones is suing the digital payment platform. Paypal said that the conspiracy-peddling website violated its policies by promoting \" hate \" and gave it 10 days to find an alternate payment processing platform. But jones says paypal is just biased against his right-wing views, and wants his account reinstated. \" it is at this point well known that large tech companies, located primarily in silicon valley, are discriminating against politically conservative entities and individuals, including banning them from social media platforms such as twitter, based solely on their political and ideological viewpoints, \" jones ' company, free speech systems, says in its complaint, per courthouse news. Jones and infowars have also been banned by apple, facebook, spotify, youtube, and twitter. Jones and his company have used paypal since 2000; he sells \" health and wellness \" products including fluoride-free toothpaste and dietary supplements gizmodo refers to as \" dubious, \" right-wing books and videos, survivalism supplies, and infowars-branded merch through his website store. He says the site's refusal to continue processing payments for infowars amounts to \" viewpoint discrimination \" and is based on conduct that has nothing to do with his business relationship with paypal — which, he argues, violates his contract with the payment processor. If paypal's ban is allowed to stand, it will set \" a dangerous precedent for any person or entity with controversial views, \" the federal lawsuit claims. He also says that paypal has \" effectively cornered the market \" on online payment services and \" is now using that market power to restrain conservative trade and commerce. \" jones is facing numerous ongoing defamation lawsuits himself.",

A circuit court judge set vick's bond at $ 50,000, during the hearing. The bond breaks down to $ 30,000 for an assault on a law enforcement officer charge, $ 10,000 for resisting arrest and $ 10,000 for obstruction of justice. The prosecution objected to the judge's decision thursday, and say they plan to file an appeal. The judge also ruled thursday that vick cannot drive, must live with his mother in chesapeake, must undergo regular drug tests and cannot test positive. Online arrest records initially showed that vick, 32, was charged with assault involving a hate crime on sunday. However, newport news police spokesman lou thurston said that was an error. Vick was actually arrested for assault on a law enforcement officer. He is also facing charges of obstruction of justice, destruction of property and resisting arrest. Vick's arrest happened in the 800 block of city center boulevard near canon boulevard. Court paperwork obtained by wavy news shows that an officer was called to onelife fitness sunday afternoon, and spoke with a man identified as vick. Thurston said police had received information that vick was wanted in montgomery county, va. On a contempt of court charge. The officer advised him that he was going to be placed under arrest.

            "A topless woman who appeared as an extra on \" the cosby show \" was taken into custody after she lunged at the disgraced comedian when he arrived at a courthouse in pennsylvania on monday morning. As the 80-year-old arrived at court on monday for his sexual assault retrial, a topless protester with the words \" cosby \" and \" rapist \" painted on her back jumped the barrier ahead of the disgraced comedian and charged at him. She was thrown to the ground and cuffed by police. The district attorney's office identified the protester as nicolle rochelle, 39, of little falls, new jersey. She was charged with disorderly conduct and if convicted, rochelle will be assessed a fine and be required to pay court costs. According to rochelle's imdb page, she appeared in four episodes of \" the cosby show \" between 1990 and 1992. Cosby's spokesman, andrew wyatt, told reporters outside of the courthouse that the disgraced actor was not affected by rochelle's behavior because he \" can't see. \" \" he can't see so it didn't affect him at all, \" wyatt said. He added that her act of protest was in \" poor taste. \" \" what concerns me is that you're out here protesting -- and you have right to protest for",

And it's entirely something else to do the latter twice in a span of a single week. That's what 29-year-old spanish climber kilian jornet claims to have just accomplished, reports the guardian. Jornet, a long-distance runner, says he reached the summit after a 17-hour climb from advanced base camp on saturday. For the record, the china tibet mountaineering association, which validates such things, has not officially weighed in yet. Assuming it does, jornet won't set a speed record, but he's making headlines for a different facet of his feat: the 17-hour ascent came just five days after jornet said he scaled the mountain in 26 hours, again without ropes or oxygen. \" i think summiting everest twice in one week without oxygen opens up a new realm of possibilities in alpinism and i ' m really happy to have done it, \" jornet says on his summits of my life blog. Outside magazine, which calls jornet \" a freak of nature, \" marvels at the faster ascent, even if it is shy of a record. He \" just ran 8,000 vertical feet up the world's highest mountain — a mountain on which it's hard to breathe, period, for the last third of it — in less than a day, \" it notes. The world of everest records can be a bewildering one, with some times in dispute, but a post at marca says austria's christian stangl currently holds the record for the fastest climb with a time of 16 hours and 42 minutes in 2016.

        "summary": "The yale neurosurgeon who four years ago claimed former first lady of argentina, eva peron, had a lobotomy in 1952 to ease her pain from cervical cancer is revising his theory. In a new paper in neurosurgical focus, daniel nijensohn says the woman who inspired the musical evita didn't just undergo a lobotomy to numb her emotional responses. He claims her husband, argentine president juan peron, forced her to have the procedure as it \" offered the perfect approach to ' calm ' evita and prevent a civil war, while also attempting to dull her response to cancer pain, \" per the bbc. Nijensohn notes eva peron was in control of argentina's social policies at the time, but not everyone agreed with her direction. In the months before her death, she began attacking her opponents as \" imbeciles \" and \" enemies of the people, \" and called for citizens to \" fight the oligarchy \" — something her cool and calculating husband would have considered dangerous, reports discovery news. Though juan peron didn't know it at the time, eva peron had ordered 5,000 automatic pistols and 1,500 machine guns from her sick bed and planned to use them to form workers ' militias — a sure-fire way to start a civil war. At the time, at least in the us, a lobotomy was thought to cure spontaneous and uncontrollable aggression and might have seemed like the ideal solution. Nijensohn says acquaintances of peron's surgeon, james poppen, confirm his theory, including one of his nurses and close friends who says the operation was conducted without eva peron's assent. She says poppen performed lobotomies on prisoners in buenos aires first, at the request of juan peron, then completed eva peron's procedure in a palace back room, watched by an armed guard. She adds he later regretted his participation and was \" surprised by her quick postoperative decline and early death, \" nijensohn writes. Eva peron stopped eating and died a month or two after the alleged operation on july 26, 1952. ( another claim about eva: she helped the nazis. )",

' i don't want to die. Please don't let me die, ' because he loved his country, he sacrificed himself for his country, \" gen.

But ornella also echoed suspicions that chavez had been poisoned, noting that perhaps 50 years in the future we ' ll learn how \" the hand of the enemy \" was involved. Poisoned or no, chavez died with a net worth of $ 1 billion. Media outlets are focusing today on former vp nicolas maduro, who has been leading the country since chavez's death. Maduro, chavez's chosen successor, has been mimicking chavez's speech patterns, clothes, and favored topics, and has been repeating the slogan \" i am chavez \" to supporters, the new york times reports. But \" he can't just stand there and say ' i am the mini-me of chavez and now you have to follow me, ' \" notes one analyst.

These signals came to be known as pulsars, a type of neutron star described by scientific american as \" a city-sized collapsed core of a massive sun that is made of degenerate matter and throws off lighthouse-like beams of radio waves. \" the discovery was a leap forward: it pointed to the existence of black holes, provided evidence for gravitational waves, and much more. It also yielded a 1974 nobel prize — but not for bell burnell. Instead, the prize went to antony hewish, bell burnell's phd supervisor, the guardian reports. Bell burnell's exclusion from the nobel prize has been cited as proof of sexism in astronomy. But, since then, bell burnell has won plenty of other accolades. \" i feel i've done very well out of not getting a nobel prize, \" she tells the guardian. \" if you get the nobel prize you have this fantastic week and nobody gives you anything else.

Per the guardian, archaeological excavations at three roman-era fish processing sites near the strait of gibraltar, which connects the atlantic ocean with the mediterranean sea, found the ancient bones of two whale species not known to frequent the area in the present day. In the journal proceedings for the royal society b, researchers wrote that the bones are evidence that grey whales and north atlantic right whales once used the region as calving grounds. The presence of the bones at the sites also tells scientists that they may have been hunted by the ancient romans. The discovery not only sheds new light on the ancient mediterranean ecosystem, it has also sparked renewed discussion about certain writings of ancient roman naturalist and scholar pliny the elder. Per livescience, pliny's 2,000-year-old writings about whales in the gibraltar region being hunted by orcas never quite squared with contemporary understanding of the habits of either species. This recent discovery might just prove pliny was right after all. Without whales to hunt in the area, the research notes that the orcas of the region now seem to prey on tuna.

        "summary": "Wildlife officials in california have a disturbing revelation for pet owners: most mountain lions in the region seem to have acquired a taste for dogs and cats. As the san francisco chronicle reports, that insight comes from an analysis of the stomach contents of mountain lions legally killed last year. Of the 83 cougars analyzed, 52 % had recently dined on a dog, a cat, or another domestic animal. The true percentage is likely higher, however, because the contents of 18 % of the stomachs were too digested to make a determination. As for deer, considered a menu staple, a measly 5 % of the mountain lions had eaten one. One resident of vista can attest, blaming a mountain lion for killing his lab mix one morning earlier this month. \"my neighbor found him, basically mortally wounded, \" he tells fox 5 san diego, adding that \" multiple sightings \" of mountain lions have been reported locally. As if that's not enough cause for worry, an official with the department of fish and wildlife says the new figures don't take into account coyotes. \" many coyote attacks on animals and people happen when the coyote sneaks up from behind, \" he says. And yard attacks also are common. \" a coyote can jump over an 8-foot fence, grab a small dog or cat and be gone before you even know it's there. \"",

        "summary": "Can't stop thinking about that time you cried in front of a girl during a tim burton movie on your first and only date? it might be because your brain is lacking a specific chemical, according to a study published friday in nature communications. And while being unable to suppress unwanted bad thoughts can occasionally be embarrassing or unpleasant, the miami herald reports it can be downright disastrous for people with depression, ptsd, or schizophrenia. \" our ability to control our thoughts is fundamental to our wellbeing, \" cambridge professor michael anderson says in a press release. Being unable to do so \" causes some of the most debilitating symptoms of psychiatric diseases, \" he adds. That's why it was so exciting for anderson and his team when they discovered what they believe is the reason some people can't stop thinking about unwanted things. The bbc reports researchers studied the chemical and blood flow changes in subjects ' brains as they were told to recall or not recall certain words. They concluded an \" inhibitory \" neurotransmitter called gaba in the hippocampus, the \" memory \" region of the brain, is the key, with subjects with more gaba being better at stopping unwanted thoughts. Anderson says gaba acts like \" an army's foot-soldiers \" against such thoughts and memories. He says the discovery could in the future lead to new ways to treat ptsd, depression, schizophrenia, and more. ( a 23-year-old lost his memory. Then came the mri. )",

        "summary": "Inside your head, there's something called the blood-brain barrier — a natural defense system that keeps germs in your bloodstream from entering your brain. While it's great when it comes to preventing bacterial infections, the barrier makes treating some brain diseases impossible, since it prevents drugs from reaching the infected area. But that could soon change. Canadian scientists have penetrated the barrier for the first time in order to treat a branching brain tumor, known as a glioma, which is incredibly difficult to remove surgically in its entirety, reports the daily beast. First, a team at toronto's sunnybrook hospital inserted a chemotherapy drug into 56-year-old patient bonny hall's blood. Then, they used pulses of ultrasound — frequencies too high to be heard by the human ear — to manipulate microscopic air bubbles delivered into the bloodstream. When the bubbles in the brain were hit with pulses of ultrasound, they vibrated, creating small openings in the blood-brain barrier, allowing the drug to reach the tumor, per the bbc. Researchers say the procedure is both non-invasive and reversible since the barrier openings close within hours, while the air bubbles disappear quickly through the lungs, reports the globe and mail. After 24 hours, doctors removed portions of hall's tumor and confirmed it had been hit with the drugs, though they ' ll now study the tumor more closely. A doctor notes the procedure — which will be tested in nine other patients scheduled for traditional neurosurgery — could \" revolutionize \" brain medicine, including treatments for other diseases, like alzheimer's. \" i really do hope this will work for them some day, \" hall said before the operation.

        "summary": "You've seen ' em. The ubiquitous little signs that say \" we buy houses \" or something to that effect and pop up on street corners and utility poles. One man in philadelphia got so tired of looking at them that he publicly offered a $ 1 bounty for every sign collected and dropped off at his house. Luckily, he's a lawyer and was wise enough to set a $ 200 limit, because it took less than 48 hours to reach it, reports philly.com. But the campaign was such a hit — residents posted tips on facebook on getting hard-to-reach signs — that another neighbor has come forward to extend it with a $ 200 offer of his own. \"everyone who came by said they already do this anyway, \" says michael froehlich, the attorney behind the first campaign. \"they're motivated by the sense that investors are coming into their neighborhoods and taking advantage of longtime residents. \" froehlich says he's fine with people selling their property to make a buck on, say, a neighborhood being gentrified. But he says that too often, people get suckered into selling too quickly and for too little money by calling the numbers on the signs or fliers. A separate story in the philadelphia inquirer notes that it's actually illegal to post such \" bandit signs \" at intersections, although a city official in the streets department acknowledged that he's fighting a losing battle in trying to keep up with them. The fine is $ 75, but raising the penalty probably won't help. \" if you can't find out who they are, what's the sense of having a higher fine? \" asks the city official. \" i'd rather have people just rip them down and dispose of them. \" ( the sale of dilapidated houses is behind a depressing new real estate scheme. )",

Kdka reports the gap between the two buildings was only about a foot and a half, but one was taller than the other. Birdsong botched the jump and ended up wedged between the two buildings about five feet off the ground. Birdsong's ill-advise leap took place around 2am tuesday. He was finally freed around 6am after rescuers broke through the wall of a qdoba to pull him out. As birdsong was loaded into an ambulance with a broken ankle, he gave a double thumbs up to the woman, who had stuck around for him to be rescued. \"i think he is an idiot for doing it, but at least he got the girl, \" one witness tells kdka. Not so lucky was the qdoba, which will need to be closed for at least a week to have its wall replaced, wpxi reports. Birdsong has already apologized to the restaurant.

According to police, a pitt student became wedged between two buildings, in a gap that ranged from 16-18 inches wide, when he tried leap from one to the other. He attempted to go from the shorter building to the taller one, but missed. After falling, he became suspended about five-feet off the ground. He was allegedly out to impress a girl he met monday night, but failed miserably. The girl he was trying to impress, who waited with everyone else along forbes avenue during the rescue, saw he was in trouble and called campus police, who called 911. It was a four-hour ordeal for paramedics, pittsburgh and pitt police and public works. He has been identified by the pittsburgh post-gazette as grant birdsong, 22, of indiana township. A spokesperson with upmc said tuesday afternoon that he is in fair condition. Pittsburgh public safety director wendell hissrich says the man fell three stories. Crews removed bricks and went through the wall at the qdoba restaurant. \"it appears there were three walls that we had to go through and also we had people on the roof, one of the paramedics did rappel down the three stories to render assistance and to get a landmark as to where he was, \" hissrich said. Birdsong and the medic were brought out through a gaping hole inside qdoba. Eventually, birdsong was brought out on a stretcher with a broken ankle, which he underwent surgery later to repair. He gave two thumbs up to the girl he wanted to impress as he was loaded into the ambulance. \"he was alert and talking, \" said hissrich. \"obviously, he was here for three and a half to four hours, so he was numb. \" the manager of qdoba says this couldn't have come at a worse time with students just returning to pitt and carnegie mellon university. \"i thought it was going to be a hole to patch, but we're going to have to remove the entire interior wall, \" said chad brooks, of fixing the wall in his restaurant.

The guardian looks at prince albert ii's decision to green-light a construction project that will see 15 acres of land reclaimed from the sea so that more luxury homes can be built on it. The prices are astronomical, and so too, apparently, will be the demand: with its lax tax laws — no personal income tax and no inheritance tax, for instance — about a third of monaco's residents are millionaires, and the guardian cites real-estate research that suggests that within 10 years, that figure could jump to roughly 42 %. But monaco measures just 485 acres, and there's basically no more room for additional housing, which can go for as much as $ 10,000 per square foot. The new portier cove neighborhood, which will cost $ 2 billion to construct, is not the first reclamation project monaco has undertaken, notes business insider: the larger fontvieille district was constructed in the 1970s. In a 2016 article on the project, the telegraph reported the project would take 10 years, and that the \" foundations for the titanic operation \" alone would take more than 3 years to construct. Hundreds of thousands of tons of sand will be imported from sicily to create the new land. ( in the 20th century, the us shrunk by one square mile. )",

Tuesday night's mega millions estimated grand prize has hit a staggering $ 1.6 billion, continuing a trend of giant jackpots. It will be the largest lottery prize in u.s. History when someone finally hits it and will join five other top 10 drawings in the last three years. Lottery officials changed the odds in recent years to lessen the chance of winning a jackpot, which in turn increased the opportunity for top prizes to reach stratospheric levels. A look at how the numbers work out: why reduce the number of jackpots? the theory was that bigger jackpots would draw more attention, leading more players to plop down $ 2 for a mega millions or powerball ticket. The more tickets sold, the more the jackpots grow, leading to more players and... You get the idea. Powerball was the first to try the theory in october 2015, when it changed the potential number combinations. In doing so, powerball changed the odds of winning the jackpot from one in 175 million to one in 292.2 million. Officials at that time also increased the chances of winning small prizes. Mega millions made similar moves in october 2017, resulting in the odds worsening from one in 259 million to one in 302.5 million did it work? states have generally reported increased mega millions and powerball sales since the change. But the ever-increasing jackpots have left them ever-more dependent on those massive payouts because prizes that once seemed so immense now seem almost puny in comparison. Consider the current $ 620 million powerball jackpot. That's an incredible amount of money, but compared to the mega millions prize hovering at an estimated $ 1.6 billion, it barely seems worth the bother of buying a ticket.

The men were also charged with creating false footage suggesting the country was facing a civil war, the ap reports. Australian peter greste, canadian-egyptian mohammed fahmy, and egyptian baher mohammed had been reporting on protesters backing ousted president mohamed morsi and were detained in a december raid on their cairo hotel room. The trio has been housed in a 13-foot cell for 23 hours a day since, the bbc reports. The prosecution's case was thin: it showed video obtained from the journalists covering a veterinary hospital and christian life, photos from greste's family vacation, a news report made while the trio wasn't in the country, and a pop video by the australian singer gotye, notes al-jazeera. ( as the new york times reports, \" there was no publicly available evidence that the journalists had either supported the brotherhood or broadcast anything inaccurate. \" ) \" we are deeply concerned that this verdict is part of a broader attempt to muzzle media freedoms, \" says australia's foreign minister. The country's prime minister has voiced his concerns to egyptian president abdel-fattah el-sissi. Mohammed was sentenced to an additional three years for possessing ammunition — a charge al-jazeera says resulted from a single leftover shell he'd been keeping as a souvenir. There were 17 other co-defendants, including other al-jazeera journos and students accused of giving footage to the journalists; 11 tried in absentia received 10-year sentences.",

Yet the mormon church, america's biggest scout-unit sponsor, says mormon affiliation with the scouts may still be over. The church \" is deeply troubled by today's vote, \" according to a church statement. \" when the leadership of the church resumes its regular schedule of meetings in august, the century-long association with scouting will need to be examined. \" similarly, a baptist leader says the shift to allow gay youths in 2013, and now gay leaders, shows \" that this is the final word only until the next evolution. \" effective immediately, the new policy was also criticized by pro-lgbt groups. The religious exemption \" undermines and diminishes the historic nature of today's decision, \" says human rights campaign president chad griffin, per cnn. \" discrimination should have no place in the boy scouts, period. \" nbc news notes that 70 % of local scout units are sponsored by religious groups, but some have opposed banning gay leaders.

Given that it pays an outrageous combined tax rate of 39.1 % on profits, it would be silly not to do everything in its power to reduce that bill. If senators were looking to cast apple as a villain, they instead exposed \" the folly of america's tax code. \" if lawmakers truly want to help, they can start by knocking that rate down to at least the mid-20s, and ideally much lower. \" the apple case illustrates, seemingly for the millionth time, the need for corporate tax reform, \" adds the editorial board at the washington post. Generally speaking, we need to close all those loopholes in exchange for lower rates, a concept that apple has said it would embrace even if it means a higher bill than it pays now. That's a good start, writes edward hadas at reuters, but he notes that apple's strategy wouldn't work if ireland didn't play along. We also need \" an international deal on corporate taxes, \" he argues. It's time to \" tax profit where it is actually, not legally, earned. \"",

Acting president oleksandr turchynov prompted the move, which saw the country's parliament replace tenyukh with col. Gen. Myhaylo koval. The switch comes as ukraine's weakened military turns to the country's own people for help, the wall street journal reports. After the fall of the soviet union, ukraine believed international agreements protected its territory; its military has since shrunk from more than 750,000 to 140,000. As of earlier this month, just 6,000 of 41,000 land troops were said to be combat-ready. With russia invading crimea, ukraine's forces found themselves in need of batteries for their vehicles; the acting government ended up getting help from the banking and oil fortune of oligarch ihor kolomoisky. Meanwhile, a hotline allows ukrainians to donate 50 cents, while a new national guard has gathered some 4,000 recruits for a two-week training process. \" for the past 23 years we never really rearmed, \" says vitaly yarema, a longtime police official now in charge of defense as first deputy pm, noting a lack of \" modern equipment. \" in other regional news, leading ukrainian nationalist oleksandr muzychko, a radical who went by the name sashko bily, has been shot and killed.

        "summary": "The \" taxi king of new york \" has made a plea deal that could be bad news for michael cohen. Evgeny freidman, the longtime business partner of president trump's lawyer, entered a guilty plea in a state tax fraud case tuesday after making a deal to cooperate with investigators, an insider tells the ap. The deal could be used as leverage to persuade cohen to cooperate with robert mueller's investigation of alleged election meddling, as well as with the federal prosecutors in new york looking into cohen's businesses, reports the new york times. But while cohen and freidman have long been close friends, it's not clear how much information on the lawyer's financial dealings freidman would be able to give investigators. Friedman, who managed dozens of new york city taxi medallions — the permits needed to operate yellow cabs — on behalf of cohen, had been facing up to 25 years on each of five felony charges related to his failure to pay $ 5 million in state taxi ride surcharges. Under the deal, he pleaded guilty to a single count of evading $ 50,000 in taxes and will receive five years of probation instead of prison time. He will also be required to pay $ 5 million in restitution to the state. Sources say that as part of the deal, freidman specifically agreed to assist state and federal prosecutors, though he says the plea is about taking responsibility for his own actions and has nothing to do with his \" dear personal friend \" cohen. ( a former qatari official says cohen offered him access to trump for $ 1 million. )",

Deloreans — the vehicle made famous in the back to the future movie franchise — are heading back into production in humble, texas, and it will be the first time the iconic car will be manufactured on american soil. \" it's fantastic. It is a game-changer for us, \" delorean ceo stephen wynne tells kprc. Wynne notes that he's got enough parts to put together about 300 cars, and although he anticipates initial output to be just one car a month, he's hoping to jack that to one a week. The first car is slated to be finished by early 2017. The anticipated price for one of these future throwbacks: $ 45,000 to $ 55,000 for a refurb, a vague \" less than $ 100,000 \" for a new model. The original back to the future gave the dmc-12 — the only model delorean ever made, per the daily dot — a high profile, but the company went down the tubes in part thanks to founder john delorean's drug and money problems, notes nbc washington. Wynne came along in the mid- ' 80s, scooped up what was left of the company, rebranded it as the delorean motor company, and moved operations to the houston area, but he was limited to refurbishing existing deloreans: a government rule made it illegal for low-volume production of cars that didn't meet current safety standards. But a recent federal highway bill now allows for a company to build up to 325 such replicas a year under certain conditions, and the delorean qualifies. \" it's huge for us.

Though a dermatologist had found nothing concerning during a check-up a year before, doctors said the cancer had spread throughout her body, per cbs st. Louis. Yet \" against the advice of my oncologist, i am choosing to delay my treatment for three weeks in order to get the baby to 28 weeks, \" combs wrote on facebook on nov. 13.

Just as she predicted, mother and baby struggled. Shaylin was put on a breathing tube, though doctors later removed it as her condition improved. Combs wasn't so lucky. \" heaven gained a new angel this morning, \" the family's photographer, emily lucarz, wrote on facebook on tuesday. Combs \" sacrificed everything so her new little one could live on, \" she said, later adding \" giving baby shaylin a chance at life was the most selfless thing she could have done. \" though combs'sister-in-law writes that combs was scheduled to begin treatment thursday, lucarz says the already-weak woman suffered \" complications unrelated to her cancer. \" she \" ended up needing a liver transplant, but because of her cancer was not a candidate. \" before she died, though, doctors \" brought shaylin to her and she got to hold the baby, \" a relative tells ktvi. \" at 38 you don't expect to find out that you are dying.

Hickox's boyfriend, ted wilbur, has withdrawn from the nursing program at the university of maine fort kent, after apparently encountering what an associate dean terms \" some real concerns \" over his presence; since hickox's much-discussed return to their home in maine, wilbur had been taking classes online. \" we worked with ted and the broader campus community to address all the concerns and uncertainties we faced over the last couple of weeks, \" says a university of maine spokesman. The couple, reports the daily news, plans to leave town within the week; it's unclear where they're headed, but it's definitely out of town, if not out of the state, notes the ap. \" i am not concerned he is a threat to anyone's health, \" says the dean. \" my only concern is how the other students would react to him being here. \" but another factor may have been the emergence of what the daily news calls \" several social media sites dedicated to keeping hickox out of fort kent and maine. \" meanwhile, wilbur is shopping for a new college, notes the ap. Not everyone is happy to see them gone: in an op-ed today in the daily news, two doctors write: \" thank you to kaci hickox, whose bravery and selflessness in going to sierra leone to fight ebola helped all of us in maine, the us, and the world, \" lauding her for being willing to \" sacrifice her time and, possibly, her life in giving her hard-earned expertise to the people of west africa. \"",

        "summary": "Renaissance artist giorgio vasari's the last supper was so badly damaged by floodwaters a half-century ago that it was considered beyond repair. Today, however, it is once again on display in all its glory, the art newspaper reports. The 96-square-foot painting, commissioned by a cloister of italian nuns in 1546, was submerged underwater for 12 hours when the arno river in florence flooded in 1966. According to the ap, the flood killed 100 or so people and damaged thousands of pieces of renaissance art — despite the best efforts of a group of art-rescuing volunteers called the \" angels of the mud. \" on friday, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the flood, a newly restored the last supper was unveiled to the public. The last supper was initially believed to be beyond restoration and was put in storage for 40 years. But by 2008, technology had improved enough to give new hope for vasari's work. A team of up to 13 experts worked years on the last supper in order to get it ready for friday's event at the basilica of santa croce. \" it was a long battle, but we made it, \" the head of an italian arts restoration agency says. The florentine calls it \" an evolutionary step in the field of restoration as well as the culmination of reflections on the safety of artworks and preventive decision-making \" — meaning the last supper is now attached to a mechanism that will raise it higher on the wall if the arno decides to breach its banks again in the future. ( another restoration may change our notion of what shakespeare looked like. )",

            "Share in santa croce facts, chronicles and history become monuments in their own right. This is especially true for the florentine floods, recollections of unexpected past events, which remain marked in the stones of this great temple of memory. Efforts to prevent the effects of the moody arno river are as old as santa croce itself. The early franciscans strove to elevate the entire structure by considerable measure. They decided to build a new church, leaving beneath it a smaller temple built just a few decades earlier. But time will show that their efforts were in vain: they should have built higher. What will mark this fiftieth anniversary of the flood for santa croce is the return of a masterpiece that few can remember having seen: the last supper by giorgio vasari. As early as 1333, the florentine chronicler giovanni villani criticized the lack of preparedness on the part of the people",

The 25-year-old las vegas woman claimed the threats came from a facebook account in the name of \" tyler parker, \" but after a hearing in may in which lawson displayed screenshots of messages — which she said showed parkervest trying to pressure her not to testify against him and claiming a friend had raped lawson's daughter — investigators grew suspicious. \" one of my da colleagues looked at [ the screenshot ] and said, ' it doesn't look right, ' and that triggered in our mind maybe we need to look into this further, \" a deputy da says. Authorities eventually secured search warrants for facebook and t-mobile and learned the messages were sent from lawson's ip address, per gizmodo. Lawson had \" disguised herself as parkervest with a similar facebook account \" and \" sent herself numerous criminal threats, \" says an investigator. Authorities say lawson also lied about parkervest holding her at knife-point in his car, reports the ap. All charges against parkervest were dropped in october.

Christie well to mount a bid for president in 2016, though the governor has said he hasn't decided on his future plans, \" writes heather haddon at the wall street journal, noting that he spent election day criticizing president obama and talking about national issues — and told his election night party, \" if we can do this in trenton, nj, maybe the folks in washington, dc, should tune in their tvs right now and see how it's done. \" christie's overwhelming win was \" a victory that vaulted him to the front ranks of republican presidential contenders and made him his party's foremost proponent of pragmatism over ideology, \" according to kate zernike and jonathan martin at the new york times, comparing his bipartisan outreach strategy to that of another gop governor who made it to the white house: george w. Bush. \" the real race is just beginning for new jersey gov. Chris christie, as he prepares to weave a careful path to the 2016 presidential nomination, \" writes alexandra jaffe at the hill. He can now point to success with the female and minority voters that the gop has struggled to win over, she notes, although the moderate positions he adopted along the way won't impress republican primary voters. Chris cillizza at the washington post sounds another note of caution. The victory \" was much more about the chris christie brand than the republican brand, \" argues. \" he spent very little time talking about his republican credentials and much more time talking about his own accomplishments in the state. \" the governor and his team may claim the resounding victory shows a republican can win blue states, but \" did christie really run as a'republican?

So students started a petition, addressed to france's minister of education, that has some 12,000 signatures. In the petition, students describe what is now known as \" question m \" as being \" incomprehensible and impossible to answer \" and ask that the question either not count at all or be treated as a bonus question due to its level of difficulty. But not all french students find this reasonable, reports the local. One 18-year-old took to twitter to say it's \" totally wrong \" to petition against a test simply because a question is difficult.

The explorer then hit a ford freestyle, whose driver suffered minor injuries; authorities are still working to determine which victims were in which car, but nbc la says the other victims were a family of four. Culbreath is currently in critical condition in hospital lock-up and appeared to be sedated yesterday afternoon; authorities had not yet interviewed her.

        "summary": "If a scientist in israel is successful, we could someday taste the wine described in the bible. In 2011, elyashiv drori sent students throughout israel in search of wild grapes, which were tough to find in an area that saw alcohol banned for centuries under past muslim rulers, the bbc reports. Relying in part on tips from hikers who had sighted wild grapes, they managed to find 100 types in three years, at least 10 % of which could be used in winemaking, reports jta. Drori has tasked dna biologist mali salmon-divol with sequencing the grapes ' genomes, and she expects some big revelations from that: \" you want to know what this wine looked like, which wine king david drank, white or red, \" salmon-divol says, and the grapes ' genes will reveal that: \" we can see if it's red or white, strong or weak. \" those grapes'dna will be compared to that of an ancient grape she plans to sequence. Jta describes them as looking like a bunch of \" black pebbles \": the remains of 3,000-year-old grapes found near jerusalem's old city. Wines are already made in israel, mostly using grapes native to europe, and drori would like to change that: \" it's not interesting to make chardonnay in israel because there's chardonnay that comes from california … but if you can make wine in israel that isn't elsewhere and that connects to the history here, that's much more interesting. \" but 3,000-year-old wine isn't the oldest to be consumed in israel: haaretz reports that archaeologists have now determined that roughly 40 clay vessels found in 2013 in a 4,000-year-old cellar at the tel karbi palace held red wine.

He and hilaria both refuted the charges ( one source claims hilaria left the funeral early because she wasn't feeling well and tweeted on the way home; hilaria herself claims she was just retweeting others, and the time stamp shows up the same as the original tweet ), but baldwin's refutations were, shall we say, somewhat more spirited than his wife's, and included some homophobic comments. His tweets on the matter were captured by the huffington post and the atlantic wire before he deleted his twitter account entirely.

Along with fellow outraged nsa target brazil, it intends to introduce a new un resolution that would explicitly extend the privacy protections in the international covenant on political and civil rights to communications made over the internet, foreign policy reports. \" the covenant was formulated when the internet didn't even exist, \" one diplomat explains. The un has no practical ability to restrain the nsa, and the resolution doesn't specifically call out the us, but it still represents a clear rebuke — and given this leak, many countries are likely interested in sending that rebuke. But that's not the only avenue germany is pursuing. Its other efforts include: deutsche telekom is trying to get german telecommunication companies to sign onto a plan to shield german web traffic from foreign spies, reuters reports, effectively creating a segregated \" german internet. \" the controls wouldn't work if germans accessed us-based sites like facebook or google, and one professor dismissed it as \" a public relations move, \" but experts worry that if the idea catches on elsewhere, the internet could swiftly become less efficient and open. Along with france — yet another aggrieved us target — germany today asked the us to hold talks during which the countries could agree on rules governing surveillance operations, the new york times reports. Other eu countries may become involved as well. But the offer may be a sign that germany wants this resolved amiably; merkel said the dispute wouldn't affect trade talks, for example.",

The former uber driver — who sued in 2013 in the hope that drivers would be declared employees — says he feels \" utterly betrayed and sold-out by an unjust settlement, \" signed \" under false pretenses, duress, and misinformation, \" that keeps drivers as independent contractors, per business insider. He says attorney shannon liss-riordan, representing the drivers, told him to sign the \" disastrous \" 100-page agreement immediately or \" face a sanction or fine from the court. \" only later did he realize that \" uber drivers are being sold out and shortchanged by billions of dollars while sacrificing the determination of their classification as employees, \" reads a declaration filed by o ' connor's new attorneys on monday, per the guardian. As the \" putative class representative \" of the case, which included some 385,000 drivers, o ' connor says he should have been consulted about the settlement. Liss-riordan says o ' connor wasn't certified as the lead plaintiff, \" but we kept him in the loop on the case and included him in the settlement. \" yet o ' connor is one of many drivers to object; court documents show drivers could have received up to $ 852 million if uber lost in court. A motion claiming the settlement is \" tantamount to a $ 1 billion wage theft \" is now seeking to remove liss-riordan from the case, with one lawyer arguing she \" single-handedly stuck a knife in the back of every uber driver in the country, \" per bloomberg.

That very question is being asked with increasing frequency, writes christopher hooks for politico magazine: with polls showing green party presidential candidate jill stein capturing as much as 6 % of the national vote, it's flaming some democrats ' fears that she ' ll siphon off enough votes from hillary clinton to hand the election to donald trump. That 6 % is better than one of the party's two major goals: hit 5 % in the general, which would open up federal funding, and get to 15 % in five national polls before then to secure a slot in the presidential tv debates, reports the guardian. Can the party do it? it may need to stop being so \" kooky, \" first, argues hooks. \" it's easy to make fun of the green party — maybe too easy, \" he writes. \" here is a party that aims to be taken seriously, whose new narrative centers on the theory that 2016 is a year of green party emergence. \" and yet their convention at the university of houston featured an open-mic session with lines like, \" isis is a goddess, not a terrorist \"; stein's own statements on vaccines and wifi haven't helped. That said, he observed a \" dichotomy \" there, with the \" kooks \" standing shoulder-to-shoulder with attendees \" with credible and considered political beliefs. \" hooks writes that it's possible that some of bernie sanders'successes — say, with organizing — could transition to the greens, but even success wouldn't guarantee success. \" the green party's presidential bids peaked in 2000, only to see, in 2004, its momentum wiped out and a democratic party that had moved right to fight bush. \" read his full piece here.",

The sacramento bee reports that the judge took less than 30 minutes to throw out a $ 4 million defamation lawsuit from lang her, a 26-year-old former university of california, davis, student who stood trial twice for allegedly assaulting fellow student yee xiong at a party in 2012. Instead of going to trial a third time after the first two resulted in hung juries, he pleaded no contest to assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury — but also sued xiong and three of her siblings for calling him a rapist in facebook comments. Her claimed the facebook posts caused him \" mental and emotional distress. \" mcgregor scott, who represented xiong, says the lawsuit is part of a trend of men found guilty of sexual assault trying to sue their victims, the guardian reports. Xiong has previously called the lawsuit a \" slap to the face, \" per ap. \" this was all about causing her additional grief and causing her additional stress and revictimizing the victim for no purpose, \" says scott, who believes monday's decision will deter similar lawsuits from other sex offenders — especially since the judge ordered her to pay attorney's fees. Scott actually worked pro bono, and he plans to donate any fees he receives to an organization that supports rape victims.",
