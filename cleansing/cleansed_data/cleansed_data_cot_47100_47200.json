        "summary": "The new york post's front page today features a picture of the last moments of the man who was pushed in front of the subway and killed yesterday, above the blaring headline, \" doomed. \" it's obviously sparked outrage on various levels, with many questioning whether the cover, a picture of ki suk han trying desperately to climb back up on the platform, is appropriate, while others wonder why the photog was snapping the picture instead of trying to help. In the post, the photographer explains his actions thusly: \" i just started running, running, hoping that the driver could see my flash.... In that moment, i just wanted to warn the train — to try and save a life. \" the post notes that the photographer fired off his flash \" repeatedly \" while running toward the train, and adds that he wasn't strong enough to actually lift the man to safety. But, as bloggers and internet commenters alike point out, it seems more likely the camera flash would have blinded the train operator than alerted him to the person on the tracks. The atlantic wire's headline sums up the reaction to the photo: \" who let this man die on the subway? \" adding to the controversy is the post's sensational headline: \" pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die, \" it reads, adding, \" doomed. \" police have released a video of han and the suspect, who is still at large, arguing before han's death, the wall street journal reports. Witnesses say the suspect had been harassing people on the platform, and han was trying to calm him down when the suspect started screaming at him. Han's wife says she and her husband had fought just before he left home around 11am, and that he had been drinking. Police did find a bottle of vodka on him, and one witness claims han was the one who started the argument.",

            "There's one big question about today's intense cover of the new york post: why didn't anyone help him? if there's enough time to capture a dying man's last moments before getting hit by an oncoming train that's that worthy of a tabloid cover, couldn't the photographer have lent a hand? that's what the post's team of writers implicitly answers in the first half of their story about ki suk han — the man pushed onto the tracks of a new york subway train by a panhandler monday afternoon. \" post freelance photographer r.

Getting a conductor's attention with a flash — and maybe even blinding him with it — doesn't seem like the way you'd necessarily help someone that's clinging to the subway platform. And that's the burning question on the twitterverse's mind: and that's assuming they can get past the macabre rubber-necking of the whole thing: the post's picture of the suspect ( right ) isn't as clear as han's dying moments. And one of the reasons people couldn't help him, according to one witness, was that people had crowded on one side of the platform to avoid han and the panhandler — according to this timeline, han was pushed right before a train came, and since people were crowded on the other side, he couldn't be helped in time. Abbasi, the photographer, explains why he was shooting instead of running with the other people trying to save han: \" the most painful part was i could see him getting closer to the edge. He was getting so close, \" abbasi said. \" and people were running toward him and the train. \" \" as i was running toward the train, the man i believe pushed him ran the other way, and i heard him say, 'goddamn"

Jerry brown broke the bad news yesterday by youtube: his state is facing a $ 16 billion deficit, not the $ 9.2 billion shortfall he had projected in january, the san francisco chronicle reports. Brown blamed the budget gap on lower-than-expected tax receipts and the loss of spending cuts, which were blocked by court order and federal officials to protect the needy. Now, brown says, the public had better support his ballot measure in november to boost taxes and raise $ 9 billion. A balanced budget is required by june 15, but the state senate's republican leader predicts that \" another phony budget \" will be passed by a simple majority of democrats. Advocates for those who use health and human services, however, are predicting harsh cuts when brown reveals his proposed budget tomorrow: \" the cuts are expected to be big, bad and brutal for california families, \" says one. A state senator calls the new deficit \" as bad as our worst fears have been. The options get fewer and fewer. \"",

            "Sacramento -- california's budget deficit has jumped to $ 16 billion, forcing gov. Jerry brown to call for even deeper cuts in state spending when he releases his revised budget plan on monday. Brown revealed the dramatically higher deficit in a web video posted on youtube on saturday. Lower than projected tax receipts along with the loss of proposed spending cuts already rejected by the courts and the federal government have increased the gap, the governor said. Brown's january budget had projected a $ 9.2 billion deficit for the fiscal year beginning july 1. \" this means that we will have to go much further and make cuts far greater than i asked for at the beginning of the year, \" brown said in the video. Administration officials declined to provide specific details on how they arrived at the new estimate or what would be included in the deeper cuts. The video was released by brown's campaign team for his november ballot measure to increase the income tax on high earners and the sales tax on everyone. Brown concluded his campaign statement with a call for californians to join him in working to pass the measure, which the administration estimates would bring in $ 9 billion in additional tax revenue. He warned that if the measure fails, it would result in \" severe damage \" to public safety and schools. Risky assumptions the new deficit numbers are a stinging blow to the governor's oft-repeated promise to turn around california's troubled finances. Since passing the budget last june, brown and democratic legislative leaders have touted their work, saying they had slashed the $ 26 billion deficit left by republican gov. Arnold schwarzenegger by nearly two-thirds. However, that budget plan relied on a number of risky assumptions, including a projection that tax revenue would grow by an additional $ 4 billion. Most of that money never materialized, and federal officials and the courts have blocked proposed cuts to the in-home supportive services program for the elderly, blind and disabled, along with rejecting increases in co-pays for hospital and emergency room visits for people on medi-cal. In addition, lawmakers have turned down about $ 1.5 billion in proposed cuts for welfare and child care services, along with reductions in the cal grants program that provides financial aid to college students.

        "summary": "The orlando shooting has raised anew the issue of the powerful weapons used by gunmen in mass shootings. While police initially said omar mateen used an \" ar-15-type assault rifle, \" they have since clarified that he used a sig sauer mcx rifle. A look at some of the coverage: the washington post looks at those two weapons and finds that they're similar in broad terms: \" a highly portable, customizable, easy to operate and accurate rifle. \" but one big difference is in the mechanics of how the bullet is propelled and the next round readied. It's \" direct impingement \" vs. \" piston gun, \" as the post explains here. The sig sauer can use magazines common to other semiautomatics, \" but otherwise has no major parts that interface with ar-15s in any way, shape or form, \" says the bearing arms blog. ( the post bashes media ignorance on the subject. ) the economist digs into the controversy over use of the term \" assault rifle, \" which gun-rights advocates say is inaccurate because a gun such as the ar-15 \" shoots only one round per trigger-pull. \" orlando station wftv offers a primer on topics such as the difference between semi-automatic and automatic weapons. ( the ar-15 and the sig sauer are in the first camp; the military's m16 is in the latter. ) pbs newshour did a segment on the ar-15 here. A philadelphia daily news columnist explains how she bought an ar-15 in seven minutes. Two huffington post writers got it done in 38 minutes. A new york daily news writer fires an ar-15 for himself. He's \" mostly terrified \" as a result. Though he's taking flak for saying he got a temporary case of ptsd. Fivethirtyeight looks into the complicated topic of how such weapons are covered under gun laws.",

The supreme court tossed out a lawsuit against the former attorney general in an 8-0 vote today, finding that he did not misuse his power or violate the 4th amendment. American muslim abdullah al-kidd sued after being arrested at dulles airport and held for two weeks, ostensibly as a \"material witness \" in a terrorism case, without ever being called to testify or charged with a crime. Supporters of the former university of idaho football player accused ashcroft of misusing his authority by seizing al-kidd with no reason to believe he committed any crime. But the high court found ashcroft's use of the law did not clearly violate the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, in a decision that continues a trend of shielding top officials in the bush administration when lawsuits are brought over their conduct during the \"war on terror, \" the los angeles times notes. But, the ap adds, justice anthony kennedy wrote that the case does raise questions about how the government can use the material witness statute and justice ruth bader ginsburg said al-kidd's \"ordeal is a grim reminder of the need to install safeguards against disrespect for human dignity, constraints that will control officialdom even in perilous times. \"",

The grinning, curly-haired barris became a familiar face as creator and host of the gong show, which aired from 1976 to 1980. The program featured performers who had peculiar talents and, often, no talent at all. When the latter appeared, barris would strike an oversize gong, the show's equivalent of vaudeville's hook. As the gong show and barris ' other series were slipping, he sold his company for a reported $ 100 million in 1980 and decided to go into films. He directed and starred in the gong show movie, a thundering failure. Afterward, a distraught barris checked into a new york hotel and wrote his autobiography, confessions of a dangerous mind. In it, he claimed to have been a cia assassin, though the book ( it was made into a 2002 film ) was widely dismissed by disbelievers who said barris had allowed his imagination to run wild.

Glamorous photographs of the event document clinton's short speech addressing the issue of climate change, as well smartly-dressed attendees enjoying themselves. A standard ticket to the event cost £ 125, with some understood to have paid up to £ 1,000 for a chance to meet the politician. But other photographs, taken from outside the venue, show hundreds of people queuing along a wall near to the old vic tunnels, waterloo, and guests entering through doors painted with graffiti. <noframe>twitter: michael liebreich - if i were former president of the us i wouldn't let people stand in line for an hour to meet me under a railway arch! <a href= \" http://search.twitter.com/search?q=stillwaiting \" target= \" _blank \" >#stillwaiting</a></noframe> a source told the daily telegraph: \" we arrived, there was perspiration dripping off the walls and the place absolutely stank.

        "summary": "\" the cancer world is forever changed. \" that's what a researcher is saying following the fda's approval of america's first-ever treatment that genetically alters a person's cells to fight cancer. The customized treatment to be administered at certified medical centers involves drawing a patient's blood, genetically engineering their white blood cells, called t cells, turning them into a \" living drug \" that fights the disease, before re-dripping them back into the patient. It's expected to be a 22-day turnaround for novartis ' kymriah treatment. Kymriah, which can cause a potentially life-threatening immune reaction, is so far approved only for b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but companies are working to develop similar therapies for additional cancers. Just don't expect them to come cheap; kymriah carries a $ 475,000 price tag, reports the new york times. Though analysts had expected kymriah to cost $ 750,000, the founder of patients for affordable drugs tells forbes the cost is \" excessive, \" while stat news notes that that number doesn't include hospitalization and travel fees. Novartis ceo joseph jimenez, however, says developing the treatment cost more than $ 1 billion. And in order for investors to continue to advance medical science, they need to get a proper financial return, he says. His compromise: there will be no charge if a patient doesn't respond within a month. For those who do respond — in a trial, 52 of 63 leukemia patients went into remission within three months of treatment, though the disease often kills quickly — the cost is less than that of a bone-marrow transplant, a doctor tells the times. \" this is a big paradigm shift, using this living drug, \" says a pediatric oncologist. \" it will provide a lot of hope. This is the beginning. \"",

New york consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in seven months in september as americans were more optimistic about the job market and income prospects, a private sector report showed on tuesday. The conference board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 70.3 from an upwardly revised 61.3 in august. It was the highest level since february and topped economists ' expectations for 63, according to a reuters poll. August was originally reported as 60.6. \" despite continuing economic uncertainty, consumers are slightly more optimistic than they have been in several months, \" said lynn franco, director of the conference board consumer research center, said in a statement. The expectations index climbed to 83.7 from 71.1, while the present situation index gained to 50.2 from 46.5. Consumers ' labor market assessment improved. The \" jobs hard to get \" index slipped to 39.9 percent from 40.6 percent the month before, while the \" jobs plentiful \" index rose to 8.3 percent from 7.2 percent. Looking six months ahead, 16.3 percent expected income increases, up from 16 percent, while",
            "Home prices kept rising in july across the united states, buoyed by greater sales and fewer foreclosures. National home prices increased 1.2 percent in july, compared to the same month last year, according to the standard &amp; poor's/case shiller index released tuesday. That's the second straight year-over-year gain after two years without one. The report also says prices rose in july from june in all 20 cities tracked by the index. That's the third straight month in which prices rose in every city. Steady price increases and record-low mortgage rates are helping drive a housing recovery. In the 12 months ending in july, prices have risen in 16 of 20 cities. In phoenix, one of the cities hardest hit by the housing bust, prices are up 16.6 percent in that stretch. Prices in minneapolis and detroit have risen more than 6 percent. \" we are more optimistic about housing, \" david blitzer, chairman of the s&p's index committee. \" stronger housing numbers are a positive factor for other measures, including consumer confidence. \" prices fell from a year earlier in atlanta, chicago, new york and las vegas. The s&p/case-shiller index covers roughly half of u.s. Homes. It measures prices compared with those in january 2000 and creates a three-month moving average. The july figures are the latest"

        "summary": "British cops are investigating whether a serial killer locked up for nearly four decades could be behind two cold cases in sweden. Police in the southern swedish city of malmö say a passenger ferry list shows that \" yorkshire ripper \" peter sutcliffe was apparently in the area in september 1980 when the body of 26-year-old teresa thörling was found dumped at a construction site, kvällsposten reports via the local. At the time, that murder was linked to the brutal killing one month earlier of gertie jensen, 31, in gothenburg. Swedish sleuth bo lundqvist confirmed to the newspaper that malmö cops told uk authorities in 1981 that the truck driver may have been in the city around the time of the murders. That lead went nowhere after interpol reported — wrongly, it turned out — that sutcliffe was not there. Interpol later corrected that version in a telex that apparently wasn't spotted by uk cops until last year, when a cold case squad took another look at the two unsolved murders. They have another major clue to pursue: a hair recovered from thörling's body that could identify her killer. Lundqvist confirmed that uk cops have asked his department for help. \" they wanted answers, \" he tells kvällsposten, including forensic evidence and \" whether sutcliffe was named in any investigations. \" sutcliffe was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, per the guardian, after being sentenced to life in prison in 1981 for the murders of 13 women in the uk in the late 1970s, and the attempted murders of seven others. Although the statute of limitations has lapsed for the two murders in sweden, sutcliffe could be prosecuted under uk law. ( a letter reopened a very old case. )",

        "summary": "Maya civilization was no mere collection of city states using slash-and-burn farming — that we learned earlier this year. Now archaeologists are looking deeper into an airborne survey that revealed a formidable civilization double the size of medieval england at its peak 1,200 years ago, ars technica reports. The survey, which used lidar ( light detection and ranging ) to peek beneath the jungle foliage, revealed some 61,000 buildings, draining canals, fortresses, and roads across roughly 828 square miles. What archaeologists are saying about those details in science: population: about 7 million to 11 million people populated the central maya lowlands — an area including some of belize, guatemala, and yucatan — between 650 and 800 ce, the late classic period. How did researchers crunch that number? by counting the structures per square mile and estimating how many were houses. Big cities like tikal likely had hundreds of people per square mile, per discovery. Farming: a huge agricultural effort was needed to keep all those mouths fed, livescience notes. Imagine a complex grid of channels providing flood control and irrigation, with grids up to six feet wide and 20 inches deep, some stretching over half a mile. Still, densely populated cities like naachtun and tikal had to import food from other maya kingdoms to survive. Causeways: in earlier maya times, from 1000 to 250 bce, cities were linked by elevated roads or causeways up to 65 feet wide and up to 13 miles in length — but they fell into disuse when so-called preclassic cities were abandoned. Yet their faded ghost outlines are visible on the lidar. Fortresses: mayans built more of them than expected in the late classic period, and sophisticated ones, too. One has walls over 25 feet high and an olympic-pool-size reservoir: \" in other words, this place was ready for a siege, \" says ithaca college archaeologist tom garrison. \" that is not really the type of conflict that we think about for the ancient maya. \" overall: \" seen as a whole, terraces and irrigation channels, reservoirs, fortifications, and causeways reveal an astonishing amount of land modification done by the maya over their entire landscape on a scale previously unimaginable, \" a tulane researcher says in a statement.",

        "summary": "Characters in the wildly popular video game fortnite can snag celebratory emotes — read dances — based on real moves. There's the floss, the worm, and the electro shuffle. There's the turk dance as featured on scrubs and this seinfeld scene. And, to 2 milly's dismay, his milly rock dance, dubbed \" swipe it \" within the game. The rapper, real name terrence ferguson, says maker epic games included his signature move in fortnite, where it can be bought for $ 5, without his permission and without offering compensation, in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed wednesday in california, per variety and the cbc. His lawyer tells kotaku race is a factor, noting it appears \" they believe that they can railroad african-american talent because they doubt that there will be any legal consequence, \" though the kotaku points out non-african-americans could lob similar accusations. The cbc notes that while fornite is free to download, in-game purchases of things like emotes have reeled in more than $ 1 billion for epic games since 2017 in the us alone. While 2 milly registered the milly rock with the copyright office on dec. 4, a lawyer explains it's typically the name of a dance move that's trademarked, rather than the move itself. The cbc's take: it was a \" smart move \" for epic to tie its brand to the most viral of moves, but it comes at a cost for the originator: \" if you weren't already following rap or internet culture, it would be easy to assume the dance originated in fortnite. \"",

Board member thomas mcinerney will receive $ 2 million base pay, twice what mayer received, plus an annual bonus up to another $ 2 million, nbc reports. The disparity has raised some eyebrows, especially since mcinerney will apparently have a much easier job than mayer: at new spinoff company altaba, he will be overseeing the company's stake in chinese internet firm alibaba in what fortune describes as a \" practically no-show job \" taking care of a fund that \" almost runs itself. \" mcinerney, former cfo at media company iac, may also be eligible for up to $ 24 million in long-term incentive grants, more than mayer's last such grant.

In what was ruled a suicide, the 28-year-old was found dead in her cell at the waller county jail three days after she was arrested during a july 10 traffic stop. An independent special prosecutor says the process isn't over and the grand jury will meet again in january to consider charges against the trooper who arrested bland, though a lawyer for her family says it has all been a \" sham of a proceeding, \" the houston chronicle reports. The family's lawyers have been unable to access evidence from the secret grand jury proceedings, including a report from a texas rangers investigation, the ap reports. Bland's sister tells the chicago tribune that the family has been \" shut out of this process from the very beginning \" and is \" in pieces this holiday season. \" \" the timing of the grand jury, in my personal opinion, is disrespectful to the family and it continues to pour salt on a wound that has already been ripped open for the past five months, \" she says. Bernie sanders also weighed in on the case, nbc news reports. \" there's no doubt in my mind that she, like too many african-americans who die in police custody, would be alive today if she were a white woman, \" he said in a statement. \" we need to reform a very broken criminal justice system. \" ( the family's lawyers say the county made an insulting claim when it sought to have their wrongful death lawsuit dismissed. )",

The bad news: scientists aren't yet sure if the drugs will actually work on humans who have the zika virus, the washington post reports. The drugs — pha-690509, a drug currently being tried on cancer patients; emricasan, a drug currently being tried on patients with liver damage from hepatitis c; and niclosamide, which is used for gut parasites — \" are very effective against zika in the [ petri ] dish, but we don't know if they can work in humans in the same way, \" says the co-author of the study that led to the discovery. The study, which screened 6,000 existing drugs, used the drugs on lab-grown human cells; the three aforementioned drugs allowed those cells to live longer when faced with zika infection — and sometimes even recover completely, though zika damage was previously thought to be impossible to reverse. The next step is to test the drugs in animal models, then, if the results are replicated, test them on humans. Meanwhile, in addition to the problems zika is already linked to in unborn babies, usa today reports that the virus is now also linked to hearing loss.",

        "summary": "In 2012 the average medical-school grad owed about $ 162,000 in student loan debt. But many of these newly minted doctors can, thanks to one government program, pay just a few hundred dollars a month on their loans — in some cases, far less than the interest that's being tacked on each month. And after 10 years, when the balance has swelled above $ 200,000, they can have whatever they owe wiped clean. The wall street journal takes a look at this expanding class of borrower: graduate or professional-school students with a six-figure loan who don't expect or intend to pay it back. That attitude isn't a flouting of the rules. As the journal reports, one 2012 program allows borrowers to pay a max of 10 % of their discretionary income ( that's any adjusted gross income beyond 1.5 times the poverty line. ) and while undergrads are prevented from taking on more than $ 57,500 in federal loans, as of 2006 grad students stopped being restricted in a similar manner: once they've borrowed $ 138,500 in government stafford loans ( that figure includes undergrad debt ), the roughly 10-year-old grad plus loans step in, in many cases eliminating the need to fill the gap using private loans. Grad plus was actually supposed to help taxpayers, because the interest rates on these loans were higher. But a 2007 measure allows those working full-time for a federal agency or nonprofit to have their balance wiped away if they make 10 years of payments ( which, yes, can be capped at the aforementioned 10 % ) on time — at the taxpayers ' expense. The journal notes that 73 % of america's hospitals are nonprofits or government owned, meaning doctors working there qualify.",

Jimmy suggs, 28, and zackary kuykendall, 26, of vinemont were arrested sunday and charged with fourth-degree arson — a felony because lives were endangered by the wildfire, a sheriff's statement cited by the denver post notes. They reportedly started the campfire thursday night going into friday at a campsite on private property near the peak to peak highway and cold springs road, and while it may be reasonable to assume the men didn't mean for the fire to get out of hand, the sheriff's statement notes they're being charged because they didn't make sure the fire had been put out properly or ensure the ashes were cooled down before they left the site, al.com reports. The cold springs fire, which officials say was helped along by hot, dry weather and winds that blew the still-smoldering ash, has since saturday spread over more than 600 acres, burned down three homes ( one of which is a nederland firefighter's, cnn reports ) and three other buildings, and caused the evacuation of more than 2,000 people southwest of boulder. Thirty other homes are still said to be at risk depending on how hot it gets and which way the wind blows. One resident who was evacuated tells the boulder daily camera that as she was leaving the area, she \" looked and saw an inferno in the sky. \" both suspects are being held at the boulder county jail.

Alain carpentier describes the progress of a patient who's set to go home almost six months after receiving the artificial heart carpentier invented, the new york times reports. The 68-year-old man, who has requested confidentiality, is \" living a completely normal life \" now and has been \" pedaling like crazy \" on a stationary bike, carpentier tells le parisien. The patient suffered from terminal heart failure — an inability of the heart to pump enough oxygen and blood to other organs — and underwent surgery on aug. 5 at the university of nantes hospital, according to carmat, the device's manufacturer. Unlike other artificial hearts ( most notably, the jarvik heart first implanted in a human in 1982 ), the carmat heart combines cow tissue with synthetic material to stop blood clots and is self-regulating, more closely imitating a real heart's contractions, smithsonian reports. More than 23 million people worldwide have heart failure, according to the national institutes of health, but options are limited: transplants are usually necessary, but there aren't enough donated organs to go around, the times notes. The carmat heart was first implanted in december 2013 — unfortunately, the patient died a little over two months later, but his survival doubled the previous success of 30 days. The august operation took six hours, as opposed to the eight hours it took for the 2013 surgery, according to the times. If further trials go well, carmat plans on selling the device for between $ 162,000 to $ 208,000. Investors were obviously pleased with the news: carmat shares were up 18 % this morning, leading to a company market value of $ 387 million, reuters reports.

            "Sean spicer, right, and jason miller, left, talk with the media at the trump national golf club bedminster on nov. 19. ( jabin botsford/the washington post ) president-elect donald trump named republican national committee official sean spicer as white house press secretary, filling what is likely to be a challenging position given trump's sometimes hostile relationship with the media and his propensity to bypass staff to communicate directly with the public on twitter. Spicer, the rnc's communications director since 2011 and chief strategist since 2015, has become an increasingly visible presence on trump's team since the gop nominee won the election on nov. 8. Noted for his combative television interviews, he helps to lead daily transition news media calls and has a close relationship with rnc chairman reince priebus, trump's incoming chief of staff. Trump also announced that longtime aide hope hicks, his campaign press secretary, will serve as director of strategic communications, and dan scavino will continue his current role as director of social media. Jason miller, who leads the transition calls, will be communications director.

The samples of feces range from scant insect excrement to gigantic elk and lion poo, as well as the doodoo of a human baby, reports the bbc. The museum even includes fossilized feces dating back some 38 million years, reports mental floss, and also covers the more metaphorically gross side of dung, such as the diseases spread without toilets or proper sanitation. In an innovative display that required a custom built drying contraption, the crap curators have placed the fetid samples in illuminated resin spheres that include related facts hidden behind toilet lids. And while it's billed as the first-ever museum devoted to poop, huffington post has tracked down two similarly themed endeavors, including a poop museum that opened in italy last year and the one and only mr. Toilet house in south korea, which features statues of an assortment of mammals doing number two. Curator nigel george, meanwhile, tells the bbc that \" small children naturally delight \" in the topic while \" for most of us, under the layers of disgust and taboo, we're still fascinated by it. \" ( what does a unicorn have to do with poop, anyway? )",

Or as mashable puts it: \" sony's out of its mind. \" the new nw-wm1z is meant to appeal to super serious audiophiles. And the verge reports the big changes are in the hardware. The walkman is made out of gold-plated copper to reduce magnetic interference and contact resistance. It also separates its analog and digital circuitry and includes a \" dual clock circuit with low phase noise quartz oscillator. \" and if any of that makes sense to you, you might be the target customer. Sony's expensive new walkman is \" as bulky as an original ipod, \" according to mashable, and features a 4-inch touchscreen that \" can be a little terrifying \" in the amount of information in displays. It boasts 256gb of storage and works with direct stream digital audio files, which have a sample rate 64 times better than cds. Still, mashable \" wasn't blown away \" by the sound quality. And the verge states all this will only result in \" minor sound quality improvements that only serious audiophiles with equally high-end headphones will notice. \" for everyone else, there's this walkman cassette player currently going for $ 5.00 on ebay.

Not realizing that his dad, sanford harling jr., who was 58, had jumped out of a second-story window, sanford harling iii, who was 12, broke free from a family friend and ran in to help him, reports the philadelphia inquirer. \" i ' m going to go back in to get my dad because he's walking with a walker, \" he said. That's the last time anyone saw him alive; firefighters found the 12-year-old on the first floor, where he'd died of smoke inhalation and thermal burns in the feb. 5, 2016 blaze. On wednesday, sanford was among 20 people named national heroes by the carnegie hero fund, which has bestowed the honor upon nearly 10,000 people since it was established in 1904 with the mission of freeing them from \" pecuniary cares resulting from their heroism, \" reports patch.com.

As chief john difava was leaving the campus, he spotted collier's cruiser, reports nbc news. \" i always make it a point to say hello, \" says the chief. \" i chatted with him for a few minutes.

Less than an hour later, collier was shot to death in his car, allegedly by the tsarnaev brothers as they unsuccessfully tried to steal his gun. Video footage from the scene shows two men approaching collier's car and his brake lights flickering, reports the boston globe. Then one of the two men extends an arm as a muzzle flashes and a bicyclist rides by. The latter appears to have been graduate student nate harman, who testified today that he was riding home and made eye contact with one of the two men by the car. Harman identified him as dzhokhar tsarnaev. ( previously, jurors got a close look at tsarnaev's written messages inside the boat where he was hiding. )",

Mellin paused for 20 seconds during his argument — and then told the jury that tsarnaev waited 12 times that before walking away. \"the defendant knew what kind of hell was going to happen, that he unleashed, \" he said. That hell encompassed more than the pain the dead and wounded suffered, mellin said. It's the torment the survivors still feel, the families — like the richards and the corcorans — that were physically and emotionally \"blown apart \" by the events of that day.

It reports that a man identified only as john read its initial coverage of the mystery and called police, telling them his brother robert and a female became stranded at the location of the rocks — swift bay — in 2013. Unable to operate their yacht out of the bay, john says they dramatically weathered a crocodile attack while en route to shore in an escape raft; upon landing there, he says they constructed the sos from rocks. The story ended, john says, with the pair being picked up by another yacht, and police are \" very confident \" that story is \" legitimate and it's the real deal, \" senior sgt. Dave rudd with the western australia police tells the bbc. The west australian reports police have thus far communicated with robert, who is currently sailing in the mediterranean, only via email, with rudd offering this: \" he said after three days they saw a plane flying overhead and realized the sos sign couldn't be seen from the air. \" but rudd says police have seen photos taken from the time of the pair's alleged stranding, and \" we can see from the photo that it's the same location and the same sos. \" ( an sos led to this desert-island rescue. )",

Sgt. Kerry schmidt of the ontario provincial police says reports started filtering in after 11pm of a vehicle that was \" all over the highway \" just north of toronto.

The police were eventually able to box the vehicle in, and were thrown by the kid they found in the driver's seat. \" [ the boy ] had just been finishing playing grand theft auto at home and wanted to find out what it was like driving a car, \" schmidt says. He adds, per global news: \" it's pretty frightening to think of what could have happened, all over the highway with no experience and with the mindset of running from the cops. \" schmidt says no charges are being filed — the opp is letting his parents decide how best to deal with his behind-the-wheel transgression.

That's what the swedish city of kiruna has decided because iron mining below it has weakened the foundations of houses and buildings, tech insider reports. Now lkab, the state-owned company behind the mining, is dedicating billions of dollars to moving kiruna about 2 miles east. The ongoing 30-year plan includes relocating 21 particular buildings ( like kiruna's city hall and its attractive church ) and paying residents to have their homes demolished and rebuilt at the new location, the guardian reported last year. An arctic city that's in darkness most of the year, kiruna \" will be a bit like a walking millipede with a thousand feet, moving, crawling, slowly... Toward the east, \" says an architect in a promotional video for the plan. Critics say social networks will be shattered by the move and relocated residents will have higher rents, but on the bright side, the new city is supposed to be more walkable and economically diverse. Plus there's a lot at stake: founded partly by lkab in 1900, the city of 18,000 supplies the european union with 90 % of its iron. \" there might be some concerns, but the mine has to keep operating, \" a resident says. It's not a first, either: cities have been relocated before for economic or safety reasons, and other towns are considering moves over climate change, the new york times notes. Only possible problem for kiruna? \" iron is under the new town center, too, \" admits a city official. \" [ but ] it will be too expensive for lkab to move the city again. \" ( in another mining story, apple and microsoft are said to use cobalt mined by kids. )",

Elizabeth — head of state of australia, canada, and more than a dozen other countries besides the uk — became queen on feb. 6, 1952 after her father, king george vi, died while she was on an official visit to kenya with her husband, prince philip, nbc news reports in a look at her long career. The queen is expected to celebrate the milestone privately at her sandringham estate as she has done on \" accession day \" in previous years, the telegraph reports. Royal gun salutes will be fired elsewhere, including a 41-gun salute from the king's troop royal horse artillery in london. The queen broke queen victoria's record for longest-serving british monarch in 2015 and became the world's longest-serving living monarch with the death of thailand's king last year. Itv reports that the palace has reissued a 2014 photo of the queen by david bailey to mark the occasion. In the photo, elizabeth wears sapphire jewelry she was given by her father as a wedding gift in 1947. Bbc royal correspondent peter hunt notes that the day is a \" moment for contemplation rather than celebration \" for the queen because it marks the anniversary of her father's death as well as her ascension to the throne. She turned 90 last year and hunt predicts that she will cut back her duties further in the months and years ahead, with grandson prince william expected to take on more.",

The 23-year-old moab native is the son of an officer, one of the 150-plus law enforcement members who in 2010 spent days hunting for lance leeroy arellano, who allegedly shot utah state parks ranger brody young nine times on nov 19 of that year near the poison spider mesa trailhead. Arellano was believed to have himself been shot and was thought to not have made it out of the desert; officers combed a 15-square-mile area without luck, and a $ 30,000 reward has remained on the table since. \" for a poor college student, that's pretty appealing, \" shumway tells the salt lake tribune. Two days into his search, he found something. Shumway and his 15-year-old brother decided to zero in on a two-mile area that contained a number of caves, and on wednesday at the mouth of a \" cave-like area \" near tangri-la ranch found a bone and bag. They returned the next day with police, who were unable to fit inside what the grand county sheriff's office describes in a press release as a \" narrow entrance way to a void in the rocks that was approximately 6 feet long and 3 feet high and approximately 3 feet wide. \" shumway went in and found more bones, clothing, and a bag with a gun in it; he believes an animal dragged the initial items he found from the cave.

Trump said the us will impose a 25 % tariff on steel imports and 10 % tariff on aluminum to shore up the struggling industries, capping a fierce, months-long internal debate that divided some of the president's top advisers. The move is likely to invite retaliatory measures from foreign countries, raising the specter of a trade war between the us and several other steel-producing countries. It was not immediately clear whether the tariffs would be phased out over time and whether trump would follow the advice of his national security advisers and exempt some countries from the tariffs to avoid harming key steel-producing us allies. Trump announced the move during a hastily arranged meeting with steel and aluminum executives, even though the policy he announced is not yet ready to be implemented, let alone fully crafted. He acknowledged the policy is \" being written now. \" \" we ' ll be signing it next week. And you ' ll have protection for a",
            "Washington — president trump said on thursday that he would impose stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum, making good on a key campaign promise and rattling stock markets as the prospect of a global trade fight appeared imminent. ( you can read more about friday's developments here. ) in a hastily arranged meeting with industry executives that stunned many inside the west wing, mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect \"for a long period of time. \" the action, which came against the wishes of mr. Trump's pro-trade advisers, would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, effectively placing a tax on every foreign shipment of those metals into the united states. The president told more than a dozen executives that he wanted the tariffs to apply to all countries, one executive in attendance said. Mr. Trump argued that if one country was exempt, all other countries would line up to ask for similar treatment, and that metals could end up being shipped to the united states through exempted countries. Mr. Trump's authority to impose such sweeping tariffs",
            "Our steel and aluminum industries ( and many others ) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and smart trade!"

Hayabusa2 is scheduled to drop a german-french lander with four observation devices onto the asteroid next week. It later will attempt to land on the asteroid itself to collect samples to send back to researchers on earth.

Most of the foods were bread-like — things like hot dog buns, bagels, pizza, tortillas — and they came from brands ranging from wonder bread to those marketed as healthy, like village health. The world health organization says there's \" abundant evidence \" that ada can cause asthma and skin sensitization, according to reuters. It also releases the carcinogen urethane when baked. In plastics, it's used to make materials more flexible. For bakers, it bleaches flour, making dough easier to work, and bread fluffier. Ada was thrust into the public eye earlier this month when foodbabe.com launched a petition demanding that subway stop using it. The chain acquiesced, but said it believed the chemical was safe — and some scientific experts do agree; one tells bloomberg that toasting bread creates far more urethane than ada.",

After the officer, who made roughly $ 60,000 a year, according to the daily mail, starting driving the supercar to the police station where he was based, colleagues became suspicious. Anti-corruption investigators discovered the 37-year-old sergeant had been making hundreds of thousands of dollars from brothels located in two parts of london, the bbc reports. The birmingham mail reports on how iqbal and his partners operated: drugs and sex were offered to men outside strip clubs; those who were interested were then taken via car to a brothel, where their credit cards were overcharged. \" their greed was their downfall, and when they were seen driving around in their supercars, it didn't take us long to piece together exactly what they were up to and take action, \" a police spokesman says of iqbal and his associates. Iqbal was sentenced to seven years in prison in september, but reporting restrictions on the case were only lifted this week after he was found guilty on unrelated charges of making unauthorized attempts to access police intelligence systems on behalf of a local religious leader. Police say they're going to try to seize the assets iqbal gained through criminal activity, as well as his police pension.

Intravenous treatments gaining popularity in asia, the uk, and the us involve weekly or twice-weekly doses of glutathione, the naturally occurring antioxidant which is believed to reduce melanin production in the body, reports the new york times. But while oral and topical glutathione treatments have undergone study, experts say no major studies have explored the possible dangers of iv glutathione treatment, which can go for $ 150 to $ 400 per dose, with some spas recommending as many as 30 doses to be repeated every few months. That's despite the fda stating injectable skin-lightening products \" are potentially unsafe and ineffective, and might contain unknown harmful ingredients or contaminants. \" an editorial in the bmj suggests iv glutathione treatments may also pose a cancer risk, while the philippine government has linked the practice to skin disorders, thyroid dysfunction, kidney dysfunction, and even death, per newbeauty. Reports of side effects are lacking in the us, where treatments are less frequent than in the philippines, involve smaller doses, and are administered by doctors and nurses. But \" it's probably not a good idea to use something when you don't know all the potential side effects, \" a dermatologist tells the times. ( this country has banned skin whiteners. )",

        "summary": "The republicans wrapped up their last debate before new hampshire votes on tuesday, a particularly feisty affair in which marco rubio took the biggest hits. One theme emerging is that it was a good night for governors but not for frontrunners: dan balz of the washington post: \" marco rubio hit a wall named chris christie. Donald trump couldn't put down an aggressive jeb bush. And ted cruz had to issue a public apology to ben carson. \" on the flip side, \" christie was the relentless prosecutor. Bush was knowledgeable and, in contrast to some earlier performances, tough and direct. Ohio gov. John kasich carved out space as a candidate ready and willing to work across party lines. \" david graham at the atlantic has a similar take: \" marco rubio, ted cruz, and donald trump all hit rough patches, while three often-overshadowed governors — chris christie, jeb bush, and john kasich — delivered some of their strongest moments of the campaign so far. \" christie hit rubio the hardest, but bush and trump also took their shots at him. The new york times focuses on the rubio onslaught. The ap takes note of cruz's \" very human moment \" in talking about his sister's fatal drug overdose. The new hampshire audience didn't like trump, and the feeling was mutual. The hill recounts the booing. A cnn media writer says cruz lied about the network's reporting. Politico rounds up the \" most explosive moments. \" abc news offers up the \" best lines \" of the night. Don't miss the disastrous introductions.",

        "summary": "An undercover video targeting planned parenthood made waves all the way to congress. Now, the anti-abortion activist behind it says there's more where that came from. David daleiden, 26, tells the new york times he has enough footage — after infiltrating the organization over two and a half years — to release a new video each week for three months, in addition to a second video yesterday. It shows eight minutes of a conversation with mary gatter, a planned parenthood medical director, and implies the organization sells fetal body parts for profit, per the daily beast. A similar claim was made via the first video, though full footage showed the discussion of legal fetal-tissue donation and processing costs. Daleiden says his work was funded by $ 120,000 from at least a dozen donors who \" believed in the mission and wanted to see it done. \" the money helped him nab footage he knew was \" going to shock a lot of consciences, \" he tells the times. But though the \" valuable consideration \" of human fetal tissue is illegal under us law, planned parenthood is allowed to accept \" reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue. \" in the most recent video, gatter suggests $ 75 per specimen. An actor posing as a buyer tells her \" that's way too low, \" and suggests $ 100. Gatter says she was actually going to suggest $ 50. At one point she jokes that she wants \" a lamborghini, \" but quickly says \" no \" and laughs. \" we're not in it for the money, \" she adds. Daleiden's next videos will likely filter out as congress works on spending bills, which could affect planned parenthood's funding, and as republican presidential candidates duke it out in the first televised debates.",

On september 4, 2006, irwin and his cameraman, justin lyons sank into the waters soaking the great barrier reef near queensland, australia. They had been in the area filming a series called ocean's deadliest, when what lyons described in an interview with australia's studio 10 as a \"massive \" stingray approached irwin. Lyons then watched as the stingray stabbed irwin \"hundreds of times. \" \"i panned with the camera as the stingray swam away and i didn't know it had caused any damage, \" he said. \" it was only when i panned the camera back that i saw steve standing in a huge pool of blood. \" lyons said reports at the time that irwin had removed the stingray's barb from his chest had been inaccurate. \"it [ was ] a jagged barb and it went through his chest like hot butter, \" he said. The crocodile hunter was quiet in his last moments"

Yet when braxton broke the ribs and femur of their 3-month-old daughter, he served just two years in prison, while hall was sentenced to 30 years for allowing the abuse to happen. She was one of 28 mothers in similar situations uncovered in a recent buzzfeed investigation, one of just three such cases in which the mom got a longer sentence than the man who abused the child. Now, buzzfeed reports, she is applying for her sentence to be commuted. Clemency seems to be the only option left: she lost her appeal; the judge denied a request to modify the sentence, of which 20 years remain; and she's not eligible for parole until 2030. In court during her trial, as well as in statements outside of court, hall described the abuse she says she suffered; the judge who sentenced her acknowledged that she seemed to fear braxton. She tells buzzfeed things got especially bad when their second child was born in 2004. She says she never saw braxton hurt their kids. But that fall, she brought their 20-month-old son to the hospital when she noticed his leg was swollen; he had a fractured femur and broken bones, leading suspicious authorities to check on his 3-month-old sister and find her injuries. Both parents were arrested. Hall ended up pleading guilty and testifying against braxton, though she did not get a reduced sentence in return and he did get a deal when prosecutors realized their case against him was going south.
