China daily sums up the chinese-language original, which say the train would start in northeast china, cross siberia, follow a 125-mile tunnel under the bering strait to reach alaska, then cut across canada to the continental us. The two-day trip at an average speed of about 225mph would cover about 8,000 miles in all, reports the guardian. \" right now we're already in discussions, \" says an engineer quoted in the original story. \" russia has already been thinking about this for many years. \" in the context of china's other massive railway projects, it's not unlikely they'd be considering something like this, writes lily kuo at quartz. But it's still \" absurd, \" she adds, estimating the cost of the china-russia-canada-america line at more than $ 200 billion. Beijing would reportedly pay for it all. \" china may be one of the best examples of countries that love mega-infrastructure projects, but even this may be too much. \"",

        "summary": "Love never fails, and now researchers say they've discovered a burial ritual ostensibly designed to allow a couple's love to persist forever. Reporting in the journal plos one, they say that french noblewoman louise de quengo, who died at the age of 65 in 1656, was buried in france with her husband's actual heart atop her coffin, the organ placed in a heart-shaped lead urn. Toussaint de perrien had been buried 125 miles away seven years earlier. The ritual, perhaps designed to allow \" couples to be reunited in death, \" is a \" phenomenon that had until now not been noted. \" louise de quengo's heart was also missing from her body, but neither it nor her husband's burial site have been located. National geographic explains that while it wasn't unheard of for french aristocrats to have specific body parts buried in separate locations out of political or religious concerns, there's no record of this being done with a romantic intention. Researchers discovered de quengo while studying bodies from a convent in rennes in brittany that had been the premier burial spot for the city's elite, reports live science. As part of the team's analysis of 133 bodies from the 14th and 15th centuries and 483 from the 1500s and 1600s, they found three other lead urns holding hearts; these were buried in the church choir. The researchers speculate that they were hidden there so as not to be seized during the french revolution and refashioned into bullets. De quengo's body was reburied at a family castle; her husband's heart sits in a lab freezer. ( hundreds attended a funeral for an 8,400-year-old man. )",

He followed that by creating freddy krueger, an unhinged character who still terrorizes audiences. But the director long wanted to break free from the horror genre he defined, so when producers bob and harvey weinstein approached him with a three-picture deal, they sweetened the offer by letting him direct 1999's \" music of the heart, \" the uplifting story of an east harlem violin teacher who brings music to scores of underprivileged students. It starred meryl streep, earning her an oscar nomination. Still, as alfred hitchcock's name came to be synonymous with thrillers and sergio leone's to spaghetti westerns, wes craven's name will forever be linked to horror films. The filmmaker died sunday at his los angeles home after a battle with brain cancer, according to his representative. He was 76. Toward the end of his more than four-decade career, which included forays as a television producer and novelist, he made peace with his fearsome reputation. \" sometimes you fight what you are, what you're doing, \" he told abc news in 2010. \" at a certain point you say",

Craven was a humanities professor before leaving academia to work in post production and on porn movies, using a pseudonym. His first credited feature was the controversial shocker \"the last house on the left, \" which he wrote, directed and edited in 1972.

            "Wes craven, the prolific filmmaker behind \" a nightmare on elm street \" and the \" scream \" movies, kicked off his career with a film so violent and gory, censors in britain banned it from theaters. He followed that by creating freddy krueger, an unhinged character who still terrorizes audiences. But the director long wanted to break free from the horror genre he defined, so when producers bob and harvey weinstein approached him with a three-picture deal, they sweetened the offer by letting him direct 1999's \" music of the heart, \" the uplifting story of an east harlem violin teacher who brings music to scores of underprivileged students. It starred meryl streep, earning her an oscar nomination. Still, as alfred hitchcock's name came to be synonymous with thrillers and sergio leone's to spaghetti westerns, wes craven's name will forever be linked to horror films. The filmmaker died sunday at his los angeles home after a battle with brain cancer, according to his representative. He was 76. Toward the end of his more than four-decade career, which included forays as a television producer and novelist, he made peace with his fearsome reputation. \" sometimes you fight what you are, what you're doing, \" he told abc news in 2010. \" at a certain point you say",
            "Legendary horror director wes craven, known for the \"scream \" films and the \"nightmare on elm street \" series, died sunday in his los angeles home of brain cancer. He was 76. Known for creating the iconic freddy krueger character from \"nightmare on elm street \" and ghostface in \"scream, \" the versatile filmmaker also wrote and produced features, directed for television and wrote novels. Craven was a humanities professor before leaving academia to work in post production and on porn movies, using a pseudonym. His first credited feature was the controversial shocker \"the last house on the left, \" which he wrote, directed and edited in 1972. He followed with the blackly comic \"the hills have eyes \" and \"swamp thing, \" an early entry in the comic book genre. He wrote and directed \"a nightmare on elm street, \" with robert englund as krueger and an early johnny depp performance, in 1984.

Of the 16 items pictured, half of them \" are not calorically significant, \" writes rebecca vipond brink at the frisky.

Yes, paltrow's exploits can be \" ridiculous, \" she writes, and no, the snap challenge is not perfect. But critics are missing the point. The challenge is meant to connect those dealing with poverty to those who will never know what it's like to have to deal with poverty. This issue needs \" privileged, wealthy champions, \" because many people misunderstand what it's really like to rely on public assistance ( think of those judgmental stories you've heard of what people use their snap funds to buy ). \" here's the thing: there's no ' winning ' a snap challenge, \" woolard writes. \" perhaps the one thing it can accurately replicate is the judgment that both rich celebrities and underserved single moms can expect for even the smallest of personal decisions, \" whether that decision is to buy food considered \" junk \" or food considered too \" nice \" — like, say, paltrow's.

Nau may be the first american educational institution to try the technology. \" when i started here, i was of the mindset that this is college — students should decide for themselves whether they should show up or not, \" says associate professor brandon cruickshank, who has taught chemistry 101 in a cavernous classroom at the university for 15 years. \" this is no longer high school. \" but over the years, he's seen that attending class does matter. So now he factors class participation into his students ' grades. Most of his students are freshmen. \" we do have to say to a lot of those students that it really is important that you do show up to class — you are not going to do well if you're not there, \" he says.

In particular, transnational organized crime – crime that reaches beyond borders – has been a topic frequently explored, and occasionally even glamorized, by the media and through film. But for the people of california, transnational organized crime is not simply a subject for the silver screen. It is an everyday reality associated with drug trafficking, sexual slavery, and shocking violence that affects nearly every community in the golden state. Transnational criminal organizations are self-perpetuating associations operating across national borders that use violence, corruption, and fraud to protect and disguise their illicit, profit-driven activities. This report examines how these groups – with roots in places around the globe – have flocked to california to engage in an increasingly diverse range of criminal activities.

A study of the \" elusive \" sea swimmer published monday in the historical biology journal describes the great white-like megalolamna paradoxodon as likely having lived in shallow coastal waters and, based on its tooth size, averaged about 13 feet in length ( though some may have grown as large as 24 feet ). And kenshu shimada, the lead author of the study out of depaul university, is calling it \" remarkable that such a large lamniform shark with such a global distribution had evaded recognition until now, \" a press release notes. The teeth, which were up to 1.8 inches long, were found in california and north carolina, as well as overseas. The shark lived about 20 million years ago during the miocene era, scientists believe. And because its teeth — which consisted of \" grasping \" teeth in the front and \" slicing \" teeth in the back — resembled not only those found on other otodontidae sharks ( of which the also-extinct megalodon shark was also a member ), but also seemed to be larger versions of those of lamniform sharks ( which include today's mako sharks and great whites ), the scientists created an entirely new species just for this creature.

            "Chicago, oct. 3 ( upi ) -- analysis of ancient shark teeth, collected in japan, peru and the united states, has yielded a new extinct shark species named megalolamna paradoxodon. Scientists described the species in a new study, published this week in the journal historical biology. The new species belongs to the family of extinct sharks known as otodontidae, a group that includes the famed megalodon. The teeth of megalolamna paradoxodon recall those of other otodontidae species, but they also resemble an enlarged version of the teeth of modern salmon shark from the genus lamna. For this reason, scientists were forced to create a new genus, megalolamna, under which to classify the novel species. The largest megalolamna teeth measure roughly 1.8 inches in length, suggesting the ancient shark was the equivalent of a modern great white -- approximately 13 feet long. The species boasted grasping teeth in the front of its mouth and slicing teeth in the back. \" it's quite remarkable that such a large lamniform shark with such a global distribution had evaded recognition until now, especially because there are numerous miocene localities where fossil shark teeth are well sampled, \" kenshu shimada, a paleobiologist at depaul university, said in a news release.

The los angeles times reports on the case of nurse jennifer hyatt, 44, who was detained on jan. 1, 2017, after a dispute with her husband, says an attorney with the council on american-islamic relations, which is representing hyatt in the suit, per a release. Hyatt says a deputy yanked part of her two-piece hijab off her head and wouldn't give it back. She says when she relayed it was a religious necessity because she was a muslim, a deputy replied, \" not in here, you're not. \" a second deputy allegedly removed the second piece of her hijab. \" i was spoken to like i was trash, \" she says. Hyatt's complaint says she \" experienced humiliation when both her religious beliefs and personal integrity were violated, \" per courtroom news. The arkansas native adds that she's \" shocked and disappointed \" this could happen in the \" supposedly tolerant state of california. \" the times notes what the deputies allegedly did may be a violation of the religious land use and institutionalized persons act, which protects prisoners'religious rights. An lapd officer says that in his department, police can ask a detainee to remove a religious item like a hijab, but only for a quick search; the detainee would then get the covering back, or a see-through alternative. Hyatt's suit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. A rep from the sheriff's office wouldn't comment. ( new york city reached a big settlement with three muslims. )",

        "summary": "Milk in your coffee not cutting it? perhaps you'd like to drop a pat of butter and some coconut oil in instead. Oh, and don't forget the eggs. The ingredients are all part of a new trend in coffee drinking, apparently driven in the us by health entrepreneur dave asprey. He's all about improving physical and mental performance, becoming what he calls \" bulletproof. \" the idea for bulletproof coffee — packed with butter and coconut oil — came from tea made with yak butter in tibet, he explains. At munchies, charlie norton sings the praises of butter coffee, which, he warns, should be made only with low-toxin coffee and grass-fed butter. Butter, he notes, is \" full of good cholesterol and vitamin k2, \" while coconut oil helps the immune system. If making the concoction is too much trouble, a california company has an instant version which also includes egg yolks and vanilla, the los angeles times reports. The effects of the coffee, according to norton, are the stuff of fantasy. At work after drinking it: \" i make a few dynamic phone calls i had been putting off, answer emails i had been procrastinating on, and, by the time i go out on a 10km run at lunchtime, i am floating in a depersonalized way. \" he's far from the only one extolling its virtues, jezebel notes. Actress shailene woodley recently tweeted that the coffee \" may very well be one of the greatest of human achievements. \" norton does warn, however, that the stuff isn't \" for the faint of heart \" and must be combined with careful eating. And health experts give it mixed reviews; some have concerns about the fats involved, jezebel adds. ( need a cup for your butter coffee? here's one for just $ 199. )",

Officials say acts of heroism probably saved scores of lives during the massacre, the ap reports.

        "summary": "The public scolding of drugmaker mylan over the soaring price of epipen seems to have worked: the company on thursday didn't lower the price, but it made the allergy injections cheaper for many by expanding its assistance programs. Specifically, it doubled eligibility for relief to 400 % of the poverty level, declaring on its website that a family of four that earns $ 97,200 would pay no out-of-pocket expenses, reports the wall street journal. It also said it is offering a savings card that will cover up to $ 300 for a two-pack of the allergy injections, amounting to a savings of 50 % for those who were otherwise paying the full price, reports the ap. \"we recognize the significant burden on patients from continued, rising insurance premiums and being forced increasingly to pay the full list price for medicines at the pharmacy counter, \" says ceo heather bresch. \"however, price is only one part of the problem that we are addressing with today's actions. \" on wednesday, hillary clinton joined those calling for mylan to lower the price, which has risen about 500 % since 2008, notes reuters.",

Nonetheless, act 10 has proven invincible to numerous legal challenges since introduced in 2011, the milwaukee journal sentinel reports. Federal appeals courts upheld the law twice, and in 2011, the state supreme court said the state didn't violate wisconsin's open meetings law when act 10 was passed. Now that his legislation has survived its last challenge, gov. Walker is claiming victory for \" hard-working taxpayers. \" \" act 10 has saved wisconsin taxpayers more than $ 3 billion, \" he says.",

        "summary": "While neither president trump nor pope francis has said what the two talked about during their short private meeting wednesday, white house and vatican sources state the topics included terrorism, climate change, and peace, cnn reports. A statement from the vatican states the pope talked about \" the promotion of peace in the world through political negotiation and interreligious dialogue. \" the vatican also states the two talked about protecting christians in the middle east. And rex tillerson says the pope encouraged trump to remain in the paris climate agreement. Here's what else you may have missed from the meeting, which trump called \" fantastic \": politico reports trump was \" effusively gracious \" with pope francis, seemingly having gotten over his earlier feuds with the pope. The atlantic runs down a few of those past disagreements. Photos of a smiling trump and stern-faced pope have been circulating, making it look like — as mashable puts it — the 28-minute meeting \" went about 27 minutes and 55 seconds too long \" for the pope. While the internet has been having its fun with the dour-faced pope photos, cnn reports there's at least one photo from the meeting in which the pope appears to match trump's enthusiasm. Following the meeting, which he called the \" honor of a lifetime, \" trump tweeted: \" i leave the vatican more determined than ever to pursue peace in our world. \" the new york times reports steve bannon was noticeably absent from the vatican visit, having returned to dc early. Bannon has been a frequent critic of the pope, whom he's called an elitist and a socialist and blamed for supporting the migration of muslim people to europe. Usa today explains why melania and ivanka trump were wearing all-black everything, including black veils, when they met the pope. It turns out papal visits include a strict dress code for women. Finally, as previously reported, pope francis caused a bit of confusion when he pointed to the president and asked melania trump what she was feeding him. According to the ap, the pope mentioned potica, a traditional slovenian dish, but the first lady thought he said \" pizza. \"",

To date, federal and state governments have only released limited current specific data about the status of emergency preparedness. We want to shine a light on preparedness because all americans have the right to expect fundamental health protections during public health emergencies no matter where they live. This report helps identify the areas of strength and weakness that should be addressed in our nation's capabilities. We have good news! the states had the highest scores ever",

A mcdonald's employee is currently being questioned, and while cops stressed that no arrests have been made, they also sounded hopeful that they were close to catching the killer who has fatally shot four people over the last two months. \"i ' m optimistic about this one, \" said tampa police chief brian dugan, per wftv. But, he added, \"we have to be very careful what we release because this person might be completely innocent. \" the development began when an unidentified employee of a mcdonald's in ybor city handed a manager a loaded handgun and asked him to hold it while the employee went out to get a payday loan, reports the tampa bay times. The manager talked the situation over with another employee, then decided to inform a police officer who just happened to be in the restaurant doing paperwork. The officer called for backup, and police were waiting for the employee when he returned. They took him in for questioning, and soon enough, the police chief called a news conference to talk about the possible break in the case. Police blocked off the employee's red mustang in the restaurant's parking lot, and the tampa bay times reports that two people have been issued tickets in regard to the car: howell e. Donaldson, 52, and howell emanuel donaldson iii, 24. Another mcdonald's employee said the person taken in for questioning was in his 20s and had been driving his father's car. One sign of how the killings have shaken the neighborhood: a push to light up the night with christmas lights, per fox 13.",

In atlanta and memphis, the difference shoots all the way up to 20 %. One researcher attributes this reversal to education: three women get a college degree for every two men. The bad news? this \"reverse gender gap \" holds true only for under-30, single, childless women, time reports. Even so, that researcher says women are gaining enough leverage through this trend that they may not lose the gains as they get older and start families. But this news should be taken with a grain of salt, writes tracy clark-flory on salon. \"when we talk about young women out-earning men, we are talking about averages, \" she writes.

So what the heck happened? a police statement explains that a \" personal water craft \" got close to moryn on the paddleboard and caused a \" significant wake, \" which, \" combined with strong winds, \" pushed him off the board. He then decided to swim to shore rather than try to follow the board and go about his travels, the statement adds. Thanks to selfies on the camera, social media posts, and public tips, officials were able to track down his american travel companion in arizona, who filled them in on moryn's whereabouts.

As of friday, he was a mere civilian barred from leaving the country as authorities raided his kuala lumpur properties. The rapid fall centers around $ 4.5 billion missing from a state development fund overseen by najib before his election loss to mahathir mohamad last week, reports the wall street journal. Though najib was cleared of wrongdoing while in office, the malaysian anti-corruption commission has reopened the investigation based on claims he intervened to hide his pocketing of $ 681 million from fund 1malaysia development berhad ( 1mdb ), some of which he allegedly spent on shopping sprees for his wife. During recent raids at his properties, police say they seized 284 boxes of handbags from gucci, chanel, and hermes; 72 suitcases holding jewelry and rolex watches; and at least $ 157,000 in cash. Najib's lawyer says the investigation represents \" unwarranted harassment, \" per the bbc. But malaysia is only one of six countries investing the fund. The us — which claims najib's stepson used 1mdb funds to produce films, including the wolf of wall street — alleges $ 1.7 billion was laundered through american banks, reports the new york times. Najib is now to testify in front of the anti-corruption commission, reuters reports, citing one member as saying evidence shows $ 10.6 million was sent to najib from 1mdb's former subsidiary. Per the journal, the investigation may be widened to include the 2006 murder of mongolian model altantuya shaariibuu, who acted as translator during a purchase of submarines while najib was defense minister. Two members of najib's security detail were convicted of the murder, though one had his sentence overturned.",

The younger kim was accompanied by senior party and military officials, while mourners in the street praised him and the official state media touted his legitimacy — indicating that north korea's transition of power so far appears to be on track. The united states appears divided over how much to push pyongyang for reform at this delicate time, reports the wall street journal. Some advocate pressuring the young leader now, as he is still consolidating power, while others believe foreign countries should back off and let north korea stabilize, as a new generation of leaders might be more open to change. Kim jong il's official funeral will be held dec. 28, but foreign delegations will not be invited. \"there will be new leaders in north korea.

The company has just introduced the domino's wedding registry which allows couples to register for gift cards ranging from $ 20 to $ 100, each with a theme — including the $ 60 \" 2am bachelor party feast, \" the $ 25 \" wedding night, \" the $ 30 \" thank you card-a-thon, \" and the $ 25 \" post-honeymoon adjustment to real life. \" wedding guests who purchase a gift card can choose to print a receipt to include in a card or send an email version to the bride and groom, who can redeem the gift cards on dominos.com, per the knot. Domino's says it was inspired by the various ways in which couples include domino's in their wedding day, like by ordering pizza as a pre-wedding meal or a late-night snack. \" we wanted to make it easier for people to ask for and receive something that they ' ll really use, \" a rep explains, adding the registry is a great option for couples who can't agree on wedding gifts but have a \" shared love of pizza. \" a bride-to-be tells the detroit free press that she's already signed up. \" i just thought it was really fun, \" she says.

The first allied submarine lost in world war i, and australia's first sub lost ever, has finally been found on the 13th search mission for a vessel that vanished more than a century ago. The hmas ae-1 was spotted by an underwater drone in almost 1,000 feet of water near papua new guinea's duke of york islands during a search effort that began last week, report the bbc and sydney morning herald. It was the first time the sub had been spotted since disappearing off rabaul, papua new guinea, while carrying 35 crew members from australia, new zealand, and britain on sept. 14, 1914 — roughly six weeks after the war broke out. There was no distress call, but its final communication put the sub in the general area in which it was found, the same area islanders had reported a \" monster \" appearing and then disappearing beneath the water. \" the boat and her crew, who've been on eternal patrol since 1914 … have now been found, \" australian defense minister marise payne announced thursday, per abc australia, calling it \" one of the most significant discoveries in australia's naval maritime history \" and one that \" will bring peace of mind to the family and descendants of the crew who lost their lives on board. \" the search team held a short service to commemorate the crew members. The governments of australia and papua new guinea will now preserve the site, reports reuters. Meanwhile, officials will try to determine why the 180-foot-long sub sank, apparently in one piece. The leading theory is that its pressure hull was punctured by a reef, as a small german survey ship was the only enemy vessel in the area at the time. ( a world war i u-boat was just found. )",

More than 100 people gathered at the uss arizona memorial to bid farewell to haerry. Afterward, a team of divers delivered an urn containing haerry's ashes deep below pearl harbor, placing it in turret no. 3, near the remains of the 1,177 who perished. Of the 335 who lived that day, only five are still alive. It took haerry 50 years to tell his story, per the ap. Only 19 when the bombs fell, he raced to an anti-aircraft gun, but found it unarmed. A massive blast split the ship apart, sending haerry into the fiery, oily water. He made it to shore, grabbed a gun and began firing. He spent days retrieving bodies. Many survivors \" went on to fight the war like raymond haerry, \" says martinez. Like 41 other arizona survivors who made the same choice, he says haerry \" has returned to his ship and his shipmates. \" ( a formerly \" unknown \" sailor killed at pearl harbor finally got the burial he was due. )",

As one of his last moves in office, outgoing kentucky gov. Steven beshear signed an executive order tuesday that grants voting rights to nonviolent felons who've finished their sentences, the new york times reports. \" once an individual has served his or her time and paid all restitution, society expects them to reintegrate into their communities and become law-abiding and productive citizens, \" the democrat said at a news conference. \" a key part of that transition is the right to vote. \" the brennan center estimates the number of immediately eligible felons at 140,000 ( the sentencing project puts that figure closer to 100,000 ), with another 30,000 to come. Still not permitted to vote: felons with new pending charges, as well as those with sex crimes, violent crimes, bribery, or treason to their names. One of the main reasons for the drive to restore felon voting rights is to address the racial disparity present in such a ban. The sentencing project estimates one in 13 black men nationwide can't vote because of their felon status, the highest rate of any demographic, per the times. The paper notes that gov.-elect matt bevin has the legal right to swoop in and change or dump the executive order, but one of his reps tells the paper that bevin \" has said many times that the restoration of voting rights for certain offenders is the right thing to do \" and that he ' ll check out the order over the next few weeks to make his final assessment.",

Citizens currently serving sentences will get a certificate of rights restoration and a voter registration application in the mail when they complete their sentence and get their discharge papers.

At forbes, madeline berg looks at how schumer pulled off the huge accomplishment. She made $ 17 million last year between her comedy central show, a comedy tour, a book advance, a super bowl commercial, and her role in trainwreck. The big difference, berg writes, is how much schumer makes for touring. While tours typically make big bucks for male comedians, the biggest females names in comedy see most of their success thanks to tv and movies. Meanwhile, schumer became the first woman to do stand-up at madison square garden back in june. \" onstage, many women still face the gendered stereotype that women just aren't funny, or double standards with subject matter, \" such as raunchy material being considered taboo territory, berg writes. There's also the fact that, as studies have shown, women find funny men attractive — while men don't particularly care if a woman is funny or not when considering how attractive she is. \" this means that there is more pressure on men to be funny, \" berg writes, and thus our culture has evolved so that there are more male comedians than female in stand-up. That makes it harder for women to break through, a fact schumer is changing. See the rest of the list here.",

But the scientists tracking her just don't know if she will \" turn west towards texas or... Turn back and go out into deeper water, \" bob hueter explains to reuters. She's swum some 5,000 miles since august, staying near the coast on her journey. Betsy weighed 1,400 pounds and was 12 feet, 7 inches long when she was tagged, but both sharks have probably gotten bigger since then. Betsy was last spotted june 5, some 120 miles west of sanibel, fla. \" every animal is causing us to reset what we thought was going on, \" hueter tells usa today. For instance, he tells the chronicle, experts previously believed the sharks went to the gulf in the winter, when the waters aren't as warm; the expectation was that they'd summer off cape cod, and feed on seals there.

Ok, so maybe they don't say that, but they could start following research published thursday in current biology. The salt lake tribune reports researchers discovered the smaller a howler monkey's testicles, the deeper and louder his mating call. According to a university of utah press release, primatologist leslie knapp believes this is because the loudest monkeys spent so much energy developing the hyoid bones in their vocal boxes, other, uh, areas were unable to grow as much. Researchers also found the quieter, larger-balled monkeys lived in groups with multiple males, while the louder, smaller-balled males lived with harems of females, the tribune reports. Knapp tells the tribune her \" calls-and-balls paper \" is the first study to show a trade off of benefits between pre-mating and post-mating. Basically a louder voice means less competition to reproduce, but bigger testicles mean more sperm and a greater chance at reproduction. \"they are different solutions to the same problem, \" knapp says in the press release. While knapp would only relate the study to humans in that women prefer deep voices and men with deep voices have more sexual partners, the daily dot goes further, saying the study is evidence men with small balls overcompensate when it comes to women. \" i am not a scientist, but the parallels between obnoxious men who catcall, mansplain, and heckle, and these screeching simians is alarming, \" writes ziwe fumudoh.

According to die welt, the proposal also stresses the importance of policies to improve the birth rate in germany, currently one of the lowest in europe.

            "Germany is considering a new tax to soften the impact of a rapidly ageing society, media reported on wednesday, as europe's top economy becomes greyer and its population slumps amid low birth rates. Top members of chancellor angela merkel's centre-right christian democrats ( cdu ) will propose that germans over the age of 25 should pay a proportion of their income to mitigate the country's demographic crisis. The amount has not been fixed, but officials are mulling a tax of about one percent of income, according to the die welt daily. \" we have to consider the time after 2030 when the baby boomers of the 50s and 60s are retired and costing us more in health and care costs, \" said guenter krings, author of a \" position paper \" to be discussed in cabinet at the end of april.

Such is the debate raging over a simple duck ramp installed by government officials at the capitol reflecting pool, which is drawing quite a bit of attention, despite its seemingly lighter nature. The new york times reports two duck ramps were installed at the reflecting pool monday to make it easier for ducklings that have made their home at the pool to get in and out. The president of city wildlife — which worked with the architect of the capitol agency to design the ramps — explains the ducklings risk drowning from exhaustion or starving to death if they can't hurdle a \" high curb at the water's edge. \" a video shows ducklings using the newly installed ramp to avoid the curb. But walker, a republican from north carolina, is not amused. \" if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck, it must be government waste, \" he tweeted monday, alongside a photo of one of the ramps. He didn't find much support, though. \" i for one am glad american tax dollars paid for you to get mad online about a duck ramp, \" replied comedian patrick monahan. Another user said the ramp \" looks like a really cheap way to offset the ecosystem disruption of the concrete structure, \" while one simply told walker to \" duck off, \" per the huffington post.

            "Honolulu, hi ( wcmh ) – under fresh scrutiny after the weekend's ballistic missile alert, internet users found a seemingly worrisome photo taken at hawaii's ema headquarters. A photo taken during an associated press tour at the ema's headquarters in july 2017 shows a post-it note stuck to a computer screen with a password written on it. Richard rapoza, an emergency management agency spokesman, told hawaii news now that the password is authentic and was actually used for an \"internal application. \" rapoza did not say what the password was used for. \"it wasn't for any major piece of software, \" rapoza added. Rapoza did acknowledge that it's not a good idea to leave passwords around in plain sight. On saturday, the agency mistakenly sent an alert to cellphones with a warning to seek immediate shelter because a ballistic missile was \"inbound to hawaii. \" the agency followed up with a cellphone alert 38 minutes later saying the initial alert was a false alarm. The agency posted a note on twitter about the false alarm about 10 minutes after the initial alert. But it took officials longer to work up and push out the false alarm alert to cellphones."

Fortunately, several recent studies have revealed ways we can replenish our ability to resist temptation, ranging from watching reruns to gargling with glucose. Now there's evidence of still another method of getting ourselves back on track, and it's a strategy as old as they come: prayer. A pair of german psychologists — malte friese of saarland university and michaela wänke of the university of mannheim — report people can exercise self-control without depleting their reservoir of that vital resource if they engage in \"a brief period of personal prayer. \" their study is published in the journal of experimental social psychology. \" even brief social interactions can activate cognitive resources … providing a cognitive boost that can benefit subsequent self-control attempts. \" their study featured 79 people ( mostly women, and largely made up of psychology students ). Forty-one ( just over half of the total ) described themselves as christians; another 24 were atheists or agnostics, while 14 listed other religious affiliations.

Assuming all of the senate's 48 democrats also oppose devos, that means she'd have 50 yes votes and 50 no votes if no other republicans oppose her, with vice president mike pence potentially breaking the tie, the hill reports. Sen. Susan collins of maine was the first to announce on the senate floor that she would vote against devos, making her the first republican to oppose one of president trump's cabinet nominees. Sen. Lisa murkowski of alaska was the second to announce she would vote no. Collins said it was a \" very difficult decision, \" but that she was \" troubled and surprised \" by devos ' lack of familiarity with the individuals with disabilities education act. Murkowski said she had \" serious concerns \" about devos, and that \" thousands, truly thousands \" of her constituents had called her expressing their own concerns. Both collins and murkowski expressed concerns with devos'support for school voucher programs, politico reports. In order to avoid using pence as a tie-breaker, republicans would need to flip at least one democrat up for re-election in a red state next year — and sen. Joe manchin of west virginia, seen as one of the most vulnerable dems in such a position, also said wednesday he would vote against devos.",

China is also openly prodding malaysia to move faster as beijing faces pressure from citizens; the plane carried 154 chinese, the ap notes. Malaysia \" bears inescapable responsibility \" for the delay, china says. House homeland security chair michael mccaul has also expressed frustration, but the us military says governments are collaborating. Elsewhere: china has also slammed manufacturers boeing and rolls royce as well as us intelligence. Amid a search of their homes, the plane's pilots haven't been linked to terrorist groups. Still, us officials are raising the possibility that the flight could have been a \" dry run \" for a terrorist attack. \" we can't discount it, \" an official tells the journal. A friend of pilot zaharie ahmad shah says a flight simulator found in his house was simply there \" because he wants to share the joy of flying with his friends, \" cnn reports. One malaysian newspaper yesterday suggested the plane may have been flying low — at about 5,000 feet — and amid mountains to hide from radar. Cnn notes that it can't confirm that story.",

        "summary": "Every couple of years, a mysterious rare fish that resembles a serpent washes up on some beach, generating buzz about the bony sea creature and worries about earthquakes until it fades from memory again. In what national geographic pegs as a \" poorly understood phenomenon, \" it's happened again, this time in the philippines. People on the shore of carmen in agusan del norte plucked a dead oarfish — aka regalecus glesne, or the \" king of herrings \" — from the waters wednesday, just days after a fisherman had found another one not far from that spot. And the sunstar notes four others have been retrieved in the philippines since january, including one that was initially found alive in cagayan de oro on saturday, though it later died. A facebook post from wednesday shows images of the oarfish pulled onto the carmen beach, with smiling beachgoers holding the outstretched fish for photo ops. The oarfish — which can grow to over 30 feet in length — is seldom spotted because it usually lives up to 3,300 feet deep in the ocean. While scientists are puzzled as to why they occasionally pop up on the surface near land, and subsequently perish, they think it may have something to do with the wind and powerful currents. Longheld anecdotal evidence links the surfacing of the oarfish to subsequent earthquakes — the mirror notes it is sometimes called \" the messenger of the sea god \" — but whether there's any scientific grounding to that remains unclear because of a lack of research. \" the intrigue remains, \" observes the geographic. ( the earthquake theory goes back a long way in japan. )",

A military drone spotted the wreckage of the aseman airlines flight north of yasuj on tuesday, and though two helicopters flew over the site, they were unable to land in the rough terrain. Revolutionary guards spokesman ramezan sharif tells state tv that the plane hit the peak of the 14,500-foot-tall mount dena, then crashed 30 yards down its slopes, per reuters. Footage aired on state tv showed the tail of the plane, while a still image reportedly showed dead bodies in snow, reports fox news. Authorities initially said there was little hope of survival for the 59 passengers and six crew members on board, and that message didn't change tuesday. Still, family members are waiting for a foot search to confirm their worst fears. In the meantime, some are calling attention to iran's aging aircraft fleet — blamed on us sanctions blocking the import of parts — and questioning whether the twin-engine turboprop atr 72 should've even been in the air. First flown in 1993, the plane sat in storage for six years before it was pulled back into operation in november, according to a website operated by the flight safety foundation. \" would you have flown on the same plane? \" a man shouted at minister of roads and urban development abbas akhoundi on monday, per reuters.
