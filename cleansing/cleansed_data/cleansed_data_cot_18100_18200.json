I will point them out to caran, i know that she will be saving all the notes to share with the boys as they get older. Posted on 12/08/2013 by organizer marissa aka mpdacna a thank you from caran johnson: i want to thank everyone who has helped my family and me through this most difficult time. We are so blessed to have so many people share their kind thoughts and prayers with us. We are overwhelmed by the support we have received. I would also like to sincerely thank those that graciously donated money. First and foremost, the money will help with the costs associated with the funeral and service for craig. It will also make it possible for me to continue to earn my teaching degree, as craig was working hard to support our family while i am in school. With your donations, i will also be able to provide christmas for our sons, and i cannot express how grateful i am for this. Unfortunately, it seems that most of the media attention has been about my family's loss. I want to let carol shelly and her family know that we are so very sorry that she was hurt in this",

The wlos morning news anchor was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1999; he beat it, but it returned, and doctors told him the chemotherapy he needed would make it hard to have children. He married his then-girlfriend, kelly, in 2000, and after trying to have a baby for years, they adopted malachi, a 1-year-old from ethiopia whose mother had died. When the boy was 3, kelly was diagnosed with a rare type of leukemia, and she died three years later, in 2014. Then, last november, malachi got a headache. The north carolina second-grader ended up being diagnosed with a brain tumor, and fought through two brain surgeries and chemotherapy. But the cancer came back and spread, and last week, the 8-year-old died. Hundreds attended his funeral, wlos reports. Now, siltzer says, \" i think it's clear why [ kelly ] went first — to be there for him. \" he adds that malachi \" was confident that he was going to heaven, and he knew he was going to see his mom there. \" siltzer took his facebook posts about his adventures with malachi over the years and turned it into an e-book, the book of malachi, which he self-published after kelly died and while malachi was already fighting brain cancer. But \" don't feel sorry for any of us, \" the book says. \" this book is not about sorrow, but rather the joy and laughter that arise from everyday life.

And those robots could eventually \" do the work of a dozen low-level associates. They would not get tired. They would not seek advancement ( or ) pay rises. \" a firm's upper echelons would still be populated by actual human lawyers, but the need for associates would shrink dramatically. As such, legal firms could see a \" structural collapse, \" legal futures reports. Those in the top rungs of firms would offer \" real understanding and human insight \" to clients, the report says, and it suggests that because the top partners of 2030 are currently in their 30s, they're likely to push the ai business model. All these changes will apply most to \" very large, high-value commercial firms, \" whereas smaller, specialist firms might see less of an impact, the report finds. Artificial intelligence has already had a big effect on law firms, as the new york times reported in 2011. It juxtaposed two cases: a 1978 case that required $ 2.2 million worth of work by lawyers and paralegals who sorted through 6 million documents, compared to a 2011 case in which software was able to pore over 1.5 million documents for less than $ 100,000.

        "summary": "Hockey legend gordie howe is dead at age 88, the detroit red wings confirmed to cbs detroit friday. His son, marty howe, tells cnn he died friday morning. Howe, a hockey hall of famer and six-time nhl mvp, had an incredible career that led to his nickname, \" mr. Hockey \": he started playing for the red wings in 1946 and won four stanley cups with them. He retired in 1971, but two years later started playing for the world hockey association's houston aeros — with his two sons. He retired again in 1980, but in 1997, he played one last time for the ihl's detroit vipers. He scored 801 goals during his 26 years in the nhl; his all-time leading scorer record in the nhl was eventually broken by wayne gretzky. Howe suffered a serious stroke in 2014, eventually traveling with his family to mexico for a stem cell treatment that, they said, helped him recover. But the los angeles times reports he later suffered several other strokes, had also endured spinal surgery, and suffered from dementia over the past few years. Even so, in march, he celebrated his 88th birthday at joe louis arena with an enthusiastic sold-out crowd. \" when it comes to who was the best hockey player ever, don't even go there with me, \" fellow hockey great bobby orr said of howe in 2003. \" there is no question that gordie is the best of all time. \"",

        "summary": "A wide-ranging, long-term study has cast doubt on the value of annual breast x-rays — and sparked fierce debate in the medical world. The study of 90,000 canadian women over 25 years suggests annual mammograms could be useless or possibly worse than useless: the death rate from breast cancer and from all causes was the same among women aged 40 to 59 who had annual mammograms and those who had only a physical exam, the cbc reports. More than a fifth of cancers found by mammograms were not a threat to the woman's health, but the \" overdiagnosis \" caused them to have unnecessary treatments like chemotherapy, the study says. The researchers say policymakers should reconsider the need for mammograms, arguing that new treatments and better awareness of breast cancer make it less vital to catch cancers so early, the new york times reports. But some experts and groups not involved in the study disagree strongly with its conclusions and argue that one study — no matter how extensive — shouldn't be cause to change public health policy, the los angeles times finds. The american college of radiology called the study \" deeply flawed \" and \" incredibly misleading, \" arguing that it involved \" second-hand \" mammography equipment and poorly trained technicians.",

        "summary": "As the democrats assess their 0-4 record in congressional special elections of late, one person who seems to be taking the lion's share of the blame is nancy pelosi. In georgia, for instance, backers of winning gop candidate karen handel unleashed a torrent of ads linking democrat jon ossoff to the house minority leader, who is, as the hill puts it, \" radioactive \" among conservative voters. Now the new york times rounds up grumbling among house democrats who think it's time for a change in leadership. One quote that's resounding: \" our brand is worse than trump, \" says rep. Tim ryan of ohio, who tried unsuccessfully to unseat pelosi as party leader last fall. Related coverage: not yet: politico reports that no coup is imminent, but its story rounds up similar sentiment, including this quote from rep. Kathleen rice of new york: \"there comes a time when every leader has to say, ' for the good of the order and for the betterment of the party, it's time for me to step aside. ' and i wish that that would happen right now. \" private grumblings: at nbc news, alex seitz-wald writes that \" for every democratic official or operative publicly calling for new leadership, there are others who privately express the same sentiment. \" he also notes that a democratic candidate in south carolina has publicly stated he won't back pelosi as speaker if he's elected. Defiant: asked about all this thursday, pelosi made clear she's not going anywhere. \"i respect any opinion that my members have, but my decision about how long i stay is not up to them, \" she said, per politico. \"my caucus is overwhelmingly supportive of me. \" she also described herself as a \" strategic, politically astute leader. \" perspective: yes, the democrats went 0-4, but they lost in four red districts, notes nate cohn of the new york times. The losses sting for them, but they were all \" very strong showings, \" better than \" even the most optimistic democrat might have guessed a few months ago. \" worth it? pelosi is a formidable fundraiser — in fact, she's the best nonpresidential politician on that front in history — but \" it's just extremely difficult for ds to argue benefits of nancy pelosi's fundraising skills still outweigh cost of her presence in gop ads, \" tweets dave wasserman of the cook political report.

        "summary": "While buzz continues to build among consumers about apple pay, at least two retailers have already jumped ship: cvs and rite aid. But the drugstore chains didn't simply dump apple pay on a whim — they're part of mcx ( short for merchant customer exchange ), a retailer consortium that's supposedly hard at work building its own mobile payment system, bloomberg reports. That system, called currentc, has already lured the likes of target, lowe's, and walmart and is said to be scheduled for a national rollout sometime in 2015. \" this act by cvs and rite aid heralds the advent of the imminent battle in the mobile pay system, \" a marketing and it professor told bloomberg. There's one major difference between the two systems: apple pay works directly with the three major credit-card companies — visa, mastercard, american express — while mcx will circumvent the credit card conglomerate entirely. What makes mcx more attractive to merchants is that a ) they won't have to pay fees to the credit card companies if they use currentc, and b ) currentc collects transaction data that can be valuable to retailers that want to offer incentives to customers, businessweek reports. Yet when cvs and rite aid took apple pay ( and similar systems such as google wallet and softcard ) off their grids last week, customers were baffled, especially since the system has been reportedly working well and the mcx system won't be ready till sometime next year anyway. One post declares, \" i may go to a cvs, fill my cart with expensive products, then try to pay with apple pay. Silent protest. \"",

Researchers in china have discovered that the odd clumps of yellow matter found on the necks and chests of mummies from as early as 1615 bc are actually lumps of amazingly well-preserved cheese, usa today reports. The small river cemetery no. 5 was uncovered in 1934 then sat forgotten for decades; excavation began in 2003, the new york times previously reported. Dry, salty conditions in the taklamakan desert where the mummies were located helped keep the cheese intact for far longer than any other specimens ever identified. The ancient cheesemakers were a bronze age people who buried their dead under boat-like wooden structures packed in cowhide, creating conditions that \" vacuum-packed \" the bodies and the cheese, says andrej shevchenko, whose study is to be published in the journal of archaeological science. His analysis showed that the extremely well-aged cheese was made with a \" starter \" of bacteria and yeast instead of rennet from the guts of a young animal, creating a low-lactose cheese that asia's lactose-intolerant people could have eaten.

Headquarters, ensuring that the nation's top law enforcement agency will be housed in a crumbling, cramped building in downtown washington for years to come, according to a senior government official. For more than a decade, the government had been searching for a new location in the washington suburbs to replace the 43-year-old j. Edgar hoover building, a brutalist edifice that sits across pennsylvania avenue from the trump international hotel. The hoover building has room for only a little more than half of the 11,000 f.b.i. Employees who work at its headquarters. The rest are scattered among more than a dozen offices in and around washington. A handful of bidders, for sites including greenbelt and landover in maryland and springfield, va., were competing for the right to build a new 2.1-million-square-foot headquarters."

        "summary": "Some of the terrorists were homegrown, but friday night's terror attacks in paris were an international affair that was planned in syria, french prime minister manuel valls warned on monday, the morning after french planes pounded targets in raqqa. Valls warned that france is dealing with a \" terrorist army \" that has more attacks planned, and he said that more than 150 raids took place across the country monday morning. He said france is using the \" legal framework of the state of emergency to question people who are part of the radical jihadist movement, \" as well as \" those who advocate hate of the republic, \" the bbc reports. Cnn reports that the raids resulted in at least 23 arrests and the seizure of weapons related to the friday attacks. In other developments: a french official has identified the mastermind of the attacks as abdelhamid abaaoud, a belgian national and isis extremist, the ap reports. Abaaoud is also believed to have masterminded thwarted attacks on a church and a high-speed train earlier this year. One of the bombers is believed to have been a syrian citizen who posed as a refugee, and the investigation is continuing to find links to isis and to syria, the new york times reports. At least one of the other attackers is believed to be a french citizen who spent time in syria, and authorities say they're probing a wide terror network that extends from syria to greece, belgium, and france. Prosecutors have confirmed the identity of another suicide bomber. Samy amimour, who blew himself up after taking part in the bataclan concert massacre, is a 28-year-old french citizen who was charged in a 2012 terror investigation, reports the ap. The independent has more on abaaoud: the 27-year-old alleged mastermind is from the molenbeek area of brussels, where police have carried out several raids since friday. He is now believed to be in syria, where he is \" one of the most active isis executioners, \" according to rtl. Police are still hunting salah abdeslam, a belgian national believed to have helped coordinate the attacks. A source tells cnn that police stopped the car he was in near the belgian border hours after the attacks, but they didn't detain him or the two people he was traveling with.",

You may not think of such deaths as a global \" public health crisis, \" but that's exactly what they are. We continue to build more roads and put more cars on those roads, and traffic deaths continue to increase, particularly in developing countries. In fact, a new project by the pulitzer center finds that road deaths will soon be the developing world's no. 5 killer. These deaths are \" symptoms of a disease, \" and the cure is safer roads, smarter laws, and better enforcement. Consider nigeria, which up until recently didn't require new drivers to pass a test; south africa, where seatbelt enforcement is dismal; southeast asia, where whole families sometimes ride on one motorcycle, often without helmets; or the dominican republic, where conditions are so bad that the who does not recommend traveling at night. In many countries, police officers are on foot, meaning \" you could run a red light or speed with impunity, \" says a pulitzer center editor. The only way to change this is to bring attention to it in the same way attention is paid to hiv/aids and malaria.

Per the houston chronicle, the mother has filed a civil suit alleging discrimination on the part of the airline. The suit claims the woman, queen obioma, and her children were boarding a san francisco-bound flight in march 2016 when obioma arrived to her seat to find it occupied by a man, who was white. When the man declined to move, obioma eventually agreed to take a different business-class seat, according to the suit. Obioma says she went to the bathroom before takeoff and upon her return the man blocked her from sitting back down. The suit claims obioma was then escorted from the plane and informed it was because of her body odor. As the miami herald notes, most airlines reserve the right to remove foul-smelling passengers at their discretion. However, obioma says she and her family were victims of racism. The suit claims united \" wrongfully singled out ms. Obioma and her children because they were blacks, and punished them because a white man did not want them on the plane. \" the family eventually made it to san francisco, albeit five hours late, and on to canada where obioma's children attend school. In a statement emailed to news outlets, united airlines declined to comment on the \" pending litigation involved in this matter. \" obioma is asking for punitive damages and attorney's fees.",

The hope is to stoke democratic turnout in conservative-leaning states where the party's senate candidates have been put on the defensive by the mishandled rollout of the affordable care act.

Why? obama wanted to remind the teens behind him at the podium that \" that he was once like them, \" write zachary goldfarb and scott wilson. It's a shift for the president, who once shied away from this demographic. He's signalling through this public-private initiative — the idea is to establish programs specifically to help black and hispanic young men — that the subject is going to be a focus of his life's work even after the presidency ends. Obama will surely take flak from some critics for creating a program so tailored to a particular group of minorities and from other critics for not doing it earlier, writes eugene robinson in the post. But robinson is on board. \" my brother's keeper isn't a solution, \" he writes. \" but it's a start. \" less optimistic is another african-american writer, jamelle bouie in the daily beast. The program may be \" worthwhile, \" but it's not nearly enough. \" if these young men are coming from neighborhoods that are poor, segregated, and violent, it's because — for most of the 20th century — it was the policy of the united states to make them that way. \" until that changes, until americans en masse cause it to change, not much else matters. \" i want to be optimistic, but given america's steadfast refusal to accept the reality of its racist past, i don't think i ' ll wait for that train to come. \"",

Sounds... Gross. But the 27-year-old actually got the beverage on the cheap: he brought his own 52-ounce mug ( purchased at goodwill ), and ordered the drink on his birthday — so it was free. And, bonus, the baristas gave him eight extra shots of espresso on the house. The daily news notes that it's not clear if chevassus did indeed set a record, as starbucks didn't reply to its request for comment. But the paper did provide this awful detail: chevassus only drank half the drink — over a few days. \" it was so sweet, it made my gums hurt, \" he said.

        "summary": "Almost half of the us population may have been affected by the massive equifax data breach, with the credit bureau revealing the personal info for as many as 143 million customers may have been exposed. Even as a handful of its top execs face a barrage of criticism for selling nearly $ 2 million in shares just days after the hack was discovered, the company is scrambling to deal with the aftermath and alleviate customer concerns. Cnet offers a primer of sorts as to what's going on, with more input from around the web: from the pov of ars technica, this breach could be \" the worst leak of personal info ever. \" that's not based on numbers alone, as recent yahoo and ebay hacks resulted in more people affected. Instead, that label is earned from the \" breathtaking amount of highly sensitive data it handed over to criminals, \" including full names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and even driver's license numbers. Two techcrunch reporters note that an online portal where customers can find out if they've been affected has been less than desirable, and seems instead to push a credit monitoring service whose terms and conditions bar users from filing a class-action suit against equifax. One of them decided to call equifax's emergency response line to check on her own status — and her experience doesn't earn equifax top customer-service marks. Bloomberg piles on, saying customers are being left \" clueless \" in their quest for answers. Speaking of that online option: the washington post details a major problem with it. To find out if you've been affected, you're prompted to enter your last name and the last six digits of your social security number versus the typical four, which a cto for a cybersecurity firm calls \" very unusual. \" people online are making fun of the idea of providing even more personal info to a company that just lost control of a whole lot of it. John biggs at techcrunch has had enough of shoddy data security overall, noting that the \" crass, callow, and lazy treatment of our digital data cannot stand. \" he's got some suggestions — including looking to estonia for answers. Cleveland.com and cnet offer useful tips on how to protect yourself in the interim, including being super-careful about what you post on social media.

However, mosby — who contends the knife is legally \" folded in \" — says \" evidence we have collected cannot ethically be disclosed, relayed, or released to the public before trial. \" state law bans possession of \" a blade that opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button, spring, or other device in the handle, \" while the baltimore ordinance bans \" any knife with an automatic spring or other device for opening and/or closing the blade, \" per usa today. A lawyer not involved in the case tells wbal that \" there is no case \" against nero — who is charged with second-degree assault, misconduct in office, and false imprisonment — if the knife is found to be illegal, because the arrest would have been justified. \" we will litigate the issues of the legality of the arrest of freddie gray in the courtroom, \" a lawyer for nero says. \" i am quite confident officer nero will be acquitted. \" click for more on the case.",

According to time, the report includes interviews with 65 child miners — some of whom started working in gold mines when they were only 9 years old. Al jazeera reports children are paid a few dollars a day to lower themselves into pits — some more than 80 feet deep, some underwater and requiring a hose to breathe — for hours at a time. Two brothers died of suffocation in one airless pit in 2014; others have been left with joint pain, brain disorders, and skin disease. But it's not just the mines that are dangerous. After the gold is retrieved, children use their bare hands to process it with mercury, time reports. According to al jazeera, the leftover poisonous metal ends up in rivers were other children play. In the philippines, anyone under 18 is prohibited from hazardous work, and underwater mining was actually outlawed in march. But both still occur in the country's hunt for gold. \" i don't meddle in what they do, \" one employer tells hrw when questioned about letting minors work. A government official says it's impossible to monitor all the small gold-mining operations going on around the country.

The fight between the christian groups and atheists began a few years back, when a local atheist started putting up his own booth next to the 14 scenes from the biblical christmas story that were erected in palisades park. Last year, he rallied other atheists to his cause, getting a bunch of them to apply for spaces in the park. Atheists won 18 of the 21 spaces and a jewish group won the 19th, leaving the nativity story to be squished into two. Things didn't go smoothly — at least one atheist banner was vandalized — and this year, concerned over the increasing tension and cost of the lottery, the city council voted in june to ban all unattended private displays in city parks. The coalition of churches behind the nativity display put up a fight, hence yesterday's ruling; a final decision on dec. 3 is also expected to go the same way, the los angeles times reports. \" the atheists won on this, \" says a lawyer for the coalition, who goes on to compare the city of santa monica to pontius pilate. But the city points out that the churches can still put up the displays on private property.",

Nbc news reports that 23 children have now been killed in gaza; at least 95 people have been killed there in total. Turkey's prime minister today called israel \" a terrorist state \" carrying out \" terrorist acts, \" specifically pointing a finger at those who \" turn their heads from the massacre of children, \" al-jazeera reports. More on the conflict: israel tells the bbc it intended to hit a home yesterday in which four children and seven other civilians were killed because it believed a senior hamas official was hiding there, but the patriarch of the family who lived there denies they were hiding anyone. That airstrike was the deadliest single strike of the conflict so far, and it killed members from three generations of the family, the new york times reports. A rocket from gaza also hit near a school in israel today and another exploded in the yard of a home, but no injuries were reported, ynet reports, adding that gaza has sent 60 rockets toward israel today. International pressure for an end to the violence is mounting, and un secretary-general ban ki-moon is flying to the region, cnn reports. \" this must stop, \" he said last night, calling for both sides to cooperate with egypt's attempt to broker a ceasefire. An egyptian source says hamas has handed its ceasefire conditions to israel; no word on what they are, but cnn notes hamas wants an end to the gaza blockade before it will agree to a truce. Former rep. Jane harman, a rumored replacement for david petraeus as cia director, told cnn this morning that she hears a ceasefire could come as soon as this afternoon, politico reports.

But badawi, who was also announced as the co-winner of the pen pinter prize earlier this month for being an \" international writer of courage, \" is stuck in jail, serving out a 10-year sentence and waiting for his next set of 50 lashes ( he's already endured the first 50 of the 1,000 he is to face ).

The stories will all relate to your friends or pages you \"like, \" such as a friend \"liking \" a company's page, playing a game app, or checking in at a business.

            "Espn, the sports network where male announcers have repeatedly faced disciplinary action in high-profile episodes of sexist behavior, has benched yet another host for his remarks to a female colleague. The network acknowledged monday that it yanked one of its announcers, ron franklin, from covering the fiesta bowl college football game saturday, reportedly after franklin made belittling comments to sideline reporter jeannine edwards. Franklin, 68, allegedly called edwards an insulting seven-letter word after she objected to being called \" sweet baby \" by franklin during a conversation that took place at a pregame production meeting friday, hours before the pair were to cover another football game for espn. The incident is the latest in a long string of episodes in which espn hosts have demeaned or engaged in sexual-harassing behavior toward the disney-owned network's female employees. Baseball analyst harold reynolds was fired in 2006 after being accused of harassment by a female employee. Steve phillips, another baseball analyst, lost his job in 2009 as a result of an affair with a much-younger production assistant who disclosed the relationship to phillips's wife after he sought to break it off. In 2007, a makeup artist working on the since-canceled show \" cold pizza \" sued the program's co-hosts, alleging they groped and harassed her.

Case in point: sausage party — which delivers more f-bombs in its first minute than one would've thought possible. How do critics feel about talking food items with, um, powerful sexual urges? here's what they're saying: \" it's a wild good time that will offend, shock, and even delight, \" writes lindsey bahr at the ap. It delivers \" the filthiest jokes you've never dared imagine, \" but has \" a big heart at the center. \" \" there is no one out there making comedies quite like [ seth rogen and evan goldberg ], \" she concludes. \" they are putting their definitive stamp on the modern american comedy one decency-smashing double entendre at a time. \" \" the food is tasteless, but never bland, \" as andrew lapin puts it. \" expect to see copious substance use, unspeakably foul language, and heavy attention paid to everyone's favorite male organ, \" he writes at npr. \" but sausage party is made with too much loving care ( and too much money ) to be written off as a dumb stoner disney parody. \" this \" is not only the raunchiest film of the year, nor is it simply the most shocking — it is, without a doubt, the most delirious movie to come out of a major studio in decades, perhaps ever, \" writes barry hertz at the globe and mail. Is that good or bad? if you find the idea of talking baby carrots \" irredeemably stupid \" you may want to pass, \" but for those willing to go along with seth rogen ( and his many co-writers ' ) surely pot-enhanced idea, the rewards are plenty. \" tirdad derakhshani had a blast and calls sausage party \" one of the funniest and most deeply offensive movies of the year. \" the content \" is so outrageous that the most libertarian libertine is liable to be offended at some point, \" especially as religion is the favorite target, he writes at the philadelphia inquirer. But overall, it's a \" mind-blowing ride. \" ( the sausage party characters recently did \" one of the weirdest morning show promos \" ever. )",

Alexander fishenko, 49, a native of the former soviet union who was naturalized in the us in 2003, was hit with 19 charges, including money laundering, circumventing export laws, and what the journal says is the little-used charge of acting as an unregistered agent of the russian government via his arc electronics firm. \" fishenko lined his pockets at the expense of our national security, \" the acting us attorney for the eastern district of new york said, per cnn. Fishenko, arrested in 2012, is one of 11 charged in the case, per the ap. The technologies fishenko sent overseas — including microprocessors and analog-to-digital converters — are subject to strict export regulations because they have the potential to be used in surveillance, radar, and missile guidance systems, cnn notes. The scheme, which the journal says kicked into full gear in 2008, flouted export laws by designating arc as a traffic-light manufacturer ( even though it produced no goods, instead obtaining them through us suppliers ), using convoluted shipping routes, and accepting payments through shell companies. Arc allegedly sent more than $ 50 million in product to russia from 2002 to 2012 without an export license, prosecutors say. Fishenko, who will hear his fate in january, is likely to receive a sentence of between 12-1/2 and 16 years rather than the century-plus maximum, per the journal.

According to mexican authorities, the texas teenager and his mother, tonya couch, were arrested in puerto vallarta after one of them used their phone to order pizza from domino's, the guardian reports. Authorities tipped off to the phone's location by the us marshals service traced the call to a condo complex, where a tour operator told them the couches had just moved out. Police say they were spotted during a surveillance operation monday and were taken into custody after behaving evasively and failing to provide ids to investigators, the ap reports. The couches were arrested in an ordinary neighborhood in the mexican city, where residents tell wfaa they noticed the arrival of the american teenager, who didn't speak spanish and ate his meals in a corner store. The \" affluenza \" teen and his mother — who will be charged with \" hindering an apprehension \" — are still in mexico, where officials tell the ap that they entered the country improperly and will be returned to the us on a commercial flight wednesday. Couch was on probation for killing four people while drunk and speeding in 2013, and despite having skipped the country, he is expected to spend no more than 120 days in jail. A lawyer for a man whose wife and daughter were killed in the 2013 crash says he's glad tonya couch will face justice. \" everybody had pretty much said ethan is a product of very bad parenting, \" he tells the dallas morning news. \" it appears at least one of those parents is going to be held criminally accountable for that. \"",

        "summary": "Archaeologists digging for ruins ahead of a new construction project in jerusalem made an incredible discovery — that immediately began to vanish. During the last hours of a \" salvage excavation \" two months ago, the israel antiquities authority stumbled upon a 2,000-year-old ritual bath when a stone suddenly disappeared into a black hole, reports haaretz. That hole turned out to be the remains of the bath, accessible by a stone staircase, which includes an anteroom with benches and a winepress. Carved into a natural stone cave, the bath itself wasn't so unusual, but the graffiti that covered the plaster walls was. Archaeologists were therefore horrified to find the aramaic inscriptions and paintings in mud and soot, dating to the second temple era from 530bc to 70ad, per discovery news, disappearing within hours of their discovery. \" the wall paintings are so sensitive that their exposure to the air causes damage to them, \" the iaa says, per ynetnews. Crews quickly removed and sealed the plaster so the graffiti, along with a few carvings, can be preserved. Archaeologists say the aramaic inscriptions are particularly special as few such writings have been found, though the script is hardly legible now. They guess at a few words, including what translates to \" served \" and the name \" cohen. \" still, the inscriptions back up the argument that aramaic was commonly used at the time and perhaps even the language of jesus. The plaster also holds drawings of a boat, palm trees and other plants, and what might be a menorah — portrayals of which were then considered taboo. An iaa rep says graffiti in baths may have been \" common, but not usually preserved. \" ( another recent find: the remnants of a \" treasured landmark \" destroyed by the nazis. )",

Measuring 55 feet long and 16 feet wide, the small trade vessel was stocked with 600 amphorae, or vases, packed with sardines and other fish. Further study of the shipwreck revealed that the ancient roman engineers also had built in a hydraulic system that allowed the ship to carry an aquarium with live fish. Over the years, metal detector enthusiasts, particularly those in the united kingdom, have uncovered archaeological treasures buried beneath the earth.

Rand paul said sunday that it is \" unfair \" to call president donald trump a racist but said his recently reported controversial comments about immigrants from haiti and african countries are unhelpful. \"i don't think the comments were constructive at all, but i also think that, to be fair, we shouldn't draw conclusions that he didn't intend, \" the kentucky republican said on \" meet the press. \" paul defended the president as one of the financial backers of a medical trip paul was part of to offer eye care and surgeries to people in haiti in 2015. \"i think it's unfair to sort of paint him, 'oh well, he's a racist, ' when i know for a fact that he cares very deeply about the people of haiti because he helped finance a trip where they would get vision back for 200 people in haiti, \" paul said. During a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers on immigration on thursday, trump reportedly questioned why the united states was accepting some immigrants from haiti and nations in africa — rather than allowing more immigrants from places like norway, according to sen. Dick durbin, d-ill., who was in the meeting. The president reportedly referred to african nations as \"shithole countries. \" trump denied saying anything derogatory during that meeting, writing on twitter, \"the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. \" he particularly defended his comments on haiti. The language used by me at the daca meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for daca! — donald j. Trump ( @realdonaldtrump ) january 12, 2018 other gop senators in the meeting have disputed durbin's recollection. Sen. David perdue, r-ga., called durbin's assertion a \"gross misrepresentation \" during an interview on abc, and sen. Tom cotton, r-ark., said on cbs, \"i didn't hear it, and i was sitting no further from president trump than dick durbin was. \" however, sen. Lindsey",

On tuesday, their three-week search for the 24-year-old nebraska woman came to a close with the discovery of a body in clay county, about 90 miles from loofe's lincoln home, per the kansas city star. Foul play is suspected, lincoln police chief jeff bliemeister tells usa today. Bailey boswell, 23, who posted a video online in which she said she dropped loofe off at a friend's house after their date, and her male roommate, 51-year-old aubrey trail, are considered persons of interest in the case, police add. Both were jailed last week on unrelated charges. Police haven't commented on how loofe is believed to have died, or on a possible motive for her killing, but they say \" digital evidence \" led them to the body. They also say data from loofe's cellphone indicated she had been in the area of boswell and trail's wilber home, 40 miles from her own. But though boswell says loofe smoked marijuana there on nov. 15, she denied any wrongdoing in a nine-minute video posted online on nov. 29, showing boswell and trail together in a car, per the omaha world-herald. A day later, boswell and trail were arrested near branson, mo. \" by their own statements on social media, we believe that aubrey trail and bailey boswell were two of the last people to see [ loofe ] before her disappearance, \" bliemeister says. \" thus they remain persons of interest. \" ( police say a teen murder suspect in colorado had a kill list. )",

        "summary": "President trump opened his speech at the conservative political action conference on friday by attacking the \" dishonest media. \" he accused the media of making up stories and sources and being \" fake news. \" and he railed against the use of anonymous sources. Here's how people reacted to the president's newest round of media criticism: it played well with those actually in the room, the los angeles times reports. One 84-year-old cpac attendee called it \" fantastic, unbelievable, absolute truth. \" the new york times says friday's speech was another example that the media has firmly replaced hillary clinton as trump's \" foil. \" axios points out the irony of trump attacking the media's use of anonymous sources hours after having his aides give an anonymous briefing to the media, not to mention his history of acting as his own anonymous source. Fox news also noted that irony, though it also credited trump with \" electrifying \" the cpac crowd with a \" historic \" speech. On the other hand, red state says trump has a point about anonymous sources. While there can be a good reason for their use, they're now being utilized simply as an excuse to attack the president. The washington post annotates the full text of trump's speech, which it says proves \" he's totally obsessed with the media. \" the politifact fact check of trump's speech finds he was incorrect in claiming the media, due to its dishonesty, had a lower approval rating than congress. Finally, slate reports trump's war on the media isn't going that well. A poll released friday found 53 % of voters disagree with him that the media is the enemy, and 48 % think trump is a bigger threat than the media.",

Between 60 % and almost 70 % of the country's energy is from hydropower, per the ap and reuters. But not everyone's excited about the prospect of forced three-day weekends. Critics say it's a bad time to be shutting things down, considering the country's current recession and inflation issues, as well as a dearth of certain medicines and food items. Others wonder what the plan means for operating schools, markets, and hospitals. And some say that people are just going to use electricity while they're home, since the cost is so low. \" for maduro the best way to resolve this crisis is to reduce the country's productivity, \" a caracas city councilor tells reuters. \" fridays are free bread and circus. \" ( maduro's relatives have been in trouble with the dea. )",

A then-50-year-old woman living just a few miles from celeste and morne nurse was charged with kidnapping, and on tuesday, her trial began. She has pleaded not guilty and is not being named to protect the identity of zephany, who was raised under another name. From the coverage thus far: the washington post's in-depth piece makes note of the eerie symbolism of the name zephany, which means \" the lord has hidden \" in hebrew. The bbc recounts celeste's testimony about how, as an 18-year-old who had given birth three days prior by c-section, she recalled a woman in maroon clothes asking if she could pick up her crying child. \" i was in pain and under medication. I fell asleep. Next thing i remember is the nurse asking where my child was. \" in a plea explanation submitted to the court, the accused claims that a woman at a train station \" handed a baby \" to her on april 30, 1997, as part of a prearranged adoption. She said she initially had difficulty loving and accepting the child as her own, reports iol. The cape times has the wednesday testimony of shireen piet, a woman who also gave birth at groote schuur hospital and claims the accused tried to take her newborn on april 30, the same day zephany vanished.

Fbi agents arrested two rabbis today and accused them of plotting to kidnap and torture a man in order to force him to agree to a religious divorce, reports nbc new york. Trouble is, their female client was actually an undercover agent. \"basically what we are going to be doing is kidnapping a guy for a couple of hours and beating him up and torturing him, and then getting him to \" agree to the divorce, one of the men says on tape. The fee of about $ 60,000 included the use of electric cattle prods and other techniques that wouldn't leave marks, reports the new york times. It's not clear whether the men have actually carried out any such kidnappings, though they boasted to their would-be client that they did so about every 18 months. Why would their services be necessary? because in many orthodox communities, a divorce can take place only when the husband agrees. In addition to rabbis martin wolmark and mendel epstein, the ap says at least eight others have been arrested in new york and new jersey in the sting operation.

The ruling regime has rigged the rules to make sure of that, writes independent correspondent peter popham. The real question is whether the regime will release aung san suu kyi as promised a week from now.

In fact, he was one of a slew of foreign reporters sent packing of late on flimsy charges. \" if the modest reporting endeavours of a handful of foreigners are such a problem for the junta, how will it cope with the lady when she gets behind a microphone again — the one person in the country capable, with a few well-chosen words, of galvanising not only millions of her own people but the leaders of the free world as well? \" in terms of the promise to release her, it doesn't bode well.",

The wall street journal says it reviewed a letter from starboard, which says it has a 1.7 % stake in yahoo, in which it rails on yahoo's board and management for not keeping promises and says they shouldn't get to decide whether yahoo keeps going as an independent company. Yahoo has been scrambling to rectify internal issues, especially after starboard warned earlier this year it wants ceo marissa mayer out and radical changes or a solid strategy for its sale. \" we have been attempting to work with yahoo for the past 18 months, \" the starboard letter to investors reads, per the new york times. \" at every step of the way, management and the board have pushed us away. \" while mayer and co. Have been trying to revamp yahoo's core business by slashing costs and refocusing on critical areas, starboard notes \" turning around this business is extremely difficult \" and cites \" interested and credible buyers, \" the journal reports. Per reuters, starboard is \" extremely disappointed with yahoo's dismal financial performance, poor management execution, egregious compensation and hiring practices, and general lack of accountability and oversight by the board. \" although yahoo has reached out to possible buyers, including verizon and time inc., starboard's letter suggests it's being left out of the process ( starboard ceo jeffrey smith is on its nominees list ) and adds \" it seems little progress has been made. \" while such a complete takeover is rare, starboard has done it before: in 2014, it cleared out 12 directors at darden restaurants and put smith in the chairman's seat, fortune reported at the time.

The kicker: so far, he hasn't been able to evict the two official tenants, burak firik and dogan kimilli, wpix reports. Landlord eddie shiew owns a three-story queens home, and the person renting out the first floor alerted him to construction on the third floor. Shiew found that a construction crew had divided each bedroom into three bedrooms by putting up sheetrock. Wpix also investigated, and found people staying in the apartment who said they were paying $ 35 a night for a room after finding the property on airbnb. Shiew brought in his own workmen to tear down the sheetrock dividers; he also changed the locks and told firik and kimilli to get out. But \" they went to court and got a court order against me, \" shiew says. \" they said i illegally locked them out. \" the court agreed, ordering shiew to let them back in. This time, instead of putting up sheetrock, the tenants allegedly used curtains as room dividers and continued to rent out rooms on airbnb. Meanwhile, shiew hired a lawyer and started eviction proceedings. He points out that the lease they signed bars them from making \" repairs or alterations, \" and his lawyer thinks the court will order them out within months. As gothamist points out, airbnb released anonymized data on their hosts last week to rebut allegations that many new york hosts are basically running illegal hostels, and said that just two queens hosts had six or more listings on the site. Still, \" as firik and kimilli's case proves, it's exceedingly difficult to evict tenants running airbnb hotels, \" adds the post. ( here's another airbnb horror story. )",

        "summary": "Onions are notorious for making us weep, but why? scientists say they now have a pretty good understanding of what's going on, reports npr in an interview with chemist and author eric block. It turns out the vegetable has \" evolved a chemical defense system \" in an attempt to get us, not to mention the many creatures living in the ground where onions grow, to stop having our way with them. \" the way the onion bulb is designed, \" block says, \" is ingenious. \" each onion cell houses what he calls \" a little glob \" filled with enzymes, and when cut into, the globs break open and release their innards, setting off a chemical reaction. Resulting molecules released into the air float up — and into our eyes. The tears come because our eyes are equipped with sensory nerves to protect us from irritants and, for our own defense, produce a burning sensation, explains a video from the american chemical society. Tears help wash away such irritants. So what to do? for starters, chop in a well-ventilated area, perhaps near a fan, suggests block. Refrigerating the onions prior to cutting also can help. Wearing goggles, however, will only make you look stupid, he says, because they won't stop the irritants from getting into your nose and mouth. The huffington post debunks some other home remedies, such as putting vinegar on the cutting board, but finds that others, such as chopping the root last, seem to help.

Here's a look at related coverage: one new rule makes it easier for doctors and other authorities to report mentally ill people to the fbi's background check system. The shift makes clear that those who do won't run afoul of privacy laws. What gets passed along: only a person's name, and the entity that made the ruling, reports the hill. What doesn't, per the rule: \" underlying diagnoses, treatment records, and other identifiable health information. \" the rules will not require that every single gun sale be subject to a federal background check, reports usa today. But they will tighten up some areas regarding private sales. For example, those who sell guns over the internet must now conduct checks \" if they are ' engaged in the business ' of selling guns, not just a hobbyist. \" the fbi is hiring some 230 more people to run background checks, making for a 50 % increase in such staffing, notes vox. All this talk of new rules, along with the san bernardino attack, combined to make december one of the biggest months for gun sales in the last two decades. The new york times has the graphics and stats. On a similar note, the stocks of gun makers are surging, notes politico.",

But the marriage deal went sour and azam's pregnant 14-year-old daughter, zarah, ended up paying the price, tortured and burned to death by her own in-laws in a so-called \" honor killing, \" cbs news and the ap report. Zarah died saturday, and azam has since made his way to kabul to seek justice for his daughter because he's not hopeful he ' ll find it in ghor province, where her immolation took place, the sun notes. \" the culprits should be brought to justice, my daughter's blood must not go in vain, \" he tells the ap. Azam had reportedly been promised the cousin's hand in marriage as payment for construction work he had done. Zarah's in-laws then pulled back on the deal when another man offered more money for the cousin, but azam eloped with her anyway, leading the in-laws to seek revenge. The ap notes that the practice of \" baad \" — giving women away to pay off debts — is against the law; azam himself could face legal trouble for giving his daughter away. Honor killings are likewise illegal, though a 2014 new york times article noted that tribal law often trumps civil law, with fathers lording \" absolute power \" over their daughters until they're married off — with or without their permission, at any age, and often to settle some sort of debt.
