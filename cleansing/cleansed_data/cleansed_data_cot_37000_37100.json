        "summary": "Nasa made its much-hyped big announcement today, and what it comes down to is that scientists have found the strongest evidence yet that there's liquid water on the red planet, the washington post reports. Last april, using data from the curiosity rover, researchers noted that perchlorates were present on the planet. Those are a type of salt, and they could make the boiling point of water on mars — which is extremely low thanks to low pressure on the planet — much higher, which would mean that liquid water containing perchlorates could form during certain parts of the year. It's been theorized that such water could be responsible for forming the geographic features known as recurring slope lineae ( rsl ) that have often been seen on mars. Researchers have been looking at rsl features and found lots of perchlorates that appear to have been getting hydrated. \" we're going to places where we thought we were seeing the presence of water and finding chemical evidence of perchlorates, \" says the lead researcher. And one of the april researchers, who wasn't involved in this latest study, tells the post, \" [ the ] flow of liquid salty water is no longer just a possibility; it does actually occur. The results [ show ] that liquid does indeed flow on mars today. \" but more research is necessary to actually confirm liquid water exists on the planet; the lead researcher says he hopes a rover can someday look closely at the rsl features. If liquid water does exist on mars, it's good news for astronauts who might one day travel there. \" if we ever go there, we could probably utilize this. We wouldn't have to bring tons of water, \" says the lead researcher. \" this stuff seems like science fiction, but in 100 years or so it could be fact. \" it could also \" boost the notion of life on mars, \" the ap notes.",

        "summary": "Here's a sentence you probably never thought you'd read: mittens, a hermaphroditic cat from newfoundland, is getting gender assignment surgery. Colleen clarke-murphy's daughter brought the stray cat home, and when the family took it to the vet, they were told it has both male and female genitalia, cbc reports. Mittens'dual gender has caused the cat to have bowel and urinary troubles. The solution: spay and neuter the cat, then assign a gender ( the vet recommends male ) and give it reconstructive surgery. The cost: $ 1,500, which a friend is helping the family raise. Clarke-murphy says it's worth it, because mittens has been \" part of my family \" since october. As bustle and cosmopolitan point out, while hermaphroditic cats are rare, gender-related operations in cats aren't as uncommon as you might imagine. Last year, mother nature network reported that some male cats suffering from urinary problems get what's called a \" perineal urethrostomy, \" in which its male genitals are removed and the urethra's opening is shortened to create an opening similar to what a female cat would have. Of course, the purpose of such procedures isn't to reassign gender but to ease health problems, but that doesn't stop some from seeing it as a sex change. And as for a fellow hermaphrodite, last year a liverpool cat with both male and female parts had surgery to become female.

        "summary": "Be careful who you call \" fishbrain. \" the insult might actually be a compliment, based on a new study in scientific reports. For the first time, scientists have discovered that a species of fish can distinguish between human faces — something once thought possible only among primates with large, complex brains. To see if simple brains without a neocortex were capable of the feat, researchers trained archerfish — tropical freshwater fish that spit water from their mouths — to spit water at a human face displayed on a computer monitor positioned near their tank. Researchers then flashed the face on the screen along with 44 others, reports motherboard. In 81 % of cases, the fish spit water at the face they'd previously been shown. When the faces were of a standard color or head shape, the rate improved to 86 %, per cnn. \" the fish continued to spit at the face they had been trained to recognize, proving that they were capable of telling the two apart, \" study co-author cait newport of oxford says in a release. Distinguishing between human faces is no easy task since \" human faces share the same basic features, \" newport explains. The study notes fish probably haven't evolved the ability for human facial recognition over time because of limited contact with humans. But the study suggests that at least some fish have \" sophisticated visual recognition capabilities, \" per the release. \" i think it's really fascinating that they have these supposedly simple brains in terms of the actual structure of it, but they're still able to use them for really complicated tasks, \" newport says, adding it's possible that pet fish recognize their owners. \" we probably just don't give them enough credit. \" ( a study finds plastic is making fish stupid. )",

            "Credit: university of oxford a species of tropical fish has been shown to be able to distinguish between human faces. It is the first time fish have demonstrated this ability. The research, carried out by a team of scientists from the university of oxford ( uk ) and the university of queensland ( australia ), found that archerfish were able to learn and recognize faces with a high degree of accuracy — an impressive feat, given this task requires sophisticated visual recognition capabilities. The study is published in the journal scientific reports. First author dr cait newport, marie curie research fellow in the department of zoology at oxford university, said: ' being able to",
            "We tested whether a species of fish, unlikely to have experienced any evolutionary pressure for human facial recognition, could learn to discriminate human faces. We found that archerfish could be trained to discriminate a learned face from a large number of other human faces even when some trivial cues had been removed ( i.e. Brightness, colour and head-shape ). While it is impossible to say from our study whether archerfish use the same visual information to discriminate the face images as humans, our results clearly show that some aspects of the facial recognition task can be learnt, even in the absence of a neocortex. During testing in experiments 1 and 2, all fish reached peak",
            "It's enough to make this writer seriously consider vegetarianism: a new study has found that fish can recognise human faces. The paper, published in scientific reports, found that archerfish — a tropical species that can shoot water jets from its mouth — could learn to distinguish an image of an individual human's face from others, even when the pictures were controlled for colour and head shape. Lead author cait newport said that the motivation of the work was to better understand how humans recognise faces. She explained that there are two theories on how human facial recognition works: one suggests that this skill relies on complex and specialised brain circuitry such as that",
            "A new study says, yes, it probably can. Researchers studying archerfish found the fish can tell a familiar human face from dozens of new faces with surprising accuracy. This is a big, big deal. It's the first time fish have demonstrated this ability. Think about it: all faces have two eyes sitting above a nose and a mouth. And for us to be able to tell them apart, we need to be able to pick up the subtle differences in features. We're good at this because we are smart, i.e. We have large and complex brains. Other primates can do this too. Some birds as well"

            "Credit: university of oxford a species of tropical fish has been shown to be able to distinguish between human faces. It is the first time fish have demonstrated this ability. The research, carried out by a team of scientists from the university of oxford ( uk ) and the university of queensland ( australia ), found that archerfish were able to learn and recognize faces with a high degree of accuracy — an impressive feat, given this task requires sophisticated visual recognition capabilities. The study is published in the journal scientific reports. First author dr cait newport, marie curie research fellow in the department of zoology at oxford university, said: ' being able to",
            "We tested whether a species of fish, unlikely to have experienced any evolutionary pressure for human facial recognition, could learn to discriminate human faces. We found that archerfish could be trained to discriminate a learned face from a large number of other human faces even when some trivial cues had been removed ( i.e. Brightness, colour and head-shape ). While it is impossible to say from our study whether archerfish use the same visual information to discriminate the face images as humans, our results clearly show that some aspects of the facial recognition task can be learnt, even in the absence of a neocortex. During testing in experiments 1 and 2, all fish reached peak",
            "It's enough to make this writer seriously consider vegetarianism: a new study has found that fish can recognise human faces. The paper, published in scientific reports, found that archerfish — a tropical species that can shoot water jets from its mouth — could learn to distinguish an image of an individual human's face from others, even when the pictures were controlled for colour and head shape. Lead author cait newport said that the motivation of the work was to better understand how humans recognise faces. She explained that there are two theories on how human facial recognition works: one suggests that this skill relies on complex and specialised brain circuitry such as that",
            "A new study says, yes, it probably can. Researchers studying archerfish found the fish can tell a familiar human face from dozens of new faces with surprising accuracy. This is a big, big deal. It's the first time fish have demonstrated this ability. Think about it: all faces have two eyes sitting above a nose and a mouth. And for us to be able to tell them apart, we need to be able to pick up the subtle differences in features. We're good at this because we are smart, i.e. We have large and complex brains. Other primates can do this too. Some birds as well"

With some 200 military personnel supporting police efforts, hazmat-suit-wearing experts established tents around two graves: the wife and son of sergei skripal, 66, the agent found slumped over a salisbury bench last sunday. The wife, liudmila, is said to have died of cancer six years ago at age 59, while 43-year-old son alexander died in st. Petersburg last march for unknown reasons. In other developments: the british government is convening its emergency \" cobra \" committee today, including foreign secretary boris johnson, to hear about the police probe — which official sources say is \" moving quite quickly. \" british detective sgt. Nick bailey, sickened during the investigation, is in serious condition but able to speak with visitors, cnn reports. Officials want to know if he fell ill visiting the salisbury bench or skripal's home, where the agent's daughter yulia may have unwittingly brought home a \" trojan horse \" package of deadly nerve gas from moscow, the sun notes. Skripal's main job as a double agent was to give mi6 a full list of russian intelligence officers — but that doesn't include undercover spies in the west, the times reports. He also siphoned information to the cia and other british allies. Investigators have identified the substance used to fell skripal and his daughter, who remain in critical condition.",

A 60-page report released thursday by the union of concerned scientists says america's current defense system is \" simply unable to protect the us public \" from nuclear attacks by the likes of iran and north korea. The report calls the ground-based midcourse defense system ( gmd ) a \" system in tatters \" and recommends the us stop expanding it before fixing its existing problems, the los angeles times reports. According to the international business times, the gmd fires interceptor missiles based in california and alaska into space, where they destroy approaching enemy nuclear warheads. Or at least that's what's supposed to happen. A physicist who co-authored the report tells reuters the gmd is a \" disaster. \" the problems started in 2004 when the bush administration exempted the gmd from what reuters calls \" normal oversight and accountability. \" it didn't get much better under obama, who ordered the interceptor fleet to be increased from 30 to 44 by the end of 2017. After spending approximately $ 40 billion, the us has a defense system that can't even pass \" heavily scripted \" tests. The gmd has been tested only nine times since 2004. It failed six of those tests despite gmd personnel having access to enemy missile speed and trajectory and the location of the target, none of which they would have in a real-life scenario. In a recent test, the interceptor's thrusters failed — something that happens with regularity — causing it to miss its target. The pentagon called the test \" successful \" anyway.

But turning that sentiment into reality might take a while. \"if you don't have a ping-pong table, you're not a tech company, \" says the chief technology officer at lithium technologies.

            "There is a saying that goes, you can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. Well people, the gig is up! it's pretty obvious these days that companies are trying to keep up with the joneses or in this case the googles of the world. Businesses are spending billions of dollars building out company playgrounds for their employees and yet employees are more dissatisfied with their employers than ever. New gallup research suggests that over 70 % of employees are disengaged – meaning, they don't really care what happens to the organization or your customers, and this can be disastrous! all the free beer in the world cannot make your employees delusional enough to remain with a boss or a company that has bad leadership. Now some of you reading this may think that free beer is some new cool perk. That is simply not the case. We actually had that benefit back in the day when i was in the corporate world. Only we called these monthly events beer busts. The difference being that this was an opportunity for us to gather at the end of a long month to share a beer or two.

        "summary": "A colorado family is suing the maker and seller of a marijuana edible for wrongful death after a man ate the candy before allegedly killing his wife. The denver post reports it's likely the first-ever such lawsuit against the recreational marijuana industry. Authorities say richard kirk ate a karma kandy orange ginger, then shot his wife kristine while their three young children were present. Kirk claims the edible caused \" delirium and psychotic-like symptoms, \" according to kdvr. And the lawsuit filed this week by kristine's parents and sister on behalf of her children blames the edible's maker, gaia's garden, and seller, nutritional elements inc., for not properly labeling the candy for potency and potential side effects. \" the manufacturers of dog treats have shown more concern for the health and well-being of dogs … than the edible producers have shown for … people, \" the post quotes the lawsuit as saying. The lawsuit claims kirk had no way of knowing what the effects of the edible — which contained 10 servings of thc in the size of a tootsie roll — would be. Regulations on the labeling of edibles have since been changed. An expert says the wrongful-death lawsuit has little chance of succeeding. \" we don't hold vodka producers responsible for drunk drivers, \" he tells the post. Kirk has been charged with murder and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors say he had a low level of thc in his blood after killing his wife, which they say he did on purpose over financial and marital stress. Cbs denver reports kirk also took pain pills with the edible. ( inside the story of colorado's first \" legal pot \" death. )",

        "summary": "The remains of a bronze age cultic priestess found in egtved, denmark, in 1921 belong to a teenager who'd likely traveled all the way from southern germany — a great distance for the year 1370bc, researchers report in a press release. They now know this is because her oak coffin was buried in a peat bog burial mound that let water in but not out, so while her bones had long since decayed, her clothing, hair, and nails were well preserved, the team notes in the journal scientific reports. This enabled them to analyze strontium isotopes, where differences in the number of neutrons in atoms of that element reveal the region where she spent time. The analysis suggests that her woolen skirt came from somewhere near southwestern germany's black forest. What they also employed to re-create her movements: her hair, which was 9 inches at its longest point ( it grew about 0.4 inches a month, so the hair housed roughly two years of information ), as well as a molar tooth, which holds geographical secrets of the first few years of her life. Their analysis suggested she'd gone on several long trips during her last two years, probably spent much of her last six months far from denmark, and likely died shortly after getting to egtved. Researcher karin margarita frei tells livescience, \" she looks, in a way, very modern, in this kind of miniskirt and a kind of t-shirt. \" ( it's a look some have re-created. Seriously. ) in fact, her remains suggest she was a cultic priestess who may have been married to a danish chieftan. What's particularly notable about the findings: the researchers say it's the first time a prehistoric person's movements have been charted with such accuracy.

The survey attributes about 18,000 deaths last year to terrorism, a rise of 60 % from the previous year, reports the guardian. Going back further to the days before the 9/11 attacks, the index sees a fivefold increase in deaths, from about 3,360 in 2000. Some facts and figures: 5 countries: iraq ( 6,362 ), afghanistan ( 3,111 ), pakistan ( 2,345 ), nigeria ( 1,826 ), and syria ( 1,078 ) account for more than 80 % of deaths last year. 4 groups: the islamic state ( or isis or isil ), the taliban, al-qaeda, and boko haram are responsible for more than 66 % of the deaths, reports the washington post. Definition: the group that puts out the index, the institute for economics and peace, defines terrorism as \" the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. \" solutions? the iep thinks sunni muslim nations can lead the way by pushing moderate theologies to counter religious extremism, reports the bbc. Isis, for instance, \"needs a military response, but a military response on its own is not enough, \" says the iep's leader. \" sunnis in iraq have a lot of legitimate grievances. \" it's also vital that these responses come from within islam and not \" outside influences, \" says the report.",

        "summary": "Chris christie's administration is under investigation yet again, this time for allegedly quashing indictments against three of his political supporters, abc news reports. A couple years back in new jersey, former hunterdon county assistant prosecutor bennett barlyn claimed he was fired for objecting when christie officials canned indictments against a sheriff and two subordinates ( the new york times ran a front-page piece ). Now barlyn says the feds interviewed him this week and may be talking to others. Christie's office calls the allegations \" conspiratorial nonsense \"; then-new jersey attorney general paula dow and other administration officials have said barlyn was dismissed for \" legitimate business reasons, \" the star-ledger reported last year. Federal investigators are still in the discovery phase, looking into what laws may have been broken, the international business times reports. It goes back to former sheriff deborah trout, who was accused of running her office as she pleased, hiring friends without mandatory background checks and regardless of their experience. A grand jury returned 43 indictments against her and two subordinates, but christie's administration stepped in, seized the investigation, and had the grand jury indictments overturned. When barlyn objected, he says, he was let go without explanation. \" i was afforded less due process than the criminals i prosecute for the most minor offenses, \" he says. \" i wasn't allowed to give my side of the story. \" christie's administration is also under investigation over several bridge closings.",

        "summary": "A texas court has ordered a houston man to pay $ 65,000 in child support — even though he's not the father of the child in question. Gabriel cornejo, 45, says he's only met the teenage girl at the center of the court order once last year, after a deputy served him with papers alerting him to a child he didn't know he had. Cornejo says he had no idea his ex-girlfriend had filed a paternity suit against him in 2003 identifying him as the only possible father of her daughter, now 16. They agreed to a paternity test, and the results proved \" i ' m not the father, \" he says. Yet a court ruled cornejo was still liable to support the girl, who cornejo calls \" wonderful, \" because he failed to contest the suit. Cornejo, a father of three who is raising his brother's two kids, tells abc13 that it's not fair that he should be forced to \" to defend myself [ of ] something that i am innocent of. \" a court had issued a subpoena, though cornejo denies he got it. The records are unclear, per abc13. No matter. Under texas law a prospective dad is still on the hook for any child support payments assessed before being cleared by a paternity test, cornejo's lawyer tells the houston chronicle. Since the payment clock began ticking in 2003, cornejo was stunned to learn he owed nearly $ 65,000. The mother's lawyer disputes that cornejo was in the dark, saying he never fought support payments docked from his paycheck years ago. \" don't stick your head in the sand, \" carel stith tells abc13. \" it won't go away. \" cornejo will challenge the law in a hearing next month.

Most of the 64 lightning deaths since thursday have occurred in the countryside, where farmers are busy with the current harvesting season, bengali-language newspapers prothom alo and samakal reported, per the ap. Experts say increased deforestation, increased use of metal equipment like cellphones, and rising temperatures have contributed to a surge in lightning deaths that has caused panic in some areas. Most of the victims were farmer working in their fields, though children playing in the open and spectators at a soccer game have also died in lightning strikes. Mohammad riaz ahmed, chief of bangladesh's disaster management department, tells voice of america that authorities are \" very concerned \" by the number of lightning deaths. More than 90 have died so far this year and the storm season hasn't peaked yet. In the us, there were 27 recorded lightning deaths in 2015 and there have been five so far this year, according to the noaa. ( nasa has named a new lightning capital of the world. )",

Police say there may have been a spare key located somewhere in the vehicle, per kiro 7. The suv, which would have been obvious with its auburn pd logos and police lights, was recovered monday morning in mercer island, the news tribune reports. It was found on a lot where a home is under construction after a construction worker called it in, per kiro 7. The police-issued rifle, which had been locked into a cage, was still inside the suv, as was the pricey gear used for traffic investigations, the station notes. The suspect is still at large.

They're often right in the kitchen, after the war, when the soldiers come face to face with loved ones who can't comprehend what combat does to a person's soul. When the main character in the hurt locker, a bomb-detonation expert, is asked by his wife to buy cereal or chop carrots, it '"

            "2 million girls a year mutilated every year several million women approach childbirth knowing that the risk will be greater because some or all of their genitalia has been cut away by the traditional practice of female genital mutilation ( fgm ). Approximately 2 million girls are mutilated every year. Egypt, ethiopia, kenya, nigeria, somalia, and the sudan account for 75 % of all cases. In djibouti and somalia, 98 % of girls are mutilated. Apart from the immediate fear and pain, the consequences can include prolonged bleeding, infection, infertility, and death. For those who suffer infibulation  the severest form of fgm in which all external sexual organs are cut away  the trauma of recutting is repeated with each new birth to allow passage of the baby. Both moderate and severe forms increase the risks of childbirth. Mutilation is not required by any religion. It is a tradition designed to preserve virginity, ensure marriageability, and contain sexuality. As the table shows, several african governments have begun to move against the practice. So far, only ghana has translated policy into law. The government of burkina faso, which has actively campaigned against fgm since 1990 through its national anti-excision committee, has escalated its work in the past three years as the result of increased national support: law cases involving deaths caused by",

It seems that 23-year-old ceo evan spiegel isn't ready to even consider offers at this point given his company's growing number of users. Besides, facebook may have undershot the mark — another offer reportedly in the work from china's tencent holdings values snapchat at $ 4 billion, notes the journal. Snapchat's niche is that it allows users to send photos and messages that soon self-destruct. ( though there's some doubt about that. ) \" this makes it perfect for sharing naughty photos with loved ones, which isn't advertised by snapchat, but can be somewhat attributed to its popularity, \" writes tom cheredar at venture beat.

            "What supposedly makes snapchat enjoyable is that messages float away and disappear after one view. It's ephemeral fun for sharing things that don't matter too much. Still, others like it because of the supposed privacy of disappearing messages. While you can take a screenshot of a snapchat you are viewing, the app lets the sender know immediately that you've done that. But a new ios app called snap save saves your snapchat messages and doesn't let the sender know. After giving it a quick test, i can confirm the app works. First you log in with your snapchat credentials, and then the app saves all of the messages you haven't viewed yet. So after you view a snapchat message, that picture or video is still there inside snap save for later viewing. The only two technical issues i see with the app is that sound didn't work with my video messages and it logs you out of snapchat each time you use it. You can also pay $ 3 to upgrade the app to show no advertising. The app should give pause to anyone who actually thought snapchat gave you any privacy. Essentially, if you're still using snapchat for \"sexting \" or sending",

The gop senators — including prominent trump critics john mccain and lindsey graham — are planning to launch an aggressive and wide-ranging probe of alleged russian meddling in the election and other cyberattacks. The obama administration has accused moscow of hacking american political sites to interfere with the election, but in a time interview this week, trump, who has praised vladimir putin and promised to improve relations with russia, disagreed. \" i don't believe they interfered, \" he said. \" it could be russia. And it could be china. And it could be some guy in his home in new jersey. \" house and senate democrats may find themselves allied with senate republicans on the issue: democrats wrote to president obama this week asking for a classified briefing on \" russian or russian-related interference or involvement in our recent election, \" including the spreading of fake news stories, the guardian reports. The post reports that administration officials say they had planned to brief senators on russian hacking on thursday but had to cancel when the senate intelligence committee broadened the scope of the hearing. Reuters reports that there's a second russian issue that could cause clashes between senators and trump: on thursday, a bipartisan group of 27 senators wrote to the president-elect calling for him to take a hard line against moscow's \" military land grab \" in ukraine.",

Zachary cruz, the 18-year-old brother of nikolas cruz, was arrested on trespassing charges monday after he was seen skateboarding at marjory stoneman douglas high school about two hours after classes ended, police say, per the south florida sun sentinel. Cruz, who'd been warned to keep away, said he'd made his third visit to the school since his brother allegedly killed 17 people to \" reflect on the... Shooting, \" say police. At a tuesday hearing, however, prosecutors said the teen had \" all the same flags \" as his brother, seemed to admire his sibling's renown, and talked of starting a pen pal or fan club. Though a $ 25 bond is typical with a trespassing charge, the judge set bond at $ 500,000. Should cruz post bail, he must wear an ankle monitor and keep away from the school and his brother, whom he's visited in jail, per cnn. Buzzfeed news reports he ' ll also undergo a mental health evaluation. Authorities, meanwhile, are seeking a risk protection order, made possible with a law signed by gov. Rick scott last week. Applied in cases of involuntary mental health assessments, the order would allow authorities to temporarily seize firearms in cruz's possession and block him from acquiring new ones. Cruz's attorney, joseph kimok, said tuesday \" the state has been seeking to make a show of this, \" per the sun sentinel.

The metropolitan police tweeted out a picture of a hoverboard sunday along with the warning, \" own one of these or thinking about getting one? they're illegal to ride in public! \" the tweet included a link to a document from the crown prosecution service noting that so-called \" self-balancing personal transporters \" are considered to be self-propelled motor vehicles, per the department of transport, the wall street journal reports. That means they're subject to road traffic laws, and they currently don't meet requirements for use on uk roads. Even if they did, they would — as vehicles — require registration and their users would require licenses; since they aren't covered by european legislation for vehicles that can hit speeds higher than 4mph, they cannot be registered or licensed for use on public roads. They can, however, be used on private land as long as the landowner permits it. Sky news notes that the law governing such vehicles is actually 180 years old.

Police say he tried to scare away the animal by splashing water on it and yelling at it. Instead of leaving, the sea lion bit the man's right arm. He was rescued by a passing sail boat, which called the coast guard, the los angeles times reports. \"the boat saved his life, \" san francisco police officer matthew reiter says. \"had that boat not seen him, this could have been a different story. \" the man seemed to be doing ok, all things considered. \"he was more worried about his clothes on the beach than he was about anything else, \" reiter says. \"it was a good sign. \" while sea lion attacks are rare, they aren't unheard of. Reiter says he hasn't seen a sea lion attack in two years on the marine unit. But swimmers in the area say they've been noticing more sea lions in the area recently, and a 2015 study found 10 incidents of sea lions or seals biting swim club members in san francisco over a period of three years. The national oceanic and atmospheric administration warns that sea lions are \" unpredictable and can become aggressive quickly. \" still, dr. Claire simeon, the lead researcher behind that 2015 study, tells fox she doesn't \" think that people should be afraid to go into the water. \" she adds: \" we're lucky to be able to share our coastline with these amazing animals. \"",

        "summary": "Since harvard university professor karen king first reported in 2012 her discovery of what appears to be an ancient papyrus in which jesus is suggested to have a wife, the authenticity of the so-called \" gospel of jesus ' wife \" has been the subject of much claim and counterclaim. Even the very ink is hard to test because the papyrus scrap is so small. But now livescience is reporting that new ink research conducted at columbia university suggests the document is not a forgery and could indeed date back to ancient times, though researchers aren't revealing more until their peer-reviewed findings are published. King isn't saying much, either, though she did write in a letter in the biblical archaeological review that \" when discussions and research are ongoing, i think it is important, however difficult, to stay open regarding the possible dates of the inscription and other matters of interpretation. \" meanwhile, new documents have surfaced perhaps countering the argument that the person who sold the coptic-language papyrus to the anonymous person who passed it on to king wasn't in fact in possession of it. King said last year that the anonymous owner provided her with a photocopy of the contract for the sale of six \" coptic papyrus fragments, one believed to be a gospel, \" from the german in question, hans-ulrich laukamp, dated nov. 12, 1999, and signed by both parties. A livescience reporter has since found seven signatures on five publicly available and notarized documents belonging to laukamp, which at least provides the opportunity to verify the authenticity of his signature. The british museum, meanwhile, is in possession of a syriac-language manuscript dating from ad570 that is said to be a copy of an older document suggesting mary magdalene was jesus ' wife, reports news.com.au.

Evidence teams with boston's joint terrorism task force moved to secure the bomb site, looking for timing mechanism springs, chemical residues, and other potential evidence, time reports. Fbi and cia specialists, meanwhile, began searching their databases for clues and the internet for congratulatory militant chatter. So far, officials tell cnn they \" have a number of active leads and some good early progress in the forensics analysis. \" here's what you need to know about the search so far: fbi and atf agents and bomb technicians searched a revere home on a lead related to the saudi student officers questioned in the hospital. But cnn notes that cops say that doesn't imply they have a suspect, and that the search was consensual and thus conducted without a warrant. Authorities are also checking area surveillance cameras, hoping to find footage of the culprit planting the bombs. So far, they haven't found any. Contrary to initial reports, gov. Deval patrick today said emphatically that no unexploded devices had been found. Such devices would likely have provided a trove of evidence. \" there are no known additional threats, \" says the fbi special agent in charge of the boston division; the bureau is taking the lead in the investigation, and \" the citizens of massachusetts and the city of boston should expect to see the fbi and its jttf partners conducting investigative activity \" in the area. The justice department has a looming decision in the case: should it treat it as a domestic terror case or an international one? the latter would give authorities access to more expansive surveillance and evidence gathering powers, thanks to fisa. If authorities decide there is still an imminent threat of an attack, they can question any suspect they do catch without reading his or her miranda rights.

        "summary": "An infamous professional prankster who once went to great lengths to get his own fake obituary published in the new york times is now actually dead, the times reports, noting in its headline that it has the news \" on good authority. \" alan abel, who has been called \" america's greatest hoaxer \" and said to be the precursor to such celebs as stephen colbert, died at his connecticut home friday at age 94 from, according to his daughter, complications of cancer and heart failure. The times also confirmed his death with a hospice care center and a funeral home. Abel, who worked as a jazz drummer and stand-up comic before turning to a life of pulling off incredibly complex gags starting in 1959, needed a dozen cohorts in order to pull off his fake 1980 passing; they played roles including his widow and an undertaker ( using a dedicated phone line with its own directory-information business listing ) to confirm the death. After the obituary was published, abel held a press conference and the times retracted its obit. All of abel's pranks involved similarly epic levels of planning, actors, costumes, and more. Among the gags: the society for indecency to naked animals, a group purportedly pushing to clothe all animals that staged activities for four years before it was outed as fake; \" omar's school for beggars \"; \" euthanasia cruises \"; \" citizens against breastfeeding \"; and the \" kkk symphony orchestra. \" the media was taken in again and again, covering the abel-concocted activities, organizations, and characters — which were sometimes meant as performance art, sometimes social commentary — as factual. The connecticut post sums it up thusly: \" long before ' fake news,'there was alan abel. \" as abel, who made a modest living by writing books and articles, making speeches, and producing mock-documentaries, once noted, the media \" need an audience, and the only way they're going to get an audience is to have perversions and calamities galore.

But as of yesterday morning, account settings could not be changed by phone. A 19-year-old hacker who broke into honan's amazon account on friday was able to scan his billing information and see the last four digits of his credit card.

The price paid is less than half of what sotheby's expected the tiny one-inch by one-and-a-quarter inch stamp to fetch, but still shatters the world record set by the sale of an 1855 swedish stamp for $ 2.3 million in 1996. The stamp — most recently owned by chemical fortune heir john du pont, who died in 2010 while serving time for the murder of an olympic wrestler — set world records the previous three times it was sold, most recently in 1980. It was issued when a shipment of stamps to the british colony was delayed and the local newspaper was asked to print some stamps. In 1873, a stamp-collecting 12-year-old schoolboy found it in his family papers. \" it has always been the world's most famous stamp. It is one of these objects around which a huge mystique has grown up over the years, \" an expert at sotheby's tells reuters.",

An established and incredibly successful british television and theater actress, dench came to the big screen relatively late, with weinstein convincing her to take her first role as queen victoria in 1997's mrs. Brown, for which she received an academy award nomination for best actress. The relationship with weinstein continued and landed dench with three more acting nominations as well as a best supporting actress award for 1998's shakespeare in love.

In the documents, the fbi insisted that ali himself was not under investigation, but that the nation of islam was — and ali was of interest to the bureau because of his involvement with the group, the new york times reports. The documents, some of which were previously classified, were released after conservative group judicial watch sued to obtain them. They refer to the nation of islam as an \" all-negro, semireligious, antiwhite \" organization. Ali later converted to orthodox islam. Included in ali's 142-page file was information on the late boxer's ties to the nation of islam from fbi informants, as well as newspaper clips ( even a gossip item ) and other publicly available info. One memo deals with the captain's uniform from the nation of islam's paramilitary wing that ali wore; the fbi also kept tabs on disputes between ali and nation of islam leader elijah muhammad. More personal details, including ali's divorce and even traffic tickets he received, were also included in his file. Another memo centers on ali's refusal to be drafted into the us military, which led to his heavyweight title being stripped from him, reuters reports. Ali discussed the controversy in a speech at a mosque in 1966, blaming the \" white man, \" per an fbi memo included in his file. More documents are expected to be released next year.",

Some coverage: science looks at the specific new regulatory powers granted to the epa. The number of chemicals the epa has issued regulations on, under the old rules: just five. Upi explains. Bloomberg sees a related problem: the agency gets more authority to review products, but may not have the resources to follow through. Consider this line: \" by the time epa finishes work on the chemicals it has prioritized, the children of today's children will have been exposed to them — probably for years. \" more on the nuts and bolts from the washington post, which calls it \" the most sweeping environmental measure to pass congress in a quarter-century. \" of note: it has the support of both the chemical industry and many ( but not all ) environmental groups. Industry groups were ok with it because they prefer one federal law as opposed to a \" patchwork \" of different ones in states, notes the wall street journal. Politico credits a \" perfect storm \" of circumstances for the measure ( called the frank r. Lautenberg chemical safety for the 21st century act ), including growing consumer concern over kids'toys and even furniture. One big opponent: rand paul, as a separate washington post story details.

Other polls show clinton with a smaller but still substantial lead, including a wall street journal/nbc poll that puts her 9 points ahead, at 47 % to 38 %.

In other coverage: according to nbc's breakdown of poll numbers, trump has retained a 5-point lead among white voters, though he's the choice of just 1 % of black voters. Some 48 % of poll respondents said he was the best choice to change business as usual in washington, compared to 26 % for clinton, while just 29 % thought he was the best choice for foreign policy, compared to 55 % for clinton.

Authorities tell the boston herald that philip chism caught the 4: 30pm showing of woody allen's blue jasmine on tuesday. At the time, he was only considered a missing person, but police believe he had already killed ritzer by then. \" he was here and gone before we even knew he was here, \" the theater's manager says. In court, an official said that chism \" did assault and beat \" ritzer to death, according to the new york times. But myfoxboston has a more lurid description: a source says chism told police that he followed ritzer into the bathroom, \" punched her in the face, and slashed her throat with a box cutter. \" he then carried the body into the woods using a recycling bin. In other developments: danvers schools will reopen today, save for the high school itself, which will instead make grief counselors available from 10am to 12pm. A vigil was held in ritzer's memory last night, with roughly 300 people coming out to mourn. \" she supported all of us. We should be there to support her, \" one senior there told the ap. Ritzer was by all accounts a beloved and caring teacher. \" i hate math … but she made it fun, \" says one 17-year-old, recalling one incident in which ritzer noticed he was in a bad mood, and took him into the hall to talk about it. \" we ended up talking out in the hall for like 20 minutes. I walked in the class feeling a lot better … it was amazing. \" ritzer was pursuing a master's degree in school counseling at salem state university, according to cnn. Ritzer's engagement with her students extended to social media, where she posted encouraging messages and jokes. You can see some of them at abc news. Prosecutors won't say anything about chism's relationship with ritzer, but they did confirm that the freshman was in one of her classes. His teammates on the junior varsity soccer team tell the herald that he excelled in math. \" he never seemed like a bad kid, \" one of those teammates says. The 6-foot-2 chism was the team's lead scorer. \" i asked him one time,'so do you think you're going to get into harvard? he said, ' yeah, i have a pretty good shot.

The attorney is indeed in iowa, and on friday he ' ll be an invited speaker at the democratic wing ding fundraiser, which has previously attracted the likes of hillary clinton, bernie sanders, and barack obama. Avenatti knows what you're thinking: publicity stunt. But he insists that isn't the case. \" anybody paying attention in the last six months knows the last thing i need is any additional publicity, \" he tells the new york times. After iowa, avenatti will be off to new hampshire, the first primary state. The new republic checks around and rounds up reaction it describes as ranging from \" amusement to despair. \" but avenatti says times have changed, adding, \" democrats need to nominate somebody who can actually beat this guy. \"",

A hiker from flagstaff, ariz., is apparently among the latter group. The coconino county sheriff's office says a search-and-rescue team had to come to the aid of the 30-year-old hiker, who got stuck in heavy snow on mount elden during his quest for a free pie tuesday morning, reports the arizona republic. The unidentified hiker, wearing only shorts and a tank top, had been racing to the mountain peak in order to win a free pizza from local pizzeria pizzicletta but was apparently unaware of heavy snow conditions and called for help around 9am. A forest service employee sighted the hiker from a lookout tower and brought him inside to await the rescue team. A rep for the coconino county sheriff's office tells kpnx he was \" shivering heavily and probably at mild stages of hypothermia. \" the office says there was as much as 5 inches of snow on the ground at the time. Friends eventually took the man home, per azfamily.com. The owner of pizzicletta says the contest for a free pizza was voluntary and he expected participants to check the weather forecast before taking part. \" we never want anyone to risk their life for pizza. It's certainly not worth it, \" caleb schiff says. It's not clear if the hiker ever got his pie. ( this man won free pizza for a year, then gave it away. )",

        "summary": "House republicans still plan on holding a vote on the american health care act — the gop's obamacare replacement — on thursday despite its continuing to not be super popular with the legislators who are supposed to be voting for it, the week reports. If 22 house republicans vote against bill, it will fail. Here's what you need to know: politico reports the stiffest opposition to the ahca is coming from the far-right house freedom caucus, whose chairman predicts 25 gop votes against the bill. The caucus ' opposition comes despite a 90-minute meeting with president trump on wednesday. Conservatives are split in their opposition to the bill, with some saying it deprives too many of health care, while others complaining it doesn't go far enough to repeal the affordable care act, according to the los angeles times. As a sign of how things seem to be going for the ahca, republican rep. Thomas massie of kentucky tweeted wednesday to change his vote from a simple \" no \" to a more emphatic \" hell no. \" meanwhile, sean spicer says the white house is confident the ahca will pass, adding there isn't a \" plan b. \" \" there's ' plan a ' and ' plan a, ' \" talking points memo quotes the press secretary as saying. Fivethirtyeight reports that if the ahca somehow passes, it could have serious ramifications for the gop. The aca only had 41 % public support, and it cost congressional democrats dearly in the next election; the ahca currently has 32 % public support. On the other hand, a video on politico looks at three things to expect if the bill fails, including who will be blamed and how democrats will take advantage. Finally, reuters reports wall street is looking at the ahca as a test of how quickly and easily trump can make his agenda a reality. Us markets could see a dip if it — and by extension trump — fails.",

The supreme court in london has ruled in favor of a 44-year-old man who got severely penalized over a small loan for a laptop that he never actually owned, reports the guardian. Richard durkin's case began in 1998 when he bought a $ 2,400 laptop at a store called pc world. He put $ 50 down and signed a credit deal with hfc bank, a division of hsbc, which handled the store's in-store financing. Durkin returned the laptop the next day, as he was told he could do, when he discovered it didn't have the appropriate modem. The store ( eventually ) returned his deposit. The bank? not so much. Hfc insisted that durkin still had to honor his loan payments on the laptop he didn't possess. He refused, and the bank destroyed his credit rating in turn, reports the bbc. Durkin won about $ 13,000 in damages, though he estimates that he's out far more than that because of his lousy credit. He says, for instance, that he was unable to buy a home. \" it's victory, but they didn't have jurisdiction to help me in the end, which is disappointing, \" he says. \" but i ' m pleased for the consumer. A lot of people will benefit from this — it's massive. \" both stories suggest that his victory could pave the way for others to challenge their credit ratings in court.",

Devised in australia, the test uses a color-changing liquid and a new cancer-detection approach that could help people pre-screen before having more thorough tests. \" a major advantage of this technique is that it is very cheap and extremely simple to do, so it could be adopted in the clinic quite easily, \" says study co-author laura carrascosa. The test is simple: a patient's dna is placed in water containing gold nanoparticles. Dna from cancer cells will cling to the gold, making the water's color stay pink; if the cells are healthy, they bind differently and make the water turn blue, per the smithsonian. \" we certainly don't know yet whether it's the holy grail for all cancer diagnostics, but it looks really interesting \" and doesn't require a biopsy or complicated equipment, says team leader matt trau. Sadly, it can't spot the size or location of a tumor, and its \" 90 % success rate \" is furrowing at least one brow: \" what if you had cancer and you were one of the 10 % whose true cancer was not detected? \" writes gary schwitzer at health news review. A california doctor tells usa today he's concerned whether the test will trigger false positives, since cancer is actually uncommon. Other \" simple \" tests have emerged lately, including one that detects up to 10 cancer types and another that can spot eight kinds of cancer before symptoms emerge, reports marketwatch.

The newly discovered planet 340 light-years from earth in the constellation centaurus is the first found to be orbiting three suns and is scorching at 1,000 degrees — though that's mostly because of its gas formation. Discovered by astronomers using a special tool to detect the heat signatures of young planets, hd 131399ab is actually twice as far from its sun as pluto is from ours. Two other stars circling each other orbit the same sun from much farther away. That means that for about half of the planet's orbit, it enjoys three sunrises and sunsets on each of its days. But that's only part of why coming up with a calendar for the planet would be a real challenge, reports cnet. It takes 550 earth-years for it to complete an orbit, so its seasons last longer than a human life. \" for much of the planet's year the stars appear close together, giving it a familiar night-side and day-side, \" researcher kevin wagner says in a release. \" as the planet orbits and the stars grow further apart each day, they reach a point where the setting of one coincides with the rising of the other — at which point the planet is in near-constant daytime for about one-quarter of its orbit, or roughly 140 earth-years. \" the planet is four times the size of jupiter, orbits a star 80 % bigger than our sun, and is one of the youngest exoplanets found so far at roughly 16 million years old. And though researchers still have lots to learn about hd 131399ab, \" it shows there is more variety out there than many would have deemed possible, \" wagner says. \" what we do know is that planets in multi-star systems are much less explored, and potentially just as numerous as planets in single-star systems. \"",

Not only has the apple founder received 141 patents since his death in 2011, he will be the star witness in a class-action antitrust lawsuit set to open in california today. The case will feature a videotaped deposition from jobs, as well as some of his emails, reports the ap. The plaintiffs accuse apple of using the \" fairplay \" anti-copying software used in songs sold through the itunes store to stifle competition and keep ipod prices high. Songs from other online stores couldn't be played on ipods, and songs bought on itunes wouldn't play on other, cheaper devices — and itunes updates thwarted the realplayer music store's attempts to make its music playable on ipods. The lawsuit applies to ipods sold between 2006 and 2009, and apple could be out $ 350 million if it loses the case. This is apple's third big antitrust suit since jobs died, and in earlier cases his emails — \" a mix of blunt litigation threats against his opponents and cheery financial promises for potential business partners \" — have made the ceo \" an exceptional witness against his own company, even beyond the grave, \" writes brian x. Chen at the new york times. One email already made public in the latest case was sent in 2003 when jobs was concerned about a software firm opening a new online music store. \" we need to make sure that when music match launches their download music store they cannot use ipod, \" he wrote to other apple execs. \" is this going to be an issue? \" ( read about one patent jobs has nabbed since his death. )",

Snow will then move into new york in time for wednesday morning's commute, and will hit boston later wednesday. Winter storm warnings are in place from massachusetts all the way down to western north carolina, and the ap reports the storm is also expected to wallop new jersey, delaware, and parts of eastern pennsylvania — philadelphia could get more snow than new york. Wind gusts of up to 35mph are expected, and power outages could ensue. As of 7am, 268 tuesday flights had already been canceled ( philadelphia, new york, and boston are the main airports affected ).

The bulk of the dangerous, wind-driven snow and sleet is expected to wallop new jersey, maryland, delaware and parts of eastern pennsylvania before heading off to nantucket early thursday. A foot ( 0.3 meters ) to 16 inches ( 0.4 meters ) of snow is forecast in new york city; philadelphia could get slightly more. Coastal flood warnings are posted for shore communities. Sleet and freezing rain are expected by tuesday afternoon, the first day of spring. The mixed precipitation should turn to all snow by late tuesday and continue through most of wednesday. Widespread power outages are possible, especially wednesday, with gusts blowing up to 35 mph ( 56 kph ). The jet stream, the upper level river of air that guides weather, is stuck in a plunging pattern that brings plenty of moisture from the south up the east coast, said brian hurley, senior forecaster at the national weather service's weather prediction center. Four nor ' easters in three weeks is highly unusual, but it happens when a pattern locks in. And that's happened, hurley said. Officials are cautioning against unnecessary travel wednesday afternoon and evening, when snow could be falling as much as 4 inches per hour. It's also not yet clear where the heaviest snow bands may develop."

Mike huckabee's resignation from its board of directors, effective immediately, \" said a cma rep, per the tennessean. In the past, huckabee has tied legalizing gay marriage to incest and polygamy, as well as railed against adoption by same-sex couples, cnn notes.

Huckabee posted his resignation note on twitter, tweeting, \" gee, anthony'the mooch'scaramucci lasted longer than me! \" he was more serious in his post, titled \" hate wins. \" \" i genuinely regret that some in the industry were so outraged by my appointment that they bullied the cma and the foundation, \" he wrote. He noted his music and education background and says he hopes \" the entertainment industry will become more tolerant and inclusive and recognize that a true love for kids having access to the arts is more important than a dislike for someone or a group of people because of who they are or what they believe. \"",

Yet her name, isis, is the same name that's become interchangeable with isil, the islamic state of iraq and the levant. Her father, david emami, can't stand how regularly his daughter's name is being misused. \"they start to wear on you a little bit, \" emami said. \"it's kind of mentally draining and especially when you know it's the inaccurate term. \" emami says he's heard people go beyond teasing his daughter. \" you want to call her name and you get weird looks now and that's not acceptable, and i don't think we should be paying the price for inaccurate use of an acronym, \" emami said. Like an awful game of telephone, the terrorist keep getting called isis. \"it's a beautiful name, \" emami said. \"she's named after an egyptian goddess. To see it be misused in such a form it's gut-wrenching, it hurts. \" emami has started an online petition, encouraging people and media outlets to stop using isis when referring to isil. \" we're proud of her name, you know we want to see these guys go away, \" emami said.",

        "summary": "Charles darwin worried about a possible hole in his theory of evolution, but some american scientists may just have plugged it. For about a billion years after the dawn of life on earth, organisms didn't evolve all that much. Then about 600 million years ago came the \" cambrian explosion. \" everything changed relatively quickly, with all kinds of plants and animals emerging — which doesn't quite seem to fit with darwin's theory of slow change, hence \" darwin's dilemma. \" now, within a few days of each other, two new studies have appeared that could explain the shift, abc news reports. One, by scientists at yale and the georgia institute of technology, suggests that oxygen levels may have been far less plentiful in the atmosphere prior to the cambrian explosion than experts had thought. The air may only have been.1 % oxygen, which couldn't sustain today's complex organisms, indicating a shift had to happen before the \" explosion \" could take place. In a separate study, a university of texas professor explains where that oxygen burst may have come from: a major tectonic shift. Based on geological evidence, ian dalziel believes what is now north america remained attached to the supercontinent gondwanaland until the early cambrian period, in contrast with current belief, which has the separation occurring earlier. That shift would have put more oxygen into the atmosphere, per a press release, and brought nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean to shallow waters, helping to foster new life forms, livescience reports. ( here's how cotton balls helped save darwin's finches. )",

The new titanium oxide mineral, believed to be some 4.5 billion years old, was named after pan gu, a giant from chinese mythology who created the world by separating yin and yang.

Since 2007, geologist chi ma of caltech has been probing the meteorite with a scanning electron microscope, discovering nine new materials, including panguite. Ma and his team have determined that panguite was one of the first solid materials to coalesce in our solar system, roughly 4.567 billion years ago. The mineral's name is a reference to pan gu, a primitive, hairy giant from chinese mythology who separated yin and yang with a swing of his enormous axe, thereby creating the earth and sky. Panguite's primordial nature means that it was actually around before the earth and other planets formed, meaning it can help scientists learn more about the conditions in the cloud of gas and dust that gave rise to our solar system.

They ran to their 16-year-old son, who had been hit by a ball, as he collapsed and stopped breathing. His mom, dr. Gina agredano, jumped into action, doing cpr on her boy for three minutes until an on-site defibrillator was brought over to shock and re-start jose's heart. \" i said to myself we were not going to die today, \" gina agredano tells the mercury news. The ball had struck jose on the left side of his chest, stopping his heart in what is called an impact-induced cardiac arrest. A doctor who treated jose at the hospital after his ordeal explains that such events are possible when something hits the left side of a person's chest at just the right time in the electrical cardiac cycle, between heartbeats. \" had it not been for the cpr and defibrillator, jose would've died, \" she says. Jose — who managed to pass the ball before collapsing, per the benito link, and at first thought he'd just had the wind knocked out of him, per ktvu — is expected to make a full recovery with no long-term damage. His reaction when he woke up in the ambulance? \" i was really happy to be alive, but kind of upset because i wanted to keep playing. \" ( a teen helped save the life of the officer who was booking him into jail. )",

Although it is hard to determine who exactly updates the site, it is believed to be directly run by the north korean government. Thus, the uriminzok twitter account could be the first official presence of north korea on twitter. The first message on the twitter account was posted last week, declaring in korean that the website \" our nation \" now has a twitter account. Subsequent messages were links to either important documents from north korean history or news items from the uriminzokkiri website. North korea is run by one of the world's most secretive regimes, but lately it's been embracing social media; last month, uriminzokkiri launched a youtube account, which currently contains 78 videos. However, the north korean government is hardly opening up with its new online presence, as the content posted on these accounts is pure propaganda and interaction with other users is currently nonexistent."

        "summary": "A suburban philadelphia judge settled one of two key pretrial issues in bill cosby's sexual assault trial on monday when he ruled that the jury could hear cosby's damaging testimony from a decade-old civil deposition. The defense had argued that cosby only gave the testimony after being assured he would never be charged in the case. But montgomery county judge steven o ' neill concluded that cosby had no such guarantee, the ap reports. O ' neill has vowed to bring the case to trial by june. The 79-year-old cosby is charged with felony sexual assault. Here's where the criminal case against cosby stands, and what's ahead: why the deposition is so important. The nearly 1,000 pages of often-lurid testimony show another side of the actor known as \" america's dad \" for his portrayal of amiable dr. Cliff huxtable in the cosby show from 1984-1992. Cosby acknowledged a string of extramarital affairs over 50 years and said he had given young women drugs or alcohol before sexual encounters that he deemed consensual. Many of the women say they were drugged and molested. What cosby says about the accuser. Cosby acknowledged the 2004 sexual encounter with accuser andrea constand, and described putting his hand down her pants after giving her three unidentified blue pills. He said he did not hear her object. \" and so i continue and i go into the area that is somewhere between permission and rejection. I am not stopped, \" he said. Prosecutors believe constand was semi-conscious and unable to give consent. What about other women? cosby testified that he had gotten quaaludes from his doctor in the 1970s and kept them on hand to give to women before sex. He said he considered it illegal to offer someone the party drug, but did so in the same way someone might say, \" have a drink. \" what's next in the case. The judge will hear arguments next week on the other key pretrial issue, the question of how many other accusers can testify at trial about cosby's alleged pattern of drugging and molesting women. Da kevin steele hopes to call 13 other women as \" prior bad act \" witnesses. The defense will fight strenuously to block their testimony, questioning their credibility and relevance. The hearing is set for dec. 13 and 14. How is cosby doing? cosby has not spent any time in custody since his dec. 30 arrest. He posted $ 1 million bail the same day and has made about a half-dozen court appearances, usually flanked by a team of lawyers and handlers. Defense lawyers say the 79-year-old comedian is legally blind and suffering memory problems, rendering him unable to help",

The lawsuit was actually just one of five filed in california on monday, reports reuters, and they add to the growing litigation over the massacre. The big targets are mgm resorts, owner of the mandalay bay hotel where paddock stayed, and the organizers of the country musical festival he fired upon. The lawsuits accuse both of lax security and training, and npr notes that one issue in particular was raised — mandalay bay's decision to give high-roller paddock access to a service elevator not open to the public. Paddock is believed to have used the elevator to sneak his arsenal of automatic weapons into his hotel room undetected. Lawsuits previously filed in nevada raised the same point. Still, \" one can't blame the hotel for not predicting that this gunman would go up to their 32nd floor with an arsenal and break out the windows and start firing at people, \" a law professor at the university of denver tells npr. The new suits also cite the makers of bump stocks, devices used by paddock to make his guns more lethal, as well as paddock's estate. The litigation could take years to resolve, notes the los angeles times. Paddock killed 58 people and injured about 500 more.",
