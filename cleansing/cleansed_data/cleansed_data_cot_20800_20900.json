        "summary": "Recent studies have suggested drinking while pregnant might not be as dangerous as women have long been led to believe, or may even be beneficial — but, troubled by these plus other recent studies finding that a surprising number of women do imbibe while pregnant, the american academy of pediatrics is out with a new study that strongly declares: don't do it. At all. \" during pregnancy: no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; [ and ] all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk, \" the study states. That's because, researchers explain in a press release, alcohol intake while pregnant can result in a wide array of problems from growth retardation to developmental delays and learning disabilities to problems with the brain, heart, bones and spine, kidneys, vision, or hearing. Dr. Janet f. Williams, one of the lead researchers, tells live science that much attention is paid to fetal alcohol syndrome — but even if your child doesn't get that, he hasn't necessarily escaped scot-free. In fact, there are any number of so-called fetal alcohol spectrum disorders that are linked to drinking while pregnant, and any time a child experiences a delay or a behavioral disorder, she explains, an fasd could be to blame — but fasds are more difficult to diagnose than fas. The new study points out that more than three decades of research links alcohol intake while pregnant with birth defects, she says, far more than any evidence suggesting it's no big deal. The bottom line, she says: \" no alcohol use during pregnancy guarantees that fetal alcohol spectrum disorders will not occur. \" ( but at least you don't have to worry too much about drinking while breastfeeding. )",

Another bystander dove in and rescued her: \" i grabbed her and helped her get up the beach, \" surfer trevor griffiths tells abc 7. Coast guard rescuers in a helicopter later pulled larry moore from the water — accounts say he was in there anywhere from 15 minutes to more than an hour — and he was pronounced dead five minutes after the rescue. Claudia moore tells ktvu that she had told her husband to go for help instead of trying to rescue her, because she felt she could stay afloat.

Leonard has no idea why gobi is so attached to him, but he decided to bring her back to scotland with him.

Leonard rushed back to china from scotland and launched a massive search in the city of urumqi, enlisting social media, volunteers, posters, and tv news. Despite having little hope of finding gobi in such a huge city, leonard stayed up 34 hours straight looking for her, npr reports. Finally on wednesday a man called leonard and said he and his son found gobi in the park while walking their dog. Leonard was skeptical, but as soon as he walked in their home gobi \" was running up my leg and jumping all over me and squealing with delight. \" leonard tells the bbc that finding gobi was \" one of the best days of my life. \" he hopes gobi will be finished with quarantine in time to join him for christmas in scotland.",

At least that's what two justices indicated today during an 80-minute oral argument involving a california teachers ' union, usa today reports. In friedrichs v. California teachers association, plaintiffs argue that the union can't make non-members contribute fees toward collective bargaining for salaries and benefits. Plaintiffs are making a first amendment case, saying workers shouldn't have to pay without having a say in union demands. Now chief justice john roberts and justice anthony kennedy seem to be siding with the court's five conservative members, which is likely a lock for the plaintiffs, reuters reports. \" the union basically is making these teachers ' compelled riders ' for issues on which they strongly disagree, \" says kennedy. And roberts seems to be siding with justice antonin scalia, who says these are really political dues because all union actions are inherently political. California and the teachers ' union argue that non-member fees ensure there's enough money for the union to function and avoid having \" free riders \" who benefit without paying dues, scotusblog reports. \" if they are given a choice, they would prefer to have it for free, rather than to pay for it, \" says a california official.

It sounds like a relatively mundane question, but the court's decision could have a broad impact on the financial health of public-employee unions and possibly even politics more broadly. Let's talk about friedrichs v. California teachers association in plain english. To understand the case, you have to start with the current law on public-employee contributions to unions.

            "Next monday, the justices will hear oral arguments in a case which asks them to overrule a 1977 decision and hold that public employees who don't want to join the union that represents them also can't be required to pay a fee to cover the costs that the union incurs in collective bargaining. It sounds like a relatively mundane question, but the court's decision could have a broad impact on the financial health of public-employee unions and possibly even politics more broadly. Let's talk about friedrichs v. California teachers association in plain english. To understand the case, you have to start with the current law on public-employee contributions to unions. It is settled that public employees who are not members of the union cannot be required to pay fees that a union would use for political activity like union organizing. But the supreme court held in the 1977 case,",

        "summary": "An upcoming hbo documentary about the ever-elusive street artist banksy is worthwhile for fans, but \" it doesn't cast a light on who banksy is or what she looks like, \" writes kriston capps at citylab. That's right, what she looks like. For a variety of reasons, capps thinks it's more likely that banksy is a woman. Yes, most interviews with people who supposedly know banksy refer to the artist as a \" he, \" and the 2010 film exit through the gift shop features a voice purported to be banksy's that is scrambled but nonetheless obviously belongs to a man. Capps thinks it's all deliberate misdirection. She cites one theory that bansky is actually a team of seven artists led by a woman and finds it at least as plausible as the \" flimsy \" suggestions that banksy is a man. Look at the art itself. \" girls and women figure into banksy's stenciled figures, for starters, something that isn't true of 99 percent of street art, \" writes capps. Nor is it concerned with the \" masculine \" idea of \" redundant branding, \" referring to the way many street artists make their name by repeating an image over and over. Banksy innovates in contemporary art, another \" feminine trait, \" writes capps. \" the best selfie artists are women, for example, \" she writes. Banksy, then, is \" at the intersection of the street and the art world, \" concludes capps. \" why would anyone expect that position to be occupied by a man? \" click for the full column.",

These hooligans weren't banksy. Neither were the police officers who took possession of the piece after the failed heist and denied that it was art. Nor in all likelihood was the silver-haired man who sold $ 420 worth of banksy prints for $ 60 a pop in central park, or the drivers who slowly trawled new york streets in trucks tricked out with banksy's sculpture, or the accordionist accompanying one of banksy's installations. While the film shares a lot of insights about street art, media sensationalism, viral phenomena, and the people who make banksy possible, it doesn't cast a light on who banksy is or what she looks like. \" banksy hunters \" who tracked the elusive artist over the course of her month-long residency last october never caught a glimpse of her — at least, so far as anyone can be sure.

Polls remain tight, with moore hanging on to a slight edge of about 2 points in the real clear politics average of polls. Still, as fivethirtyeight notes, this race has been difficult to poll for various reasons, and the difference right now falls within the statistical margin of error. It's doubtful the race will be called early, especially if turnout is relatively heavy, as expected, notes al.com. Politico highlights some keys to the race: if jones hopes to win, he ' ll need to get heavy turnout from black voters, while moore can counter that with heavy turnout among rural conservatives. One big x factor, however: whether write-in votes will hurt moore. Cnn, meanwhile, observes that the key for both candidates might be performing well in mobile.

Eden hoelscher's mom, kylee hoelscher, reports in a gofundme page set up to help with that therapy that her daughter was walking at 9 months, potty-trained herself at 18 months, and rode a bike, sans training wheels, the first time she tried. \" she just came out of the womb with so much energy, \" hoelscher tells abc news. Doing flips and falling came with bumps and bruises, so after eden did a simple gymnastics move she'd done dozens of times before — pushing herself off the ground in a backbend position — and complained that her legs and hip hurt, her mother hugged her and told her to calm down. A half-hour later eden's face changed; she said she felt like her legs had fallen asleep and she was unable to move them. That was on dec. 23; the 5-year-old would go on to spend the next 52 days in the hospital, where doctors discovered she had hyperextended her spine and caused the artery that feeds her spinal cord to stop pumping blood, causing a stroke in her spinal cord and paralyzing her from the waist down. \" the extent of damage is unheard of, \" her mother writes. \" her bowels and bladder do not work. We have to wake up twice a night to move her so she won't get pressure sores from sleeping in one position too long. \" still, eden was back in school a week after being discharged from the hospital, reports people, and the family is hopeful that upcoming physical therapy and locomotor training at facilities in baltimore and louisville will help eden achieve their \" ultimate goal \": walking.

But that's no longer a valid excuse for not getting in better shape. According to a study published tuesday in plos one, gibala and fellow researchers have shown that just one minute of go-for-broke exercising is as beneficial as a 45-minute moderate workout. \" if you are someone, like me, who just wants to boost health and fitness and you don't have 45 minutes or an hour to work out, our data show that you can get big benefits from even a single minute of intense exercise, \" gibala tells the new york times. Researchers split 27 \" sedentary men \" into three groups. The first group continued not working out as usual, the second group did 45 minutes of moderate pedaling on a stationary bike plus five minutes of warm-up/cool-down, and the final group did 10 minutes of sprint interval training. That training included just the aforementioned one minute of intense exercise: three 20-second intervals of pedaling as hard as possible, which alternated with two two-minute recovery periods of very slow pedaling and five total minutes of warm-up/cool-down. Both exercising groups worked out three times a week for 12 weeks and showed nearly identical improvements in their health and fitness. ( this man lost 70 pounds eating nothing but potatoes. )",

One of the most disconcerting trends of the modern internet is the specific, reflexive ways that bad actors have learned to manipulate and dismiss inconvenient truths by using the culture, systems, and mechanics of the internet. In the four decades since the internet expanded beyond its military origins, a clear playbook has emerged for denying reality — and it's one that is insidiously easy to use. That hasn't been good for discourse or truth. Elon musk, the tech mogul and tesla ceo, might be about to make things worse. Yesterday, musk took issue with a negative article about tesla, tweeting that \"the holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them. \" in the resulting tweetstorm — which ricocheted around the internet like a bullet in a cartoon — musk floated the idea of founding a crowdsourced site called pravda, which would, in musk's words, let \"the public [... ] rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication. \" problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as tesla doesn't advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world's biggest advertisers. — elon musk ( @elonmusk ) may 23, 2018 even if some of the public doesn't care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors &amp; publications will. It is how they define themselves. — elon musk ( @elonmusk ) may 23, 2018 many, including musk '"

Reuters reports monsanto is offering what can amount to a more than 50 % rebate to farmers who agree to use the herbicide xtendimax with vaporgrip on their 2018 soybean crop. A rep for monsanto calls use of the product and the complementary soybeans engineered to withstand it part of the \" next level of weed control \"; us regulators are less bullish. After concerns that dicamba-based herbicides — xtendimax is one — are drifting to other crops that haven't been modified — the new york times in september called monsanto's modified seeds \" one of the biggest product releases in the company's history \" — more states are restricting the application period and requiring farmers who use the product to undergo training, making the product a bit more cumbersome to use. To address the first, reuters reports monsanto will give farmers a $ 6 per acre rebate on the product, which generally costs $ 11 per acre to apply. Ohio state university reiterated its position on how to minimize issues of dicamba drift: limit its use to early season, when there is \" less emerged vegetation, \" noting \" postemergence use of dicamba accounted for most of the off-target problems in 2017. \" to that end, reuters outlines some states ' in-the-works restrictions for 2018; arkansas is considering a ban on its use after april 15. Monsanto says it expects xtend soybeans to cover 40 million acres in 2018, a doubling of 2017's numbers. Agriculture.com reports 89.5 million acres of soybeans were planted in the us in summer 2017, and 3.6 million acres were thought to be harmed by dicamba drift.",

Farmers who buy a weed killer that has been linked to widespread crop damage, offering an incentive to apply its product even as regulators in several u.s. States weigh restrictions on its use. The incentive to use xtendimax with vaporgrip, a herbicide based on a chemical known as dicamba, could refund farmers over half the sticker price of the product in 2018 if they spray it on soybeans monsanto engineered to resist the weed killer, according to company data. The united states faced an agricultural crisis this year caused by new formulations of dicamba-based herbicides, which farmers and weed experts say harmed crops because they evaporated and drifted away from where they were sprayed. Monsanto says xtendimax is safe when properly applied.

            "This season's off-target movement of dicamba used in dicamba-tolerant soybeans was due to a number of reasons, but volatility wasn't one of them, say basf officials. Volatility results when a herbicide converts to a gas. When this happens, the herbicide in a gaseous form can leave the application site and damage plants where it lands. \"from a number of field investigations last summer, we identified multiple contributing factors, and we don't believe volatility is one of those driving factors, \" says chad asmus, basf technical market manager. Asmus and other basf officials held a conference call on november 17 with the agricultural media. Basf makes and markets engenia, one of the new dicamba formulations in monsanto's dicamba-tolerant roundup ready xtend system. The other two approved dicamba formulations are monsanto's xtendimax with vapor grip technology and dupont's fexapan plus vapor grip technology. Damage tally recent data tallied by university of missouri weed scientists indicate 2,708 dicamba-related injury cases are currently under investigation by various state agriculture departments. Approximately 3.6 million acres of soybeans were injured by off-target dicamba movement during 2017. Usda pegged total u.s. Soybean plantings last june 30 at 89.5 million acres. \"while most growers achieved great results stewarding dt crops this season, some non-dt farms experienced symptomology that may have come from the improper use of the new"

But the reason words like \" stunning, \" \" dazzling, \" and \" landmark \" are being used to describe the finding is that these vessels aren't supposed to be present in brains. Their presence suggests that our brain is directly connected to our immune system, a discovery that overturns previously accepted medical knowledge and has \" significant implications \" for the study of neurological diseases such as alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis, reports gizmag. \"the first time these guys showed me the basic result, i just said one sentence: 'they ' ll have to change the textbooks, ' \" says kevin lee, chair of uva's department of neuroscience. So how could scientists mapping the human body all these years have missed this? \" the elusive lymphatic vessel hid in plain sight, throughout decades of research, because it was very small and tucked behind a major blood vessel, \" explains business insider. The website says the study in nature is creating a buzz in the field, though it's not being met with total surprise because previous research had at least hinted at such a result. The next big step will be to try to confirm the findings in humans.

        "summary": "The good news for brandi chastain is that she got inducted into the san francisco bay area sports hall of fame on monday for her soccer prowess. The bad news is that much of the attention is focusing on her plaque, which bears an image of her that is, as she diplomatically puts it, \" not the most flattering, \" per the san jose mercury news. But \" it's nice, \" added chastain, who once provided the sports world with a more enduring image — her rip-the-shirt-off celebration after a world cup win in 1999. ( see it in the photo gallery. ) some reaction to the new plaque: \" brandi chastain is one of the most beautiful athletes i've ever covered, \" writes ann killion, a sports columnist at the san francisco chronicle. \" how this became her plaque is a freaking embarrassment for bashof. \" bashof official anthony savicke initially said the group had no plans to redo the plaque. The images on them are \" representations \" and not meant to be photographic replicas, he said, per the mercury news. However, ann killion of the chronicle tweeted that a wealthy patron had offered to pay for a new plaque. Bashof later relented, with its president telling ktvu it will be \" expensive \" but that the plaque will be redone. Chastain is a \" total babe, \" but the \" plaque made her look more like babe ruth, \" complains tmz. Helpful twitter users suggest the image was actually of bill belichick, mickey rooney, gary busey, or jimmy carter. Plus another vote for babe ruth. The sporting news rounds up other reactions. Lots of people were reminded of the weird bust of men's soccer great cristiano ronaldo.",

Prosecutors argued rudd staged the highway murder to look like a car accident before collecting $ 120,000 from life insurance policies and returning to live with another woman whom he later married. One of rudd's stepdaughters from that marriage, who described his deception in a book called living with the devil, testified rudd had left her mother just a day before his wedding. \" i ' m not asking you to like a guy who cheats on his girlfriend, but that doesn't mean he committed murder, \" his lawyer, tim grace, tells the chicago tribune. Vowing that an appeal will be successful ( if rudd survives his cancer treatment ), grace adds, \" it's outrageous to convict anyone on the testimony of someone trying to make a buck on a book. \" but jurors also heard from three pathologists — one who autopsied kumeta in 2013, finding she died of injuries inconsistent with being thrown from a car, as her husband claimed she was, and two who concurred. The autopsy came about through an investigation into the 1991 shooting death of one of rudd's legal clients. Loretta tabak-bodtke, who'd threatened to report rudd to the state's attorney disciplinary board after a squabble over money, was reportedly killed on the same day rudd's car was seen at her home. He remains a suspect in that killing but hasn't been charged, per wls. He faces a minimum of 14 years in the kumeta case.",

Except one word in that statement — \" waiver \" — rendered it inaccurate, as malik came into the country on a fiance visa, not through a federal program that waives visas. A confirmation from the white house noted obama's mistake, and the official transcript of the speech has corrected the error. As explained on the state department website, the visa waiver program allows eligible travelers from one of 38 participating countries to come to the us for up to 90 days without a visa. Malik had lived in both pakistan and saudi arabia before her arrival in the states, and neither country is one of the 38 covered under that waiver program. Instead, malik came in through what the los angeles times refers to as the \" previously obscure \" k-1 fiance visa program, which requires the newcomer to marry his or her us sponsor within 90 days of arrival. That program includes a reportedly comprehensive counterterrorism screening — including the use of fingerprint checks and facial recognition software — as well as other paperwork and interviews to prove that a couple is indeed planning on marriage.

In announcing one of the new steps his administration is taking to secure the u.s.

Obama said he'd requested a review of the \" visa waiver program \" under which one of the suspected san bernardino attackers arrived in the united states.

No reason was given — but a demonstration was happening on the sidewalk outside. There, 50 to 75 people gathered to protest new \" no-sit \" signs put up by the city outside the store. The signs read, \" the sidewalk is for pedestrian movement only. Please keep clear, \" kgw reports. The protesters believe those signs are a way to criminalize loitering downtown, and note they come a few weeks after the oregonian published an op-ed by columbia ceo tim boyle. He described his employees as having suffered threatening run-ins with panhandlers and numerous car break-ins since the company opened its new sorel headquarters adjacent to the store, reports the oregonian. \" we thought it was a good opportunity to be part of this millennial movement of young people setting up shop downtown, \" boyle wrote in the nov. 10 piece. \" but at the end of the day, i have to ensure the safety of my employees.... A few days ago, one of our employees had to run into traffic when a stranger outside our office followed her and threatened to kill her. \" boyle said he is considering closing the office and relocating his staff. Protesters point to that op-ed and the $ 15,000 contribution boyle made to the campaign of now-mayor ted wheeler. \" we think it's disgusting that a ceo that happened to give so much money to ted wheeler's campaign can write an op-ed and instantly these signs go up that no one is allowed to sit in front of his business, \" says portland's resistance founder gregory mckelvey.

So-called frbs ( fast radio bursts ) twinkle in the sky for only a millisecond, yet they radiate more energy than the sun ever could in 10,000 years. Although scientists have pinpointed only 18 of the bursts, they believe they flicker somewhere every 10 seconds or so. Since frbs were first discovered in 2007, astronomers have been hunting their source. They found some answers thanks to an frb that repeats — the only known one to do that, reports the verge. Using 27 radio telescopes in new mexico arrayed in a y shape, scientists captured high-resolution images of the bursts. Writing in the journal nature, researchers say they tracked a glimmer of light to a distant dwarf galaxy, a mass of stars smaller than our own milky way. By measuring the galaxy's movement through its light, they were able to determine its distance from earth — 3 billion light years. The finding left the telescope set a bit, er, underwhelmed. \" we were not sure what to expect, but i think the whole team was surprised to see that our exotic source is hosted by a very puny and faint galaxy, \" researcher cees bassa says, per space. Still unsolved: what's causing the waves. One theory is that a black hole belching light-speed jets of particles and \" blobs of plasma \" may sometimes create a bright flash, per the verge. Another idea is that those plasma blobs are magnifying pulses from a \" magnetar, \" a star with a strong magnetic field, allowing us to see the light bursts on earth.

Now, in a federal lawsuit, rivera's attorneys say they can prove police tried to frame rivera, the chicago tribune reports.

        "summary": "North korea's kim jong un promoted his younger sister over the weekend, naming kim yo jong, believed to be 28, to the nation's most important political body, the workers party's politburo. It's a rare sign of trust by kim in a family member, and the new york times speculates that he may want to make sure a familial successor is in line should anything happen to him before his young children are old enough to assume power. Related developments: full siblings: kim yo jong and kim jong un have the same parents ( their mother was a dancer who was one of kim jong il's wives ), and she has for years been seen at her brother's side at public functions, reports reuters. The pair, along with another full sibling, kim jong chol, who stays out of politics, are believed to have attended school in switzerland. She is also believed to be married, possibly to the son of a powerful party secretary. Blacklisted: in 2014, kim yo jong began working for the ruling party's propaganda arm and thus found herself among those blacklisted this year by the us treasury department for \" ongoing and serious human rights abuses and censorship activities, \" per time. Image control? reports in south korean media suggest that kim yo jong has been trying to improve her brother's image by encouraging visits to hospitals and such, reports usa today. She may also be behind his odd friendship with dennis rodman. Her job: kim yo jong is now an alternate member of the party's decision-making body, which generally rubber-stamps kim jong un's mandates. But she would theoretically get to take part in debates on issues including military decisions. She is only the second woman known to get such an appointment. The first was her aunt, who hasn't been seen in public in years and may be under house arrest. The aunt's husband was executed in 2013, per the times. Taking a toll: meanwhile, the wall street journal reports that us pressure on pyongyang is beginning to seriously pinch. More than 20 nations have reduced business or diplomatic ties with north korea through various means: kicking out ambassadors or guest workers, barring ships, limiting flights, etc. The idea, being pushed by secretary of state rex tillerson, is to try to show kim that the price for becoming a nuclear power is too high. Trump skeptical: one person apparently not sold on the above progress is trump himself. On monday, he tweeted, \" our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with north korea",

The senate may not need to follow suit, however, because the white house has ordered an administrative solution, reports cnn. Under a deal with the pentagon, the private fisher house foundation will provide the benefit to families, then get reimbursed by the defense department once the shutdown ends. The lapse emerged when the families of five troops who were killed in afghanistan over the weekend learned they wouldn't be receiving the death benefit because of the shutdown. \" my husband died for his country, and now his family is left to worry, \" the widow of joseph peters, one of the soldiers killed by an ied on sunday, told nbc news earlier.",

        "summary": "Nearly 80 % of people who've injured themselves while sleepwalking felt no pain and didn't even wake up, according to a new study published this month in sleep. And we're not talking about a stubbed toe or bumped elbow, either. One study subject jumped out a third-floor window — suffering multiple severe fractures — and didn't feel any pain until waking up later, according to an american academy of sleep medicine press release. It was the same for another person who fell off his roof and broke his leg while sleepwalking. Of the 100 sleepwalkers studied by a french research team, 47 reported injuring themselves while sleepwalking at least once. But only 10 actually woke up immediately from the pain. The study's lead researcher, dr. Regis lopez, says those numbers are surprising, according to the aasm press release. \"our results may help to understand the mechanisms of the sleepwalking episodes, \" lopez says. \"we hypothesize that a dissociate state of arousal may modify the components of sleep-wake behavior, consciousness, and also pain perception. \" as the international business times simplifies: researchers believe there's some sort of connection between sleepwalking and the neurons that send pain signals to the spinal cord and brain. The study also found sleepwalkers are nearly four times more likely to report a history of headaches and 10 times more likely to report suffering from migraines while awake.

Their evidence: the bones and cremated remains show signs of violence that jibe with the life of macedonian king philip ii, a warrior who lost an eye to an arrow at the siege of methone in 354bc, discovery reports via mashable. Presented by head researcher theodore antikas, the analysis includes x-ray images, electron-microscopic scans, and some 3,000 color photographs of the remains. Antikas says the remains show signs of a sinus infection \" that might have been caused by an old facial trauma \" ( the eye wound ), along with a sharp wound to the left hand ( likely a battle scar ) and degenerative markers and lesions that indicate a horse-rider in his middle years. What's more, the female remains buried alongside him apparently belong to a warrior woman whose body matches armor found in the tomb, meaning she likely used weaponry found there, too. What's the big deal? the weapons were forged by scythians — a group of ancient iranian tribes — and \" no macedonian king other than philip is known to have had'relations ' with a scythian, \" says antikas. He adds that the woman may have been the daughter of athea, the scythian king. If antikas'team is right, they will settle a debate that scholars have waged ever since the tomb was discovered by a greek archaeologist in 1977-78. Meanwhile, archaeologists at a burial mound 100 miles away have found a large floor mosaic dating back to the time of alexander the great, depicting the god hermes as he ushers souls to the afterlife, the ap reports.

This is particularly so given tennessee borders so many other states. Imagine, five months of the year when chattanoogans are planning to meet friends from north georgia, they will be on different times. The other seven months the time will be the same. Confusion will reign in every area that borders a different state ( and in tennessee, that includes georgia, alabama, north carolina, arkansas, virginia, etc. ). The legislator pushing the idea says getting rid of standard time in tennessee will benefit farmers and school students. Of course, he doesn't say how. If anything, it will create a dangerous condition for those students who will be forced to stand in the pitch black waiting",
            "By tom humphrey nashville — when tennesseans spring forward into daylight-saving time next month, they will never fall back into standard time again under legislation that has cleared its first step toward passage in the general assembly. \"it will be great for the farmers. It will be great for the school kids, \" said rep. Curry todd, r-collierville, sponsor of hb1909. \"i've talked to many businesses and folks across the state about this, and i've not got one negative comment about this bill. \" as amended in the house state government subcommittee, the bill simply declares that tennessee will drop out of the ritual of moving clocks forward an hour each year on the second sunday in march, then back again on the first sunday in november. The bill takes effect on july 1 and, since daylight-saving time will be in place on that date, the effect will be making daylight-saving time permanent, todd said. Todd said federal law allows states to make such moves as long as the state covers two time zones, as tennessee does: the eastern time zone in east tennessee and the central time zone in middle and west tennessee. Arizona, hawaii and indiana have successfully adopted a uniform time system with no changes by season, he said, and tennessee should do the same. The bill prompted both some joking"

        "summary": "If bill cosby had simply stuck to stand-up and fat albert over the years, the damning deposition revealed yesterday in which he confessed to obtaining drugs to sedate women may have remained sealed. That's the crux of justin wm. Moyer's article in the washington post, which explains how one of cosby's most famous lectures helped \" [ crown ] himself a moral crusader \" and \" may … go down in history as a case study in the costs of hypocrisy. \" the \" pound cake \" speech, which cosby presented at a 2004 naacp ceremony, railed on the failures of the black community. \" looking at the incarcerated, these are not political criminals, \" he said. \" these are people going around stealing coca-cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake! then we all run out and are outraged:'the cops shouldn't have shot him. ' what the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand? \" this speech, combined with other public tirades, may have been, as moyer puts it, what choked him. A us district court judge was forced to consider an ap request to unseal a deposition from a settled 2005 molestation case, the post notes. Simply being a celebrity wouldn't have warranted the release, per judge eduardo robreno, because stars have a right to privacy, and in most cases the release of such info wouldn't serve the greater good. But cosby wasn't most cases, robreno decided, because \" the defendant has donned the mantle of public moralist and mounted the proverbial electronic or print soap box to volunteer his views on, among other things, childrearing, family life, education, and crime, \" he wrote. He included a footnote that said \" item no. 1:'see, e.g., pound cake speech. ' \" \" the address the comedian used to shame others was now being used to shame him, \" moyer writes.

        "summary": "Pregnant at 33, new jersey's lauren bloomstein was excited to soon welcome her first baby into the world. But in a joint effort by propublica and npr, nina martin and renee montagne document how things went terribly wrong on oct. 1, 2011 — the day bloomstein's daughter, hailey anne, was born, and the day before bloomstein died from childbirth complications. Adding an extra level of awful irony: bloomstein was a neonatal intensive-care nurse, a fact looming over the equally shocking statistic that the us has the worst maternal mortality rate of all developed countries, with 60 % of those deaths avoidable. The reasons behind this phenomenon are many, with martin and montagne listing lack of adequate health care, older moms with more complicated health histories, and neglected health issues unrelated to pregnancy as just a few of the factors that could contribute to a new mom or mom-to-be dying. The us infant mortality rate, however, hit a \" historic low \" in 2014, per the cdc — meaning the medical community may have been lulled into complacency on the maternal care front while focusing attention on the babies. In bloomstein's case, she'd developed preeclampsia, a dangerous form of hypertension that can prove fatal if not caught quickly. Her husband, larry, watched in horror as her condition deteriorated, her elevated blood pressure eventually spurring brain hemorrhaging. She died 20 hours after hailey's birth. Advocates nationwide are slowly working to remedy this upending of the birthing process, via initiatives that help medical staff better deal with such emergencies. Larry, meanwhile, has since remarried and is raising 5-year-old hailey anne with his new wife and younger daughter. His lawsuit against lauren's ob-gyn, the medical center where she died, and five nurses is still pending. More here. ( texas has a disturbingly high maternal death rate. )",

It's time for that to change, writes julia greenberg in wired. Mayer has been criticized for setting a poor example for her female employees, but what about male employees? \" parental leave benefits only make a difference to the extent that employees feel confident they can take advantage of them, \" greenberg writes. \" it's understandable workers might worry that, whatever the official policy, taking time off could put their standing on the job and future opportunities at risk. \" that's why, even though more tech companies are offering generous maternity and paternity leave benefits, male executives need to actually take advantage of those benefits in order to assure those below them they won't be penalized for doing so. \" research has shown that parental leave significantly benefits not just women — and companies — but men as well, \" greenberg writes. \" dads who take extended time off are more likely to play an active role in child care and have higher satisfaction with parenting. \" click for her full piece.",

However, if i took the new job, a long leave couldn't happen.

        "summary": "Researcher matt lamanna calls it \" the holy grail \" of dinosaur discoveries. After decades of digging had left a 44-million-year gap in the fossil record for dinos in africa, lamanna says his jaw \" hit the floor \" when he saw photos of skull fragments, a lower jaw, neck and back vertebrae, shoulder and forelimb bones, and a foot bone indicating \" a well-preserved dinosaur … we paleontologists had been searching for for a long, long time, \" per a release. The bbc explains few dinosaur fossils have been found in africa from the late cretaceous period ( 100 million to 66 million years ago ) when the supercontinent pangaea broke apart and dinosaurs eventually disappeared. The gap left some wondering if african dinosaurs evolved separately from other species as the continent perhaps became more isolated. The discovery of mansourasaurus shahinae in western egypt disputes that theory. Found in the sahara desert in 2013, per national geographic, the long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur weighing as much as an elephant ( and also with bony plates in its skin ) is more closely related to dinosaurs from europe and asia than those from southern africa and south america, which suggests dinosaurs could move freely between africa and europe during the late cretaceous period. \" it shows africa wasn't this strange lost world of dinosaurs that lived nowhere else, \" says lamanna, whose research is published in nature ecology and evolution. Fellow researcher eric gorscak compares the discovery to a corner or edge piece of a puzzle \" that you use to help figure out what the picture is. \" experts expect more fossils lie in wait in africa, though vegetation and political conflict may prevent their discovery.

            "We have witnessed something very disturbing this week. The republican establishment which fought ronald reagan in the 1970s and which continues to fight the grassroots tea party movement today has adopted the tactics of the left in using the media and the politics of personal destruction to attack an opponent. We will look back on this week and realize that something changed. I have given numerous interviews wherein i espoused the benefits of thorough vetting during aggressive contested primary elections, but this week's tactics aren't what i meant. Those who claim allegiance to ronald reagan's 11th commandment should stop and think about where we are today. Ronald reagan and barry goldwater, the fathers of the modern conservative movement, would be ashamed of us in this primary.

Depp is in the country filming pirates of the caribbean: dead men tell no tales, and joyce issued the ultimatum today after discovering the dogs, boo and pistol, had been \" snuck in \" on depp's private jet instead of being declared to customs officials, the bbc reports. Joyce says officials discovered the dogs were in the country after they were taken to a groomer, the guardian reports. \" there is a process if you want to bring animals: you get the permits, they go into quarantine, and then you can have them, \" joyce tells abc australia, saying if the country lets movie stars — \" even though they've been the sexiest man alive twice \" — break the laws, \" then why don't we just break the laws for everybody? \" \" it's time that pistol and boo buggered off back to the united states, \" he says, suggesting depp \" put them on the same chartered jet he flew out on to fly them back out of our nation. \" joyce admits that after the blunt warning, he doesn't expect an invite to the opening of the fifth pirates of the caribbean movie, the guardian notes. An online petition urging joyce to spare the dogs has gained more than 2,000 signatures.",

But while park owner jordan patch saw the video stream, set up in anticipation of the calf's birth, as educational, some animal activists saw otherwise and lobbied youtube to take the stream down for hosting nudity and sexually explicit content, per mashable. Patch took to facebook live thursday morning to lay into the \" extremists \" and to tell viewers that he was on the \" same team \" as anyone who wants the animals cared for and that \" instead of sitting behind a keyboard or holding up [ a ] protest sign, get behind conservation. \" youtube tells mashable that, due to the volume of content it's reviewing, it sometimes errs when it gets a complaint about a video flouting the site's community guidelines, but that its appeals process helps keep things in check — which it apparently did for april's live-stream, which returned shortly after 9am thursday.

By early sunday afternoon, martin was responding. After apologizing to cameron with a tweet, martin assured him, \" i will deal with it personally \" and asked cameron to privately send him more specifics. A statement from the airport offered a similar mea culpa, noting \" the images shared certainly don't reflect the high standards we expect to deliver and it was reassuring to see mr. Martin respond personally to the feedback received. \" cameron adds that airport food in general isn't very good and that he's pleased with martin's genuine-seeming response. \" that's proper customer service right there, \" he tweeted wednesday. \" hats off to the man. \" ( meanwhile, good news on the banana front. )",

        "summary": "Western leaders were wary of congratulating vladimir putin after the russian leader's overwhelming election win — with one notable exception. President trump said tuesday that he congratulated putin on the victory during a \" very good \" phone call, which the washington post reports went directly against the advice of trump's national security advisers. Sources tell the post that it would have been hard for trump to misinterpret the advice: his briefing materials stated \" do not congratulate \" in capital letters. The sources say trump, who told reporters he would \" probably \" be meeting putin \" in the not-too-distant future, \" also ignored advice to condemn the recent poisoning of a former russian spy. The post's sources say it's not clear whether trump — who initiated the phone call — even read his briefing materials before calling the russian leader. Sen. John mccain was one of the strongest critics of the congratulatory call. \" an american president does not lead the free world by congratulating dictators on winning sham elections, \" he said in a statement. By doing so, trump \" insulted every russian citizen who was denied the right to vote in a free and fair election to determine their country's future, including the countless russian patriots who have risked so much to protest and resist putin's regime, \" mccain said. Cnn reports that white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders rejected mccain's criticism. \" we don't get to dictate how other countries operate, \" she said.",

After their cars caught fire as they tried to drive to safety, parents jon and sara shepherd and 17-year-old daughter kressa became separated from kai as they fled on foot. All four were quickly overcome by smoke and collapsed. Hours later, a neighbor found sara and kressa badly injured and called 911, but kai was beyond saving, the los angeles times reports. Kai's body was found around 50 feet away from his mother and sister, who tried to run toward their home and were burned over more than 60 % of their bodies. His father, who ran the other way, was burned over around 45 % of his body. All three surviving family members are still hospitalized and sedated. Relatives say they haven't yet told them the terrible news about kai, the youngest fire victim identified so far.

As some media outlets noted, trump put forth no evidence backing his claim in the the tweets, made roughly two hours apart. They read: first: \" report just out: ' china hacked hillary clinton's private email server. ' are they sure it wasn't russia ( just kidding! )? what are the odds that the fbi and doj are right on top of this? actually, a very big story. Much classified information! \" then: \" hillary clinton's emails, many of which are classified information, got hacked by china. Next move better be by the fbi &amp; doj or, after all of their other missteps ( comey, mccabe, strzok, page, ohr, fisa, dirty dossier etc. ), their credibility will be forever gone! \" the hill notes the tweets came on the heels of a monday report from the daily caller that made the china claim based on unnamed intelligence sources. Per the caller, the hack was uncovered in 2015 and allegedly used the following ruse: a virginia-based company ( and not a technology one ) that acted as a front for the chinese government and inserted a line of code into clinton's server that sent a \" courtesy copy \" of each of her emails to china. Fox news notes it's unclear whether trump's tweets were based on the caller report or \" after learning about new intelligence. \" china commented broadly. A rep for the chinese foreign ministry didn't mention trump or clinton specifically but brushed off the accusations as similar to ones china has heard before and reiterated the country's opposition to such internet attacks, per reuters.",

Odd or unpleasant odors have been the top complaint from new car buyers in china, according to jd power's annual initial quality surveys. In contrast, new-car smell was the 21st most common complaint among us buyers, who most often said their voice command systems didn't work as well as they should. Now that china is the world's largest car market, this could mean the death of new-car smell as we have come to know and love it ( in the us, at least ). In january, fast company interviewed several ford engineers, who said the company didn't have the assembly capacity to make different interiors for different regions. ( new-car smell is a result of newly-produced industrial goods \" off-gassing, \" or releasing chemicals, fastco notes. ) instead, manufacturers must try and strike a comfortable medium, one that can be pleasing or at least inoffensive for most noses.

Gladstone's library, located about 200 miles northwest of london in the quaint village of hawarden in wales, is named after former british prime minister william gladstone, who was himself a bibliophile and wanted his own collection to remain in wales and available to the public, reports the telegraph. In fact, 32,000 of the library's 250,000-plus books are from gladstone's own collection, and the library has been residential since it opened in 1904, not long after gladstone's death. The residential quarters feature 26 rooms, all sans tvs — \" because you didn't come all the way to a library just to watch tv, \" notes conde nast traveler, and the library says this is a place to \" sleep with books. \" for a room that costs about $ 80 a night, guests enjoy extended access to the library all the way until 10pm ( it closes to the public at 5pm ). Several reading rooms feature large sofas, desks, persian rugs, fireplaces, an honesty bar, and a kitchen that works up a full-on sunday roast. The library is run by gladstone's family and self-funded, so the prices on rooms and meals are intentionally low with his mission of ready access to books in mind. In recent years, gladstone's has become a hot spot for writers ( there's even one in residence ), and guests visit from all over the world. ( the world's oldest library is reopening in morocco. )",

        "summary": "The latest source of us-mexico trouble: tuna. The world trade organization has ruled in favor of mexico to the tune of $ 163 million in a longtime dispute over the fish. As npr explains, the dispute centers on \" dolphin-safe \" labels on cans of tuna adopted by the us in 1990. The us claims that mexico's use of large-net fishing boats that chase and target dolphin schools to find tuna do not meet the country's no-kill standards. But mexico says the us rules unfairly target the country and do not take into account new practices that have drastically decreased dolphin deaths. Mexico claims losses as high as $ 472.3 million annually over the labels and filed the case back in 2008, reports reuters. The us believes the number is closer to $ 21.9 million at most, but the wto estimated it at $ 163 million, and said mexico could impose retaliatory restrictions on the us to claw back that amount. The office of the us trade representative says the decision doesn't take into account a new rule enacted in 2016 that expanded the restrictions to all countries, adding that it \" dramatically overstates \" the financial impact on mexico. The wto will next consider the 2016 changes made by the us, and its ruling in july could overturn this week's decision. Meanwhile, the trump administration said wednesday that it will attempt to renegotiate nafta, making the timing of this decision and trade relations with mexico all the more sensitive.",

( the washington post ) the food and drug administration on tuesday evening approved the world's first drug designed to stir a woman's waning desire for sex, a condition that affects an estimated 1 in 10 u.s.

The approval of the controversial drug, flibanserin, which the fda twice rejected before and now will be marketed as addyi, comes with a series of conditions reflecting the agency's concerns about serious side effects. These include a boxed warning that highlights the risks of low blood pressure and fainting in patients who drink alcohol while taking the drug, as well as a requirement that doctors complete a training course before being allowed to prescribe it. \"because of a potentially serious interaction with alcohol, treatment with addyi will only be available through certified health care professionals and certified pharmacies, \" janet woodcock, director of the fda's center for drug evaluation and research, said in",
