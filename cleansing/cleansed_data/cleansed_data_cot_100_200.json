And now, dna has positively identified farrenkopf as the mummified body found in the backseat of her jeep in march. \"this has brought some closure for our family, knowing we may finally lay pia to rest, \" says a message posted to facebook on july 15. However, officials still don't know how farrenkopf died, mlive.com reports — her badly decomposed body was missing the heart, liver, and lungs, which are usually used to determine cause of death, and mummified muscle didn't yield any results in a toxicology test, the oakland county deputy medical examiner explains to the detroit free press. \"the possibility of hypothermia or any drug or chemical intoxication cannot be ruled out, \" he says. Though the death was treated initially as a homicide, investigators have found no evidence that the pontiac, michigan, woman — who would have turned 50 this year — was murdered, the times herald adds. Her assumed time of death has been pinned down, however, by subpoenaing bank, health, and phone records, which indicate she died in early 2009. Reuters reports that investigators also found out farrenkopf was seen alive in early 2009. She'd stopped working in 2008 and, following her death, her bills were paid automatically; the money ran out last year, eventually leading to her discovery.",

The offer was refused, so she bought 48 rolls instead, reports the boston globe. Jon prince of candyfavorites.com tells npr that another fan tried to buy his entire stock of necco wafers and cried after learning sales were being limited. \" they said they couldn't imagine a world without their necco wafers, \" says prince. Of course, not everyone loves the wafers, which come in flavors like chocolate, clove, and licorice. \" i mean, it is really like chewing on chalk, \" one man tells npr. More likely to be missed are necco's conversation hearts, always a hit around valentine's day. A few weeks after this year's holiday, necco said it would be forced to close — meaning 395 lost jobs at its factory in revere, mass. — unless it found a buyer by may. Necco sales on candystore.com have jumped 82 % in the aftermath, while wafer sales have spiked 150 %.

A former bodyguard to castro, juan reinaldo sanchez — who fled cuba in 2008 and has made similar allegations before — describes them fully in the double life of fidel castro: my 17 years as personal bodyguard to el lider maximo. In a juicy new york post excerpt, sanchez claims that he overheard castro meeting with a loyal general, josé abrantes, about drug trafficking: \" what business! \" sanchez writes, with co-writer axel gylden. \" very simply, a huge drug-trafficking transaction was being carried out at the highest echelons of the state. \" according to the book, castro and gen. Abrantes discussed smuggling cocaine into the us. Castro's reasoning: \" if the yanks were stupid enough to use drugs that came from colombia, not only was that not his problem... It served his revolutionary objectives in the sense that it corrupted and destabilized american society, \" the book reads. Sanchez also accuses castro of covering up his involvement by engineering sham trials that led to the deaths of two devoted officers, including abrantes; this fueled the alcoholism of brother raul, who feared he would be next. Imprisoned in cuba for two years before fleeing, sanchez has already accused castro of secretly living a luxurious life that includes an 88-foot yacht and a caribbean getaway island, the miami herald reported last year.",

Reuters reports on the new evidence that brought them to that conclusion: a silver-colored pistol prosecutor ricardo jimenez says sebastian woodroffe purchased in early april. They were told by a witness that the pistol tumbled out of the 41-year-old's backpack when locals, angry over olivia arevalo's death, grabbed him; he was subsequently lynched. Jimenez says no weapon has been found, but \" he is the main suspect. \" as for a motive, jimenez says arevalo's son owed woodroffe nearly $ 4,500, though jimenez told the bbc arevalo's family claims woodroffe became enraged when arevalo wouldn't conduct an ayahuasca ceremony for him. Meanwhile, the ap reports peru's attorney general has ordered two suspects be arrested in connection with woodroffe's death. It adds forensic experts are examining the canadian's remains to see if there is any evidence of his shooting arevalo. ( this ayahuasca ceremony ended in death in 2015. )",

        "summary": "They didn't set out to do a study on divorce, but two university of washington researchers poring over a range of sociological data saw such a clear pattern emerge that they've ended up with one: it turns out that that married couples divorce most often in march and august. When the researchers plotted the data from 2001 to 2015, the divorce spike in those two months was both striking and consistent, they write in a press release. And while that data comes exclusively from washington state, it seems to apply nationwide. The researchers followed up with a look at data from ohio, minnesota, florida, and arizona, and found the same pattern. So what's going on? they think winter holidays and summer vacations are a big factor. These are both \" culturally sacred times for families, \" says associate sociology professor julie brines, per the uw release. That is, couples may be reluctant to split around christmas, or just ahead of an annual vacation, and instead view those times instead as an opportunity to mend a troubled relationship. \" one last shot, \" as brines puts it, per the atlantic. If they fail, the added stress of the holidays or the tight quarters of a vacation then push the couple toward divorce. The delay from post-holidays to march in the divorce filings may be because the holidays put such a heavy dent in the wallet, notes bustle. That's less of an issue in the summer, and the researchers speculate that, for couples with kids, the start of school may actually speed things along.

        "summary": "Human radiologists, look out. Pigeons turn out to be expert mammogram readers after very little training, at least according to a study published this week in plos one. Using 16 pigeons in a chamber with a touchscreen, scientists trained them to peck at one of two colored buttons to correspond with the type of image they were being shown; if they got it right, they got food. It turns out that those beady little eyes picked up patterns showing malignant versus benign breast tissue very well and very fast. At first, as they were trained for what to spot, they were right 50 % of the time. \" in some sense, the pigeon and the person are starting at the same place, \" says one researcher, experimental psychologist edward wasserman. \" they're equally naive. \" but a mere two weeks into the experiment the pigeons were identifying the images correctly 85 % of the time, reports the washington post. What's more, the birds were able to take what they'd learned from the first, familiar set of slides and apply it to new images they'd never seen before, boasting a success rate that was just a few percentage points lower. And they performed even better as a flock than individually — with a success rate maxing out at 99 % when required to \" vote \" as a group, reports gizmodo. It's more likely that robots, not pigeons, will be the ones to take the place of humans someday. But wasserman hopes pigeons will be taken more seriously and studied more closely. \" the pigeon has kind of a bum rap, \" he says. \" humans are not the only intelligent animals walking and swimming and flying on earth. \" it's also helpful, he tells discover, that they're \" workaholics. \" ( pigeons have a biological gps. )",

In a statement cited by the times, cuomo said he's setting up a task force, effective immediately, to check salons individually, come up with mandates to protect workers from possibly dangerous chemicals wafting around their salons, and conduct a six-language educational campaign to let workers know this kind of debasement isn't ok. \" we will not stand idly by as workers are deprived of their hard-earned wages and robbed of their most basic rights, \" cuomo said in the statement. Several government agencies, including the health department, were spurred into action last week after the two-part times article ran. Rules going into effect asap include publicly posted signage ( in different languages ) in salons listing workers ' rights, a requirement that manicurists wear gloves and masks, and a mandate that all salons are bonded so employees can recoup wages if it's found they've been denied rightful earnings, per the times. Cuomo's office says the task force agencies won't probe workers ' immigration status. Creating the emergency plan allowed cuomo to skirt red tape. \" the article highlighted a significant problem in new york state, \" the governor's general counsel tells the times. \"we cannot wait to address the problem. \" ( what could help protect workers: more \" green \" salons. )",

Timon, who owns a medical equipment company and frequently flies first class, said that when no drink came, he pressed his call button, and a male flight attendant came to say he had been cut off. Timon said he had only had a single drink and was sober. He says his gesture was misunderstood as sexual harassment, and he was met by police who escorted him off the plane. Police took statements from timon and others but there was no further action. \" for me to be accused of this, and for me to be escorted off the plane by police? this is it.

            "A san diego man has been banned from flying on alaska airlines after an allegation that he harassed a flight attendant — an accusation he said is unfounded and is \"reverse discrimination against men. \" mike timon, 53, said he is accused of touching the flight attendant's buttocks while in first-class during an evening flight from portland to san diego on dec. 26. Timon denies the claim, and said he touched the woman \"politely \" on her back — not her buttocks — to get her attention and order a drink. Instead of a drink, timon said he was accused of misbehavior and met by police at the end of the flight. Timon reached out to the san diego union-tribune the following day. \"for me to be accused of this, and for me to be escorted off the plane by police? this is it. I ' m blowing up... It's unnecessary. It's discrimination toward me, \" timon said. The incident comes amid a national reckoning over sexual harassment, as claims of assault or misconduct have brought down powerful men in politics, media and entertainment, and sparked the #metoo movement where women disclose their own experiences. Alaska airlines spokeswoman ann johnson declined to discuss specifics of the dec. 26 incident, citing an open investigation. But she did say in a statement issued thursday that alaska",

        "summary": "Scientists have observed a behavior never before seen in killer whales, and it makes for a grim discovery. Following strange calls from orcas off the northeastern coast of british columbia's vancouver island in december, researchers observed the first known case of infanticide among the whales. After tracking down the orcas and hearing a ruckus in the water, the scientists spotted a male orca with a newborn calf in its mouth, being chased by the calf's mother and other members of its family. As the male's mother attempted to intervene, the calf's mother \" hit the male so hard that... His blubber was shaking on his body and you could see blood flying through the air, \" ecologist jared towers tells the cbc. \" we were really quite horrified and fascinated. \" the male still didn't let go of the calf, which had died by that point, according to newsweek. Researchers, describing the case in scientific reports, say the male orca likely killed the calf so the male orca could mate with the infant's mother. In other mammals, infanticide \" forces the infant's mom into a fertile state much quicker, \" towers says. He adds researchers previously thought female orcas were picky about mates, but this behavior suggests \" females don't have a lot of choice when it comes to breeding. \" the cbc notes $ 9 million the canadian government has dedicated to orca research may reveal more about the endangered species in time, as washington state works on protection, per time. ( orca pregnancies are failing. )",

Kyrie irving of the cleveland cavaliers first revealed his flat-earth beliefs back in february, and now retired basketball player shaquille o ' neal has revealed he's on the same page. In an episode of his podcast broadcast late february but only recently picked up by the media, shaq said, per sports illustrated: \" it's true. The earth is flat. The earth is flat. Yes, it is. Listen, there are three ways to manipulate the mind — what you read, what you see, and what you hear. \" he used an example involving christopher columbus, arguing that columbus didn't really discover america because there were already \" fair-skinned people \" living here when columbus arrived. Then he got into the real nitty gritty. He explained that he drives from coast to coast, and it certainly seems flat to him: \" i ' m just saying. I drive from florida to california all the time, and it's flat to me. I do not go up and down at a 360-degree angle, and all that stuff about gravity, have you looked outside atlanta lately and seen all these buildings? you mean to tell me that china is under us? china is under us? it's not. The world is flat. \" kenny ducey at si says that while he wants to believe this is all a joke, both irving and o ' neal seem to be taking it seriously; irving, for example, has continued to defend his beliefs. Ben rohrbach at yahoo sports, who first uncovered the shaq podcast, agrees that irving is not kidding around ( or trying to make some sort of point about \" fake news, \" as nba commissioner adam silver suggested ), and points out that at least two other nba players have agreed with him.",

The state-run sana news agency quoted a \" credible source \" at the foreign ministry as saying on tuesday that the country is \" shocked \" by the qatari emir's comments, which \" could worsen the conflict and kill the chances of syria working closely with arabs \". The source warned that it will be \" unfortunate to see arab blood flow on syrian soil \". Sheikh hamad bin khalifa al thani was quoted by an american television programme on sunday as suggesting that arab troops should be sent to syria to stop the deadly violence. The interview, which was conducted late last year, was the first time an arab leader had called for the deployment of troops inside the country. The united nations estimated in december that at least 5,000 people have been killed since protests against the government of president bashar al-assad broke out in march. The organisation also believes at least 400 people have been killed since the arab league first deployed observers - meant to oversee the implementation of a league-brokered",

( associated press ) syria \" absolutely rejects \" any plans to send arab troops into the country, the foreign ministry said tuesday, even as the death toll mounts from the 10-month-old uprising against president bashar assad. Assad has insisted there be no foreign intervention in syria. He agreed under heavy regional pressure to admit some arab league observers, but their effectiveness has been limited. Activists said at least 18 people died tuesday, and six syrian soldiers were killed late monday near damascus. The revolt has turned increasingly militarized in recent months, with a growing risk of civil war. The u.n. Says about 400 people have been killed in the last three weeks, on top of an earlier estimate of more than 5,000 dead since march. Syrian activists said most of tuesday's dead were shot by security forces or pro-regime gunmen. The reports could not be independently verified. Attacks also were reported for a fifth day in the damascus suburb of zabadani, near the border with lebanon. The government rejection of armed intervention followed a remark from the leader of qatar, sheik hamad bin khalifa al thani, who was"

Curtis dawkins'debut, the graybar hotel, was published in july by scribner and details life behind bars in ways that have thrilled readers. Michigan's department of treasury is less enthused, however, and has filed a court complaint that asks that 90 % of the convicted killer's reported $ 150,000 advance be given to the state as payment for the cost of his imprisonment. Michigan's attorney general reportedly filed the complaint, which states that dawkins is not entitled to the money or to transfer any of it to his family, not long after his victim's brother complained publicly about the book deal, per the guardian. Because he cannot afford an attorney, dawkins is scheduled to defend himself in the case. Dawkins has in the past expressed remorse for the 2004 botched robbery that led to the murder of thomas bowman. The new york times reports he intends to argue that the same law the attorney general says allows the state to keep the profits also stipulates that courts must consider a convict's obligation to provide for his children or spouse when deciding such cases. Michigan is one of some 40 states with laws on the books that allow the government to force inmates to pay for incarceration.

        "summary": "Good news for those trying to conceive: a new study suggests there's no reason for you to continue lying down, immobile, after having sex. There's a widespread belief that lying still after sex helps give the sperm time to get where they need to go, and the same belief has transferred over to women getting intra-uterine insemination ( iui ), a fertility treatment in which sperm are injected directly into the uterus. \" there's a lot of anxiety that after iui if you stand up, everything will fall out, \" an expert from the university of southampton tells new scientist. Two studies have found that resting in bed for 15 minutes after getting iui did increase success rates, but they were small studies. The new, larger study out of amsterdam's vu university medical center disputes that belief. Researchers looked at 479 women getting iui, most of whom got multiple rounds; they collected information on nearly 2,000 cycles overall. Women were randomly assigned to either get up and move immediately after treatment or stay on bed rest for 15 minutes before moving. Of the cycles incorporating bed rest, 32 % resulted in pregnancy — while 40 % of the cycles after which the women immediately moved resulted in pregnancy. \" in our opinion, \" says the lead researcher in a press release, \" immobilization after iui has no positive effect on pregnancy rates, and there is no reason why patients should stay immobilized after treatment. \" she would not \" generalize \" the results to give advice to couples attempting to get pregnant via traditional intercourse, but the southampton expert thinks the study likely applies there, too. ( this woman became pregnant after her doctor said she couldn't, and now she's suing. )",

After an hour of larsen trying to escape the poo-poo prison, his friends called the local fire department. Firefighters quickly cut larsen out of the toilet using a chainsaw. A spokesperson for the department notes \" it was pretty full down there. \" larsen was disinfected and treated for bruising on his arms, and he also says he received some animal bites, per the sun. \" it was disgusting as hell.

From there, weather conditions may have driven the toxin downward, potentially exposing troops to it for several days. Troops were told that chemical weapons alarms that blared at the time were false alarms, the new york times reports. The theory has been raised before; the new paper supports it using intelligence and weather reports. The researchers also noted a correlation between the number of times troops say they heard the alarm and the severity of their symptoms. Satellite images in the report show yellow gas over the us encampments, usa today adds. Almost half of 700,000 gulf war veterans have made claims for disability, with many citing symptoms whose cause remains mysterious. The pentagon has maintained that the gas couldn't have traveled far enough to present a threat, and other experts have agreed.",

That's up from 30 % of counties in 1998, with the guardian reporting that the number of lyme disease incidents has tripled in the us since the ' 90s. The biggest increases were seen in northern and northeastern states, reports cbs news, which singles out minnesota, new york, ohio, vermont, and wisconsin. It's not surprising, then, that while some 30,000 cases of lyme disease are reported annually, the real figure is estimated at a staggering 330,000 people every year. While lyme disease continues to be fairly easy to treat via antibiotics, if left untreated it can lead to serious symptoms, including chronic joint inflammation and even heart and neurological problems years after infection, reports the cdc, which adds that the best preventive measures are removing ticks as quickly as possible and applying pesticides. Biologists blame reforestation, growing deer populations, and climate change for the fast spread of ticks that carry lyme disease, reports the guardian, and the researchers note in a press release the rise of the blacklegged tick ( ixodes scapularis ) in particular.

Scientists in london picked up a packet of dried porcini mushrooms at the grocery store and then used a technique known as dna barcoding, explains the cbc. When they attempted to match the dna profiles of the dried mushrooms to known species, they discovered that three of the 15 pieces they tested were previously unknown to science. Introducing boletus meiweiniuganjun, boletus bainiugan, and boletus shiyong. All come from china, as do about half the porcini mushrooms sold in europe, reports science 2.0. It's not so much a bombshell discovery as evidence of the \" enormously diverse and completely under-documented \" world of fungi, says the blog post. These particular porcinis have likely been consumed for decades; it's just that nobody had taken the time to categorize them. That said, the researchers were surprised to get hits on three of only 15 specimens, notes kew.org. The new research is published in the journal peerj.

            "For lovers of wild foods, autumn means things like mushrooms and fungi of dizzying variety. Intrepid treasure hunters scour the woods in search of delectable wild mushrooms and their not-quite-meat, not-quite-vegetable qualities. A bonus: if you find some, you may be eating something not even known to science. The fungi kingdom is enormously diverse and completely under-documented. Species are tough to know, and that is without counting the billions that have gone extinct without us ever knowing about them, but of the 10 million species likely out there, only about 100,000 have been described. Mushrooms are one the most conspicuous and well known groups of fungi and make up around 16,000 named species, but only a handful of these species are well documented. With estimated rates of fungi extinction exceeding current rates of description, the enormity and urgency of the task of accurate identification cannot be overstated. New approaches that accelerate the documentation and description of new species are desperately needed before it is too late. So how well do we really know the mushrooms? in an article published today in peerj, mycologists",

Per cnn, the condition is called acute flaccid myelitis, or afm, and damages the body's nervous system. While uncommon, afm is serious and can lead to paralysis or even death. The state usually sees just one case of the illness per year, which the star-tribune reports has health officials now issuing alerts to doctors statewide. And, unlike the viral disease polio, afm's more elusive cause means there is no vaccine. \" disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases, \" the minnesota department of public health said in a statement. \" the department is also in contact with the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) to share information. \" afm most commonly affects young children and the cases in minnesota, which are not isolated to one region but have instead been seen in multiple parts of the state, have all occurred in patients under age 10. Afm is believed to be most frequently triggered by some separate viral infection, leading officials to urge parents to ensure children follow basic preventative measures including hand washing, staying up-to-date on vaccinations, and avoiding mosquito bites when at all possible. Officials also want parents to be aware of early signs of afm, which include weakness or stiffness of the neck, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, and slurred speech. With no vaccine, all doctors can do in these cases is treat symptoms and hope effects like limb paralysis aren't permanent. ( meanwhile, the cdc says the disease may be on the rise. )",

        "summary": "The world is discussing the self-proclaimed islamic state in paris today, with president francois hollande opening a conference attended by leaders and diplomats from 25-plus countries by saying \" there is no time to lose. Iraq's combat against terrorism is also ours. \" or so hopes iraqi president fuad masum, who urged those in attendance to expand the fight against isis to syria, reports the new york times. \" we must not allow them to have sanctuaries. We must pursue them wherever they are. \" the times notes that, thus far, the us has oked only intelligence gathering over syria. More on the isis front: not in attendance at the conference: iran. Though france \" initially opened the door to a possible role \" by the country, per the times, john kerry put the kibosh on the idea over fears it would dissuade saudi arabia and other middle eastern states from participating. Iran, for its part, says that syria should have been invited to the table. Though it was announced yesterday that several arab nations have agreed to join the fight against isis, with the bbc reporting that the anti-isis coalition now stands at about 40 countries including 10 arab states, specifics remain in short supply. A bbc analyst describes a \" scramble to craft a coherent plan from contributions offered \" by the countries. The wall street journal reports that while no officials have named which mideast states might also conduct airstrikes, saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, jordan, turkey, egypt, and qatar likely have the ability to join the us campaign. As far as those airstrikes go, five weeks of them ( 150 strikes since president obama's speech last wednesday, notes the new york times ) have halted the militants ' progress, us officials tell the journal, but the paper points out that isis has reacted by becoming more \" stealthy. \" equipment isn't moved in open convoys; electronic communications have been curtailed; tarps and foliage are increasingly used to shield militants from drones; and militants are hiding among locals. The upside is that \" isis has not gained any land since the airstrikes started, \" per one official. The downside is that they may be tougher to track.",

They could get the clearances by being declared national security advisers. Trump kids ivanka, eric, and donald jr. Are on his transition team, as well as son-in-law jared kushner. A member of the transition team, however, denies that top-secret clearances had been requested for trump children, saying it's \" not something i ' m expecting right now, \" politico reports. In other developments: the wall street journal reports that rudy giuliani is rumored to be trump's leading choice to replace john kerry as secretary of state. \" one never knows, \" giuliani said monday evening when asked if his job title would soon include the word \" secretary. \" a source tells politico that the transition team has become chaotic since chris christie was ousted. The insider says that in an approach reminiscent of how dick cheney ran george w. Bush's transition, the campaign officials that replaced christie have discarded much of his work to focus on picking trump loyalists. The washington post reports that in his first press conference since the election, president obama described trump as sincere about wanting to be a good president. \" this office has a way of waking you up, \" said obama, who was on his way out of town for a final foreign trip that will take in greece, germany, and peru. A source tells the new york daily news that the secret service has been holding talks with the nypd about how to protect trump when he's at trump tower. The source says the nypd has told the secret service to forget about its plan to shut down fifth avenue whenever trump is in town.

        "summary": "In preparation for the singapore summit, kim jong un has reportedly shaken up north korea's military leadership — though it's not clear whether it's the kind of reshuffle that involves executions or mere demotions. According to south korea's yonhap news agency, all three of north korea's top military leaders have been replaced, the guardian reports. A senior us official confirmed to reuters that the three leaders had been ousted. Yonhap named the military leaders as defense chief pak yong sik, korean people's army chief of staff ri myong su, and kim jong gak, head of the kpa's general political bureau. All three men, including 84-year-old ri myong su, were replaced by younger deputies. Analysts believe kim is sidelining powerful figures from father kim jong il's generation ahead of the summit. Their replacements \" are guys that are kim jong un guys — kim jong un loyalists and people who he trusts, \" michael madden of the north korea leadership watch website tells the washington post. Madden believes kim made the changes because he wants to have the new military leaders in charge of the country while he is away — and to help oversee changes including possible denuclearization. \" so if there are policies he needs to implement, these are people who are not going to be resistant to that and they will make sure his policies are implemented in a timely fashion, \" madden says. ( syria's bashar al-assad is also interested in meeting kim. )",

            "Seoul/washington ( reuters ) - north korea's top three military officials have been removed from their posts, a senior u.s. Official said, a move analysts said on monday could support efforts by the north's young leader to jump-start economic development and engage with the world. Kim jong un is preparing for a high-stakes summit with u.s. President donald trump in singapore on june 12, the first such meeting between a north korean leader and a sitting u.s. President. The u.s. Official, who spoke on sunday on condition of anonymity, was commenting on a report by south korea's yonhap news agency that all three of the north's top military officials were believed to have been replaced. Kim's motivation remains unclear but analysts said the shake-up allows him and the ruling party to tighten control over the korean people's army ( kpa ) at a critical time of international engagement and domestic development. \"if kim jong un is set on making peace with the u.s. And south korea and dealing away at least part of the nuclear program, he will have to put the kpa's influence in a box and keep it there, \" said ken gause, director of the international affairs group at cna, a non-profit research and analysis organization. \"this reshuffle has brought to the fore the officers who can do just",

But, if confirmed, the moves suggest another step in kim's ongoing reorganization in military leadership — this time bringing in younger military overseers to replace older ranks possibly at odds with his outreach to the united states and its ally south korea, experts said. The officials who reportedly were dropped are from some of the highest echelons of the north's military structure, including ri myong su, the chief of general staff for the korean people's army. Ri was thought to be a confidant of kim's father, the late leader kim jong il. The others dismissed, according to yonhap, were defense chief pak yong sik and kim jong gak, director of the political bureau of the north korean army.

Knowing that a tourniquet would later lead to amputation, he took his chances and went without it; the bleeding eventually slowed. \" i have to get these next moments right, \" hein tells the ap. \" what do i do to make sure i have the best chance for a positive outcome? \" part of that meant surviving for at least three days; he wasn't expected home for another two, so that's how long it would take for a search party to be dispatched. Hein abandoned his heavy pack on mount goddard, taking a poncho, pocket knife, whistle, and bivvy sack with him as he scooted to a glacier; there, he nursed his injury with ice for four days, surviving on melted ice, moths, and crickets. He then decided he'd have a better chance of being spotted elsewhere; held his leg together using hiking poles, a belt, and a cord; and crawled for about a mile. On day six — july 10 — two helicopters flew above him several times. \" it was kind of wrenching, \" he tells the fresno bee. Around 7: 30pm, a \" fortuitous \" moment arrived: a crew was dropped off just 50 feet from him, and when he saw the searchers spot him, he rolled onto his back and \" breathed a deep sigh of relief. \" full recovery is expected to take months. Hein plans to get back in the wilderness — though next time not alone, he says. ( check out which insect this man survived on for months in the wild. )",

The porpoise, known for sporting a little smirk, is a marine mammal that would drown in the nets where they couldn't swim to the surface for air, and the appetite for totoaba has not diminished as the fish's bladder is used in chinese medicine and considered a delicacy there, fetching more than $ 4,000 for just one. The mexican government has frantically decided to try to capture the remaining survivors, now around 60, to try to save the species. The us is joining in, too, offering up another marine mammal to help: the dolphin. The us navy is training the so-called seal team 6 of dolphins, which already prowl around for underwater mines, to find the last surviving vaquita, which live between the mexican mainland and baja california peninsula. \" their specific task is to locate, \" one expert says. \" they would signal that by surfacing and returning to the boat from which they were launched. \" unfortunately, the vaquita doesn't thrive in captivity, where they would need to remain to be safe from fishing nets.

        "summary": "For 20 years, the heart transplant unit at sydney's st. Vincent's hospital has been working hard to figure out a way to transplant a dead heart into a live patient. Today doctors from the team announced their work had paid off: they have successfully completed three transplants using hearts that had stopped beating for 20 minutes — said to be the first such transplants in the world, according to the sydney morning herald. Two of the patients are already up and about, while the most recent recipient is still recovering in intensive care. Heart transplants typically rely on organs taken from brain-dead donors whose hearts are still beating; the herald reports the new development could save 30 % more lives. The surgeon who performed the operations says he \" kicked the air \" after he realized the first surgery had gone well. The secret to their success lies in cutting-edge technology and the preservation solution in which the nonbeating hearts are immersed. The heart is first placed in a special \" heart in a box \" machine that warms it up and keeps it beating for about four hours before the transplant operation. The preservation solution, which alone took 12 years to develop, minimizes damage to the organ after it has stopped beating and helps ensure it both survives the surgery and functions in the recipient's body, sky news reports. Michelle gribilas, a 57-year-old who had congestive heart failure, tells the herald that she was \" very sick \" before having the operation two months ago, and \" now i ' m a different person altogether. I feel like i ' m 40 years old. \" ( this woman wants to live out her heart donor's bucket list. )",

The gao report, which inside higher ed says is \" highly critical, \" looked at the federal government's income-driven repayment plans, which cap borrowers ' monthly payments based on their income and, in some cases, ultimately forgive the balance of the debt entirely. Currently, $ 355 billion is owed under income-driven repayment plans, and the gao report found that $ 137 billion of that will never be repaid. Of that, $ 108 billion will be forgiven under the terms of the plans, and $ 29 billion will be written off due to disability or death. Those amounts only cover loans made through the current school year, the wall street journal reports. Income-driven repayment plans were passed by congress in the 1990s and 2000s, but the obama administration beefed some of them up and increased efforts to enroll people in them; currently 5.3 million borrowers are enrolled. The gao report could offer ammunition to congressional republicans looking to trim such programs in an attempt to rein in costs. \" really what the gao is saying is that the obama administration's expansion of this program has been done without good information about the effects, \" says one higher-ed finance expert.",

On thursday, melbourne's federal court of australia handed down the fine the aussie blogger will pay as a consequence: around $ 320,000, the bbc reports. The 25-year-old had made a name for herself in her home country when she claimed she'd beaten her cancer through a regimen of healthy living and eating, which she monetized via an app and cookbook she created, both called the whole pantry. Per the ap, the fine was handed down due to gibson's claims that proceeds from the app and cookbook would go to different charities. But the charities never got those funds, and that's when questions started to pop up about gibson herself. It was in mid-2015 when gibson finally admitted she'd never had brain cancer, or other cancers she'd also initially said she had ( she later called those misdiagnoses ). Gibson's \" pitch \" for people to throw money her way \" overwhelmingly used groups likely to evoke sympathy because of their vulnerabilities — young girls, asylum seekers, sick children, \" federal judge debra mortimer said in march. The guardian notes the court had spent months trying to figure out a penalty for gibson, and consumer affairs victoria, which brought the case against gibson, said she could've faced a fine of up to $ 860,000. But mortimer had previously said it was pointless to issue a fine that gibson would be unable to pay. Gibson wasn't in court to hear mortimer's decision, instead sending an email response to the ap that said, \" thank you for the update. Much appreciated. \"",

Avril haines, 43, is a white house lawyer who has worked in the state department and senate foreign relations committee. She hasn't worked in an intelligence post before, bloomberg notes, but her work at the white house has been steeped in intelligence-related matters, the new york times reports. President obama had initially nominated her to the post of state department legal adviser; she would have been the first woman in that job, too, the times notes. Morell, for his part, was involved in the drafting of white house talking points on benghazi. He's leaving to spend more time with his family, he says, though he will also join the president's intelligence advisory board. \" whenever someone involved in the rough and tumble of washington decides to move on, there is speculation... About the'real reason, ' \" morell says. \" but when i say that it is time for my family, nothing could be more real than that. \" ( odd aside about his successor: the daily beast reports that haines co-owned a baltimore bookstore in her 20s, and the store hosted regular \" erotica nights, \" during which she would do readings. )",

From 1941 to 1944, about 100,000 people ( 70,000 of them jews from nearby vilnius ) were slaughtered by the nazis, then dumped into burial pits in lithuania's ponar forest — systemic murder that started even before the gas chambers in what archaeologist richard freund tells the new york times was \" ground zero for the holocaust. \" to cover up the massacre, the nazis forced 80 jews from the nearby stutthof concentration camp to exhume the bodies, burn them, and hide the ashes, ynetnews reports. These \" corpse unit \" members were kept in a deep pit during the night, and some spent those hours digging an escape tunnel. On the night of april 15, 1944, 40 of them made a break for it. Guards shot many on sight, but 11 escaped and survived the war to tell the story of the legendary tunnel. The research team led by freund used a special geophysical process to locate the tunnel, combining radar and electrical resistivity tomography, which uses electricity to examine natural objects in the ground and soil disturbances that may have been caused by digging. These nonintrusive search methods allow scientists to explore sites that previously were off-limits, notes pbs, which will air a nova documentary on the discovery in 2017. It also puts to bed the belief that stories told through the years about the tunnel were only a myth. \" as an israeli whose family originated in lithuania, i was reduced to tears on the discovery of the escape tunnel, \" an archaeologist with the israel antiquities authority tells ynetnews. \" [ it ] enables us to present not only the horrors of the holocaust, but also the yearning for life. \" ( evidence of an escape tunnel was found under the sobibor concentration camp. )",

Diane black, who is running for governor of tennessee, made the comments while speaking to a group of ministers during a \"listening session \" recently, according to huffpost, which reported the story and included audio of the remarks. The comment about pornography came as black wondered what was driving some children to such violent ends. \"what makes them do that? \" she said. \"because as a nurse, i go back to root causes. \" she then listed a couple of these root causes, which included pornography, as well as \"deterioration of the family \" and violence in movies. \"pornography, it's available, it",
            "Nashville, tenn. - representative diane black said she hopes to fund president trump's border wall through crowdfunding. The tennessee gubernatorial candidate appeared on fox news and fox business to discuss the border wall trust fund act bill that would make it easier for the public to help fund the border wall. \" if someone wants to send in money to the federal government to help to build the wall, they can do so, but we don't have a dedicated fund for it. And so what this does is actually dedicates a fund, \" black said. The money put into the border wall trust fund would be used only for planning, designing, constructing and maintaining a wall along the southern border."

With last year's quiet launch of a service called price promise, the car shopping website is trying to \" be as close as possible to amazon.com for the automotive experience, \" president seth berkowitz explained at an industry gathering yesterday. What that means, per the detroit free press: berkowitz says car shoppers ' no. 1 gripe is the lack of a clear, exact car price; price promise cuts out the haggling that follows as a result by allowing dealers to email the exact price of a vehicle found on the site to shoppers who request it. Shoppers can then print out a certificate bearing the number; the dealer must sell the car for that price. Ergo, no haggling. Though the site hopes the feature will set it apart from the competition, truecar.com has offered a similar program since 2009, the free press notes; it claims 6,200 participating dealers, to edmunds.com's 600. The service also doesn't factor in a buyer's credit history, which could change the monthly payments, points out the wall street journal. Price promise doesn't necessarily meaning getting the lowest price, either. Dealers say they sell cars to price-promise users for $ 300 to $ 500 more than traditional buyers. But according to berkowitz, it's a worthwhile tradeoff for those looking to save time and avoid headaches.",

The woman was staying at a hotel near where hawking was staying. Authorities found evidence of religious extremism, including items contradicting hawking's claim that god doesn't exist, in her room. They also found details of hawking's home and office and plans for how to approach him. The bbc reports the woman was also in possession of a map of hawking's festival itinerary.

On thursday, farrow appeared on cbs this morning and says she wishes there'd been a trial since \" i was already traumatized \" from the alleged assault on august 4, 1992. That's when farrow says her \" hero \" led her to the attic of mia farrow's connecticut residence and \" touched my labia and my vulva with his finger. \" dylan farrow was 7 at the time. The now-32-year-old mom told interviewer gayle king she felt it was necessary to finally come forward on tv, saying, \" i want to show my face and tell my story.... I want to speak out. Literally. \" and she has supporters in high places, including mira sorvino and natalie portman, per time. Although allen vowed in 2014 to never again comment on the allegations from his adopted daughter, he broke that vow thursday. \" i never molested my daughter, \" the director says in a statement to cbs news. He adds two investigations — one by a hospital's child abuse clinic and another by child welfare investigators in new york — previously \" concluded that no molestation had ever taken place \" and it was \" likely a vulnerable child had been coached to tell the story by her angry mother during a contentious breakup.... Sadly, i ' m sure dylan truly believes what she says. \" dylan farrow refutes that, noting that \" my mother has only encouraged me to tell the truth, \" adding she wonders why \" this crazy story of me being brainwashed \" is more believable than her own account.

Carried by the aedes aegypti mosquito, the zika virus typically causes only mild symptoms, or none at all, reports the times. Late last year, however, health officials in brazil began to find a correlation between the disease and an increase in cases of microcephaly. More than 3,500 cases, including 46 infant deaths, in the nation may be linked to zika, cnn reports. In the us, 14 imported cases of the virus were diagnosed in returning travelers between 2007 and 2014, plus a total of eight in 2015 and so far this year.

        "summary": "An alimony deduction to be erased in 2019 under the new tax plan has lawyers preparing for a wave of divorces this year — and eying complications for recipients beyond. Payers have long received a tax break on alimony, while recipients have paid income tax on payments. But after dec. 31, 2018, alimony will no longer be deductible for the payer, and recipients won't need to pay income tax on it, reports politico. While this will help recipients — primarily women — in one sense, they ' ll suffer in other ways. As lawyer madeline marzano-lesnevich tells yahoo, a man in the highest income-tax bracket who pays his wife $ 100,000 in alimony in 2018 ( $ 85,000 for the woman after taxes ) actually pays about $ 60,000 with the deduction. Without it, he might argue $ 60,000 is all he can afford to pay, leaving the wife with $ 25,000 less than before. Attorneys predict the change will complicate divorce negotiations and lead to more cases being heard in court. But some say women will be disproportionally injured by it. \" the repeal reduces the bargaining power of vulnerable spouses, mostly women, in achieving financial stability after a divorce, \" a lawyer tells politico. Others point out alimony recipients may have a harder time saving for retirement as contributions to retirement accounts often have to come from taxed income, per cnbc. Marzano-lesnevich says her firm has already had \" a rush of clients … demanding we get them divorced immediately \" to avoid such complications in 2019. More couples are expected to follow suit this year. Politico reports removing the deduction is expected to raise $ 6.9 billion over the next decade and help offset the cost of tax cuts outlined in the gop bill.",

        "summary": "An iphone and a few well-timed button pushes by a mysterious patron was all that was needed to make a missouri casino's slot machine pay out lots of cash. But this wasn't just a random scammer who'd figured out how to play the machine: it was part of an elaborate russian hacking scheme brendan koerner explores for wired. That patron, murat bliev, was a member of a st. Petersburg cheat group, a willing participant in what koerner describes as a \" hotbed of slots-related malfeasance. \" this underground movement originated in 2009, when then-prime minister vladimir putin decided to make most gambling illegal to curb organized crime. All of the slot machines in russian casinos had to go somewhere, and so many of them ended up with high bidders ( including bliev's organization ), who then poked around in the machines ' coding to figure out how to exploit them. How the racket-runners worked: they figured out the patterns behind the machines ' pseudorandom number generators, or prngs, which, while difficult to crack, aren't impossible if someone can get into the machine's insides. But because the \" temporal state \" of each machine is different, additional surveillance steps were needed in combination with the prng intel — and a casino security expert figured out how the hackers pulled it off. The scheme involved cellphones with video, a tech team back in st. Petersburg, and vibrating \" timing markers \" sent to the players to indicate when to hit. While bliev and others were eventually busted, the hacking still lives on via enhanced methods, as there's \" no easy technical fix. \" a finger that lingers too long above a spin button may be a guard's only clue, \" koerner writes.

Languages, and the people who use them, tend to favor using positive words over negatives, researchers find, and they've learned that that's particularly true in spanish. Experts at the university of vermont and the mitre corporation went through volumes of text from all kinds of sources: books, the news, music lyrics, movie subtitles, and more, including some 100 billion words used on twitter, uvm reports. Investigating 10 languages, they picked out the 10,000 most common words, then had native speakers rank these words on a nine-point happiness scale; \" laughter, \" for instance, was rated 8.5, while \" greed \" came in at 3.06. All 24 types of sources reviewed resulted in scores above the neutral 5, meaning they leaned \" happy. \" in other words, \" people use more positive words than negative ones, \" a researcher says. As far as individual languages go, here are the top five happiest ones, via discovery: spanish portuguese english german french chinese came in last of the 10 languages in the study, published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. Positive-language data has also resulted in an actual happiness meter, known as the hedonometer, uvm notes. It follows twitter posts in english to determine when the happiest words are being used. Christmas, it shows, is a very happy day, while celebrity deaths correlate with low points. Meanwhile, boulder, colorado, is apparently the happiest city ( at least among twitter users ), while racine, wisconsin, appears to be the most miserable.

The brother joined up in august 2003 and left the service in august 2007, and navy records state that he received the national defense service medal, the global war on terrorism expeditionary medal, the global war on terrorism service medal, and the sea service deployment ribbon during his service, which included time as an information systems technician on the uss enterprise. A navy spokesman tells the new york daily news that farook was a computer technician who also received an award for good conduct. Investigators are still trying to piece together a motive for the rampage the other syed r. Farook allegedly carried out with wife tashfeen malik. A \" veritable armory, \" including at least a dozen pipe bombs, was found at their home, and officials say they're probing possible links to islamic extremists but haven't found firm evidence of radicalization, the los angeles times reports.
