        "summary": "While america might more typically worry about what its youth are doing, japan spends a lot of time worrying about what they're not doing, and what they're not doing is having sex â€” at all, apparently. A new government survey suggests that the country's millennials are not only in no hurry to marry, but apparently aren't in any rush to do the deed. To wit, a whopping 44 % of women and 42 % of men, amounting to nearly half of the country's millennial singles ages 18 to 34, say they are still virgins, reports the washington post. But the percentage of these singles who say they hope to marry in the future is up close to 90 %. \" people marry later or stay single for life, contributing to the nation's low birthrate, \" the head researcher tells the japan times. \" they want to tie the knot eventually, but they tend to put it off as they have gaps between their ideals and the reality. \" with an aging generation of baby boomers weighing down what is already the world's oldest population, japan has for years been trying to encourage its dwindling number of young people to marry and have children. But complicating this quandary, cnn reports that the apparent lack of interest in engaging in actual sex could result in part from the country's many manga fans choosing fantasy over reality. Plus more women are making more money and choosing to marry later or not at all, while many men report feeling intimidated by them. \" they feel threatened by women who are empowering themselves, \" one expert says. ( a quarter of young men and almost half of young women in japan go so far as to say they despise sexual contact. )",

The blick mead encampment, as it's known, is from the mesolithic period and was likely home to hunter-gatherers who headed to the spot before britain became an island. It's the \" latest dated mesolithic encampment ever found in the uk, \" says archaeologist david jacques, and findings, including apparent structures and evidence of feasting, mean that \" british pre-history may have to be rewritten. \" another expert calls the encampment stonehenge's greatest revelation in 60 years. \" was stonehenge built in part as a monument to the ancestors from the deepest part of britain's past? \" jacques wonders, per heritage daily. \" blick mead could explain what archaeologists have been searching for for centuries \": the real story behind the site. But the encampment is already in trouble â€” from plans for a highway that's actually intended to make stonehenge a nicer place to visit. A nearly two-mile tunnel aims to reduce a traffic bottleneck in the area, the guardian reports. But it could also obscure history. Prime minister david cameron, who announced the plans, \" is interested in re-election in 140 days; we are interested in discovering how our ancestors lived 6,000 years ago, \" says jacques. The site \" connects the early hunter-gatherer groups returning to britain after the ice age to the stonehenge area all the way through to the neolithic in the late fifth millennium bc, \" he notes, and \" our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead. \" recent reports also pointed to a \" super henge \" underneath the stones.",

And while some want a ban on the book's publication, others point out that it's already available in many places around the globe â€” and the internet. ( bavaria, for example, never held the copyright for the book in the us, the ap explains. ) even a jewish community leader who wants the book banned does not oppose a scholarly version of the book with annotations, and that's what will be out in germany on jan. 8. The aim of the $ 65, 2,000-page text is to \" deconstruct and put into context hitler's writing, \" and to provide counterarguments to his ideas. Germany's education minister thinks such a version should be studied in classrooms so that \" hitler's comments do not remain unchallenged \" and students ' questions are answered. But another jewish community leader warns that, even though it is accompanied by commentary, the original text is contained in the annotated version, and \" right wing militants \" could attempt to spread hitler's ideas. Others argue that it's the limits on publication up til now that have served to fuel the \" mystique \" surrounding the book.",

But \" mein kampf \" -- which means \" my struggle \" -- falls into the public domain on january 1, meaning that the state of bavaria can no longer challenge reproductions or translations of the inflammatory work. For several european countries that were under nazi occupation, including austria and the netherlands, the expiration of copyright will have little impact as reprints and sales of hitler's diatribe remain banned there. But in germany, historians have readied an annotated version to hit the bookstores on january 8, while in neighbouring france, publisher fayard will go ahead with a new french version, sparking chagrin in some quarters.

        "summary": "The story of two women from hawaii rescued after being lost at sea for five months is beginning to seem incredible â€” as in difficult to believe. After they were picked up by the uss ashland 900 miles southeast of japan last week, jennifer appel and tasha fuiava said they faced storms and shark attacks and that there were times when they \" absolutely \" thought they would die. They didn't mention that they failed to use their emergency position indicating radio beacon, which would have immediately alerted rescuers to their location. A coast guard spokeswoman says the women claim they never used the emergency beacon because they never felt \" truly in distress, like in a 24-hour period they were going to die. \" multiple other inconsistencies in the account have surfaced, including some that conflict with the \" basic geography of the pacific ocean, \" the ap reports. The women say they departed hawaii bound for tahiti on may 3 and ran into a fearsome force 11 storm the same day that \" lasted for two nights and three days, \" but the national weather service says there were no storm systems near hawaii around that time. The women have said their mast and motor failed, along with multiple methods of communication, though the coast guard says it made radio contact with their sailboat, the sea nymph, near tahiti in june and they said they weren't in distress. One long-distance sailor tells people that many sailors find the women's story odd, because \" there are so many holes in it that it just doesn't make any sense. \" ( the two women are now back on land. )",

But there's something remarkable about that moment: it's actually \" a marvel of 21st century engineering, \" reports the los angeles times. Vawter, 32, is the \" test pilot \" for a new bionic leg â€” the first of its kind to communicate with the brain ( though the technology has been used with arm prostheses ). It uses sensors to harness \" reinnervated \" nerves; they're essentially nerves that, rather than being allowed to die, are surgically \" rewired \" to control his right thigh muscles; the bionic leg is then programmed to read the contractions of those muscles. The comparison to his other prosthesis is \" night and day, \" vawter tells the wall street journal. The error rate ( that includes things like the risk of falling ) is shaved, from 12.9 % with a robotic leg, down to just 1.8 %, bloomberg reports via a new england journal of medicine report. Weighing about 10 pounds, the bionic leg is the work of the rehabilitation institute of chicago, which saw an $ 8 million boost from the us army. The latter hopes the leg can one day benefit some 1,200 iraq and afghanistan vets who could use it. But there's much broader appeal: about 1 million americans are without lower limbs and the device could be available to them in three to five years, bloomberg reports. \" the value it will provide to the people who use it will be enormous, \" the study's lead author said. \" we are making fantastic progress. \"",

Heidi klum and tim gunn, the stars who turned \"project runway \" into one of the first and biggest cable reality-tv hits of the previous decade, are saying goodbye to that venerable series and making the leap to streaming. The duo has signed a deal to develop a new fashion-oriented reality show for amazon studios. Details of the new program are not yet known, and no producers are yet attached. Sources tell variety that amazon will open a competitive process for production companies to vie to oversee the new show. Klum and gunn's amazon deal throws into question the future of \"project runway, \" whose season-16 finale aired last year on cable channel lifetime.

At the democratic national convention this year, judd spoke openly about her choice to have an abortion after she was raped in a state where, had she carried to term, the rapist could have held parental rights. Judd has also used her fame and platform to speak about the importance of education worldwide.

        "summary": "There's \" clear and convincing evidence \" that surface-to-air rockets loaded with sarin gas rained down on the ghouta area of damascus last month, un weapons inspectors announced today. The panel concluded that chemical weapons have been used \" against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale. \" the inspectors were only tasked with determining whether chemical weapons had been fired, not who fired them, the ap explains; though cnn reports that the report will cover \" signs of culpability. \" earlier today, a separate un commission said it was investigating reports of 14 chemical attacks, but that it had already determined that both sides had committed war crimes, with or without chemicals. The assad regime has committed both war crimes and crimes against humanity, the commission determined. The rebels hadn't committed crimes against humanity only \" because there is not a clear chain of command. \" the reports follow syria's admission that it has chemical weapons, as part of a deal to disarm. Some recent fallout of that deal: the assad government called the disarmament deal a \" victory, \" and the rebels seem to agree, the new york times reports. They expect assad to break his word, and to step up his conventional weapons offensives. Indeed, the violence escalated appreciably last week, the washington post points out, with some towns facing their first airstrikes in weeks, and more than 1,000 killed. Now that the threat from the us has evaporated, \" the regime has regrouped and is back on the offensive with a vengeance, \" one expert on the region says. Some rebels said arms shipments from foreign backers had increased, but complained that they were light weapons, and speculated that their backers only want to see the war drag on. \" we won't get advanced weapons, \" a spokesman for a brigade in aleppo says, \" because that would mean we would achieve victories. \"",

Nuclear weapons tests, are asking for the option of leaving the country without losing millions of dollars the u.s. Paid them in relocation costs. Rising sea levels have destroyed crops in the marshall islands and raised concerns about residents ' health and safety, according to the department of the interior, which has proposed making it easier for displaced bikini atoll residents to relocate to the united states or elsewhere. Federal treaties, called compacts of free association, already allow residents of the marshall islands, the federated states of micronesia and the republic of palau to live and work in the united states. The interior department's office of insular affairs is asking congress to write a bill to allow the people of bikini to use existing federal resettlement and relocation money even if they leave the marshall islands, officials said wednesday.

Topping the list is a screenplay, lovebound, that depicts a relationship between a 10-year-old boy and a 30-year-old man. There are also documents in support of \" pedophiles ' rights and the liberation of children. \" what's more, lanza told a friend that pedophilia was \" a disease that needed to be treated and not look at as evil, \" according to a police report on the shooting. Appearing as smiggles in an online forum, lanza posted that children are duped by \" culturapists \" and \" carried to other worlds in the stream of semen, \" reports the daily beast. Someone responded: \" doesn't anybody else notice that smiggles sometimes sends huge ' i am a pedophile'signals? \" if lanza was battling pedophilic urges, that's \" still a long way from explaining what he did, \" said fred berlin, an expert in sexual behavior, but he doesn't rule it out. Michael daly puts it more bluntly at the daily beast: \" so maybe 20-year-old adam lanza was a kind of pedophile whose idea of having sex with kids was to shoot them. \" ( a seven-minute call lanza made to an oregon radio station in 2011 grabbed headlines last week. )",

The 16-year-old san diego high school student's assured version of \" i will always love you \" was \" just amazing. I don't even know what to say, \" jennifer lopez exclaimed during the performance show. \" jessica, you may be the one. You just made 40 million people cry, \" tyler said ( adding a dose of hyperbole by roughly doubling the show's biggest wednesday night audience for the season so far ). Randy jackson didn't hold back either, calling sanchez \" one of the best talents in the whole country. \" on the fox show's 400th episode, the men tackled stevie wonder's catalogue and the women choose from houston's hits, a tribute to the singer",
            "You know how every year at the end of american idol, the finalists get the chance to perform with some random artist who may or not may be their musical hero? that's now going to be an entire tv show. In another sign that tv's musical competition arms race is not abating, abc today will take the wraps off of duets, a talent hunt in which established stars kelly clarkson, robin thicke, lionel richie, and jennifer nettles of country group sugarland crisscross the country in search of musical mates. These won't be random hookups, however: the goal of duets seems to be finding a pairing of celeb and amateur actually capable of selling records. According to abc, the four star singers \" will individually set out on a journey across america looking for undiscovered talent worthy to be their protÃ©gÃ©s. \" the hunt will culminate with each star picking two finalists as their duet partners, resulting in eight pairings that will be put to the test weekly via live performance shows. Presumably, audiences will decide which celeb-amateur combos will move forward each week, leaving one duo as the ultimate winner of a contract with disney-owned hollywood records ( and perhaps a hit single ). Abc says it's fast-tracking the project to debut this summer, perhaps in time to quash whatever small chance"

Instead of letting the media do its ostensible job of mitigating any 9-to-5 stress, scientists found that certain \"ego-depleted individuals \" regard these activities as procrastination from more critical tasks and fault themselves for a lack of self-control. The german and dutch researchers asked 471 subjects to talk about how they felt after their 9-to-5 toil the previous day, as well as what media they used to veg out, according to a post at eureka alert. Even though the study's authors say that media has been shown in previous research to offer a \"recovery experience \" for stressed-out working stiffs, this survey seems to indicate the opposite: that worn-out workers who could probably use a decompression session of orange is the new black the most end up feeling like the biggest losers because they think they should be reading crime and punishment or cleaning out the garage instead. \"in times of smartphones and mobile internet, the ubiquitous availability of content and communication often seems to be a burden and a stressor rather than a recovery resource, \" says one of the co-authors.

This is supposed to make you feel better. But, a recent study published in the journal of communication, by researchers at the johannes gutenberg university mainz, germany, and vu university amsterdam, found that people who had high stress levels after work and engaged in television viewing or video game play didn't feel relaxed or recovered, but had high levels of guilt and feelings of failure. Leonard reinecke ( johannes gutenberg university mainz ) and tilo hartmann and allison eden, ( vu university amsterdam ) surveyed 471 participants to think about the preceding day and report how they had felt after work and what media they had used. The researchers found that people who were particularly fatigued after work or school showed a higher tendency to feel that their media use was a form of procrastination. They felt that they succumbed to their desire of using media instead of taking care of more important tasks. As a result, they had a higher risk of feeling guilty about their media use. These feelings of guilt diminished the positive effects of media use and reduced recovery and vitality after media use. The results also suggest a paradoxical pattern between depletion and media-induced recovery: those depleted individuals who could have benefitted the most from recovery through media use, instead experienced lower levels of recovery because they took their media use as a sign of their own self-control failure.

        "summary": "The us is no longer one of the top five executioners in the world, afp reports. In 2016, both death sentences and executions dropped in the us; only 20 people were put to death, which dropped the us to the no. 7 spot globally, per us news &amp; world report. And just 32 people were sentenced to death, the lowest number since 1973. Amnesty international, which reported the news, is hailing the trend, with the secretary general of the human rights organization calling it \" a sign of hope for activists who have long campaigned for an end to capital punishment. \" and it's not just the us â€” globally, there has been a 37 % decline in the death penalty since 2015, the year that saw the highest recorded number of executions worldwide ( 1,634 ) since 1989. But china, which keeps its numbers secret, was not included in amnesty's tally. \" china wants to be a leader on the world stage, but when it comes to the death penalty it is leading in the worst possible way â€” executing more people annually than any other country in the world, \" the organization states, calling on the country to start publicizing its numbers. Amnesty says china is the biggest executioner in the world, followed by iran, saudi arabia, iraq, and pakistan. But two of those, iran and pakistan, saw significant drops in the number of executions ( 42 % and 73 % respectively ) in 2016.",

It's an infrequent practice but one on the rise in the netherlands, which is thought to have seen no more than five such cases in 1997 but 42 in 2013. Still, \" little is known \" about these cases, write researchers in a report published wednesday in jama psychiatry. And so they reviewed the particulars of 66 patients who opted for eas in the country from 2011 to 2014. Depression was the most common psychiatric disorder, but there was also psychosis, ptsd, and anxiety and long-term eating disorders ( most had more than one condition ). About half had attempted suicide; almost all had a comorbidity ( ranging from cancer to arthritis ), though the study calls out one healthy 70-year-old woman who simply found her life a \" living hell \" in the year after her husband's death. As for how they came to end their lives, \" the reality of implementing such programs is messy, \" reuters notes. In 32 % of the cases, the patient had been refused eas. The physicians for three of those 21 patients ultimately reversed their decisions; the other 18 got approval from a new physician. In 24 % of the cases, there was physician disagreement, per a press release, and the new york times points out that while most patients had long treatment histories, 56 % had turned down at least some treatment. In an accompanying editorial, dr. Paul s. Applebaum sees further \" red flags, \" among them the 20 % who had never been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons, the \" ratio of women to men ( 2.3 to 1 ), and the 56 % of cases in which social isolation or loneliness was important enough to be mentioned, \" raising \" the concern that physician-assisted death served as a substitute for effective psychosocial intervention. \" ( belgium granted a depressed 24-year-old the right to die. )",

She was 25. \"one of my favorite memories that keeps popping into my head, and it makes me so sad to say this, \" peterson says, unable to continue his words. Between several pauses to let the tears pass, he explains why he can no longer hide his grief. It was such a small thing, really, but it meant so much. After every season, peterson conducts exit interviews with his athletes. Keijzer was from the netherlands, and under ncaa rules was eligible to row only one year while she pursued her graduate studies in chemistry. Keijzer was a key recruit for peterson, who was looking to draw more international athletes, with more experience, to help keep indiana competitive in the big ten. Keijzer was a terrific fit. She had competed in prestigious events, like the european rowing junior championships and the world rowing junior championships. She had olympic aspirations.

        "summary": "Scientists using cutting-edge brain imaging technology finally know how that new idea pops into your head and may even be able to read the thought by looking at your brain. Researchers at carnegie mellon university observed 16 participants ' brains as they learned about the habitat and eating habits of eight extinct animals, wired reports. As participants underwent a one-hour, mini-tutorial on the animals, functional magnetic resonance imaging showed changes in specific parts of the brain, along with a \" unique activation signature \" for each animal. Incredibly, a computer program was then able to determine which animal a participant was thinking about just from observing their brain. In other words, scientists could read the participants ' minds. \" each time we learn something, we permanently change our brains in a systematic way, \" says the lead author, whose research is published in human brain mapping. For example, anyone who read about the discovery of the olinguito \" permanently changed their own brains, \" a researcher explains in a press release. \" when people learned that the olinguito eats mainly fruit instead of meat, a region of their left inferior frontal gyrus â€” as well as several other areas â€” stored the new information according to its own code. \" animals with similar diets or habitats elicited similar activation signatures, and a property of an animal stayed in the brain once it was learned, even after several new animals were introduced, suggesting a neural durability of the subjects we learn. Researchers say the study could help develop new teaching methods and give insights into how knowledge is supposedly erased due to conditions like dementia.

The washington post reports that an assistant to businessman savvas savopoulos dropped off a package with that amount at his home last thursday while the family and a housekeeper were being held captive. It's not clear whether the assistant knew the package contained money, why he dropped it off, or whether he had any inkling that anything was amiss. Hours later, the mansion was in flames, and firefighters found the bodies of savopoulos, wife amy, their 10-year-old son philip, and housekeeper veralicia figueroa. Investigators think the four had been held for about 10 hours. In fact, wusa9 reports that two domino's clerks say a delivery person brought a pizza to the house at some point during that stretch. The station is floating the theory, based on an anonymous source, that the killers coerced savopoulos into coming up with money. Authorities haven't said much about how the victims died, only that three had wounds. Dc police chief cathy lanier says detectives are \" passionate \" about the case, particularly because philip was only 10. One of the few public clues is an image of a hooded figure running.",

Authorities say 32-year-old michael wilson aroused the suspicions of his unnamed wife's stepfather when he told her to make sure she used the front door and to not let a child touch the doorknob. ( reuters reports wilson and his wife have a young daughter together. ) during this time, wilson had disappeared from his in-law's home in tennessee without explanation and accused his wife of cheating on him via text. Authorities went to wilson's home in florida on tuesday and found burn marks on the front door, which let off a large spark when kicked open. Inside they found the doorknob and deadbolt attached to a car battery charger. An electrician who looked at a picture of the booby trap determined there was an 80 % to 100 % chance of \" suffering death or great bodily harm. \" they also found wilson's wife's new smart cameras in the toilet and other odd items. Wilson was arrested thursday in tennessee and charged with attempted aggravated battery on a pregnant person. He's also been charged with stealing a firearm from his father-in-law's home, wkmg reports. Wilson's wife says he \" seemed to be a normal person \" until falling a few months ago and refusing to get medical treatment. Wilson's facebook page lists him as \" widowed. \"",

        "summary": "The name john c. Woods may not be familiar to most americans, but it turns out the wichita native played a unique role in history in the aftermath of world war ii. As the wichita eagle explains, woods was a us army executioner who hanged 10 prominent nazi war criminals after the nuremberg trials. His story, one that includes allegations that he deliberately prolonged those hangings and ends with his own suspicious death in 1950, may become better known with the release of the book american hangman later this year. The eagle talks to the author, retired us army col. French maclean, for the broad strokes. One of the first disturbing bits is that woods was dishonorably discharged from the navy prior to joining the army and diagnosed with \" psychopathic inferiority without psychosis, \" a term associated with violent criminals. He managed to join the army anyway amid wwii and eventually volunteered for his executioner duties. Woods executed an estimated 90 men, says maclean, but he became internationally known for his killing of the nazis. \" i ' m proud of it, \" he would say. Eyewitnesses say some of the hangings appear to have been botched, either out of incompetence or malice. One man reportedly took 28 minutes to die. An earlier book, the nazi hunters, also chronicled woods ' role, and the dallas morning news points out that the \" nazi elite \" dispatched by woods probably were affronted by an executioner who was \" slovenly, unshaven, with crooked yellow teeth and dirty, unpressed pants and an insubordinate attitude. \" woods was fatally electrocuted in 1950 while standing in a pool of water and changing light bulbs, but maclean asserts that the army investigation into his death was wrong, suggesting foul play.",

The jobs guarantee would encompass projects involving infrastructure, education, the environment, and care giving. It's not clear when sanders will formally present the plan; a representative says sanders ' office has not done a cost estimate for the plan or determined where its funding would come from. Sanders ' announcement comes after two other democrats, sen. Kirsten gillibrand and sen. Cory booker, recently backed the idea of a jobs guarantee plan. Booker is aiming to create a three-year pilot program to test such a guarantee in 15 areas, vox reports. Supporters of such a plan say it would increase competition for workers, thus forcing corporations to increase their wages and benefits in order to compete with government jobs. But republicans, who currently control congress, say the idea is impractical, and even some democrats agree with that. \" it would be extremely expensive, and i wonder if this is the best, most targeted use of the amount of money it would cost, \" says one economist who served in obama's treasury department, noting that it would be tricky to make sure millions of new jobs â€” the authors of the sanders plan do envision it would hire millions of americans â€” are all actually productive.

Politico reports that her eight pages of prepared testimony are, almost verbatim, the same as the testimony offered to congress yesterday by head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services marilyn tavenner. Of course, that's not stopping anyone from hoping sebelius will address some questions that remain unanswered. Nbc and cnn round up a few: why wasn't the site tested earlier? officials have said they were running out of time and tests indicated everything was fine. But republicans want a much better explanation, and contractors have said they warned cms that more testing was needed. Why wasn't the launch delayed? tavenner said yesterday that cms wasn't aware how bad the problems were at first. The questions for sebelius: why not? and when, exactly, did she learn of the problems and how bad they were? why so secretive? specifically, why hasn't hhs named the contractors or experts involved with the site? how do we know everything on the site will work correctly? for example, how do we know the subsidy calculator ( which uses a complex formula ) will accurately calculate an individual's government subsidy? how much is this going to cost to fix? so far, hhs hasn't offered an estimate. Can she explain the millions of people whose current policies will be canceled? those people will need to switch to a plan that complies with obamacare's minimum standards. It's probably not going to be a fun day for sebelius, but in a profile this week, usa today points out that she's used to this type of political fight. \" she has been successful because she is level-headed, \" says a colleague from sebelius'days as governor of kansas. \" she's unflappable. \"",

His second came this month when he won a $ 1 million lottery in canada with a co-worker, reports huffington post canada. If you're scratching your head wondering, \" what are the odds, \" ctv has your answer, courtesy of a math professor at the university of moncton: one in 2.6 trillion. Those are the odds of one lotto win and two lightning strikes, the professor explains. It turns out mccathie's daughter has also been struck by lightning. \" i honestly expected to get hit by lightning again first, \" says mccathie of winning the lottery; he plans to use the money to pay off debt and take a second honeymoon with his wife of 30 years. He still recalls the lightning strike, which happened as he was wading in a lake's shallow waters. \" i was trying to lock the boat up, it was a very sunny day, there was one big, white cloud in the sky and the lightning bolt came through the trees and hit me. \" mccathie actually owns the store in amherst shore, nova scotia, where he and employee diana miller bought the winning ticket, and if that sounds fishy, cumberlandnewsnow.com can dispel any suspicions. They used something called a \" retailer play button \" designed to ensure any such purchases are legit. As for miller, a baker at the store: \" maybe i won't ask him for a raise this year. \" ( this man just survived a lightning strike to the head. )",

Biebs had been trying to find a church in new york city with a pool in which to get baptized since february, after a string of unfortunate choices got him quite a bit of bad press. Well, last week, he settled for a bathtub baptism, tmz reports. Pastor carl lentz of justin's fave hillsong church nyc performed the ritual in the home of one of bieber's friends, sources say. Before the baptism, lentz says he and bieber did a week of \" intense bible study \" involving reading and studying bible passages and attending church services. The religious rebirth comes after bieber's latest controversy â€” two videos of him using the n-word when he was younger were just recently released, two months after an alleged extortion attempt. A man demanded $ 1 million from bieber or else he would release the videos, tmz notes. If you were wondering how bieber mentor usher might react to that whole brouhaha, tmz reported over the weekend that usher insists bieber \" hasn't always chosen the path of his greatest potential, but he is unequivocally not a racist. \"",

        "summary": "While prince philip was in the hospital wednesday, his wife, queen elizabeth ii, delivered the queen's speech at the opening of parliament in the uk. The speech, which outlines the government's agenda and is actually written by ministers, centered on brexit, reports reuters. But what's drawing the most attention is what was apparently left out: any mention of donald trump's state visit to the country, previously announced by prime minister theresa may. Details: the guardian reports the queen usually mentions state visits \" planned for the duration of the parliament, \" which in this case is two years. Trump's visit was rumored to be planned for october, per the bbc. While she mentioned an upcoming visit from king felipe and queen letizia of spain, the queen might've simply wanted to avoid a hullabaloo. After all, may's invitation to trump resulted in protests and more than 1.8 million people signing a petition seeking to prevent the trip, per bloomberg. But a trump administration official offers a simple explanation to cnn: \" she didn't mention [ the visit ] because the date is not yet set. \" a downing street rep affirmed that account. The bbc's james landale isn't convinced. Citing fears within the british government that the public response would embarrass trump, he concludes the visit has been put off and is \" very unlikely \" to occur this year. The guardian previously reported trump had decided to put off the visit until he could gain public support in the uk. The white house denied the report. Meanwhile, the guardian and the telegraph are now wondering whether the queen was sending a pro-eu message with her hat during the speech.",

        "summary": "The so-called \" ferguson effect \" says homicides go up after high-profile police-on-citizen violence because police become too worried about being investigated for use of force. But the milwaukee journal sentinel reports a new study published thursday has another explanation. Researchers found that 911 calls related to crime dropped 20 % in milwaukee following the horrific beating of unarmed black man frank jude by off-duty cops in 2004. The effect lasted for more than a year, totaling more than 22,000 fewer crime-related 911 calls, according to the atlantic. And 56 % of the decrease occurred in black neighborhoods, despite black neighborhoods making up only 31 % of milwaukee. Researchers are calling it the \" jude effect. \" researchers found similar declines after police killed sean bell in 2006 in new york city and assaulted danyall simpson in 2007 in milwaukee. Police violence \" de-legitimizes the criminal justice system in the eyes of the african-american community, \" researcher matthew desmond tells the journal sentinel. The study concludes that incidents of police violence \" make the city as a whole... Less safe, \" the christian science monitor reports. Jude's beating was followed by a 32 % increase in murders in milwaukee. The spike in homicides can potentially be attributed to the drop in 911 calls, which are used by police for all sorts of crime fighting. \" no act of police violence is an isolated incident, in both cause and consequence. \" the atlantic quotes researcher andrew papachristos as saying. ( man dies three days after calling police for help. )",

Trump's rivals on stage indicated that they would support him if he became the republican nominee, \" notes the new york times. \" the consensus was especially unusual in the case of mr.

Mike halpert of the climate prediction center says there will likely be a la nina weather pattern that will bring more snow than usual to the northern rockies and the great lakes area, while there will be less shoveling than usual to do in the mid-atlantic region, npr reports. There probably will be less rainfall than usual in the south, halpert says, but more than average in much of the northern part of the lower 48. The center says there's a 55 % to 65 % chance of la nina developing. Halpert tells the washington post that climate change caused by carbon emissions is certainly among the reasons why most of the us will have a warmer-than-average winter, though he says that unlike the previous two winters, this one is unlikely to break records. Despite a higher-than-average precipitation forecast, drought could develop in parts of the south, the noaa says.

According to usa today, the unique giraffe was spotted as a calf last year in tarangire national park. It was seen again this month, almost exactly a year later, the wild nature institute writes in a blog post. \" we are thrilled that she is still alive and well, \" the nonprofit states. A tour guide named the pale animal omo after a local laundry detergent, but the institute is open to other suggestions. Omo is leucistic, meaning most of her surface cells produce no pigment, explains the wild nature institute. But unlike an albino, some of her cells â€” such as those in her eyes â€” can still manufacture color. The institute's founder, dr. Derek lee, tells the telegraph that omo is the only such giraffe they are aware of. \"omo appears to get along with the other giraffes; she has always been seen with a large group of normally colored giraffe, \" he says. \" they don't seem to mind her different coloring. \" but her uniqueness could make her a target for poachers, lee says.

Cards against humanity, the game company based out of chicago, purchased an original of the 1962 picasso linocut for an undisclosed amount and will let supporters of its most recent holiday promotion decide whether the artwork goes to a museum or faces the business end of a laser-cutting machine.",
            "The makers of cards against humanity, the mildly risque party game, have another publicity stunt up their sleeves: they're threatening to cut up an original pablo picasso artwork. \" tete de faune, \" a 1962 linocut of a faun's head by picasso, was purchased by the pranksters using cash from 150,000 customers who each gave $ 15 toward cards against humanity's \" eight sensible gifts for hanukkah \" promotion. It says the 150,000 subscribers will be able to vote whether the artwork will be donated to the art institute of chicago or cut up with a laser into 150,000 1.5-mm squares and shared among them. Asked tuesday whether he had the guts to follow through on the gimmick, one of the company's founders, max temkin, declined to comment.

Sort of. Each year, the irreverent, kickstarter-funded card game offers a holiday special card pack of sorts. This year, it was the hanukkah themed eight sensible gifts consisting of eight individual presents mailed out over the course of the eight-night jewish holiday. Last year the cah team gave away one square foot of a private island in maine to the 250,000 participants in the ten days or whatever of kwanzaa. Like we said, they're irreverent. For hanukkah, cah's first three \" gifts \" were all pairs of socks. Then came a membership to wbez, chicago's npr station, and a one-week paid vacation for workers at cah's chinese printing"

And in the brutal heat and pollution of the beijing summer, china's most important politicians head to the beach â€” specifically, the resort town of beidaihe, \" a chinese combination of the jersey shore and martha's vineyard \" that lies 180 miles east of the capital, reports the new york times. President hu jintao tried cracking down on the beidaihe gatherings when he took power in 2002, but many in the party bucked hard and today the resort town is as important as ever.

        "summary": "President trump on saturday expressed his belief that the wildfires ravaging california can be blamed on \" gross mismanagement of the forests. \" neil young, for one, isn't having it. Variety reports the musician lost his malibu home in the fires, and on sunday he offered a retort to trump on his website in the form of a 300-word post ( you ' ll need to register to read it in full ). It reads in part: \" california is vulnerable â€“ not because of poor forest management as dt ( our so-called president ) would have us think. We are vulnerable because of climate change; the extreme weather events and our extended drought is part of it.... We love california. We are not ill-prepared. We are up against something bigger than we have ever seen. It's too big for some to see at all. Firefighters have never seen anything like this before in their lives. \" the ap backs up young's assertion by way of an interview with university of utah fire scientist philip dennison. He says there are a number of contributing factors, but \" forest management wasn't one of them. \" he elaborates on why: some of the areas that have been hit saw fires in 2005 and 2008, so they aren't \" fuel-choked closed-canopy forests. \" and in the case of southern california, what has burned isn't forest but shrub land. So of the other contributing factors, which was the big one? the santa ana winds, says dennison. \" with wind speeds as high as they were, there was nothing firefighters could do to stop the advance. \" even fire breaks â€” areas where vegetation has been cleared or intentionally so as not to offer the oncoming flames fuel â€” has been no match. One of the fires straddled eight lanes of freeway, a distance of roughly 140 feet, he says.",
