        "summary": "The mysterious sleeping sickness that has befallen dozens of villagers in a remote region of kazakhstan continues to befuddle scientists. Following reports of victims passing out in schools, at home, and even on a motorcycle, and sometimes failing to snap out of it for days at a time, scientists descended on the 600-person village of kalachi. And while the ruling last week by local officials is carbon monoxide poisoning, reports the astana times, scientists aren't convinced. While the \" symptoms fit, \" as a duke pulmonologist tells wired, it's unlikely that the gas — suspected to be coming from a nearby uranium mine — would be in concentrations high enough for illness in open spaces. Plus the mine is inactive, so where's the carbon monoxide coming from? it's possible that other gases, like carbon dioxide, could be to blame, as it occurs naturally in our environment and is tough to detect. And hydrocarbons that could be in the form of methane gas appear to be escaping from the mine, though the question of how such a gas remains concentrated enough to cause these symptoms remains. Meningitis has been ruled out, and while bad vodka was at first considered a culprit, doctors say those who've fallen ill didn't have any, reports the diplomat. Either way, the kazakh government has decided to relocate villagers in case the mine is indeed to blame; villagers say the relocation is causing its own headache. ( another medical mystery: this man thinks every day is march 14, 2005. )",

            "In 2013, dozens of people in kalachi and krasnogorsky, towns in remote kazakhstan, began succumbing to a mysterious \"sleeping sickness. \" they started passing out at random — at school, at home, on a motorcycle — sometimes for days at a time. Kazakhstani officials announced last week they had an explanation: carbon monoxide drifting out of a nearby uranium mine. Problem solved, right? only... Maybe not. The soviet-era uranium mine, abandoned since the early 1990s, was indeed an early suspect. But its most obvious associated dangers — like radon gas and radiation — didn't fit the symptoms. Victims who didn't pass out suffered hallucinations, headaches, and fatigue, while radon and radiation are more likely to increase cancer risk in the long-term. Scientists descended on kalachi, a tiny 600-person village, and eventually ruled out a pathogen or man-made toxin as the cause. Theories about mass psychosis and even the supernatural took hold. Now, the official explanation is carbon monoxide. It seems possible. \"the symptoms fit, \" says claude piantadosi, a pulmonologist at duke university medical center. Carbon monoxide binds to human blood 200 times more strongly than oxygen, which means that it doesn't take that much carbon monoxide to asphyxiate someone — even if there's still oxygen in the air.

            "The villagers of kalachi say it all began in the spring of 2013. People, seemingly at random, began dozing off, slipping into comas – sometimes for weeks – experiencing dizziness, headaches and nausea. Over 150 cases have been reported, with some people experiencing the illness more than once. The moscow times reported a surge in cases through the winter and in january, the government began working to relocate the villagers. Kalachi is a village in northern kazakhstan's akmola region, roughly 230 miles northwest of the capital, astana. Its population is between 582 ( a figure cited by interfax and the bbc ) and 680 ( the number used by the moscow times and rfe/rl ). Not all of them are willing to relocate. Viktor kazachenko, who has lived in kalachi for more than 40 years, told eurasianet in march: \"i ' m not going anywhere … why should i go? i've been here for 40 years. I ' m going to die here. \" in january, the governor of the northern akmola region, sergey kulagin, said that all the villagers would be relocated by may. But the astana times reported today that as of june 19, only 176 people have been relocated – 65 families, including 54 children. Neighboring districts have offered to take in the people of kalachi."

Vox reports microsoft unleashed tay — an \" ai fam from the internet that's got zero chill \" — into the wild this week to learn how to have a conversation. Unfortunately, it learned those conversation skills from the stinking digital cesspool known as twitter. \"'tay ' went from ' humans are super cool'to full nazi in <24 hrs, \" one twitter user observed. Among the viewpoints put forth by tay after 15 hours spent on twitter: black people should be put into a concentration camp, the holocaust didn't happen, all mexicans should be killed, and \" hitler was right. \" she started using racial slurs, attacked feminists, and went after the #blacklivesmatter movement, according to cnn. A lot of tay's offensive tweets were just her repeating what other users told her to say, ars technica reports. But she was fully capable of being offensive on her own, as well. For instance, she decided hitler invented atheism and ricky gervais was a totalitarian. She also slid into random twitter users'direct messages and started hitting on them and harassed a real-life woman and game developer who has a history of receiving violent threats online. By the end of wednesday, microsoft had shut tay down for retooling, blaming internet trolls and a \" coordinated effort \" to mess with tay. But critics say microsoft programmers should have seen this coming.

As many as 800,000 people on the uk donor register may have had their preferences about which organs they wished to donate recorded incorrectly. Potential donations from these people have been temporarily put on hold. Health secretary andy burnham said he regretted the error but it should not stop people from donating. The british medical association warned public confidence could be damaged. Nhs blood and transplant apologised and said only people in scotland, england and wales who had registered as donors using their driving licence application form were potentially affected. Mr burnham said a system had been put into place to prevent the error from happening again. Please turn on javascript. Media requires javascript to play. While many of the 17 million registered donors give consent for all their organs to be used for transplant after their death, some have withheld consent for certain organs - such as their eyes.

            "It is illegal to take organs without consent there will be an independent review after the nhs transplant authority confirmed 21 cases in which the wrong organs may have been taken from donors. As many as 800,000 people on the uk donor register may have had their preferences about which organs they wished to donate recorded incorrectly. Potential donations from these people have been temporarily put on hold. Health secretary andy burnham said he regretted the error but it should not stop people from donating. The british medical association warned public confidence could be damaged. Nhs blood and transplant apologised and said only people in scotland, england and wales who had registered as donors using their driving licence application form were potentially affected. Mr burnham said a system had been put into place to prevent the error from happening again. Please turn on javascript. Media requires javascript to play.

Against a himalayan backdrop of jagged white peaks and a bright iris sky, the next generation are holding a debate, clapping their hands triumphantly when they score a point over their opponent. Inside the high-security cloisters, the bravado gives way to a more sombre scene as selected devotees wait in line for the man they regard as their living god. These include local teachers waiting to be blessed for their devotion; a wealthy looking white-haired western man in a black tibetan robe; and a glamorous young australian woman in a tight cheongsam and high wedges. As tenzin gyatso, the 14th dalai lama, passes down the line, the emotion is too much for some. One young woman starts weeping and locks her fingers into his, holding his fist to her cheek. At the end of the line, the dalai lama stoops to meet the gaze of 81-year-old lhakchung, a wheelchair-bound tailor now dying of cancer. He looks intently into his eyes.

Six of the dogs were said to be a dachshund-terrier mix, while the older one was thought to be a dachshund-border collie mix. Dinwiddie adds the dogs were infested with fleas and ticks — \" you can tell they have been living out in the woods \" — but otherwise healthy. \" this is just a bad deal all the way around, \" bryant says, per kten.

Webster thursday, april 7, 2011 12: 49 edt a new poll out of mississippi finds that in a bastion of america's south, many republican voters have tightly held onto the old, hateful views of race as a dividing line in society. A full 46 percent of mississippi republicans said they believe interracial marriage should be illegal, according to the left-leaning survey group public policy polling. Only 40 percent said they thought it should remain legal, with the rest unsure. Republicans who said they were in favor of banning interracial marriages were most frequently supporters of fox news contributor sarah palin, the former alaska governor ( r ) who quit half-way through her first term. Their least liked candidate was mitt romney, the former radio executive and governor of massachusetts ( r ). Romney, palin and fox news employee mike huckabee are widely considered to be the top three most likely republican front-runners. None of them have officially announced their candidacy. The poll found that overall, mississippi republicans want gov. Haley barbour as their nominee over other potential candidates. Barbour won 37 percent of the survey's respondents, compared to 19 percent for huckabee and 10 percent for former fox news contributor newt gingrich, the one-time republican speaker of the house. Barbour's popularity may have something to do with the mentality of his constituency in mississippi. For instance, in a state where almost half of the republicans believe interracial marriage should be illegal, barbour has praised a civil rights-era group that fought against segregation and refused to denounce an effort to get a state license plate to honor a former leader of the white supremacist ku klux klan terrorist group. Barbour was most recently in the headlines after it was revealed that he spent over $ 300,000 on out-of-state travel in 2010, campaigning with fellow republicans and meeting with wealthy benefactors.

This is the \" terror \" being set upon meat purveyors in france, the head of the french federation of butchers tells the bbc, all part of a campaign by vegans to intimidate \" in their aim of making a whole section of french culture disappear. \" in a letter to the french interior ministry cited by the new york times, the group's president says it has been subjected to \" physical, verbal, and moral violence \" as \" a form of terrorism \" at the hands of animal-rights or anti-meat groups, and the butchers now want police protection. The vandalism is especially alarming to the butchers because those who traffic in meat and cheese are usually held in high esteem in french gastronomical circles, and because the number of vegetarians in france isn't even a big one: a 2016 survey found just 3 % of people there place themselves in that category. Still, despite france's boeuf-loving history, the times notes meat consumption has slowly dropped as of late due to health, environmental, and cost concerns — and that has the butcher federation worried. \" the 18,000 artisans, butchers, and sausage makers of our country are worried about the excessive media exposure about the vegan way of life, \" the group's president says in his letter. The guardian notes some dairy sellers are facing similar acts of vandalism, with one lyon cheesemaker reporting his shop was hit with \" milk is rape \" and \" milk is murder \" graffiti last year.

        "summary": "When gay marriage advocates finish celebrating yesterday's supreme court rulings, a sobering bit of reality is bound to sink in: the nation now has a confusing patchwork of state and federal laws that often conflict with each other, reports the new york times. Consider a gay couple that marries in one state and retires in another; or the couple whose marriage is recognized within their military base in mississippi but not in mississippi itself. One possible solution: the human rights campaign vows to make gay marriage legal in all 50 states within five years, reports the los angeles times. For now, the immediate game plan is to roll out campaigns in illinois, new jersey, nevada, oregon, and hawaii in the coming months to try to increase the number of states where gay marriage is legal. But ultimately, it's a good bet that this is going back to the supreme court for a definitive ruing on whether gay marriage is a constitutional right, reports the wall street journal. Meanwhile, congress may have to clarify rules to accommodate the doma decision, making sure that gay couples get their federal benefits. But at least one house conservative hopes to clarify things in the opposite direction: tim huelskamp plans to file a constitutional amendment within a week to reinstate doma, reports the washington post. President obama, meanwhile, touched on the overall issue today in africa, notes poltico: \"it's my personal belief — and i ' m speaking now as a president [ not ] as a lawyer — if you're married in massachusetts and you move someplace else, you're still married. \" but he cautioned that white house lawyers were still unraveling yesterday's decisions.",

Per npr, researchers at the national institutes of health believe they've completely rid a woman of her metastatic breast cancer after she ran out of all other treatment options and, she believed, out of time. In a paper published monday in the journal nature medicine, the researchers describe how they teased out the woman's own t cells that were armed against the very specific dna mutation that was causing her tumors to grow unchecked. Once found, the t cells were grown billions of times over and given back to the patient along with drugs to encourage them to battle the cancer. While physically brutal, the treatment appears to have succeeded. Doctors say retired engineer judy perkins has been cancer free for two years. As doctors work to make treatments like the one perkins received more accessible and affordable to people with the most common forms of the disease, other cancer news this week could immediately impact the lives of thousands of women. Most women with the most common form of early-stage breast cancer can safely skip chemotherapy without hurting their chances of beating the disease, doctors are reported this week in a landmark study that used genetic testing to gauge each patient's risk. The study is the largest ever done of breast cancer treatment, reports the ap, and the results are expected to spare up to 70,000 us patients a year the ordeal and expense.",

The case is raising hopes about a new way to harness the immune system to fight some of the most common cancers. The methods and the patient's experience are described monday in a paper published in the journal nature medicine. \" we're looking for a treatment — an immunotherapy — that can be broadly used in patients with common cancers, \" says dr. Steven rosenberg, an oncologist and immunologist at the national cancer institute, who has been developing the approach. Rosenberg's team painstakingly analyzes the dna in a sample of each patient's cancer for mutations specific to their malignancies. Next, scientists sift through tumor tissue for immune system cells known as t cells that appear programmed to home in on those mutations. But rosenberg and others caution that the approach doesn't work for everyone. In fact, it failed for two other breast cancer patients. Many more patients will have to be treated — and followed for much longer — to fully evaluate the treatment's effectiveness, the scientists say. Still, the",

            "Therapy made from patient's immune system shows promise for advanced breast cancer enlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of judy perkins courtesy of judy perkins doctors at the national institutes of health say they've apparently completely eradicated cancer from a patient who had untreatable, advanced breast cancer. The case is raising hopes about a new way to harness the immune system to fight some of the most common cancers. The methods and the patient's experience are described monday in a paper published in the journal nature medicine. \" we're looking for a treatment — an immunotherapy — that can be broadly used in patients with common cancers, \" says dr. Steven rosenberg, an oncologist and immunologist at the national cancer institute, who has been developing the approach. Rosenberg's team painstakingly analyzes the dna in a sample of each patient's cancer for mutations specific to their malignancies. Next, scientists sift through tumor tissue for immune system cells known as t cells that appear programmed to home in on those mutations. But rosenberg and others caution that the approach doesn't work for everyone. In fact, it failed for two other breast cancer patients. Many more patients will have to be treated — and followed for much longer — to fully evaluate the treatment's effectiveness, the scientists say. Still, the",

        "summary": "Washington state is cracking down on texting and eating at the wheel with a new law that went into effect sunday. The new \"driving under the influence of electronics \" law puts stricter restrictions on the use of handheld devices in cars, reports the seattle times. Even when stopped at a red light or in standstill traffic, drivers can be ticketed for simply holding their phones. The law allows phone usage strictly in emergency situations or with apps that are voice-activated, controlled through dashboards, or mounted for map navigation that requires \"minimal use \" of fingers. Per usa today, offenders will be slapped with a $ 136 fine for first offenses; the penalty increases to $ 234 for additional offenses within five years. Police will report offenses to insurance companies and they ' ll also appear on driving records. Non-electronic distractions like applying makeup, eating, or driving with a pet on your lap are also restricted as a secondary offense and run a $ 99 fine. \"if i see you speeding and as you speed by me, i see that you're eating a big old cheeseburger, that's a secondary, \" washington state patrol trooper will finn explained to fox 12 during a ride along, during which he pulled over a driver ( who was \"shocked \" to find out about the law ) for speeding while eating an ice cream cone. Finn added that educating drivers is key in the first stages of the law to get to washington's traffic safety commission's \" target zero \" goal of no deaths on the road by 2030. Per the times, distracted driving causes a third of road deaths. A spokesperson for the governors highway safety association says washington, the first state to ban texting while driving 10 years ago, \" has the potential to be a game changer and serve as a model for other states. \"",

It was built while iraq was warring with iran and was given to saudi arabia, then allied with iraq, to keep it safe from air strikes. After iraq invaded kuwait in 1990, however, saudi arabia gave the yacht to jordan; from there, it's not clear what happened to it until iraq found it in nice, france. After a court battle, it was returned to iraq in 2010, and the government put it on the market for $ 30 million. No one bought it, however, and it remained moored in basra; for the past two years, basra university researchers have used it for trips to study marine life.

Advertisement one of the pillars of kim jong un's vise-grip on the lives of his people is propaganda: all news originates from the same government propaganda bureau, photographs and video of kim are tightly coordinated, and there is absolutely no independent media. There's no satellite tv, no foreign newspapers. Radios are fixed so they receive only domestic broadcasts. Illegally modifying a radio to tune stations from neighboring south korea can land someone in jail. If widespread access were ever allowed, the internet would pose a massive threat to the regime. But keeping it out completely would deprive the ruling regime of some important benefits. In a country that's been hit by waves of sanctions, the internet can assist with international trade and communications. So in 2001, the government had a company called sili bank set up an email relay between pyongyang and shenyang, a border city in china. Messages were held",
            "When jocko willink‏, a former us navy seal who is now an author and occasional business insider contributor, was asked on twitter how he would handle the north korean crisis, he gave an unexpected answer that one expert said just might work. Willink's proposal didn't involve any covert special operation strikes or military moves of any kind. Instead of bombs, willink suggested the us drop iphones. \" drop 25 million iphones on them and put satellites over them with free wifi, \" willink tweeted last week. While the proposal itself is fantastical and far-fetched, yun sun, an expert on north korea at the stimson center, says the core concept could work. \" kim jong un understands that as soon as society is open and north korean people realize what they're missing, kim's regime is unsustainable, and it's going to be overthrown, \" sun told business insider. For this reason, north korea's government would strongly oppose any measures that mirror willink's suggestion. Sun pointed out that when south korea had previously flown balloons that dropped pamphlets and dvds over north korea, the kim regime had responded militarily, sensing the frailty of its government relative"

Some in the porn industry say dumping net neutrality will make online porn \" very vanilla and boring, \" possibly forcing more conservative views on what sex should be by making access more difficult for fetishes and alternative types of sex, increasing loneliness for people just trying to connect with others who enjoy the same, per a june motherboard article. \" when you slow sections of the internet, you're telling people that some ideas and sexualities and identities are second-class, and you bring that shame back, \" a rep for kink.com said. A spokesman for xhamster said it's even more political than that, comparing it to restrictive regimes around the world. \" the same governments that severely restrict adult content are also the ones that limit sexual expression, lgbtq rights, women's rights, and access to different ideas, \" he noted.",

        "summary": "Dolphins can do more than just jump through hoops and balance balls. They can be trained for a variety of military — some say deadly — applications, which is why the russian military's recent purchase of five bottlenose dolphins is getting some attention. Russia's defense ministry sought bids on a contract to procure the marine mammals, reports nbc news, with the utrish dolphinarium in moscow being the only one to respond. The government will pay $ 26,000 for the three male and two female dolphins, which are stipulated to have \" all teeth intact \" and \" no mucus from the blowhole. \" the dolphins are scheduled to be delivered by aug. 1 to a military dolphin training facility in sevastopol, ukraine, which was annexed by russia in 2014. Records don't indicate why the defense ministry wants the animals ( and no one returned nbc's request for comment ), but there is a decades-long history of dolphins being conscripted into the military to do things like detect mines and intercept underwater spies, per nbc. In the ' 60s, the us and the former soviet union had competing military dolphin programs. One former dolphin trainer who visited the sevastopol facility told wired in 2007 that dolphins were being outfitted with potentially lethal co2 darts and then trained to poke swimmers. The us used dolphins during the vietnam and persian gulf wars, the washington post notes, and continues to use them to protect ports, find mines, and fetch objects. As for using dolphins to attack people, the navy says: \" it would not be wise to give that kind of decision authority to an animal. \" however, sea lions have been trained to attach clamps to a diver's leg, allowing human personnel up top to reel the diver in, per national geographic.",

Both of these species are known for their trainability, adaptability, and heartiness in the marine environment. The navy also has two white whales, or belugas ( delphinapterus leucas ), that have been subjects in a number of research projects and are currently on breeding loan.

        "summary": "\" no one should have to go through this, not children, adults, elderly, \" stephen blumberg tells cbs boston, and a jury apparently agreed with him. The cause of blumberg's emotional turmoil: a fake, \" inflammatory \" yelp review of his massachusetts jewelry store posted by the son of a competitor, per nbc boston. A jury decided march 22 that adam jacobs, whose father owns toodie's fine jewelry, had purposely put up a false, multi-paragraph diss about blumberg's store, stephen leigh jewelers, in august 2013; jacobs has to now pay blumberg $ 34,500 for emotional distress, the patriot ledger reports. The \" guest \" who supposedly wrote the review said he'd visited blumberg's store to buy a diamond engagement ring and \" left this place sick to my stomach, \" calling the shop \" the biggest thief on the south shore. \" but blumberg, who tells nbc he was \" incensed \" by the review, says that interaction never took place — and he started digging to find out who the \" adam j. \" who'd posted it really was. His months-long detective work had him sifting through other yelp reviews written by the same person and calling those reviewed businesses; eventually he was able to connect the dots. Blumberg says he had never met jacobs, who works at his father's store, before this and \" had no beef \" with either him or his dad. The jury did let toodie's, which had also been named in blumberg's december 2013 complaint, off the hook. An attorney for toodie's and jacobs says his clients are glad about toodie's vindication, but \" disappointed \" about the decision on jacobs, which they may appeal. ( a petsitting company decided a bad yelp review was worth up to a $ 1 million. )",

Dressed to the nines and appearing on live television, abe entered the yasukuni shrine this morning in order to, as he put it, \" pay respect for the war dead who sacrificed their precious lives and ( hope ) that they rest in peace. \" and seemingly fully aware of the hornet's nest he was kicking, he added: \" i have no intention to neglect the feelings of the people in china and south korea. \" china instantly deemed the visit \" absolutely unacceptable to the chinese people, \" notes the bbc, while south korea is expressing \" regret and anger. \" the us state department has also jumped in, saying it is \" disappointed \" with abe's move, which will \" exacerbate tensions \" in the region. It's the first such visit in seven years, but what was abe thinking? npr thinks the prime minister, a staunch nationalist looking to introduce a \" first-strike capability \" to his nation's national security strategy, knew exactly what he was doing. An expert earlier this week said of abe, \" what we're seeing is the first move towards japan really shedding that pacifist post-war stance and taking a much more proactive defensive posture. \" another says that with the shrine visit, abe is \" showing he is a tough guy, \" a move that the bbc says \" plays very well with his base. \" quartz runs down a list of winners and losers of the visit, noting that \" the true implications are likely to play out over a much longer timespan. \"",

The hashtag: #shoutyourabortion. Its mission, per bonow and co-founder lindy west: to encourage women who've had abortions to speak up about it and shake the stigma, notes the new york times. \" a shout is not a celebration or a value judgment; it's the opposite of a whisper, of silence, \" bonow tells the new york paper. But not everyone is cool with the initiative. Both bonow and west say they've received angry reaction and threats, as have other women who've used the hashtag. \" i tweeted three times and each time got 20 or more responses, saying things like ' baby killer ' and ' your child is waiting to forgive you in heaven, ' \" a women who had had an abortion at age 20 tells the new york times. Michele bachmann jumped into the anti-hashtag fray, tweeting, \" #shoutyourabortion gives a new meaning to macabre, \" while #shoutyouradoption sprang up to support women who chose adoption over abortion. Bonow and west kicked off their campaign with essays in salon and the guardian, respectively, explaining why they started the hashtag and how they felt about their own abortions ( read: not sorry or ashamed ). And neither is sorry about this hashtag. \" many women want to live in a world where you can say, ' i've had an abortion, and i ' m perfectly fine with that, ' and not have people saying they want to kill you, \" bonow tells the la times. Meanwhile, though she's been in contact with the seattle pd and the fbi, bonow isn't sure how long she ' ll stay away from home. \" i ' m not a public figure, \" she tells the new york times. \" i've never dealt with anything like this, so i don't know how seriously to take it. \" ( a california congresswoman shouted her abortion on the house floor. )",

Graciela martinez's older brother drove her to school in the family's 1997 bmw 328i early one morning last fall and left her inside to get extra sleep before classes began. He locked the doors from the outside so she wouldn't be disturbed, only to find her still in the car, pale and without a pulse, after classes finished, nbc reports. She was pronounced dead a short time later and an autopsy found the cause of death to be \" heat stroke and environmental hyperthermia due to vehicle entrapment. \" she had been trapped inside by the car's \" double-locking mechanism, \" which ensures the doors can't be opened from the inside after they have been locked from the outside, according to the lawsuit, which accuses bmw of negligence. The teenager didn't have a phone with her and without the ignition key, she was unable to use the car's horn. The family's lawyer says there are signs she tried to escape, but wasn't strong enough to break a window, reports the fresno bee. The family is also suing the school district, accusing it of violating school policy by failing to notify the girl's parents when she didn't show up for classes. A bmw spokesman says that while he can't comment on the lawsuit, the locking mechanism in the 1997 model was designed to prevent theft. \" we didn't envision the situation where someone would lock somebody in the car from the exterior, \" he says, adding that the design was changed in 1999.

Once the doors are locked from the outside, they can't be opened from the inside. Graciela also couldn't use the car's horn to get help because it needs the ignition key to activate it, the lawsuit says. \" it's a sad, terrible tragedy that could have been prevented, \" said fresno attorney warren paboojian, who represents graciela's parents, pedro and jacinta martinez. The family is seeking unspecified damages from the automaker and madera unified. Madera unified is negligent, paboojian said, because school officials failed to discover graciela in the locked car and violated school policy by failing to notify her parents that their daughter was not in class. Madera unified superintendent ed gonzalez said thursday that \" the loss is incomprehensible. Our hearts go out to the martinez family. \""

In what npr calls a turning point, denmark-based maersk will send the first container ship — a 42,000-ton vessel housing 26 crew and a stash of frozen fish, per cnn — from vladivostok, russia, to st. Petersburg via the arctic as a means of determining whether such a route might be worthwhile in the future. \" the ice is melting and more things are becoming possible, \" says the founder of the arctic institute think tank, noting the northern sea route could cut two weeks off a trip from asia to europe. But maersk claims it isn't interested in saving time just yet. The venta maersk's journey to begin later this month, which would otherwise require passage through the suez canal, is \" a one-off trial designed to explore an unknown route for container shipping and to collect scientific data, \" maersk says, per the independent, adding the course isn't considered \" an alternative to our usual routes. \" that's likely because there are no arctic ports for security and transshipment options, per npr. Plus the venta maersk — complete with a reinforced hull that can cut through a few feet of loose ice — can only make the journey three months of the year, unless it follows an icebreaker. That might not be the case forever, though. Indeed, activists fear environmental damage from large ships will only speed arctic ice melt.",

        "summary": "Saiga antelopes have been roaming central asia since the time of the woolly mammoth, an achievement only a resilient species could pull off. But now, \" total extinction \" may be on the horizon. That's according to researchers studying the deaths of more than 200,000 endangered saigas in kazakhstan in 2015. Scientists were dumbfounded to see nearly two-thirds of the global saiga population wiped out in a few weeks and raced to discover the cause, reports gizmodo. They now think they've found it: in a study in science advances, lead author richard kock says 10 days of high heat and humidity preceding the deaths fatally altered a usually harmless bacteria in the animals ' bodies. Kock tells npr that pasteurella multocida type b in the animals'tonsils would've been \" quite close to the environment of the air, \" which caused the bacteria \" to start growing. \" from there, the bacteria entered the bloodstream, causing a disease known as hemorrhagic septicemia. \" it's so toxic and so devastating that the animal doesn't show a lot of pathology actually, \" kock says. \" suddenly they'd start looking a little bit unhappy and stop feeding. Within about three hours they were dead. \" only 30,000 saigas in kazakhstan survived, likely because they were outside the area of high heat and humidity. But they might not be so lucky if such an event occurs again, a \" very, very likely \" scenario given that mass die-offs of saigas also occurred in 1981 and 1988, kock says, per the bbc. Fellow researcher steffen zuther says little can be done to prevent die-offs linked to weather as the planet warms. This shows the importance of maintaining large saiga populations and combating poaching and other threats, he says. ( maine's mussels are dying, too. )",

Still, moon, a neurologist, and her husband, steve snow, an air force pilot, were thrown by the backlash after a cnn story on their family in october. \" they are steve's and my decisions, but we look to julianna to guide us, \" moon rebutted to people in january. And medical experts who worked with the family supported their decision: one hospice nurse said, \" i don't know that it's appropriate for every child, but in this scenario it's very appropriate. \" what hurt the most, moon says, were judgmental attacks — including the dear julianna website, which shows people with neuromuscular disabilities who survived to adulthood — based on a misperception she and her husband had deprived julianna of medical care.

He tells the bbc his students convinced him to solve the 156-year-old problem, and he did it because they believed in him. According to yahoo, the hypothesis was first proposed by bernard riemann in 1859 and has to do with the distribution of prime numbers. Despite the bbc asking enoch what he plans on doing with his winnings, not everyone is convinced the prize is his. Cnn reports the institute still considers the problem unsolved, as enoch hasn't contacted them, published his solution, or even made his solution public. Aperiodical did a little digging on enoch and his claim. According to the mathematics blog, enoch is apparently taking credit for someone else's paper on the riemann hypothesis, though he did discover a scientific method for identifying if someone is on an evil mission. Other revelations about enoch's claim include broken links, empty websites, fake-sounding urls, and poorly attended conferences. ( a lot of mathematicians have met awful fates. )",

All humans have blind spots due to the lack of photoreceptors where the optic nerve passes through the retina. But we don't notice them because our brains use nearby photoreceptors to fill in the gap. The new york times reports researchers from australia's queensland university used a computer monitor, an eye patch, and a picture of a ring placed directly into the blind spot to increase the sensitivity of blind-spot-adjacent photoreceptors in 10 subjects — admittedly a very small sample. After 20 days of training, the subjects had shrunk their blind spots by 10 %, live science reports. That change, while \" quite an improvement \" in vision, was not noticeable to the subjects, live science reports, though that wasn't necessarily the important part. \" the real significance is that our data shows that regions of blindness can be shrunk by training, and this may benefit people who suffer from pathological blindness, \" says paul miller, author of the study. Miller says eye exercises similar to the ones used by researchers could help fight blindness caused by macular degeneration and could be combined with other new technologies to help people see again.

Here we report that the functional size of the physiological blind spot can be shrunk through training to distinguish direction signals at the blind spot periphery. Training on twenty successive weekdays improved sensitivity to both direction and colour, suggesting a generalizable benefit. Training on one blind spot, however, did not transfer to the blind spot in the untrained eye, ruling out mediation via a generic practice effect; nor could training benefits be attributed to eye movements, which were monitored to ensure stable fixation. These data suggest that training enhances the response gains of neurons with receptive fields that partially overlap, or abut, the physiological blind spot, thereby enhancing sensitivity to weak signals originating primarily from within the functionally-defined region of blindness [ ].

Nbc has some tips for safe viewing — stressing that nobody should look directly at the sun because of the risk of serious eye damage — and usa today has some tips for photographers, again stressing the need for protective eyewear. There will be a live stream from the griffith observatory in los angeles. For those who miss out completely, there will be one more solar eclipse visible in north america this decade: a total eclipse on aug. 21, 2017.",

Within an hour of the shooting, hundreds of automated twitter accounts with suspected russian links began sending out tweets with hashtags like #nra and #guncontrolnow, seeking to spread what analysts call \" divisive propaganda \" on both sides of the issue, the new york times reports. \" this is pretty typical for them, to hop on breaking news like this, \" says jonathon morgan at new knowledge, a firm that tries to track disinformation campaigns. \" the bots focus on anything that is divisive for americans. Almost systematically. \" after a couple of days, some bots switched to the #falseflag hashtag, pushing theories that the parkland shooting was a government conspiracy. Analysts say that along with race relations, gun control is a favorite target of disinformation campaigns seeking to spread confusion and anger. Bret schafer, a research analyst with the alliance for securing democracy, tells wired that similar spikes in activity were seen after last year's mass shootings in las vegas and texas. \" i don't think the kremlin cares one way or another whether we enact stricter gun control laws, \" he says. \" it's just being used as bait, basically. \" he says most of the bots his group tracks target right-wing audiences, and he believes the #guncontrolnow hashtag was being used sarcastically.

But since the election, the russian-linked bots have rallied around other divisive issues, often ones that president trump has tweeted about. They promoted twitter hashtags like #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee after some national football league players started kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. The automated twitter accounts helped popularize the #releasethememo hashtag, which referred to a secret house republican memorandum that suggested the f.b.i. And the justice department abused their authority to obtain a warrant to spy on a former trump campaign adviser. The debate over the memo widened a schism between the white house and its own law enforcement agencies.

( associated press ) air force officers entrusted with the launch keys to long-range nuclear missiles have been caught twice this year leaving open a blast door that is intended to help prevent a terrorist or other intruder from entering their underground command post, air force officials said. The blast doors are never to be left open if one of the crew members inside is asleep _ as was the case in both these instances _ out of concern for the trouble an intruder could cause, including the compromising of secret launch codes.

And that's pretty interesting for modern humans. \" they are the closest we can get to having a ' living ' ancestor, \" professor of human origins bernard wood says in a press release. Because bonobos are an endangered species, dissections are rare. But researchers were able to study seven bonobos that had died at a zoo and were being preserved. It resulted in the first study to compare the muscular anatomies of bonobos, humans, and chimpanzees. Researchers discovered bonobos ' muscular anatomy has more in common with that of modern humans than that of chimpanzees. Humans, chimps, and bonobos share a common ancestor millions of years back. Humans split off first, but since chimps and bonobos split from each other, bonobos ' anatomy has changed less. Earlier studies have come to a similar conclusion regarding the dna of humans, chimps, and bonobos. ( bonobos also have something besides musculature in common with human babies. )",

Scientists believe that modern human and common chimpanzee/bonobo lineages split about 8 million years ago with the two great ape species splitting about 2 million years ago. As common chimpanzees and bonobos evolved after their split, they developed different traits and physical characteristics, even though they remained geographically relatively close, with their main division being the congo river. Because of this, researchers have been curious as to what those differences are and how they compare to humans.

Therefore, since the chimpanzee-human split c.8 mya, the divergence rate for striated muscle gross morphology has been c.3.5 characters per million years ( ma ).

The guardian — citing a study published last year in communication research — reports rom-coms portraying obsessive behavior as romantic can make women more likely to tolerate stalkerish behavior in their real lives. Examples of \" romantic \" stalking in films can be found in everything from love actually to beauty and the beast to high fidelity. \" stalking often seems to be trivialized in our culture, \" the study's author, julia lippmann, tells global news. \" it can encourage women to discount their instincts. \" and she says those same instincts \" serve as powerful cues to help keep us safe. \" for her study, lippmann asked women questions about \" aggressive romantic behavior \" — as the guardian puts it — after having them watch various movies. Women who watched ben stiller hire a private detective to track down cameron diaz in there's something about mary were more likely to accept \" stalking myths \" than women who watched march of the penguins or enough, in which jennifer lopez is terrorized by an obsessive ex. \"stalking myths are false or exaggerated beliefs about stalking that minimize its seriousness, \" lippmann explains to the guardian. The study found this kind of normalization could have legal ramifications for actual stalking victims. For example, a security guard in australia successfully used his love of bollywood romances to defend himself against harassment charges.

Now plans are underway to convert deseret ranch into a massive new city by 2080. The project proposed by the mormon church, owners of the ranch, may be home to half a million people, the guardian reports. The plan would create more than 16 communities, with office blocks and high-rise hotels. Officials in 2015 approved development of about half of deseret's 290,000 acres, with tens of thousands of acres to be preserved as conservation and ranch land. Environmentalists say that is not enough. They are fighting \" david and goliath \" style to protect the state's \" last remaining wilderness \" from the urban sprawl that has transformed much of the sunshine state, activist karina veaudry tells the guardian. The church of jesus christ of latter-day saints began buying up ranch land in the area in 1950 for the purposes of food production and has about 40,000 heads of cattle, per the ap. Orchards grow oranges for tropicana. Founder joseph smith imagined small, self-sufficient agrarian cities for his flock, per the guardian, though the church's vast real estate holdings today — which eclipsed $ 35 billion in 2012, per reuters — far exceed that vision. The church owns 1 million acres in several states, plus residential and commercial property like a $ 1.5 billion shopping mall in salt lake city. Debate is sure to continue in florida since ground won't break on the new project for two decades. ( mormon plans high-tech utopia in vermont. )",

Mike wallace, 57, had just left the pnc music pavilion with his family when a verbal spat went south. \" mike was talking to one of the three men and then, out of nowhere, one came after mike like a crazy man, \" said wallace's brother, kenny wallace. \" mike was knocked out completely cold. While he was on the ground they continued to beat on him, kicking him in the face. \" wallace's daughter, lindsey wallace van wingerden, reportedly leaped onto her dad's unconscious body to protect him, which is when the three suspects started beating her instead, kenny wallace says. Per espn, the police report said no weapons were involved and injuries to wallace and van wingerden were minor, though they certainly sound painful: wallace says he suffered a concussion, a black eye, and three teeth forced a few inches back into his mouth. But even as he was reportedly being pummeled by the three men — whom he says he doesn't know and who the washington post says all topped 6 feet tall and weighed more than 200 pounds each — wallace was mainly worried for his daughter, he tells channel 9. \" i woke up. I see my daughter laying on the ground, which is devastating for a father, \" he says. Arrested in the attack, per a charlotte-mecklenburg pd rep: 29-year-old paul lucas, 22-year-old nathan lucas, and 24-year-old randolph mangum, all of whom were hit with a simple assault charge and let out on $ 1,000 bond. Per a post on his facebook page ( tweeted out by siriusxm motorsports host dave moody ), wallace said the men — allegedly lawn contractors for pnc — had been involved in multiple dustups at pnc before. But a witness tells the station the wallaces started the brawl. \" kenny wallace has used a public platform to blow this thing up and destroy a family, \" that unnamed witness says.",

        "summary": "Sunday night's presidential debate could hardly come at a more interesting time, with donald trump's hot mic trouble and hillary clinton's speech-transcript trouble. The town-hall-style debate at 9pm eastern won't feature podiums but will have instead have the candidates on a stage answering questions from undecided voters. Five things to watch: is trump sorry? the new trump scandal is guaranteed to loom over the debate, but no one is sure how trump will play it. Will he appear genuinely apologetic or will he double down on his \" locker room talk \" defense? cnn thinks trump can survive if he comes off as \" sincere. \" will trump go after bill clinton? trump has hinted he might open the floodgates on hillary's husband. ( \" bill clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even close, \" trump said, per the los angeles times. ) while trump has several lines of attack he could open on bill clinton, attacking a woman over her husband's infidelities could backfire. Vox breaks down the ways this strategy could go \" horribly wrong. \" how will trump come off in town-hall style? that's the question politico and many others are asking. Trump has seen success in the past by overpowering debate moderators and talking over his opponents, but those strategies might not come off so well if employed against regular, working-class people. Hillary clinton's wall street speeches: long a topic of shadowy campaign allegations and a symbol of clinton's perceived cozy relationship with the 1 percent, the new york times says the transcripts of clinton's private speeches to bankers \" show a hillary clinton at ease with wall street. \" expect trump to fully highlight the release of these speeches, which has been largely overshadowed by the discovery of trump's remarks. Trump is likely to seize on clinton's advocacy for a worldwide free-trade zone, given his propensity for attacking clinton over her support of trade deals including nafta and the tpp. How hawkish will clinton get over wikileaks? npr wonders how far clinton might go in linking wikileaks to russian intelligence services, which have often been accused of trying to sway the election in trump's favor. Wikileaks released the speech transcripts and lots of other damaging material this election cycle. If clinton chooses to aggressively link russia to the hacks, it could highlight trump's alleged links to moscow. The guardian has more on that front.",

Devices that use five electrodes to shoot weak currents into very specific targets in the cortex have performed very well in studies investigating performance under pressure, boosting cognitive ability in a way that could be safer than prescription drugs, reports the guardian. Both modafinil and ritalin are said to be used off-label to enhance performance in the military. In the latest study, scientists asked participants to keep a crosshair inside a moving circle on a screen while juggling three other tasks on the same screen for 36 minutes. One group had a constant two milliamp current beamed into their brains, while the control group only had 30 seconds of stimulation at the start. The constantly stimulated group began performing better just four minutes in — a \" profound effect \" that provides \" new evidence \" of a \" human operator \" having enhanced multitasking abilities via brain stimulation, the researchers write in the journal frontiers in human neuroscience.

A closer look at the accompanying metal plates revealed that five deceased archbishops of canterbury, going all the way back to the early 17th century, were among those interred. \" this is really astonishing, \" a former chair of the uk's heritage lottery fund tells the bbc, noting that one of the newly discovered church leaders was richard bancroft, who commissioned the english translation of the king james bible. Per nbc news, builders were toiling away at the site one day in 2015 when they made their discovery. A hole was mistakenly cut through the floor near the altar, and when the workers lowered a smartphone on a stick into the hole, they spied a staircase leading to the tomb where the coffins rested. What really caught their eye, though: the red and gold archbishop's crown perched on top of one casket. Although historians knew archbishops had been buried in the museum when it was still a church, they thought all remains had been removed during an 1851 rebuild — and most had, save for the ones directly beneath the church's altar. Viewers will soon be able to peer through a glazed panel to see the steps to the vault, where the coffins will remain undisturbed. One reason for leaving them be: no one wants to be sprayed with the thick black \" coffin liquor \" that can result when bodies in lead coffins decompose, the telegraph notes.

Trump flies home to manhattan in one of his private planes or copters so he can snooze in his own bed in trump tower every night, reports reuters. For instance, trump attended eight campaign events in iowa in november and december, and he hightailed it back to nyc afterward each time. \" it works very well for me, \" he tells reuters, mentioning he uses a boeing 757 with a larger bed when he's flying into bigger airports, and a smaller cessna for tinier destinations. But reuters talks to political analysts and others who think the strategy could end up costing him votes. \" not everything in a presidential campaign can be accomplished with a speech or a rally, \" the chairman of the american conservative union says. \" you attend a family event of a supporter in a key state... These have an important psychological impact. \" ted cruz has been able to go to about 12 town halls and about two dozen smaller schmooze sessions in part because he holes up in local accommodations after his work is done — and while his numbers can't necessarily be pegged to his lodgings, he's now leading trump in iowa polls. Still, as one blogger notes, you can bet trump isn't worrying about his travel habits.

If you miss a glimpse tomorrow, another will happen in august — that one should be bigger, says the washington post — and again in september. The term supermoon got coined about 30 years ago but has come into vogue only in the last few years, explains a post at earthsky.org. Astronomers generally stick with the more formal \" perigean full moon, \" a reference to \" perigee, \" the point in the moon's orbit when it's closest to us.

As business insider reports, the woman had been receiving $ 33,000 a year since 2008 after a whiplash injury. But when insurer ap pension saw her fitness data on the endomondo app, it launched a fraud investigation and eliminated the payouts before relenting and reinstating them at a lesser amount. Her plight came to light because a trade union publicized the case as a warning to others to watch what what they post. Endomondo is a danish app bought by american sports apparel company under armour a few years ago, and most of its users are outside the us, per the local.

The struggling service has reported a $ 5.2 billion quarterly loss, and says it's nearly out of cash, reports the wall street journal. Last week, it defaulted for the first time in its history, failing to make a legally required $ 5.5 billion payment for future retiree health benefits, and it may fail to make a similar $ 5.6 billion payment at the end of september. Most of the quarterly loss came from retiree benefits payments, but the service also lost $ 1 billion on its normal operations as the long decline in letter-sending continued. Postmaster general patrick donahoe said that the service would do whatever it takes to make sure mail is still delivered, although some vendors might go unpaid.

The photo is \" completely unprofessional, \" writes iraq veteran and blogger john burk in a post that's gotten some attention on facebook. He adds that black lives matter is \" known for inflicting violent protest throughout various parts of the united states, calling for the deaths of police officers, and even going so far as to call for the deaths of white americans. \" but west point graduate mary tobin says she talked to some of the cadets, who are upset by the controversy and see it differently: \" that fist to them meant you and your sisters did what only a few people, male or female, have ever done in this country, \" she tells the new york times. ( historically, the raised fist has been used by groups ranging from suffragists to labor unions to the black panthers, the army times notes. ) meanwhile, black lives matter organizer jonathan pulphus says fist-raising by blacks is a way to acknowledge civil-rights advances and make \" a space for themselves in institutions where they tend to not have a sense of belonging. \" failure to realize this, he adds, would cost west point black applicants. As for the cadets in the photo, they're still slated to graduate on may 21 from the mostly white, male military academy.",
