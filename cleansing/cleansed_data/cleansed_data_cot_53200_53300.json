        "summary": "North carolina passed a controversial voter id law in july, but if the department of justice has its way, the law — said to be the most sweeping of its kind in the nation — may never be enforced. The doj will file suit against the state today, a source tells politico and the charlotte observer; eric holder is expected to make the announcement later today. The suit accuses north carolina of violating the voting rights act by discriminating against black voters, and asks that the state be barred from enforcing the law — which was scheduled to go into effect for the 2016 elections. It also seeks to put north carolina back on a \" preclearance \" list, meaning all changes to voting laws and procedures would need to first be approved by the doj or a federal court. Forty north carolina counties were subject to preclearance until june, when the supreme court struck down part of the voting rights act. But the doj can use another vra provision to attempt to put states back under preclearance, as it is also doing in texas. The problem with the voter id law, as the doj sees it: just 22 % of registered voters in north carolina are african american, but they make up 34 % of the voters who do not have a dmv-issued id ( and thus would not be allowed to vote ). The doj suit will also take issue with three other parts of the law: the elimination of provisional ballots for voters who go to the incorrect polling place ( 30 % of out-of-precinct voters last year were african american ); the elimination of some early voting days ( 29 % of early voters last year were african american ); and the elimination of same-day voter registration during early voting ( 41 % of voters using same-day registration were african american ).",

According to the daily mail, which first reported weiner's communication with the underage girl, weiner's explicit messages included one where he told the high school sophomore he would \" make her limp for a week. \" the girl says weiner — who allegedly called himself \" t dog \" this time instead of \" carlos danger \" — asked her to undress and touch herself, and the new york daily news notes that encouraging a child under 17 to \" engage in a sexual performance \" can carry a 15-year sentence in new york.

The wounded bear, which had been attracted by a bait bin, ran off. In a youtube video that has now been taken offline, bowmar says he returned the next day and found the body of the bear around 150 feet from where it was hit. The video sparked controversy — and lurid headlines like \" warped hunter kills starving bear with seven foot homemade spear \" in british tabloids — not just for the manner of the kill, but for bowmar's celebration, the cbc reports. \" that's going to be some epic footage, \" he exclaims. \" yeah, i got mad penetration. That's a dead bear. \" the humane society of the us also weighed in, referring to the ohio man as \" this year's version of walter palmer, \" the american dentist who killed cecil the lion, notes the dayton daily news.

The kill was \" as humane and ethical as one could get in a hunting situation on big game animals, \" he says, adding that \" no one cares more about these animals than us hunters, especially me, \" and that the bear's hide and meat did not go to waste.

        "summary": "The mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: in an online essay titled \" plural marriage in kirtland and nauvoo, \" the church for the first time declares that founder joseph smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that \" careful estimates \" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant smith. The leader, then married to first wife emma, took his first plural wife, fanny alger, in kirtland, ohio. Smith and alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to nauvoo, ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old helen mar kimball; some were already married, a revelation the new york times describes as the \" biggest bombshell for some. \" the essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with kimball, were sealed \" for eternity alone, \" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved ( the ones that did involve sex were \" for time and eternity \" ). What did emma think of all this? per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the \" wrenching trial \" of polygamy? kimball said smith told her that \" the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the saints would ever have to test their faith. \" two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share \" reliable, faith-promoting \" info about its past, the church's historian tells the times. ( part of that effort: an explanation of its undergarments. )",

According to 2011 agency documents leaked by edward snowden, the nsa grabs \" millions of images per day \" — about 55,000 of which are good enough for facial recognition. The agency doesn't take them from state databases of us passport photos or driver's licenses, said an nsa spokeswoman, but she wouldn't say whether social media sites or state department databases were fair game. Law enforcement agencies already create facial-imagery databases — relying on facebook and driver's-license photos, for example — and the fbi is combining fingerprints with facial imagery and other data. But the nsa can match its images with vast troves of information it has already intercepted. So, is this legal? the nsa would need court approval to snatch images of americans, the times notes, unless they contacted someone overseas. The technology isn't foolproof, and gives its share of false positives, but civil-liberties advocates are still concerned.

However, this being syria — whose civil war is a many-sided conflict — it remained unclear just how effective it would be. The syrian government and its main allies, russia and iran, say they will abide by the weeklong truce, but the country's most powerful insurgent groups have not yet said whether they will, reports ap. If the truce holds for a week, the us and russia would begin intelligence sharing and target coordination against the islamic state and al-qaeda-linked militants. Meanwhile, syrian president bashar assad vowed that his government would take back all its land from \" terrorists. \" assad spoke during a rare public appearance that included attending prayers for the muslim holiday of eid al-adha in the damascus suburb of daraya, which had surrendered last month and reverted to government control after a four-year siege. \" we call on all syrians to turn toward reconciliation, \" he said. Italy, meanwhile, says a syrian cease-fire could pave the way for political negotiations aimed at ending the long and bloody conflict. Foreign minister paolo gentiloni told reporters after talks with his cypriot counterpart that a cessation of hostilities must happen before talks can begin. Cnn has a primer on the truce.",

At least some members of the jury apparently had it: a judge on monday declared a mistrial in the case. Tellis ' first trial, in 2017, ended in a mistrial as well. Tellis was arrested in early 2016 after the local da said a break in the perplexing case came via \" technological data \" like cellphone records; a doj analyst told the court saturday that tellis ' phone data indicates he was with chambers the night she died and that he wiped chambers'texts and info from his phone after her death. Buzzfeed notes that chambers ' father had previously said tellis ' name wasn't known to the family, and the prosecution in this trial described a relationship between chambers and tellis that was only a week old. The clarion ledger reports the prosecution sought to chip away at the \" eric \" detail: the medical director at the firefighters burn center estimated she had been on fire for as long as five minutes, and he and a speech pathologist both testified that they don't believe the 19-year-old was capable of intelligible speech based on the severity of her burns. Tellis ' attorney, alton peterson, thought doubt remained: \" when you have eight trained first responders who were there on the scene... It's hard to get around her telling them with her dying breaths that someone else did it. \" fox13 reports prosecutors plan to \" assess things \" and then announce if they ' ll try tellis a third time.",

The interview, recorded in canada in september, was obama's first since leaving the oval office in january. \" i miss the work itself because it was fascinating, \" obama said of his eight years, citing health care reform as one of his proudest achievements. He did not mention his successor, but did say government officials should be careful in using social media. Harry also focused on climate change, the military, mental health, and asked obama a \" lightning round \" of questions. The former president declined to say whether he wears boxers or briefs, but prefers aretha franklin to tina turner — \" aretha is the best \" — and favors basketball star michael jordan over lebron james. Obama also said he is \" obsessed \" with helping to train the next generation of leaders. As for the elephant in the room — whether harry will invite obama to his may wedding to meghan markle — mashable notes that the prince deferred, saying, \" well, i don't know about that. We haven't put the invites or the guest list together yet, so who knows whether he's going to be invited or not. Wouldn't want to ruin that surprise. \" he did say markle enjoyed her first christmas as a guest of queen elizabeth ii. \" she really enjoyed it, and the family loved having her there. \"",

        "summary": "As the navy tries to figure out what caused its latest collision, two of the most common theories involve human error or some kind of electrical glitch in the navigation system. But another idea has surfaced as well, and the navy isn't ruling it out: hacking. \" 2 clarify re: possibility of cyber intrusion or sabotage, no indications right now... But review will consider all possibilities, \" tweeted adm. John richardson, chief of naval operations, per fox news. The idea is that some foreign power, perhaps china or russia, interfered with the uss john s mccain's gps navigation, and perhaps did the same before the deadly june collision involving the uss fitzgerald. Here's a look at what experts are saying:'very unlikely ': at popular mechanics, kyle mizokami tosses cold water on the idea that \" gps spoofing \" is to blame. For one thing, broadcasting such an interference signal would likely have affected dozens of ships in the area, not just the uss mccain, and there's no indication of that. Plus, navy ships don't rely solely on gps: human spotters should have seen the hazard. It's fishy: \" there's something more than just human error going on, \" a former information warfare specialist for the navy tells mcclatchy, referring to the string of navy accidents. The story notes that on june 22, hackers appear to have manipulated the gps signals of 20 ships in the black sea, the first such instance of gps misdirection, or spoofing. The ships ' gpses actually told them they were on land, and the best guess is that the interference came from russia. It's fishy, take ii: \" i don't believe in coincidence, \" a former member of israel's cyber-warfare unit tells news.com.au. In addition to interfering with gps signals, hackers also could have planted malware in the ships ' computer network, he says. \" china has capabilities, maybe they are trying things, it is possible. \" the uss mccain had been returning from a patrol in the south china sea, where it sailed by one of china's contested man-made islands, when the collision occurred. Remains of some of the 10 missing sailors from the uss mccain have been found on the ship itself.",

            "Congress is on pace to make history with the least productive legislative year in the post world war ii era. Just 61 bills have become law to date in 2012 out of 3,914 bills that have been introduced by lawmakers, or less than 2 % of all proposed laws, according to a usa today analysis of records since 1947 kept by the u.s. House clerk's office. In 2011, after republicans took control of the u.s. House, congress passed just 90 bills into law. The only other year in which congress failed to pass at least 125 laws was 1995. These statistics make the 112th congress, covering 2011-12, the least productive two-year gathering on capitol hill since the end of world war ii. Not even the 80th congress, which president truman called the \" do-nothing congress \" in 1948, passed as few laws as the current one, records show. The difference between 1995 and now is that republicans rebounded in the second year of the 104th congress in 1996, churning out 245 laws with a democratic president, including a tax cut package, a minimum wage increase, an overhaul of the nation's welfare system, and requiring law enforcement to disclose where sex offenders live.

            "That thud you just heard was the sound of congress hitting an all-time low approval rating – again. Gallup said thursday that a mere 10 percent of americans think members of congress are doing a good job – the same approval rating from february of this year, which was the lowest in gallup's history. And their disdain for capitol hill is one thing that democrats, republicans and independent voters can agree on.

            "Congress is on pace to make history with the least productive legislative year in the post world war ii era. Just 61 bills have become law to date in 2012 out of 3,914 bills that have been introduced by lawmakers, or less than 2 % of all proposed laws, according to a usa today analysis of records since 1947 kept by the u.s. House clerk's office. In 2011, after republicans took control of the u.s. House, congress passed just 90 bills into law. The only other year in which congress failed to pass at least 125 laws was 1995. These statistics make the 112th congress, covering 2011-12, the least productive two-year gathering on capitol hill since the end of world war ii. Not even the 80th congress, which president truman called the \" do-nothing congress \" in 1948, passed as few laws as the current one, records show. The difference between 1995 and now is that republicans rebounded in the second year of the 104th congress in 1996, churning out 245 laws with a democratic president, including a tax cut package, a minimum wage increase, an overhaul of the nation's welfare system, and requiring law enforcement to disclose where sex offenders live.

And their disdain for capitol hill is one thing that democrats, republicans and independent voters can agree on.

The amendment passed easily 68 to 30 – with the thirty senators who voted against the measure receiving a good amount of backlash – but shortly after the vote there were rumors that conferees would strip the amendment from the final bill during reconciliation with the house. Not to fear, though, because according to sam stein over at the huffington post, the franken amendment survived, and the final language is \" remarkably strong. \" an aide to franken told stein \" the substance of the language ' is unchanged, ' \" which means the government will not be able to contract with companies that restrict employees from going to court over charges of \" assault, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress or negligent hiring practice[ s ]. \" moreover, the title vii provision of the amendment, which allows an employee to sue not only the alleged perpetrator but also the perpetrator's employer, remains in the bill as well.

He had a criminal record but nothing on the scale of sunday's crazed attack, the miami herald finds. He was arrested on a battery charge when he was 16, and was busted seven other times between 2004 and 2009 for charges including vending near a school, trespassing, and marijuana-related offenses. He was married for more than a year to a woman who says he became increasingly violent with her. \" i wouldn't say he had mental problem, but he always felt like people was against him. No one was for him, everyone was against him, \" his ex-wife, who filed for divorce in 2007, tells wplg. At eugene's former home, a woman says the previous occupants lost the home to foreclosure last year, but eugene would often turn up unannounced looking for mail. Eugene's victim, who lost most of his face in the attack, is fighting for his life in a local hospital, and police still aren't sure what prompted the horrific attack. They believe it could have been cocaine psychosis or an overdose of \" bath salts, \" a synthetic drug one police spokesman likens to a potent new kind of lsd.",

            "The victim of the vicious flesh-eating attacker on the macarthur causeway on saturday has been identified as 65-year-old ronald poppo, the miami herald has learned. Poppo remains in critical condition at ryder trauma center with horrific facial injuries. His attacker, killed by miami police at the crime scene, has also been identified as rudy eugene, who as a teenager in the late 1990s played high school football at north miami beach high. How the men's paths crossed in such a violent act remains unclear. More recently, court records show that eugene was married in 2005 and divorced in 2007. According to the filing, he had no income and his assets included $ 2 cash and $ 50 for a cellphone. His former wife, jenny ductant, agreed to take on the couple's debt, which included the power and phone bills. \" i don't want to talk about it, \" she said tuesday when reached on her cellphone. The man eugene attacked remained in extremely critical condition monday at jackson memorial hospital. Much of his face was gone, the skin ripped away, the nose bitten and the eyes gouged. What remained was his goatee and little else. Photos of the scene with eugene and his victim quickly went viral on the internet monday. were hoping that he pulls through, for his well-being",
            "Miami - sources identified the man who was shot and killed by police while biting off parts of another man's face near downtown miami on saturday. Police sources identified the man as rudy eugene. Police said eugene, 31, was found attacking another man near the west end of the macarthur causeway and biscayne boulevard on saturday afternoon. \" when the officer approached him, told him to stop, pointed a gun at him, he turned around and growled like a wild animal and kept eating at the man's face, \" fraternal order of police president armando aguilar said sunday. A witness said eugene was biting off pieces of the other man's face and tossing them aside. He described it as looking like a scene out of the walking dead.

            "The victim of the vicious flesh-eating attacker on the macarthur causeway on saturday has been identified as 65-year-old ronald poppo, the miami herald has learned. Poppo remains in critical condition at ryder trauma center with horrific facial injuries. His attacker, killed by miami police at the crime scene, has also been identified as rudy eugene, who as a teenager in the late 1990s played high school football at north miami beach high. How the men's paths crossed in such a violent act remains unclear. More recently, court records show that eugene was married in 2005 and divorced in 2007. According to the filing, he had no income and his assets included $ 2 cash and $ 50 for a cellphone. His former wife, jenny ductant, agreed to take on the couple's debt, which included the power and phone bills. \" i don't want to talk about it, \" she said tuesday when reached on her cellphone. The man eugene attacked remained in extremely critical condition monday at jackson memorial hospital. Much of his face was gone, the skin ripped away, the nose bitten and the eyes gouged. What remained was his goatee and little else. Photos of the scene with eugene and his victim quickly went viral on the internet monday. were hoping that he pulls through, for his well-being",

Researchers looked at 1,075 cases of eye infections reported to an fda medical device database over a 10-year period ending in 2015, and of those infections, almost 20 % of them ended up causing more serious eye injuries, a cdc release reports. Those injuries ranged from scarred corneas and cornea transplants to other forms of vision problems. And of those who reported infections, the issue was bad enough for more than 10 % of them to go to the er or an urgent-care clinic for treatment. Yet most people don't give a second thought to the perfunctory way in which they handle their contacts, a lenox hill hospital ophthalmologist tells webmd. \" unfortunately, many of the 41 million contact lens users in the united states do not think of a contact lens as a medical device they are placing on the surface of their eye, \" dr. Mark fromer says. In addition to replacing contacts as recommended, users should also follow other recommendations from the american optometric association to keep eyes healthy, per cbs news, including not sharing contacts with anyone, not using tap water to clean contacts, and no snoozing with them in, which the cdc says can raise the risk of an eye infection between six to eight times.

Friends charlotte trego, 27, and tameka lynch, 30, were the first to disappear, separately, on may 3, 2014. Lynch was found dead of a suspected drug overdose in a creek weeks later; her mom told the dispatch she was afraid of water. Wanda lemons, 38; shasta himelrick, 20; and timberly claytor later vanished; the bodies of the latter two were ultimately found. Himelrick was pregnant; the five other women all had children.

He should know: brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile pct, which runs from the mexican border through california, oregon, and washington to the border with canada. But don't take his word for it: the pacific crest trail association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire pct in 2006, according to the ap, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? you can thank cheryl strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the pcta's jack haskel told the ap in 2015. But after the movie, starring reese witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the pct exploded. \" millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired, \" haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \" however for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well, \" writes donthikelikewild.org. \" our advice to would-be hikers: grow a spine first.

Trump is reportedly \" irked \" that he's bringing in big ratings for other networks without getting any of the profits himself. \"he wants to figure out if he can monetize it, \" a source says. He's allegedly consulting with daughter ivanka trump and son-in-law jared kushner on a \" mini-media conglomerate. \" his reasoning, according to a source: \"we've triggered a base of the population that hasn't had a voice in a long time. \" a trump spokesperson denies trump is even thinking about such a thing. But immediately after, trump tweeted: \" the press is so totally biased that we have no choice but to take our tough but fair and smart message directly to the people! \" new york magazine says the theory makes sense. This is the first time it's unclear whether a presidential candidate actually wants to be president. Trump is historically unpopular and shows little interest in changing that, and he's half-assing basic tasks of running for president, such as calling donors. Trump tv would be the \" logical end \" of his campaign, according to new republic. \"if trump's tv station gets 30 % ratings, it ' ll be doing fantastically well, \" the website states. \" but if that's his share of the vote, then his candidacy will end in failure. \" transitioning from presidential candidate to media baron wouldn't be easy. Trump would still need a partner for funding and would likely need to buy an existing cable channel. \"it's a fool's errand, \" an entertainment executive tells vanity fair. \"but then again, we are talking about donald trump. \" ( did this 1992 movie predict trump's campaign? )",

And no, that doesn't mean we're about to get the polar bear version of outkast, but rather that the arctic ocean is rapidly becoming more like the atlantic ocean, according to new research published thursday. The arctic ocean has historically been separated into two layers: a cold, less salty layer on top with a salty, warmer layer of atlantic water underneath, scientific american reports. The barrier between the two is called the cold halocline layer, and it's been responsible for preserving arctic sea ice, according to science. But the separation between the layers has been quickly breaking down over the past decade or so. The temperature difference between the two layers has lessened by 2 degrees since 2002, and the top layer of cold water has gotten thinner in the past decade — possibly by as much as 180 feet. From 2013 to 2015, the layers merged completely in some areas. The loss of the cold halocline layer means sea ice in the arctic is getting attacked from both sides. Warming air and warming surface ocean temperatures are creating a \" positive feedback loop \" that is decimating the ice. Sea ice in the arctic is decreasing by 13 % every decade, and soon the arctic ocean could be entirely ice-free during the summer. Between warmer water with more nutrients and no more ice to block the sun, it's unclear what will happen to the arctic's ecosystem, inverse reports.

The 47-year-old took to facebook last night, writing that \" i was given the choice to walk away quietly and to publicly suggest that this was my decision. But... That would be untrue. \" ghomeshi's version of the truth is that an unnamed \" jilted \" ex has launched a smear campaign against him, centered around his bedroom activities, which he writes \" may not be palatable to some folks. \" ghomeshi describes \" a mild form of fifty shades of grey \": rough sex that was consensual and involved safe words. The toronto star tells it quite differently: it says it has heard allegations from three women ( none willing to go on the record ) who describe incredibly violent and non-consensual sex. One told the star that ghomeshi had expressed that he would be aggressive, which she took to mean \" he would want to pull my hair and have rough sex.... [ later ] he attacked me. Choked me. Hit me like i didn't know men hit women. I submitted. \" the women told the paper they have not gone to police, reportedly over concerns their names would leak or that sexual texts they sent ghomeshi would be used against them; they cited the case of carla ciccone, who was lambasted online after publishing a story on xojane about a date she had with a popular radio host and \" repulsive sexual predator. \" ghomeshi plans to file a $ 50 million suit against the cbc today; q is one of the most successful shows the network has ever run.",

As keith schmoozed with the people around me, i enjoyed the concert and also tried to make jake fall for me using telepathic love vibes. Just kidding. There were no love vibes, and the only feeling jake had was annoyance after keith arrived. He kept trying to talk to jake, who wasn't feeling his \"i really want to get you on my show and maybe into your pants \" vibe, so keith soon turned his attention to me. \"sorry, how do you pronounce your name again? \" he said. \"um, carla, \" i replied. \"oh, i thought it was more complicated, like carafalooota, \" he said.

Clare shaw and her family were out on their boat sunday outside of noank when ryder, their 8-month-old shiba inu, somehow broke free of his harness and plunged into the water, per fox 61. The panicked family, which was under the impression ryder couldn't swim, called the coast guard and backtracked for hours looking for their pup, to no avail. \" we felt defeated, \" shaw says. \" we packed up his things and lit a candle in his cage and assumed our boy lost his life drowning. \" but shaw obviously didn't give up hope completely, because she decided to put up a now-deleted post on her facebook page asking if anyone had seen her precious pup, the epoch times reports — and it was after 100 shares or so of that post that the best news ever came her way. A horse vet saw her post, as well as a post in a local lost-and-found group, and put two and two together. Phil bigelow and patrick jullarine, friends since they were 9 years old, had been out boating themselves on sunday and spotted a \" shaking and scared \" ryder in the sea, scooped him out, and nicknamed him nemo. Bigelow says once he got home, he and his girlfriend picked up some snacks, a collar, and toys for their newfound furry friend \" to make him feel loved \" until his owners could be tracked down. Shaw calls ryder's save a \" true miracle \" and expressed her gratitude on facebook, via people. \" the power of social media is out of this world, \" she says.

        "summary": "Yet another ruling in the amanda knox case is coming from italy's highest court today. Knox and then-boyfriend raffaele sollecito were convicted in the 2007 murder of meredith kercher in 2009, acquitted on appeal in 2011 ( at which point knox returned to the us ), had that acquittal overturned in 2013, and were then found guilty again last year. As the new york times and the ap report, italy's top court, the court of cassation, has a number of options: confirm the convictions: that would mean italy would likely attempt to extradite knox, who has maintained her innocence and vowed not to return to the country willingly, though there is a chance the justice ministry would decline to do so. Sollecito, who is still in italy, would go to prison immediately to serve his sentence. Order new appellate trials for knox and/or sollecito: yes, you read that right: this saga may still not be over. If this court decides to throw out all or part of the appeals court's guilty verdict, it will likely order a third trial. ( to give you an idea of how long this could go on, one 1972 murder case went to the court of cassation nine times before a final verdict was issued, 28 years later. ) throw out the guilty verdict without ordering new trials: this would amount to an acquittal, leaving knox free to visit italy without fear of arrest, but the ap notes that \" such a decision is rare. \" if an extradition request is made for knox, a professor of international law tells the times the us will likely grant it, though it would be a \" hard \" decision. The two countries do have an extradition treaty, and another expert tells the ap there is no formal reason — though there are a number of political ones — for italy to not bother asking in the first place. ( some have argued the concept of \" double jeopardy \" could be used to block knox's extradition, though others have debunked that idea. ) it's not clear when the ruling is expected, but the bbc's live updates noted that the hearing was \" underway \" as of 7am eastern time.",

Cnn reports @alt_uscis regularly accuses ice agents of impropriety, such as taking bribes.

In its lawsuit, twitter says it and its users have a first amendment right to \" disseminate such anonymous or pseudonymous political speech. \" it claims releasing user information would have a \" chilling effect \" on other accounts critical of the government. The actual user behind @alt_uscis is being represented by the aclu, which says the government usually only asks for social media account information for a criminal matter or pressing national security concern. The cbp's request was based on a statute that mostly deal with taxes on the importation of goods.

Jerusalemprime minister benjamin netanyahu said on sunday that most threats to israel's security were \" dwarfed \" by the prospect of iran obtaining nuclear weaponry, which local media reports charged tehran had stepped up its efforts to achieve. The comments at a weekly cabinet meeting and the front-page reports in the liberal haaretz, a frequent netanyahu critic, and in the conservative, pro-government israel hayom came as israeli debate intensified about whether to go to war against iran - and soon - over its disputed atomic projects. The debate seemed to defy appeals by u.s. President barack obama, seeking re-election in november, to allow more time for international diplomacy. Tehran says its nuclear ambitions are peaceful and has threatened wide-ranging reprisals if attacked. In comments also broadcast live by israeli media, netanyahu said that \" all the threats currently being directed against the israeli home front are dwarfed by another threat, different in scope, different in substance. \" \" therefore i say again, that iran must not be permitted to obtain nuclear weapons, \" netanyahu said. Netanyahu also said israel was \" investing billions in"

The show halted production earlier this week. The workers — who asked to stay anonymous out of fear of ruining their careers — say spacey targeted young male staffers in a \" predatory \" manner.

The worker says the nonconsensual touching from someone in a \" very powerful position on the show \" left him \" in a state of shock. \" the production assistant says after arriving on set, spacey cornered him in his trailer and made \" inappropriate contact. \" he says after he told spacey what he was doing wasn't ok, spacey became \" flustered \" and left for the rest of the day. House of cards producer media rights capital says spacey was reported for sexual harassment in 2012 and it is \" deeply troubled \" by the new allegations, per the hollywood reporter.

One lawsuit, filed under the north american free trade agreement, seeks damages because the permit rejection was \" arbitrary and unjustified, \" reports reuters. The suit claims that obama overstepped his authority because of his \" unprecedented and symbolic grounds \" for turning down the project, which he argued would bring \" dirtier crude oil into our country \" while doing little to boost the american economy. The second lawsuit, filed in a federal court in houston, calls for a reversal of obama's \" unconstitutional \" decision and a ruling that no future president can block the pipeline project, reports reuters. A canadian trade lawyer tells the globe and mail that it's tough to predict how these kinds of lawsuits will go, but that transcanada's argument that it was treated unfairly because the issue had become politicized appears solid. The times notes that a win for the canadian company would be unprecedented: in the 22 years of the nafta agreement, the us has won all 12 of the challenges it faced from canadian firms, while us firms have prevailed in trade agreement cases in canada.",

        "summary": "The author of the explosive dossier dogging donald trump less than 10 days before his inauguration has been named as a former british intelligence officer — but the investigative firm he co-directs won't confirm or deny his involvement. Sources tell the wall street journal that the document was prepared by christopher steele, a former russia expert in britain's spy service who founded the orbis business intelligence research firm in 2009. The new york times, in a look at how the dossier came to light, reports that steele was hired by washington research firm fusion gps, which was hired by a wealthy gop donor in the fall of 2015 to compile anti-trump material. After trump became the presumptive nominee, the gop donor no longer needed the research firm's services, but wealthy democratic donors stepped in, and steele continued to send monthly memos detailing alleged russian efforts to both compromise trump and assist his campaign, per the times'sources. In other coverage: the guardian looks at john mccain's involvement, which apparently included clandestine efforts to obtain the dossier after hearing about it from a diplomat during a conference in canada. \" upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, i delivered the information to the director of the fbi, \" mccain said in a statement wednesday. The ap reports that it has been unable to contact steele. A neighbor of the former spy, who lives outside london, says steele and his family are away and it's not clear when they will return. Intelligence chiefs are defending their decision to take the very unusual step of attaching a summary of the unverified dossier to last week's briefing on russian hacking, the washington post reports. \" part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security, \" director of national intelligence james clapper said wednesday. He said he spoke with trump and expressed dismay at the \" extremely corrosive \" leaks in the press. Early thursday, trump tweeted that clapper had called him \" to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. \" he added: \" made up, phony facts.too bad! \" politico looks at how democrats are dealing with trump's russia troubles. So far, senators have been more restrained than house members, some of whom have started referring to trump as \" moscow donald. \" the new york times reports that trump is facing a backlash from jewish groups for wondering if we \" are living in nazi germany \" when he was criticizing intelligence agencies ' handling of what he called \" fake news. \" at",

        "summary": "Some passengers were hurled to the ceiling monday when an aeroflot flight from moscow to bangkok hit a patch of turbulence so severe that dozens of passengers were injured. The boeing 777 hit what's known as \" clear air turbulence \" around 40 minutes before landing in bangkok, where 27 passengers were hospitalized, some with broken bones, the guardian reports. The airline is paying for their treatment, though it says the injuries were definitely not its fault. \" the reasons behind the injures were that some of the passengers had not had their seatbelts fastened, \" aeroflot said in a statement. Passenger rostik rusev tells cnn that it lasted for 10 terrifying seconds. \" there was blood on the ceiling, people with broken noses, babies who were hurt. It was horrible. It came out of nowhere. It was like driving a car and a tire suddenly bursts, \" rusev says, adding: \" the aircraft personnel couldn't have been more professional and courageous. They were heroes in everything they were doing. \" there are hundreds of cases every year — usually milder ones — of aircraft encountering clear air turbulence, which is caused when masses of air moving at different speeds meet, the bbc reports. Pilots rely on each other to report turbulence pockets they encounter in skies that appear clear and calm.",

Worn out, she got sick, went on the antibiotics, and the rest is history. Miley tweeted today that she ' ll likely have to cancel tonight's concert in st. Louis, as she probably won't be released today, e! reports. Cyrus has made no secret of the fact that she's despondent over floyd's death — in fact, she's posted about it so often on social media ( and even sang a tribute to a huge inflatable version of the husky at one of her concerts ) that gawker ran an explainer on monday. It's not clear what happened to floyd ( there are reports he was killed by a coyote ), but he was apparently miley's favorite of the five dogs she had. After his death, her mom got her a new dog named moonie, but she ended up giving the puppy away due to a concern about having small dogs — because in 2012, another dog of miley's died after being grabbed by yet another dog of hers ( who was also subsequently re-homed ).

In an industry first, united announced a bounty in may that rewards miles to anyone who identifies a bug on its website. There are 10 bug classes eligible: cross-site scripting bugs, for example, are worth 50,000 miles, while authentication bypass bugs earn 250,000. While \" passively poking the site, \" jordan wiens, founder of a florida security company, says he found what he thought were two remote code execution bugs, which allow a hacker to run their own potentially dangerous code on a site. \" i also thought they were lame and wasn't sure if they were on parts of the infrastructure that qualified, \" he tells threatpost. \" i figured they'd award me 50,000 miles or something smaller. \" it turns out rce bugs earn the highest payout: a maximum 1 million miles. After making his submission to united — his first to a bounty program, he says — wiens got an email asking for confirmation that he was a us citizen and that his six hours of research was completed in the us. \" two hours later, i got a message to check my account that i had gotten my million miles, \" he says. Wiens, who can't share details of the bug, says the miles are worth $ 25,000 and could take him on a first-class trip around the world or on 40 domestic round-trip flights in coach. His plan is to use the miles on coach trips for his family, plus one luxurious flight with his wife, he tells fox 13. Wired reports wiens ' award is the program's first major payout. Other security researchers have since shared their awards on twitter. One says he nabbed 500,000 miles. ( speaking of planes, a \" horrible \" and \" evil \" new seat design has been revealed. )",

Though the event can't be directly attributed to climate change, it is suspicious that the ice receded the fastest it had in years in the months preceding the final break during the dead of winter, when temperatures would normally be their lowest. Without the protection of the a-68's ice, almost 3,600 sq miles ( 6,000 km ) of antarctic ocean water are now exposed to sunlight and accessible for the first time in more than 120,000 years.

The scientists, led by the british antarctic survey ( bas ), are trying to reach a newly revealed ecosystem that had been hidden for 120,000 years below the larsen c ice shelf on the antarctic peninsula. In july last year, part of the larsen c ice shelf calved away, forming a huge iceberg - a68 - which is four times bigger than london, and revealing life beneath for the first time.

Now she's suing her former employer, money transfer service intermex, for invasion of privacy, unfair business practices, and retaliation, among other things, ars technica reports. Arias started researching the app, then called xora — its website touts the app's ability to let employers \" instantly see where their employees are and where they have been \" — and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss john stubits then, per the suit, \" admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments. \" arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by intermex. \" her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time, \" the complaint states, noting that he told arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called.

Both are democrats from conservative states and both are safe from re-election campaigns until 2018. \" the makeup of families is changing, but the importance of family is enduring, \" said heitkamp in a statement. Together with yesterday's flip by florida's sen. Bill nelson, the moves leave only four democratic senators who have not publicly voiced support for gay marriage. If you're a bit amazed by how quickly senators have been \" evolving \" on this issue, you're not the only one. But nate silver decided to take things a step further, as usual, and try to come up with a mathematical model to explain why, for his latest blog post in the new york times. The key, says silver, is public support for gay marriage in many states growing from a slight majority to a clear one. But he expects the pace to slow down greatly at this point. \" the remaining senators who have not taken the opportunity yet may have good political reasons for it, and may wait some time before they do, \" he writes.",

            "So many senators are declaring their support for same-sex marriage that i've regularly had to check my twitter feed while working on this article, lest i miss any announcements. As dylan matthews of the washington post has detailed, 50 senators have now stated their backing for same-sex marriage, up from only 16 in 2010 and eight in 2008. Why are senators shifting their positions so rapidly? obviously, this mirrors the shift in opinion among the general public to some degree. But while the public's increase in support for same-sex marriage has been exceptionally linear and steady, the number of senators endorsing it has increased at exponential rates over the last few years, with a remarkable jump in the last two weeks when a cascade of senators announced their support. One explanation might be that there is \"momentum \" in the senate behind same-sex marriage. Often, explanations rooted in notion of momentum are analytically lazy: they describe what is happening ( \"support is increasing! \" ) without really telling you why. However, it is plausible that senators are learning from one another's experiences. If one senator comes out for same-sex marriage and finds that she is getting a favorable response from her constituents, her donors, her colleagues and the news media, she may encourage others to do so as well.

Presto, they got a rate since 1900 that's eight to 100 times worse than the natural one. \" we were very surprised to see how bad it is, \" says study leader gerardo ceballos. \" this is very depressing. \" \" if it is allowed to continue, life would take millions of years to recover, and our species itself would disappear early on, \" says ceballos. But nations can reverse the crisis — which has been linked to deforestation, industrialization, and other human factors — by conserving threatened species and lowering pressures on their populations, the paper says. So far critics seem to buy the paper's basic math but doubt that species extinction will continue at this high rate for centuries. \" it is likely the problem will decline rapidly because most countries will be rich and care much for the natural world, \" writes one environmentalist. Earth has seen five other mass extinctions, including one 443 million years ago that killed off 83 % of sea life, and the most recent, which wiped out the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, the telegraph notes.",

            "Abstract the oft-repeated claim that earth's biota is entering a sixth \"mass extinction \" depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the \"background \" rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years ( that is, 2 e/msy ), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current",
