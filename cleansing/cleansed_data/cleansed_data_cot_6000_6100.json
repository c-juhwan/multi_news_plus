        "summary": "It's a question that has bedeviled kindergartners, and now apparently phds have the answer: why do giant pandas have spots? to find out, a team of california researchers compared the black and white regions of the panda's fur to more than 200 other species, and then analyzed those findings in relation to environmental and behavioral conditions, science reports. Since pandas don't hibernate like their bear cousins, the team ruled out that color helps regulate body temperature. Writing in the journal behavioral ecology, the researchers theorize that white patches on the panda's face, rump, and belly provide camouflage from predators in snowy habitats, while dark limbs help the panda hide in forests. And those black ears that you might think are adorable are meant to help the panda communicate \" ferocity \" to predators. Dark eye patches aren't meant to resist glare, as the experts thought, but instead probably help the panda recognize friends and ward off competitors. Piebald patches evolved as a sort of compromise since the bamboo eaters are active year-round, per science. Lead author tim caro says in a statement that the panda's unique coloring posed \" a long-standing problem in biology that has been difficult to tackle because virtually no other mammal has this appearance. \" the \" breakthrough \" came, he explains, when researchers treated \" each part of the body as an independent area. \" the panda question wasn't caro's first bicolor-related puzzle. He once donned a zebra costume as part of a quest to figure out why the animals have stripes, per uc davis. The answer? to stop pesky horseflies from biting them. ( pandas are off the endangered list. )",

Or they could be used for camouflage, communication, eye protection, or regulating body heat.

In his new book, zebra stripes, caro takes readers through his scientific and personal journey to get to the bottom of this mysterious and beautiful coloration. Since biologists alfred russel wallace and charles darwin first debated the issue more than 130 years ago, many theories have been put forth as to why zebras have stripes: a form of camouflage? to confuse predators? heat management? to repel biting flies? dressing up like a zebra, for science chapter by chapter, the book shows caro's process of elimination as he systematically tested each of these hypotheses at his research site in tanzania.

Japan's parliament passed a law friday that will allow akihito, who became emperor when father hirohito died in 1989, to abdicate, reports reuters. Akihito has had heart surgery and prostate cancer and has hinted that his health is making it tough to carry out official duties. But a ban on emperors making political statements made it impossible for him to just say that he wanted to step down, the bbc reports. The law — which will apply to akihito alone, not any successors — calls for him to be replaced on the chrysanthemum throne within three years by his son, crown prince naruhito, who is currently 57 years old. Reuters notes the abdication will be the first in the country since 1817.",

Middle schools saw a jump, too, with usage increasing from 1.4 % to 2.7 %. In many places, it's even legal. Though two dozen states have moved to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, the rest haven't, and the fda is still considering how to regulate them, the wall street journal reports. E-cigs may be much less harmful than regular cigarettes, but anti-smoking advocates fear they ' ll lead to kids getting hooked on the old-fashioned burning variety. Unlike traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes can advertise freely, and come in kid-friendly flavors like strawberry and chocolate. So far 93 % of high school students who tried e-cigarettes say they'd already smoked traditional ones. Among middle schoolers, however, that number fell to about 80 %. The figures help explain why the e-cig business is booming.",

Getting a bunch of celebrities in the background, you feeding them pizza. \" the satellite appearance — obama's first time on the show as president, entertainment weekly notes — is yet another attempt by obama to remind people about the march 31 deadline to sign up for obamacare. More highlights from e!: he complained that with michelle in china, he's \" stuck with two dogs, and i ' m expected to walk them, and do what you do when you walk dogs. \" obama expanded on his plan to make sure neither of his daughters ever gets a tattoo: he and michelle will get the same tattoo, in the same location. \" we will reduce the cool factor of any tattoo.

Carey essentially appears to have made a drunken spectacle of himself during a three-day official trip to moscow in july, insulting his hosts and fraternizing with \" suspicious \" women, according to an investigative report released via a freedom of information act request. Here are some highlights, courtesy of the washington post ( which notes he \" behaved like a boor \" ), russia today, and cnn: carey became \" visibly agitated \" about a long layover in zurich, and started drinking. \" he appeared drunk and, in the public area, talked loudly about the importance of his position as commander of the only operational nuclear force in the world, and that he saves the world from war every day, \" one witness said. Carey kept on drinking throughout his stay in moscow. There, he met two, to use his term, \" hot women, \" at the rooftop bar at the ritz carlton, and again at a restaurant the next night. They were evasive about whether they were russian or british. Carey himself found the women suspicious. \" for people who are in business to be kind of conveniently in the same place where we're at, it seemed odd to me, \" he said. While at the restaurant, \" maj. Gen carey had alcohol and kept trying to get the band to let him play with them, \" the report said. \" the band did not allow maj. Gen. Carey to play with them. \" carey had another eyebrow-raising encounter with a female tobacco store clerk. \" a tobacco store lady talking about physics in the wee hours of the morning doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, \" he told investigators. The report says carey \" was frequently rude \" to his hosts, both during dinner — where he offended with unspecified comments about syria and edward snowden — and during a walk through the red square, where he \" pouted and sulked \" because he couldn't keep up. He also kept arriving late to events. At one point on a tour of a monastery he tried to give their ( again female ) guide a fist bump. \" she had no idea what he was trying to do, \" a witness said. \" it was again, very, very embarrassing. \" carey has now been re-assigned as an assistant to the commander of the air force's space command. \" this was an unfortunate incident, \" that commander said. \" maj.

On nbc's \" today, \" flake called trump's remarks at a rally in mississippi the night before \" appalling. \" flake sided with democrats last week in seeking a one-week pause in the confirmation process to allow the fbi to investigate multiple claims of sexual misconduct against kavanaugh. \" there's no time and no place for remarks like that, \" flake said wednesday. \" to discuss something this sensitive at a political rally is just not right. \" \" i wish he hadn't done it, \" added flake, whose vote senate republicans will need to confirm kavanaugh if all democrats oppose the nomination. Sen. Susan collins, r-maine, who has not said publicly how she will vote on kavanaugh, said wednesday that \" the president's comments were just plain wrong. \" sen. Lisa murkowski, r-alaska, who has also not said publicly how she plans to vote, called trump's attack on ford \" absolutely wholly"

But until that inquiry or any other turns up actual evidence of collusion into the 2016 election, he also thinks people need to calm down. Because what's unfolding right now, he writes, is nothing short of \" conspiratorial mass hysteria. \" reporters seem \" paralyzed \" by the story, afraid of challenging it in case it ends up being true. \" nobody wants to be the one claiming the emperor has no clothes the day his highness walks out naked. \" taibbi, for instance, says he has written some \" very tame \" stories on the matter, suggesting that the media wait for the aforementioned evidence before going crazy — only to be accused of being on putin's payroll. \" one way we recognize a mass hysteria movement is that everyone who doesn't believe is accused of being in on the plot, \" writes taibbi. \" this has been going on virtually unrestrained in both political and media circles in recent weeks. \" he finds it remarkable that british conspiracist louise mensch is a \" suddenly legitimate \" source in the eyes of the new york times and others, this the same woman who insists that putin murdered andrew breitbart. He also calls out politicians such as democratic sen. Mark warner for being fixated on the idea of russian infiltration to nearly comic extremes.

        "summary": "Congressional republicans on friday evening revealed the final version of their massive tax bill, which appears likely to pass next week, the washington post reports. Here's some of what's included in the \" tax cut and jobs act \": the corporate tax rate is reduced from 35 % to 21 %, representing an approximately $ 1 trillion tax cut over the next decade. Despite trump's claim the bill wouldn't cut taxes for the wealthy, the wealthiest americans see their tax rate reduced from 39.6 % to 37 %. The bill also raises the income needed to hit that tax rate. People can inherit up to $ 11 million tax-free — an increase from $ 5.5 million — in changes to the estate tax. The bill lowers tax rates within all seven tax brackets, leading to lower taxes for most americans, abc news reports. But those cuts expire in eight years, and independent analyses have found people making under $ 75,000 will pay more in taxes over the next decade. The standard deduction is increased from $ 12,700 to $ 24,000 for joint filers and from $ 6,350 to $ 12,000 for individuals. In a move seen as targeting blue states, the bill limits state, local, and property tax deductions to $ 10,000. Those deductions are unlimited under current law. The bill keeps popular deductions for student loan interest and medical expenses, as well as graduate students'tax break. The bill repeals the obamacare individual mandate and allows drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge, the hill reports. The tax cut and jobs act will be voted on next week, starting with the house on tuesday. Republicans can only afford to lose two votes in the senate, but there are currently no republican senators on the record against the bill. Analysts have suggested tax cuts in the bill will add $ 1.5 trillion to the deficit and would likely not pay for themselves through economic growth, as republicans and the trump administration claim.",

Just weeks after chelsea railed against sanders ' health care plan, bill clinton — whom the washington post called a \" doomsday device \" for his wife's campaign — took to a new hampshire stage sunday to address what he calls dishonest and \" sexist \" attacks against hillary, the new york times reports. \" when you're making a revolution you can't be too careful with the facts, \" the ex-president said, calling sanders \" hermetically sealed \" from reality, per nbc news. The times described clinton's remarks as ranging from a general discussion about the race to \" an angrier recitation of grievances against mr. Sanders and his fervent supporters. \" the paper also notes that although clinton has been relatively subdued so far, frustration may be brewing due to sanders'strength in the state ahead of tuesday's primary. Among clinton's complaints: hillary's alleged links to wall street; sanders ' attempt to paint himself as the anti-establishment candidate ( \" anybody that doesn't agree with me is a tool of the establishment, \" clinton said, pretending to speak in sanders-speak ); and a sanders'staffer improperly accessing clinton campaign voter data. But clinton really lit up when talking about what he describes as misogynistic attacks against his wife by sanders'supporters. In talking about a female blogger who defended his wife online, clinton said \" she and other people have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often, not to mention sexist, to repeat. \" sanders ' campaign manager tells bloomberg: \" it's unfortunate that president clinton is choosing to engage in the kind of negative attacks that he is on the eve of the new hampshire primary. \"",

The two filed a lawsuit against the department this week. \" not only did the state fail us, they failed him, \" trish said. \" they lied to us. \" the couple adopted their three foster kids in march 2013, rounding out their family that already included four biological children.

Wikileaks founder julian assange says the website still intends to release soon 15,000 more classified documents relating to the afghan war. Video courtesy of reuters. Some governments and corporations angered by the site's publications have already sued wikileaks or blocked access to it, and the group fears that its money and infrastructure could be targeted further, founder julian assange said in an interview in london shortly after publishing 76,000 classified u.s. Documents about the war in afghanistan in july. The move sparked international controversy and put wikileaks in the spotlight. In response, the site has established a complex system for collecting and disbursing its donations to obscure their origin and use, mr. Assange said. Anchoring the system is a foundation in germany established in memory of a computer hacker who died in 2001. Wikileaks's financial stability has waxed and waned during its short history. The site shut down briefly late last year, citing a lack of funds, but mr. Assange said the group has raised about $ 1 million since the start of 2010. Wikileaks's lack of financial transparency stands in contrast to the total transparency it seeks from governments and corporations. \" it's very hard work to run an organization, let alone one that's constantly being spied upon and sued, \" mr. Assange said in the interview. \" judicial decisions can have an effect on an organization's operation. … we can't have our cash flow constrained entirely, \" he said.

Some governments and corporations angered by the site's publications have already sued wikileaks or blocked access to it, and the group fears that its money and infrastructure could be targeted further, founder julian assange said in an interview in london shortly after publishing 76,000 classified u.s. Documents about the war in afghanistan in july. The move sparked international controversy and put wikileaks in the spotlight. In response, the site has established a complex system for collecting and disbursing its donations to obscure their origin and use, mr. Assange said. Anchoring the system is a foundation in germany established in memory of a computer hacker who died in 2001. Wikileaks's financial stability has waxed and waned during its short history. The site shut down briefly late last year, citing a lack of funds, but mr. Assange said the group has raised about $ 1 million since the start of 2010. Wikileaks's lack of financial transparency stands in contrast to the total transparency it seeks from governments and corporations. \" it's very hard work to run an organization, let alone one that's constantly being spied upon and sued, \" mr. Assange said in the interview. \" judicial decisions can have an effect on an organization's operation. … we can't have our cash flow constrained entirely, \" he said. View full image associated press wikileaks founder assange in stockholm aug. 14 said the site would publish more afghan war documents. Among the cases wikileaks has faced, the swiss bank julius baer &amp; co. In 2008 sued for damages in federal court in california, alleging that the site had published stolen bank documents. The court ordered the disabling of the wikileaks.org domain name"

        "summary": "Sunday night's penultimate episode of season 7 of game of thrones took us \" beyond the wall \" and, per some critics, beyond the realm of believability. For those willing to load up on spoilers, read on for more on the action north and south of the wall and what it means. Relations between sansa and arya deteriorated even further, leading to a chilly and somewhat chilling encounter between the two in arya's room. While looking for a potentially damning scroll, sansa stumbles upon arya's bag and pulls out two faces. The verge looks at whose faces they may have originally been. Bowled over by the episode? at the atlantic, david sims has a lot of bones to pick with it. He brands it a \" fairly insulting episode, one that piled frustrating, illogical twists atop a plot ( jon snow's quest beyond the wall ) that already felt tenuous. \" as for the confrontation between the sisters, he sees arya's \" sudden irrationality... Just eye-rollingly one-dimensional. \" his fleshed out take is here. As for jon's improbable rescue by uncle benjen after being pulled into the icy waters by some wights, nina shen rastogi has a theory at vulture: \" i ' m going to guess that, just as the three-eyed raven once sent him to save bran and meera, bran himself sent benjen this time, but that doesn't make it read as any less ridiculous in the moment. \" she goes on to outline her own dissatisfaction with the arya-sansa plotline: \" i just don't buy it. \" at the new york times, jeremy egner highlights a thread: babies, and the talk about them. \" dany's supposed inability to have them, after the drogo reanimation fiasco in season 1, and jorah telling jon to keep the mormont sword for ' your children after you. ' by the end jon and dany looked pretty ready to give it a shot. \" sonia saraiya digs deep into their seemingly blossoming relationship at variety, writing, \" for some reason, watching jon and dany is like watching two teenagers who have just discovered the merits of staring into each other's eyes and calling each other ' babe. '... Mostly, they appear to be responding to a chemistry that the show hasn't done much to sell to the audience.... It's this type of inert character dynamic that makes an episode like ' beyond the wall ' feel sort of superficially magnificent and otherwise somewhat forgettable. \" but arguably unforgettable is its final moment, and viserion's icy blue eye as the",

        "summary": "The world wildlife fund has improved its methods of measuring the world's wildlife populations — and discovered that the situation is even worse than previously thought. In its living planet report, the numbers are stark: populations of vertebrate species — including mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles — fell by a staggering average of 52 % between 1970 and 2010, and the trend isn't slowing down. The population drop was 39 % among both terrestrial wildlife and marine wildlife, and 76 % among freshwater species, according to the report released in partnership with the zoological society of london. Researchers earlier estimated that around 30 % of the world's wildlife had been lost over the 40-year period. The report looked at more than 10,000 representative populations of wildlife species and found that habitat loss was causing the most damage, although the effects of climate change are becoming more apparent. \" we're gradually destroying our planet's ability to support our way of life, \" warns wwf chief carter roberts. \" but we already have the knowledge and tools to avoid the worst predictions. We all live on a finite planet and it's time we started acting within those limits. \" but the report wasn't unrelentingly bleak: the group was able to highlight a few successful conservation efforts, including growth in gorilla tourism in rwanda and moves away from slash-and-burn agriculture in brazil, the bbc reports.",

Nbc's katy tur broke the news on twitter. Cnn reports cohen was subpoenaed by the house intelligence committee two weeks ago and has agreed to testify by sept. 5. It's unclear exactly why mueller's investigation is interested in cohen, though he was mentioned in the trump dossier compiled by a former british spy, according to the washington post. The dossier claimed cohen traveled to prague to meet with russians to coordinate hacking efforts. Cohen has denied it, and trump called the dossier \" fake news. \" but cohen, a lawyer for the trump organization for a decade, did meet with a ukrainian lawmaker in january in new york and received a plan from a former trump associate that could have led to the lifting of russian sanctions. Cohen says he threw the plan away, but it's been reported he gave it to michael flynn. Cohen isn't the only one lawyering up. It was reported thursday that vice president pence hired outside legal counsel, and now a trump campaign senior communications adviser has also hired a lawyer.

One out of 20 people with such a clot die within 30 days of surgery. But in this case, doctors drilled pressure-releasing holes in the man's skull and allowed the blood to drain; he appeared to be fine at a two-month checkup.

( associated press ) philadelphia ( ap ) — a retired corporate executive said in a lawsuit that she spent $ 150,000 on a matchmaking service that set her up with a string of highly incompatible suitors, including men who were married, mentally unstable or felons. Darlene daggett, former president for u.s. Commerce for the west chester-based home shopping channel qvc, settled the lawsuit against corte madera, california-based kelleher international hours after it was filed in federal court last week, according to the philadelphia inquirer ( http://bit.ly/2vmkpoc ). Kelleher chief executive amber kelleher-andrews, a former actress who appeared on \" baywatch \" and \" melrose place, \" said in a statement to the newspaper that her company is responsible for thousands of marriages over the years. \" it doesn't always work out, \" kelleher-andrews told the newspaper. She said her company works to end courtships \" fairly and reasonably. \" according to the lawsuit, the 62-year-old daggett, a divorced mother of four, wanted someone to spend her retirement with, and she felt \" social dating sites did not provide her with the degree of screening and privacy she was looking for. \" she said she paid $ 150,000 for a \" ceo level \" membership with kelleher international that guaranteed her matches from around the globe but then endured a series of bad courtships that fell short of what the dating service promised. Her attorneys described one match as an australian entrepreneur who took daggett on trips to panama and costa rica. She said the man started a new trip around the world with his ex the same day she flew home from panama, something"

        "summary": "Air pollution has been linked to strokes, heart attacks, autism, and raised blood pressure. Now, scientists say it might also be responsible for alzheimer's disease. Scientists at lancaster university in the uk say they found an \" extraordinary \" amount of magnetite, an iron oxide toxic to the brain, in the brains of 37 people from mexico city and manchester, england — or millions of particles per gram of brain matter, to be precise. While scientists reported seeing small, crystal-shaped magnetite particles, which appear naturally in human brains, there were 100 times more magnetite particles \" from combustion sources, such as car exhausts, industrial processes and power stations, \" study author barbara maher tells the guardian. These particles appear larger and round, and scientists believe they enter the brain through the nose before spreading to areas affected by alzheimer's disease. Though this study didn't link magnetite to alzheimer's, a study published last year found long-term exposure to air pollution significantly increased one's risk of the disease. Magnetite has also been found in higher concentrations in the brains of alzheimer's patients, maher says. \" it's an unfortunately plausible risk factor, and it's worth taking precautions, \" she adds, per science. The brains examined also held platinum, cobalt, and nickel, which are found in car exhausts but don't occur naturally in the brain, reports new scientist. ( air pollution may also increase suicide risk. )",

The washington post reports a bill that would make the penalty for swatting — calling in false threats to prompt an armed law enforcement response on unsuspecting victims — up to 20 years in prison and heavy fines just survived a \" crucial \" vote by the house energy and commerce committee. The next stop for hr 2031 ( the anti-swatting act of 2015 ) is a floor vote in the house. One of the bill's sponsors, massachusetts rep. Katherine clark has, herself, been a victim of swatting — a \" frightening experience, \" she tells esquire, that was likely prompted by her support for anti-swatting legislation. In that case, someone called police saying there was an active shooter in her house. Though esquire says the fbi doesn't maintain swatting stats, a press release from clark cites an estimated 400 such incidents annually. While falsely phoning in bomb threats and terrorist attacks is currently a federal crime, making false reports of other emergency situations is not, and she wants to close that loophole. Online gamers, who often broadcast their gameplay in real time on the internet, are often the target of swatting, and at the post, brian fung observes that \" the swatting trend underscores how easy it is, in the internet age, for a harasser to dig up personal information belonging to their targets. \" it further puts a spotlight on \" the growing militarization of police forces...

        "summary": "A new study in nature offers what looks to be a genuine advance in the fight against alzheimer's, one that raises hopes for a preventative drug in the future. Researchers discovered that a particular gene mutation prevalent in icelanders slows the production of a substance called beta amyloid in the brain, reports the new york times. Excessive amounts of the substance have been linked to the disease, and the study found that elderly people with the anti-amyloid mutation are better protected, notes webmd. Drug companies have been working on amyloid remedies for a while, so far without success, but the discovery brings strong evidence that they're on the right track — especially if they can mimic the effects of the newly discovered mutation. The finding is \" extraordinarily important, \" says an alzheimer's expert at the mount sinai school of medicine, calling it the biggest breakthrough in more than 20 years. But \" for those already suffering, this will have little benefit in terms of new drugs soon, \" he adds.",

Discussed before and after tesla's autopilot vehicles hit the market — particularly after a florida man died in an autopilot crash in 2016 — options of adding a camera and infrared sensor to track eye movement and a steering wheel sensor to monitor hand placement were dismissed by executives over concerns about cost and ineffectiveness, the journal reports, citing people familiar with the discussions. \" it came down to cost, and elon was confident we wouldn't need it, \" one source is quoted as saying, though musk says ineffectiveness, not cost, was the deciding factor. \" wsj fails to mention that tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous, \" musk tweets. He also stressed the company's safety record when commenting on friday's crash of a tesla whose autopilot feature was engaged in utah, per usa today. Still, the journal stresses that general motors and volkswagen delayed rollouts of hands-free driving systems using eye-tracking technology over safety concerns, while musk plowed ahead with autopilot safeguards that can be fooled. Per the verge, drivers receive multiple warnings if they fail to move the steering wheel for extended periods before the autopilot feature shuts off. However, investigators previously found the driver touched the wheel for just 25 seconds of a 37-minute ride before the aforementioned crash in 2016.",

            "Long before the fatal crash of a tesla car in march, some developers of the vehicle's autopilot system expressed concern there weren't enough safeguards to ensure drivers remained attentive, people familiar with the discussions said. Tesla inc.'s engineers repeatedly discussed adding sensors that would ensure drivers look at the road or keep their hands on the wheel both before and after the driver-assistance system was introduced in 2015, these people said....",
            "Engineers inside tesla wanted to add robust driver monitoring systems to the company's cars to help make sure drivers safely use autopilot, and tesla even worked with suppliers on possible solutions, according to the wall street journal. But those executives — elon musk included — reportedly rejected the idea out of worry that the options might not work well enough, could be expensive, and because drivers might become annoyed by an overly nagging system. Tesla considered a few different types of monitoring: one that would track a driver's eyes using a camera and infrared sensors, and another that involved adding more sensors to the steering wheel to make sure that the driver is holding on. Both ideas would help let the car's system know if the driver has stopped paying attention, which could reduce the chance of an accident in situations where autopilot disengages or is incapable of keeping the car from crashing. Musk later confirmed on twitter that the eye tracking option was \"rejected for being ineffective, not for cost.",

            "Close the national transportation safety board is investigating a crash and fire involving a telsa model s car. Two teens died in fort lauderdale, florida crash on tuesday. The probe is not expected to involve tesla's semi-autonomous autopilot system. ( may 11 ) ap a tesla sedan with a semi-autonomous autopilot feature rear-ended a fire department truck at 60 mph ( 97 kph ) apparently without braking before impact on may 11, 2018, but police say it's unknown if the autopilot feature was engaged. ( photo: south jordan police department/ap ) san francisco — a tesla model s that crashed into a stopped fire truck at high speed was operating in autopilot mode, the driver of the car told utah police officials. Tesla says it continues to work with police on the investigation, and has not yet released details of the incident based on the car's computer logs. The driver of the vehicle, a 28-year-old woman from lehi, utah, slammed into the truck in south jordan, utah",
            "Long before the fatal crash of a tesla car in march, some developers of the vehicle's autopilot system expressed concern there weren't enough safeguards to ensure drivers remained attentive, people familiar with the discussions said. Tesla inc.'s engineers repeatedly discussed adding sensors that would ensure drivers look at the road or keep their hands on the wheel both before and after the driver-assistance system was introduced in 2015, these people said....",
            "Engineers inside tesla wanted to add robust driver monitoring systems to the company's cars to help make sure drivers safely use autopilot, and tesla even worked with suppliers on possible solutions, according to the wall street journal. But those executives — elon musk included — reportedly rejected the idea out of worry that the options might not work well enough, could be expensive, and because drivers might become annoyed by an overly nagging system. Tesla considered a few different types of monitoring: one that would track a driver's eyes using a camera and infrared sensors, and another that involved adding more sensors to the steering wheel to make sure that the driver is holding on. Both ideas would help let the car's system know if the driver has stopped paying attention, which could reduce the chance of an accident in situations where autopilot disengages or is incapable of keeping the car from crashing. Musk later confirmed on twitter that the eye tracking option was \"rejected for being ineffective, not for cost.",

Their only outside visits will be to medical clinics for ultrasounds and blood tests, the sydney morning herald reports. The tabbot foundation in australia is offering to assess women by phone and, provided they pass, send them do-it-yourself abortion kits with anti-nausea drugs, painkillers, prophylactic antibiotics, mifepristone, and misoprostol ( also called ru486 ) for $ 250. \" medical pregnancy termination through teleconference is one of the most appropriate medical conditions you can use this for because you don't have to examine the patient, \" says a tabbot spokesman. \" it will also mean women who might have felt intimidated going into an abortion clinic don't have to. \" psychological evaluations ( required in some aussie states ) will also be by phone, and a nurse will call a day later to check in. Tabbot also provides a 24-hour help line and follow-up blood tests. No word yet from abortion foes in australia, but their influence apparently played an inadvertent role in this: \" back in 2012, when these medications were approved... There was a lot of media that said, ' oh, every gp will be able to prescribe it, and it will only cost them $ 6, ' and that just hasn't happened, \" especially in rural areas, pro-choice advocate jenny eljak tells the brisbane times. Many doctors have avoided giving abortions, she says, \" because they know there's a significant backlash that will happen from opponents of abortion. \" tabbot's model is also a cheaper alternative to australian abortion clinics, says eljak. ( in a church shift, pope francis says priests can forgive women who have had abortions. )",

The bigger questions will be who finishes in the secondary spots in the gop — though john kasich has locked up second place — and how big sanders ' margin of victory will be. In incomplete returns, sanders had 59 % to hillary clinton's 40 %, while trump ( 34 % ) was followed by kasich ( 16 % ), ted cruz ( 12 % ), jeb bush ( 11 % ), marco rubio ( 10 % ), chris christie ( 8 % ), carly fiorina ( 4 % ), and ben carson ( 2 % ). While the wins by trump and sanders were predicted by recent polls, the new york times takes note of the bigger picture: these are victories by two relative \" outsiders \" who have \" rocked the political establishment. \" the washington post has a similar line of thought: the night is a \" remarkable victory for two outsiders who tapped into voter anger at the two parties ' establishments, each promising massive government actions to provide working people with an economic boost. \" after accepting a thunderous ovation from his supporters at his victory rally, sanders called his win \" nothing short of the beginning of a political revolution. \" trump, meanwhile, said, \" this is something very special, \" and told supporters that his late parents were looking down with pride. Clinton, for her part, called sanders to congratulate him as soon as the race was called. \" it's not whether you get knocked down that matters, \" she said at her rally. \" it's whether you get back up. \" a spokesman added that the nomination \" will very likely be won in march, not february, \" and predicted that clinton would roll up a \" potentially insurmountable \" lead next month, reports politico.",

Instead, katie malone ended up with her body shattered after a freak parasailing accident in mexico — but she and her family are thankful she's alive. Malone's brother brendan malone tells people his sister took off on what was meant to be a 10-minute parasailing ride in puerto vallarta in early june, but something soon went wrong. The boat pulling malone flipped and her parasailing line was severed, leaving her floating untethered, hundreds of feet up in the air. Brendan malone tells cnn his sister tried to steer the parasail, but she passed out about 20 minutes into the ordeal, which ended when she crash-landed 45 minutes after it all started at an airport about 2 miles away. Her dad tells the sun her last words before she passed out: \" please don't let me die, please don't let me be paralyzed. \" malone didn't die, but her brother says she did suffer a slew of serious injuries, including a broken pelvis, a handful of broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a gash to her forehead, per a gofundme he set up to help pay for her medical costs ( it's raised nearly $ 50,000 as of friday morning ). Malone spent nearly three weeks in a mexican hospital, then was transferred by plane back to the us to continue receiving treatment at a hospital in san diego, where she's from. Although brendan malone is staying mum on whether there will be legal action against the parasailing company, he tells people his family is \" beyond unhappy. \" \" those guys left the scene of the crime, \" he says. \" they flipped the boat back over and put it back in the ocean and bailed while my sister was floating away. \" still, he calls his sister \" a miracle, \" noting she's been upbeat, joking around \" and … is not giving up. \"",

Insiders tell politico that trump's transition team is working with republican leaders on a plan to sidestep the need for new legislation by asking congress to fund the wall under a george w. Bush-era law authorizing 700 miles of \" physical barrier. \" the sources say republicans are considering adding wall funding to a spending bill that must pass by the end of april. They believe democrats are unlikely to threaten a government shutdown to fight the move — especially since president obama and hillary clinton were among the senators that voted in favor of the 2006 law. Gop lawmakers declined to confirm to cnn whether trump is planning to use taxpayer dollars to build the wall, but trump himself had a response to the story. \" the dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall ( for sake of speed ), will be paid back by mexico later! \" he tweeted friday morning.

            "I participated in my first n.c.a.a. Tournament pool in 1992 when, as a 14-year-old, i correctly predicted sixth-seeded michigan to reach the final four. I don't particularly remember what went into the prediction, other than that the pool offered some ridiculous bonus for picking lower seeds — and also, since i grew up in east lansing, mich., i could be pretty sure that nobody else would be willing to go all-in on the team from ann arbor. I've never been asked to return the 75 \"units \" i took in for finishing first, despite the fact that michigan's fab five had to forfeit its wins for recruiting violations. This year, we've decided to do something a bit more scientific, analyzing the results for all tournament games since 2003 ( a total of 512 games ) and evaluating which factors best predicted success. Our forecast is here. The goal is to have a system that makes good statistical sense and also makes decent basketball sense, as opposed to identifying a bunch of spurious correlations. There's no da vinci code for winning the tournament; it's just a matter of playing good basketball. Let me give you an overview of the system; there's more elaboration down below for those interested in the gory details. The simple version — first, we create a power rating for each team. The power rating is an aggregation of four computer ratings and two human ratings, all of which have performed well at predicting tournament games in the past: objective ( computer ) ratings: a ) jeff sagarin \"predictor \" ratings; b ) ken pomeroy pythagorean ratings; c ) joel sokol lrmc rankings; d ) sonny moore power ratings. Human ratings: e ) tournament seeds; f ) the associated press preseason poll. ( the rationale for accounting for preseason expectations is explained here. ) — next, this power rating is adjusted based on three factors: injuries ( and other types of player absences like suspensions ), the geographic location of the game, and ( after the first round ) a team's performance in tournament games so far. — finally, by comparing two teams ' power ratings, we can estimate the likelihood that any team in the 68-team field will beat any other in any given game.

I don't particularly remember what went into the prediction, other than that the pool offered some ridiculous bonus for picking lower seeds — and also, since i grew up in east lansing, mich., i could be pretty sure that nobody else would be willing to go all-in on the team from ann arbor. I've never been asked to return the 75 \"units \" i took in for finishing first, despite the fact that michigan's fab five had to forfeit its wins for recruiting violations. This year, we've decided to do something a bit more scientific, analyzing the results for all tournament games since 2003 ( a total of 512 games ) and evaluating which factors best predicted success. Our forecast is here. The goal is to have a system that makes good statistical sense and also makes decent basketball sense, as opposed to identifying a bunch of spurious correlations. There's no da vinci code for winning the tournament; it's just a matter of playing good basketball. Let me give you an overview of the system; there's more elaboration down below for those interested in the gory details. The simple version — first, we create a power rating for each team. The power rating is an aggregation of four computer ratings and two human ratings, all of which have performed well at predicting tournament games in the past: objective ( computer ) ratings: a ) jeff sagarin \"predictor \" ratings; b ) ken pomeroy pythagorean ratings; c ) joel sokol lrmc rankings; d ) sonny moore power ratings. Human ratings: e ) tournament seeds; f ) the associated press preseason poll. ( the rationale for accounting for preseason expectations is explained here. ) — next, this power rating is adjusted based on three factors: injuries ( and other types of player absences like suspensions ), the geographic location of the game, and ( after the first round ) a team's performance in tournament games so far. — finally, by comparing two teams ' power ratings, we can estimate the likelihood that any team in the 68-team field will beat any other in any given game.

Finally, in the early 20th century, an expedition led by roald amundsen prevailed. Now, more than 100 years after that, the cruise ship crystal serenity will transport 1,700 passengers and crew through the \" previously all-but-impenetrable \" passage, discovery news reports. While there have been more than 200 transits through the passage by now, nothing on the scale of a cruise ship has made the trip. But because of climate change, the thickness and extent of the ice is decreasing, opening the passage to cruise-goers willing to pay up to about $ 100,000, reports the telegraph. Demand is so high that the company is booking for 2017 as well. The crystal serenity sets off aug. 16, and the trip from seward, alaska, to new york is expected to take about a month. Not everyone is thrilled. \" the melting of the arctic sea ice should be a profound warning for humankind, not an invitation to oil companies and now tour ships to move in, \" says john sauven of greenpeace. The ship promises to travel at a low speed and will be accompanied by an escort vessel stocked with oil cleanup equipment. Passengers will not be allowed to use cell phones on the tiny network used by local inuit communities. But they will have the opportunity to spot polar bears and whales, as well as hitch helicopter rides, and play golf all night in ulukhatok, home to the northernmost 9-hole golf course in the world.

Little did they know they're twin sisters — and they were reunited for the first time since they were babies wednesday on good morning america. It all started when audrey asked her parents for a sister for christmas. Her mom, jennifer, says she wanted to give her 10-year-old daughter information about her history as a christmas present, so she got in touch with a chinese researcher for help digging into audrey's past. That's when she found, for the first time, a picture of a woman — audrey's chinese foster mother — holding audrey on one knee... And another, identical baby on the other. \" as soon as i had that picture, i was desperate to find out... Who that other child was, \" jennifer doering says. After more research led her to confirm the other baby was her daughter's twin sister, doering found the girl's adoptive family with the help of social media. The doerings, of wisconsin, and the rainsberrys, of washington state, connected and found out the twins have similarities big ( both had heart conditions that required surgery after they came to the us ) and small ( both love chicken alfredo and sports, and they share some of the same mannerisms ). They video chatted after discovering one another about a month ago, the wausau daily herald reports, but they hadn't met in person until they came on gma for the emotional reunion, which saw both girls break down in tears as they hugged. \" it felt like there was somebody missing, \" says audrey. \" now, it's complete. \" the show presented the girls with travel vouchers so they can continue to see each other.

Iranian negotiator mohammad javed zarif touted the possibility of a breakthrough, while a senior obama administration official said that they see \" the outlines of a first step, \" the new york times reports. Here are the stories about the talks today: the us wants iran to freeze its nuclear activities, perhaps for six months, and negotiate a broader deal in the interim. In exchange, iran would get some limited, temporary sanction relief. Exact details are hazy, but the five other negotiating nations have signed off on the plan, the washington post reports. This entire rapprochement with iran kicked into high gear following a much-touted phone call from president rouhani to president obama. But the fateful call wasn't as spontaneous as it was made out to be, the wall street journal revealed today. Obama had been quietly reaching out to tehran for months, sources say. The administration hosted a series of secret meetings and calls with iranian exiles and arab monarchs, and gave iranian expert puneet talwar free rein to converse with iran. Susan rice was also enlisted to talk with iran's un ambassador. Not everyone's thrilled about the thaw. Countries like israel and saudi arabia have been making their displeasure known. \" on a good day, we're paranoid about iran, \" one senior arab official says.

From chronic pain and injured organs to painful intercourse and an inability to work, they're part of what one australian politician is calling the country's \" biggest medical scandal, \" reports news.com.au. Johnson &amp; johnson, the makers of the device surgically implanted to help treat problems common after childbirth, such as pelvic prolapse, maintains that these women represent only a \" small minority \" of patients, per the evening standard. However, published internal emails between doctors and j&j reveal the extent of the reported devastation on women's bodies, and doctors ' attitudes toward them. In one email posted by the australian broadcasting corporation, a french gynecologist wrote anal sex would be a \" good alternative \" for women in too much pain for intercourse. \" i said to myself, there you go, for your next prolapse [ patient ], you talk to her about... Fellatio, sodomy, the clitoris with or without g-spot, etc., \" one wrote. \" i am sure of one thing: that i would very quickly be treated like some kind of sex maniac ( which, perhaps, i am ) or a pervert, or an unhealthily curious person. \" women in the suit say they've heard similar lines from their doctors and call the advice \" despicable \" and \" appalling, \" per the guardian. One woman asks how a medical practitioner could \" be so thoughtless and arrogant as to suggest that anal sex is an adequate solution to sexual dysfunction. \" meanwhile, in the us, more than 120,000 suits are pending. ( a court ruled sex is still important for women over 50. )",

As part of a transit and highway funding bill currently being negotiated in congress, the provision would allow the feds to revoke, deny, or limit a person's passport if he or she owes more than $ 50,000 in \" seriously delinquent tax debt \" ( including interest and penalties ), cnnmoney reports. Only people against whom the irs has filed a lien or levy would be subject to lose their passport under the provision, which will take effect jan. 1 if it passes, and the state department could issue exceptions for individuals contesting the tax bill or working with the irs ( e.g., setting up an installment plan ), as well as for those traveling for humanitarian or emergency purposes. The joint committee on taxation estimates the provision will raise nearly $ 400 million over 10 years, the wall street journal reports. Although it may seem odd to tie important travel documents to a beef with the taxman, forbes compares it to having a pile of unpaid parking tickets and not being able to register a car or renew a driver's license. An la attorney who thinks the measure is too harsh tells cnn that $ 50,000 can build up quickly and that there may still be holdups as higher-ups deem whether a situation qualifies as an emergency, for example. For americans living overseas, a new foreign tax act could complicate matters further. A lawyer who advises a us expatriate group tells the journal that \" americans abroad need their passports for many routine activities of daily life, such as banking, registering in a hotel, or registering a child for school, and mistakes could be disastrous. \" a dc accounting firm partner agrees, noting if the measure passes, \" it will be imperative for americans traveling … or living abroad to pay attention to irs notices — assuming they receive them. \"",

He already had to use some of his winnings to pay back child support, and now he's now battling his ex-girlfriend in court over the rest of the money, the ap reports. Quezada's lawyers say that, since he was never married to inez sanchez, she shouldn't get any of the winnings, and that he bought the ticket on his own. But her lawyers say the couple lived together for a decade, had a child together, shared ownership of the bodega, that they played the lottery together, and that quezada bought the ticket based on their shared income. On friday, a judge refused sanchez's request to freeze quezada's assets, the record reports. But she also refused to dismiss the lawsuit, and a trial will decide the outcome. Sanchez moved out of the new jersey home quezada purchased with $ 300,000 of his winnings, and has filed a domestic violence claim against him. Her attorneys say quezada has spent much of the $ 152 million lump sum payment, and that $ 20 million of it can't be located. Readers with good memories may recall the odd way quezada informed then-girlfriend sanchez that he had won.",

Several people were pulled alive from vehicles trapped in a jumble of concrete debris and steel girders. Authorities believe more than 30 cars and three heavy vehicles were on the bridge when it collapsed amid a sudden storm and torrential rain. One survivor says he managed to slam on his brakes and stop just a few feet short of the 150-foot drop. \" i ' m alive by a miracle.

Copeland is refusing to take pain... ( associated press ) a georgia woman fighting a flesh-eating disease is refusing to take pain medications during some procedures, partly because of her personal convictions, her father said. Aimee copeland despises the use of morphine in her treatment, despite its effectiveness at blocking her pain, her father said in a friday online update on his daughter's condition. Her graduate-school study of holistic pain management techniques leads her to feel she's a \" traitor to her convictions \" when she uses drugs to manage her pain, andy copeland said. He also said the morphine has been making his daughter groggy, confused and has given her unpleasant hallucinatory episodes.

Nelson had been a democratic survivor as the gop ascended into power, hewing to a more moderate tone even as newcomers such as democratic candidate for governor andrew gillum tried to push the party in a more liberal direction. Scott charged into the race last april at the urging of president donald trump and spent more than $ 60 million of his own money on a series of ads that hammered nelson as out-of-touch and ineffective. The campaign waged between the two men was more about character, competence, and their loyalty to trump even though scott was placed on the defensive about his record on the environment and health care. The weeks leading up to the election were bitter, and it remained that way after it became clear that the race between nelson and scott would head to a legally required recount. Scott held a press conference at the governor's mansion suggesting that fraud may be going on in several democratic-controlled counties. ( read about scott's lawsuit in the florida race. )",

        "summary": "The election results in france are now final, confirming the political earthquake that has just taken place: centrist emmanuel macron took 23.8 % of votes in the first round, with 21.5 % for far-right candidate marine le pen, the bbc reports. The two candidates will compete for the presidency in a runoff election may 7 — and for the first time, neither contender is from one of the country's main parties. Conservative francois fillon will miss the runoff after getting 19.9 %. Far-left candidate jean-luc mélenchon got 19.6 %, while benoit hamon from the ruling socialist party got just 6.4 %. A roundup of coverage: reuters reports that macron's pro-business, pro-european union positions made him the favored candidate of financial markets, and they reacted with sharp gains early monday, sending the euro to its highest point against the dollar this year. The wall street journal reports that polls suggest that macron will easily win the second-round vote — but it could be complicated by the fact that almost 50 % of voters supported anti-eu candidates. The guardian describes the result as \" a humiliation for modern french party politics of left and right, \" with macron's first-place finish a sign of hope that he will prevail over le pen's national front party, which represents \" bigotry, hatred, and nationalism of the worst kind. \" the bbc reports that macron, who stepped down as the ruling party's economics minister to form his own en marche party, has promised to cut corporation tax and step up the move to renewable energy. Le pen has promised to hold a referendum on the eu, cut immigration, and close \" extremist \" mosques. Unlike her rival, she has promised to protect the 35-hour work week. The ap reports that mainstream parties are urging voters to support macron, though mélenchon has yet to do so, and the national front says it believes it can win the support of some of his voters. \" the voters who voted for mr. Mélenchon are angry voters. They can be in agreement with us, \" says a party official. Don't expect a brexit or trump-style surprise in france, nate silver writes at fivethirtyeight. He notes that polls give macron a 26-point lead, much bigger than anything seen before the brexit and trump votes. \" she could beat her polls by as much as trump and brexit combined and still lose to macron by almost 20 points, \" he writes. Vanity fair predicts \" two weeks of hell \" ahead during campaigning in france as le pen tries to \" stoke fear and division \" to boost her chances.",

            "Instead of loosening its grip, the existing government appeared to be consolidating its power: the prime minister said police forces were returning to the streets, and an army general urged protesters to scale back their occupation of tahrir square. Protesters interpreted the simultaneous moves by the western leaders and mr. Suleiman as a rebuff to their demands for an end to the dictatorship led for almost three decades by mr. Mubarak, a pivotal american ally and pillar of the existing order in the middle east. Just days after president obama demanded publicly that change in egypt must begin right away, many in the streets accused the obama administration of sacrificing concrete steps toward genuine change in favor of a familiar stability. \"america doesn't understand, \" said ibrahim mustafa, 42, who was waiting to enter tahrir square. \"the people know it is supporting an illegitimate regime. \" leaders of the egyptian opposition and rank-and-file protesters have steadfastly rejected any negotiations with mr. Suleiman until after the ouster of mr. Mubarak, arguing that moving toward democracy will require ridding the country of not only its dictator but also his rubber-stamp parliament and a constitution designed for one-party rule. On saturday, mr. Mubarak's party announced a shake-up that removed its old guard, including his son gamal, from the party's leadership while installing younger, more reform-minded figures. But such"

The 10th circuit court of appeals overturned a 2013 ruling that effectively decriminalized polygamy by removing penalties for married people cohabiting with other adults who are treated as spouses, the deseret news reports. The ruling came as part of a lawsuit brought by sister wives reality show star kody brown and his polygamous family, who moved from utah to nevada to avoid possible prosecution. The court didn't address the constitutional issues the brown lawsuit raised, but instead declared that the original lawsuit should have been tossed out years ago, reports the salt lake tribune. The court decided, confusingly, that since the browns and similar families were highly unlikely to be penalized, the penalties should stay in place, the ap reports. Utah declared years ago that polygamous families would not be prosecuted in the absence of crimes like coercion or fraud, but officials want to keep the law on the books to help prosecute people like warren jeffs. With families that are otherwise law-abiding, \" we want them to come out of any shadows to report crimes, avoid abuse, and continue to live peaceful and productive lives, \" utah attorney general sean reyes says. \" we have worked with them in the past to those ends.

        "summary": "Astronomers just proved the great albert einstein wrong — by proving him right. Einstein's 1915 theory of relativity says gravity can distort light and alter its path. National geographic reports einstein posited that would create a phenomenon called gravitational microlensing between two stars appearing to pass in front of each other. The light from the star in the background would be bent by the gravity of the star in the foreground, according to the los angeles times. \" of course, there is no hope of observing this phenomenon directly, \" einstein wrote for science in 1936. Guess again, einstein. Astronomers using nasa's hubble space telescope observed that very phenomena, publishing their findings in science on wednesday. Astronomers had observed gravitational microlensing in the past using entire galaxies or the sun, but never with individual distant stars, which are comparatively microscopic in size. The leader of the team that proved einstein right/wrong says observing the phenomena with distant stars is like trying to see a firefly moving across a quarter from 1,500 miles away while a bright light bulb is glaring next to it. So, it's understandable einstein was doubtful it would ever be seen. The observation allowed astronomers to measure the mass of a white dwarf star — about 68 % that of the sun — and confirm an 87-year-old theory about the stars, according to a press release. \" einstein would be proud, \" one astronomer says. ( a 40-year-old signal from space has finally been explained. )",

Hamid karzai today presented the deal to the loya jirga, afghanistan's grand council of elders, urging them to accept it — which, the ap points out, represents a huge about-face for the afghan president, who had promised to leave the us'status up to the new president afghanistan will elect in april. But karzai did say today that the actual signing should occur after the vote. In hopes of winning over the council, president obama sent a letter vowing to respect \" afghan sovereignty \" and to raid afghan homes only under \" extraordinary circumstances. \" but the us will retain the power to conduct those raids, and its troops will be immune from afghan prosecution, two key concessions that the us wasn't able to secure in similar negotiations with iraq back in 2011, the new york times points out. Nor will obama have to apologize for american military missteps, as one karzai aide insisted he should.

A senior member of mugabe's ruling zanu-pf party says the motion to impeach the president will be presented to parliament on tuesday and that mugabe could be removed from power as early as wednesday, the bbc reports. The main charge? that mugabe allowed his wife, grace, to \" usurp constitutional power \" when he fired his vice president, emmerson mnangagwa, two weeks ago, a move seen by many as an attempt to position his wife to be the next president. The military seized mugabe last week and has been holding him under house arrest ever since, though it insists the action isn't a coup. On sunday, zanu-pf leaders told mugabe to resign or face impeachment. In addition to the charges related to his wife, mugabe's critics in the parliament say he deserves to be impeached for refusing to \" implement the constitution \" and for being a \" stubborn man \" of \" advanced age \" who refuses to listen to the \" voices of his people. \" cnn reports that mnangagwa, who has been out of the country since being ousted by mugabe, will return to zimbabwe soon to meet with the president.

In 2017, there were 218,710 reported cases of chlamydia, the highest number since 1990, representing a 9 % increase over 2016. There were another 75,450 cases of gonorrhea, the highest number since 1988 and a 16 % increase over 2016, and 13,605 cases of syphilis, the highest in 30 years and a 20 % increase over 2016, according to a report by the california department of public health. \" we've been seeing increases for all three diseases for the last five or six years, \" department rep james watt tells the san francisco chronicle, though particularly concerning is a 30 % increase in stillbirths caused by congenital syphilis. There were 30 in 2017, california's highest number since 1995. \" for california to have a steady increase in congenital syphilis is shameful, \" ucla professor jeffrey klausner tells the ap, noting cuba and thailand have almost eliminated the condition. He points to the \" decimation \" of public health infrastructure, including the closure of clinics and sex education programs, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Watt agrees that's one factor. But \" the internet allows for a broadening of sexual networks, and the broader that gets the more opportunity you have for sexually transmitted diseases to spread, \" he says. Other stats: african-americans had rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea five times higher than whites; chlamydia rates were 60 % higher among females than males, while males had twice as many gonorrhea cases.

Those are among the media takeaways from saturday night's democratic debate at st. Anselm college in goffstown, new hampshire, between clinton, bernie sanders, and martin o ' malley: clinton's \" above-the-fray posture in the debate \" revealed her confidence that \" neither of her democratic rivals would prove a significant obstacle, \" the new york times reports. By targeting donald trump, the wall street journal says, she \" sought to cast herself as the likely nominee, playing down any threat posed by mr. Sanders ' upstart campaign. \" clinton accused trump of \" becoming isis's best recruiter, \" saying the militant group is \" showing videos of donald trump insulting islam and muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists. \" but as the ap points out, her campaign hasn't shown evidence of specific videos being used that way. For his part, sanders apologized to clinton for his campaign having taken information about her supporters. He also offered a way to get middle eastern countries to help fight isis: \" tell qatar, instead of spending $ 200 billion on the world cup, maybe they should pay attention to isis, which is on their doorstep, \" slate quotes him as saying. O ' malley \" sought to promote himself as the technocratic voice of a new generation, \" writes john cassidy at the new yorker. \" occasionally, however, he overdid the youthful bit: after all, at the age of fifty-two, he is hardly a stripling. \" oh, and clinton returned late from a commercial break with the debate already underway. \" sorry, \" she said with a smile.

Södersjukhuset hospital says it will begin admitting men and boys to an emergency rape clinic in october, reports the bbc. A 2014 study found men were often unclear on where to get help after a sex assault. About 370 cases of male rape were reported in sweden last year, though the actual number is probably higher, experts say. The subject remains \" extremely taboo \" and \" the general perception is that men cannot be raped, \" says a physician at the hospital, per the local. However, \" in studies, the health effects are shown to be greater for men, both in terms of physical health and mental health. \" male victims, for example, have a higher risk of ptsd, and as they are more likely to be raped by other men, may encounter \" sexual identity \" issues, the doctor says. The hospital already operates a 24-hour emergency clinic for female victims, accepting 600 to 700 patients each year. In 2011, 29,000 swedish women said they were raped, though just 6,620 reported the crime to police. A report from the gatestone institute earlier this year dubbed sweden the \" rape capital of the west, \" noting it ranked only second to lesotho in southern africa in terms of its rape rate per 100,000 people, which was 53.2 in 2010. The local cautions, however, that sweden counts its rapes more aggressively than some countries: for instance, if a person is raped daily for a week, it's logged as 7 crimes; in many other countries, it would be reported as one crime. Still, during a visit last month, india's women's minister said india's rape problem paled in comparison to sweden's, the local reported. ( read one man's account of his rape. )",

        "summary": "Given the popularity shambling corpses enjoy these days, it was only a matter of time before we got warm bodies, an honest-to-goodness zombie romantic comedy, in which a member of the living dead ( \" r \" ) falls for a still-breathing girl ( \" julie, \" get it? ). And believe it or not, most critics actually think it's kind of sweet. Here's what they're saying: \" i kinda love this movie, \" confesses richard roeper at the chicago sun-times. \" a lot of zombie movies have heart — but usually the heart ends up on someone's plate. \" not this time. Warm bodies had \" the, um, guts to be unabashedly romantic and unapologetically optimistic. \" its look inside the mind of one of the undead makes for \" a bloody fresh twist on the most popular horror genre of this century. \" \" i don't know if the first zombie date flick is a step forward or backward for civilization as a whole, \" quips ty burr at the boston globe, but this is an enjoyable flick anyway. \" the humor's there, and the insights, such as they are, are tart. \" and despite the obvious parallels, bodies ' protagonists \" are too sharp to be anybody's edward and bella. \" \" warm bodies is cute and amusing enough to catch on cable one day, \" writes manohla dargis at the new york times. You've seen this plot: \" zombie meets girl. Zombie loses girl. Zombie — well, you know the rest, \" and the action scenes are familiar \" off-the-shelf \" stuff, but it's a \" sweet relief from the apocalyptic freakout \" of the walking dead. But kyle smith at the new york post can't help picking nits in the movie's ragged logic, and wasn't charmed by the plot. \" could opposites attract? could love save the world? could this script be any more trite? \" he writes. \" i can hear the 14-year-olds:'shut up! can't you see how beautiful r and julie's love is?'despite the loads of my-soul-is-abloom emo on the soundtrack, no. \"",

In the 70 years since the city was secretly built around the mayak nuclear plant, its residents have been victims of nuclear accidents; waste from the nuclear plant is dumped into local lakes and rivers. \" the rate of cancer is enormous and their kids are born with cancer, \" samira goetschel, who made the documentary city 40, told vice in may. \" they die with cancer.

Republican sources tell the new york times that some candidates, fearing that a trump collapse could cost them the election, and even cost the party control of the house and senate, have decided to wait until this sunday's second debate to decide whether to abandon the candidate. Polls show that independent voters have been pulling away from trump, whose unpopularity could prove to be the deciding factor in tight races nationwide. Some republicans, including major donors, say they have already given up hope that trump will win the election and are now hoping he can pull off a \" lose-close \" strategy, holding clinton to a narrow win and not pulling other republican candidates down with him. For now, trump's best remaining hopes of victory appear to be in the west, where he has been campaigning this week, politico reports. \" the path to 270 goes through all the same states as it did in 2012 and 2008, \" says katie packer, mitt romney's deputy campaign chief in 2012. \" michigan, wisconsin, and pennsylvania aren't really even swing states.

A survivor of the 2015 church massacre in charleston, sc, testified on the first day of the trial about watching her son die and, during her testimony, referred to roof as \" evil \" and said he belongs in the \" pit of hell. \" the defense team argued those remarks were inappropriate, the ap reports. But the judge ruled the comments were not unduly prejudicial, the post and courier reports. The defense team argued that the testimony seemed to suggest a sentence for roof before guilt had been established, so the judge said that while he would not strike the testimony from the record, he would \" instruct the jury that the sentencing decision is always theirs and not the responsibility of any of the parties or any of the witnesses. \" the defense team also revealed that after wednesday's opening statements, roof's mother was taken to the hospital and treated for a heart attack.",

        "summary": "Bill o'reilly may be gone from fox, but he's got a rich severance package to ease any pangs. Brian stelter of cnn reports that the network will pay him \" tens of millions \" under the exit terms of a lucrative contract he had just signed in march. The exact amount is unknown, but regulatory filings could provide details in the next few months. Variety is more specific, pegging the buyout at $ 20 million to $ 25 million. Here's a look at other coverage of the former cable ratings king: one thing is clear: the ouster of o'reilly means that fox news is now being run by james murdoch, not his father, rupert, writes michael wolff at the hollywood reporter. \" and, most immediately, this means that fox news, that constant irritant in james ' view of himself as a progressive and visionary television executive, will begin to change. Virtually overnight. \" so what's next for o'reilly? given that he had 4 million nightly viewers, some kind of subscription-based streaming service, free of advertisers, is a possibility. The los angeles times notes, however, that it's not clear whether his core audience of older white males would follow to an internet service. The speaking circuit or a commentary role on regular tv also are possibilities. Adds alan wolk at slate: \" critics of o'reilly are cheering the end of his cable news dominance. But given the possibilities, he ' ll only really disappear if he wants to do so. \" a big question for fox is whether o'reilly's fans were loyal to him or the network. Media writer jim rutenberg explores the question in the new york times, noting that breitbart news is a potential alternative for those looking to jump ship. Quartz suggests that a pending $ 15 billion takeover of sky news by the murdoch family, which controls 21st century fox, may have played a role in the decision to fire o'reilly. British regulators must sign off on the deal, and the move clears away a potential ethical roadblock. Tucker carlson, 47, co-founder of the conservative daily caller, is taking over o'reilly's 8pm time slot following his successful replacement of megyn kelly in the 9pm hour, notes the wall street journal. The new yorker takes a look, with kelefa sanneh writing that \" there are few forces on television more powerful than tucker carlson's skepticism. \" this is the new york times investigation from april 1 that led to o'reilly's departure, detailing his multiple settlements in sexual",

Thirty-seven people were rescued after the sinking thursday afternoon, mwanza regional commissioner john mongella told the ap. \" i cannot speculate \" how many people had been on board, he said. \" right now our focus is on rescue. \" such ferries often carry hundreds of people and are overcrowded. The tanzania electrical, mechanical and electronics services agency, in charge of servicing the vessels, urged patience in a statement as rescue efforts began. The ferry was traveling between ukara and bugolora and capsized near the area of mwanza, the agency said. Accidents are often reported on the large freshwater lake surrounded by tanzania, kenya and uganda. Some of the deadliest have occurred in tanzania, where passenger boats are often said to be old and in poor condition. In 1996, more than 800 people were killed when the passenger and cargo ferry mv bukoba sank on lake victoria. Nearly 200 people died in 2011 when the mv spice islander i sank off tanzania's indian ocean coast near zanzibar.

The show features rehm's interviews with newsmakers, authors, and artists — us presidents clinton and obama, as well as toni morrison, are among past guests, notes the washington post — and covers everything from \" iraq and the us economy to the art of landscape design and james joyce's ulysses, \" per the show website. One reason she's retiring: she's just tired. \" i ' m perfectly happy doing something different … where i ' m not forced to get up at 5am every morning to prepare for a show, \" she tells the post. \" i've been doing that for 37 years. \" the two-hour program produced by dc's wamu radio station has aired since 1979 and is now broadcast on 197 stations, with more than 2.4 million listeners weekly, per the post. Her ascension on the airwaves surprised even rehm, previously a secretary and stay-at-home mom with no college education who first showed up at the station as a volunteer. \" i never thought i'd have a career of any kind, much less a career in radio, \" she told the post a few years back. Another reason for her departure: the death of her husband, john, last year from parkinson's, an event that motivated her to become a right-to-die advocate. Rehm also has a memoir coming out and is pondering options including a speaker series or podcast. As for her immediate aspirations: \" maybe i ' ll get to sleep until 7 or 7: 30am, like other people do, \" she tells the post. ( read about rehm's right-to-die efforts. )",
