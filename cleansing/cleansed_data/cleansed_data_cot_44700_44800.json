        "summary": "A serbian man is being hailed as a hero after killing — accidentally — a shark that had been terrorizing an egyptian resort town. Dragan stevic was black-out drunk when he vanquished the predator that has killed one beachgoer and injured four. He went with friends to the beach after a long night of drinking, announced that he would take a jump off a diving board, and the rest is history, the macedonian international news agency reports. \" dragan climbed on the jumping board, told me to hold his beer, and simply ran to jump. There was no time for me to react or to try to stop him, he just went for it, \" a friend who was there explained. As luck would have it, stevic landed right on the shark's head — it had likely been lurking in the shallow waters waiting for a new victim — killing it instantly. When he returned to his friends, he complained that he had twisted his ankle because the water \" wasn't soft. \" the kicker: stevic is currently in the hospital... For alcohol poisoning. ( update: apparently you can make up stories about drunken serbs fatally whacking tourist-eating sharks: this story originated on a site described as the \"serbian onion, \" and it turns out the macedonian international news agency has had some factual issues in the past. But we wish it was true. )",

            "Dragan stevic of serbia is the new egyptian hero who killed a large shark which had previously terrorized numerous tourists ( injured 4 and killed 1 ) at the famous egyptian resort sarm el sheikh. The serbian hero was too drunk to remember what had happened, though one of his friends who witnessed the incident explained it all for the belgrade based media. Dragan stevic was dubbed by the egyptian media as \" shark el sheikh \" and thanked him for saving their tourist season. Milovan ubirapa, one of stevic's friend who witnessed the incident explained that dragan had decided to go to the beach for a swim after a long night of drinking.

Dragan had nailed it right in the head, killing it instantly. The egyptian police found the shark washed out on the beach that morning. Dragan was able to swim to the shore and told his friends he had twisted his ankle, telling them the water was not that soft. The water is soft buddy, you just landed on a shark. At the moment, the fearless hero is in a hospital recovering from alcohol poisoning.

For more than 300 years it carried on with the name tsaritsyn, but after it became home to one of history's deadliest battles — 2 million lives were lost when the nazis tried to advance into the soviet union during world war ii — then-soviet leader joseph stalin decided to name it after himself. That lasted 26 years, at which point stalin's successor, nikita khruschev, renamed the city volgograd in an attempt to diminish the former dictator's posthumous reach. As if the saga wasn't confusing enough, as of last year the city began changing its name to stalingrad some six times a year, the moscow times points out. Now, a 365-day change could be in reach. In response to an inquiry from a wwii vet on friday, russian president vladimir putin suggested a referendum be held over the question of the city's name. The guardian reports he promised to help the city see such a referendum take place, but rt notes that his press secretary today insisted that putin wasn't coming out in support of the former name, but establishing that there's a \" procedure \" for arriving at such a decision. Only problem is, the locals don't appear to want the name change, at least according to a poll cited by the guardian that found roughly 75 % against it.

The issue was brought up by a group of russian wwii veterans who met with president vladimir putin in deauville, france, as part of the international d-day celebrations. One of the elderly veterans asked if it was possible to rename the city of volgograd back to stalingrad. Putin replied that the law says such questions need to be decided at the regional and municipal level. \"in this case the city residents must hold a referendum and make a joint decision. We will do what the people say, \" the russian leader said. The veterans are eager to go to volgograd and as part of the campaign.

Now the city may become stalingrad once again after president vladimir putin proposed holding a referendum to change the name amid a wave of second world war patriotism over eastern ukraine. When asked by a soviet veteran during d-day commemorations in normandy on friday, putin promised to help the city's residents vote on bringing back the stalingrad name. \" it wasn't me who canceled that, \" putin told the veterans.

As bloomberg reports, plenty of people have done just that, making his mypillow company wildly successful. Consider that he opened a second factory last year and saw sales jump from $ 115 million to $ 280 million. He now employs 1,500 people and has sold more than 26 million pillows, which he insists, to anyone who will listen, are the best ever made. But what makes lindell's success story so compelling is what the bloomberg piece calls the \" preposterous \" nature of it: lindell, for instance, is a former drug addict who loves to tell the story of how his crack dealer probably saved his life in 2008 by cutting him off after a 19-day binge and ordering him to go to bed. For years, lindell owned bars and maintained a steady cocaine habit, and the idea to begin making pillows came to him as a kind of vision that found him sketching the company logo over and over before the company even existed. He experimented with various types of foam and ways to manipulate it, and saw his first success hawking pillows at a home and garden show in minneapolis. Since then, it's been nothing but strong growth over the last decade or so, despite, or because of, a management style that involves \" governing largely on instinct and by making seemingly wild gambles that he swears are divinely inspired, \" writes josh dean. \"we don't use powerpoints, \" says lindell. \"i end up getting stuff in prayer. \" click for the full story, which notes that he and pal stephen baldwin plan to turn his story into a movie.",

You can \" pin \" a live tile of a friend, for instance and see their facebook or twitter activity, cnet reports. \" the ios6 home screen is really just a sea of static icons, \" windows phone manager joe belfiore said. \" it's not people; it's not live data. \" microsoft also boasted about its growing apps catalog, which it says now contains 120,000 programs, the wall street journal reports — while noting that it's a far cry from the 700,000 or so android and ios apps. They also touted the tight integration between windows phone and microsoft's other products. \" if you're one of the hundreds of millions of people who will use windows 8, there is no better phone for you, \" steve ballmer said. Initial phones will include the htc windows phone 8x, and the nokia lumia. Versions of both will be available from verizon, at&t, and t-mobile, for prices ranging from $ 99.99 to $ 199.99.",

        "summary": "Sarah and mark hall ( names changed ) love their 3-year-old daughter, ellie. Yet they recently sued for \" wrongful birth, \" testifying that they would have aborted the pregnancy had they known ellie would be born with a rare genetic disorder. People who file such lawsuits are often vilified, elizabeth picciuto explains in the daily beast, but they may have no other choice. In the halls ' case, they knew their daughter was at risk for one of two rare disorders, so sarah had an amniocentesis at 16 weeks. Someone from the obstetrician's office misread the results, and told the halls that ellie would be a carrier, but not symptomatic. Instead, she was born with a rare disorder picciuto will only refer to as \" syndrome z. \" in cases like this, couples are left with few options — and in the halls ' case, their only option was to sue for wrongful birth. The healthcare worker didn't cause ellie's disorder, so in order to win a lawsuit against the provider, the halls had to prove the error caused harm — that is, they would not have proceeded with the pregnancy had they known the truth, and their lives have been adversely affected since they did proceed. As one expert notes, plaintiffs in other medical malpractice cases don't face quite the same burden; in most cases, all that matters is what a \" reasonable person \" would have done had they received the correct diagnosis, not what the specific plaintiff would have done. Because of the controversy surrounding wrongful birth lawsuits, they're difficult to win, one medical malpractice defense attorney says, adding that juries frequently say they disapproved of the parents in such cases — perhaps not understanding that the parents had no other path to compensation. \" who wants to say ' i wish this child wasn't here '? \" muses sarah. In their case, the obstetrician's office admitted the mistake and will settle. Another couple recently filed a wrongful birth lawsuit in chicago, the sun-times reports, claiming they were told their son's ultrasound showed no \" fetal abnormalities, \" but he was born with dwarfism.

Floodwaters have eaten away the riverbank in recent days and the 16th-century castle is now teetering on the edge, discovery reports. John gordon, the baron of abergeldie, was forced to flee his ancestral home over the weekend after the river burst its banks and took with it nearly 60 feet of land, leaving the castle just a few feet from the new riverbank, reports the telegraph. The castle was built around 1550 in aberdeenshire ( per local lore, its dungeon was once occupied by an accused witch ) and neighbors the queen's balmoral residence. Floods caused by severe weather took many people in the region — including the 76-year-old baron — by surprise. \" when the waters came up he had to get out quickly, \" a neighbor tells the press and journal. \" the castle is teetering on the brink. God knows what will happen if the dee rises any further, \" the neighbor says. \" the castle is in imminent danger and john is at his wits ' end. It's not only a home.

In fact, three to five cups is apparently just fine, notes the los angeles times. The guidelines emphasize veggies, fruits, and whole grains, include the first daily limit for added sugars, and remove a daily limit on cholesterol, reports abc news. Some highlights: to cut your risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, limit added sugars to less than 10 % of your daily calories. That's no more than 12 teaspoons with a 2,000-calorie diet, per npr. Previous guidelines recommended people consume less than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day. That recommendation is now gone, with researchers less worried about the effects of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods. Still, the guidelines suggest we \" eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible. \" the recommendation on sodium stays the same. Those 14 and older should eat no more than 2,300 milligrams per day. Most people consume far more. Don't mix caffeine and alcohol. The combination may make people drink \" more alcohol and become more intoxicated than they realize, increasing the risk of alcohol-related adverse events. \" though an advisory panel suggested americans should limit red and processed meats, the guidelines don't go that far. But they do say people should eat more lean meats, eggs, nuts, seeds, and seafood for protein, per nbc news. \" essentially, the new guidelines nudge us nutritional policy toward a traditional mediterranean diet, which emphasizes consumption of fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes drenched in such fat sources as olive, nut, canola and soybean oils, \" writes melissa healy of the times.",

        "summary": "Political gloves are off in canada after the prime minister's wife, sophie grégoire trudeau, said she needs \" a team \" to help her \" serve the people, \" reports msn.com. In a french-language interview, the 41-year-old described her difficulty answering charity requests from her dining-room table while juggling family life with her husband, justin trudeau, and three children. \" i'd love to be everywhere but i can't, \" she says. \" i need help.... People really lay out their suffering in some of the letters i receive. \" but in canada, where there's no official \" first lady \" position, some are accusing grégoire trudeau of abusing her role while others say critics are insensitive to working mothers or simply don't like the trudeaus, the globe &amp; mail reports. Among the reactions: \" it is really the hypocrisy of mr. Trudeau at this point, always wanting more to do self-promotion, to do vanity trips, \" a conservative mp tells the globe &amp; mail. \" that is where a lot of canadians would question more [ staff ]. \" a lawmaker with the left-wing ndp was no kinder, saying the interview \" really speak[ s ] to a disconnect \" about \" what canadian women face on a daily basis. \" but the toronto star notes that past pm's wives have had at least one assistant — as grégoire trudeau does — and one, mila mulroney, had three. Neil macdonald argues at the cbc that canadians just can't stand having a \" tall poppy \" around. \" in canada, we look at tall poppies and cluck and disapprove and fervently hope somebody takes them down a peg or two, \" he writes. \" who do they think they are, anyway? \" an open letter on facebook sees pure sexism: \" we're supposed to be perfect mothers, wives, friends, employees and citizens, and we're not supposed to admit that we can't do it without a little help, \" writes amanda brennan. On a more practical note, the prime minister's office tells the globe &amp; mail that it's considering giving grégoire trudeau a second assistant.",

Bates ' attorney has said his client, charged with second-degree manslaughter in harris'death, had undergone all required training, cnn reports. Now, however, \" multiple \" anonymous sources tell the tulsa world that at least three supervisors were told to falsify the 73-year-old's field training and firearms certification records — and when they refused to do so, they were transferred to other departments. Other discrepancies have also popped up. Bates would have needed 480 hours of field training to qualify as the \" advanced reserve \" officer he was classified as, but the tulsa sheriff's office has said he completed just 300 hours, per cnn. Then there's bates'tenure as a reserve officer: the department says he started in 2008, but bates has said he started in 2007, cnn notes. And although the tulsa sheriff told local radio this week that bates was certified for three weapons, that paperwork has vanished, as has the person who signed off on it, per the world. Regarding the falsification allegations, the department's undersheriff tells the world, \" i have absolutely no knowledge of what you are talking about. There aren't any secrets in law enforcement. Zero. \" the department also sent an email to cnn stating, \" just keep in mind that the tulsa world reporter cannot validate her sources and claims anonymity which leaves us skeptical that her claims are unsubstantiated and deceptive. \" says a harris family lawyer, per business insider: \" an officer who is trained would never get these two weapons confused. \"",

        "summary": "In a five-day span at a single hospital in india, 60 children have died, 34 of them infants. The rash of deaths, which the independent reports began last monday, has led to the suspension of the head of the hospital in uttar pradesh state, and it's also spurred a string of questions and finger-pointing. Reuters cites indian media's take: that some of the deaths were due to a lack of liquid oxygen, with the hospital's supply having been cut off due to unpaid bills. Rajeev misra oversaw the state-run baba raghav das medical college hospital in gorakhpur before his suspension, and he backs up that assertion, telling the media on saturday that \" i wrote at least three letters \" to the government requesting money. A home ministry rep was quoted as saying 21 of the deaths were the result of the oxygen shortfall, reports the washington post. But other officials and a hospital doctor cited by sky news say the oxygen supply wasn't a factor. They claim mosquito-borne encephalitis was the cause of 35 % of the infant deaths, with the rest being due to unspecified causes. State officials say they were able to bolster the oxygen supply after reaching out to area nursing homes. But parents tell sky the oxygen supply dried up thursday night and that parents were offered manual resuscitator bags. The post obtained documents showing the hospital had been receiving letters regarding unpaid bills for six months, and that nearly $ 90,000 was owed to a medical supply company. The chief minister of uttar pradesh has pledged to get to the bottom of the situation: \" we will know whether it was because of an oxygen shortage or due to a lack of proper treatment. Those found guilty will not be spared. \"",

In syria, american and russian planes are now flying combat missions in the same country for the first time since world war ii, raising fears that they could end up firing on each other, reuters notes. On the ground, meanwhile, syrian government forces backed by russian planes have launched their first major offensive since russian airstrikes began last week, the ap reports. Activists say that the \" most intense fighting in months \" is taking place in the northwestern provinces of idlib and hama, where the ap reports there is no isis presence, although the al-qaeda-backed nusra front is active, along with us-backed rebel groups.

The state's department of fish and game requires people in boats to stay at least 30 feet away from bears. He argues that the clip shows the palins getting closer than that, thereby \" encouraging the violation of important guidelines. \" a rep from the fish and game department, however, is not convinced they actually violated any guidelines, the guardian reports, since they did not approach the bears as they were feeding.

And those two designations -- ™ for products and ℠ for services -- can be broadly defined to include... Pretty much anything. Products, images, slogans, designs and even names qualify for protection under the 1946 lanham act, and all it takes is a documented history of using that product, or \" mark, \" uniquely for commercial purposes. There's even a designation for \" non-conventional trademarks \" that allow for smells, colors and sounds, like the harley davidson engine rumble.

        "summary": "As if news that party of five debuted 20 years ago this month doesn't make you feel old enough, friends is this week hitting the same milestone. And as willa paskin writes for slate, the anniversary is being \" greeted with untempered enthusiasm, even for this era of rampant internet-based nostalgia. \" that has paskin asking — and answering — the question of why. As she writes, \" it did more than any show to excise the teachable moment from sitcoms for grown-ups. \" it was sweet, it was fluffy, and it was... A rare thing. In the 10 years since rachel, chandler, et al have left us, it's become apparent that making a \" straightforwardly pleasant sitcom, one that 20 million people want to watch and discuss, \" is actually incredibly difficult. Today's comedies take one of two routes: they make specificity king ( paskin cites girls and louie ) in the hope of reeling in a small but fervent audience or they go \" unbearably broad \" in a bid to reel in, well, everyone. But the attempts to do the latter are largely tainted by a \" light sheen of anxiety, \" writes paskin. \" they have to do everything they can, right away, to find an audience. \" friends, in contrast, \" casually [ assumes ] it has a claim on your attention even when it has made an entire episode about ross's misguided leather pants. \" at the end of the day, we watch tv for pleasure, and 20 years on, friends does that \" reliably, effortlessly. \" click for paskin's full column.",

The respected globe and mail is out with an investigative piece on the mayor's family, including brother doug, a city councilor. It includes paragraphs like this: \" what has emerged is a portrait of a family once deeply immersed in the illegal drug scene. All three of the mayor's older siblings — brother randy, 51, and sister kathy, 52, as well as doug, 48 — have had ties to drug traffickers. \" doug, in particular, is portrayed as the go-to guy for hash in the city back in the 1980s. One of his associates reportedly was david price, who now works in the mayor's office under the vague title of \" director of logistics and operations. \" kathy ford, meanwhile, was associated with white supremacists in the 1980s and is linked to a slew of headline-making incidents of the wrong kind. In one, her longtime boyfriend, a convicted drug dealer, was charged with threatening to murder the mayor; he also was once accused, along with another man, of shooting kathy ford in the face. While many of the events took place years ago, \" as mayor, rob ford has surrounded himself with people from his past, \" says the story. The globe began working on the piece in 2011 — well before the recent allegations emerged about the mayor smoking crack on video. In a letter to readers, the paper's editor writes that it would have been \" irresponsible \" not to publish the story, given the ford family's huge sway over the city. \" character matters, \" writes john stackhouse.

If you're not already obsessed with him, you're about to be. Watch more of lauri's videos here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/uccmd... And read more about him here: http://qz.com/657279/",
            "The first thing you see is a black and white montage accompanied by an infectious heavy metal soundtrack. A button is pushed, a lever pulled, a needle jumps within a pressure gauge. Then comes a male voice, thick with a finnish accent: \"welcome to the hydraulic press channel. \" since the beginning of october 2015, lauri vuohensilta has been crushing random objects to smithereens, just for the sheer pleasure of it. He's pulverized a rubber duck, a jawbreaker, various kinds of fruit, a hockey puck, a barbie, lego cars and a cable box, among other assorted and strange items. Crushing stuff is all that vuohensilta does for his youtube channel, which has gained almost 700,000 subscribers and nearly 51 million total views in just seven months. \"it's been quite a surprise that it's gotten so big so fast, \" he said in a skype interview with the washington post, through a gap-toothed grin. \"i thought it would take three years or something like that to get this big. \" ( courtesy of lauri vuohensilta ) curiously, the video that shot the hydraulic press channel to viral status was not a spectacular crush like a bowling ball, or crushing a hydraulic press with a hydraulic press ( appropriately titled \"pressception \" ). Instead, vuohensilta's first viral video proves an age-old myth in a rather startling fashion — paper really can't be folded in half more than seven times. After folding a normal piece of paper in half five times, vuohensilta enlists the help of his 100 ton hydraulic press to make the creases a little sharper. He grunts as he bends the little white square a seventh time and pushes it under the press, applying 300 bars of pressure. What happens next is unexpected — the piece of paper shatters. Vuohensilta is just as surprised as we are, exclaiming \"what the f – k? \" before gently extracting the remnants of the printer paper from beneath the press. It crumbles in his hand, like limestone. About a month ago, \"can you fold paper more than 7 times with hydraulic press, \" made its way to the front page of reddit. Within a day, the video got two million views, and vuohensilta's aptly named hydraulic press channel took off. Now, his videos typically gain over a"

        "summary": "When barry gibbs ' wife had a heart attack two years ago, the north carolina man couldn't take her to the hospital in nearby belhaven — because it had closed. Should he drive her 60 miles east to one town or 70 miles west to another? neither seemed close enough. But his dilemma isn't unique in a country where 83 rural hospitals have shuttered since 2010 in an ongoing financial crisis, the guardian reports. The problem: many rural people have contract jobs without insurance, so hospitals often pay for the neediest, especially in states that rejected the medicaid expansion under obamacare. Now urban hospitals are averaging 6 % annual profit and rural hospitals only 2 %. And as the former mayor of belhaven learned, the politics of it can get ugly. Adam o ' neal, who served as mayor for 12 years, staged protest walks when the medical consortium vidant health prepared to close the hospital for losing money. \" it's worse than murder, \" says o ' neal. \" everybody who needs emergency care and is dying is being murdered by vidant. \" the consortium did build a $ 5.9 million multispecialty clinic after closing the hospital, but that left belmont without all-important emergency care. On the federal level, sen. Chuck grassley has introduced a bill to let small, rural hospitals save money by offering only emergency care and transferring other patients, so that's in the pipeline, per upi. But it's too late for barry gibbs, whose wife portia died on the way to the hospital. He sprinkled her ashes outside his home.",

According to reuters, gov. Francisco dornelles declared the state of financial emergency friday, requesting federal funds to keep public services going during the olympics and to avoid a \"total collapse in public security, health, education, transport, and environmental management. \" rio is expecting half-a-million visitors when the olympics start aug. 5. During the games, the state, which is facing a $ 5.6 billion budget deficit this year, will be in charge of transportation, policing, and health. And things don't look good on that front. Homicides and assaults are increasing in rio at the same time the state's security budget was cut by 30 %. Rio is already delaying pension and salary payments while closing schools and hospitals. Slate reports teachers have been striking for months, and hospitals are running out of syringes. Plus there's the whole zika thing. Brazil, as a whole, is in its worst recession in 80 years thanks to low oil prices. And the state chief of staff says rio is \" nearing a social collapse. \" but despite all that, the olympics will likely go off without too many hitches. Much of the funding for the games is coming from the rio de janeiro city government. \"once the games are over? that's when the real crisis will set in, \" according to slate.",

The shot that injured his throat was fired at close range, sources tell newsday, and that, combined with the bullet's apparent trajectory, leads investigators to believe that the 19-year-old shot himself in a failed suicide attempt after police discovered his hiding place. The source says tsarnaev was mouthing curse words as an ambulance rushed him to the hospital, though it's unclear if they were aimed at his doctors, his captors, or himself. Investigators now believe dzhokhar may have dealt the killing blow to his brother, tamerlan, the boston globe reports.

The law expired oct. 1 but has enough funding to last another year. Proponents of the law are seeking its permanent extension, but some republicans have opposed that, saying they want a chance to periodically review it and make sure it's operating soundly. Stewart told noah that he wasn't there to take his show back, but stewart told him he was back because he had an issue he wanted people to pay attention to and that he \" realized he didn't have a show anymore, \" the wrap reports. Stewart, who devoted a show to the issue in 2010, said that from his experiences, \" the only [ conclusion ] that i can draw is the people from congress are not as good a people as the people who are first responders. \" he had a panel of four first responders on the 2010 show and welcomed one of them, firefighter kenny specht, back to the show monday night, mashable reports.

The animals didn't have long to enjoy their freedom, though: one returned to the enclosure on its own, while the others were tracked down within 30 minutes. Two were captured near a tree line, but one reached a nearby road. A video shared by abc news shows researchers chasing a baboon as cars whiz by. A passerby tells ksat she saw \" four guys clapping at the bushes. I just went about driving and then all of a sudden this brown big mass pops out. \" luckily the escaped baboons are doing well, and they weren't involved in any infectious disease research at the institute, where new vaccines and medicines are developed. But the barrels, which were to help the baboons mimic foraging behavior, will be removed to prevent future escapes.

The nearly finished findings, according to law enforcement officials who say they've been briefed on it, are expected to show how systematic discriminatory actions helped stoke tensions in the period before michael brown's shooting death last summer by officer darren wilson. The report is also said to suggest that ticket fines are used to keep the city's budget in line, the times notes. If those issued a ticket can't pay it, they can keep going to jail for the unpaid fees, which has proven lucrative for the city: \" fines and public safety \" are ferguson's second-largest revenue source ( sales tax is the first ), per the times. Although blacks in ferguson only make up 63 % of the population, they were involved in 86 % of the city's 2013 traffic stops, per missouri ag info cited by the times. And the search rate for blacks after a stop was twice that of whites during that time period, though whites were significantly more likely to have \" contraband. \" mayor james knowles iii has already taken umbrage with the alleged findings and for recent statements by ag eric holder, who said in october that \" wholesale change \" was needed in the ferguson pd. \" how come they haven't told us there is something that needs to be changed as they found it? \" knowles told the times last week. \" why have they allowed whatever they think is happening to continue to happen for six months if that's the case? \" also said to be included in the report: a racist joke believed to have been emailed among city officials, law enforcement officials tell the times.",

Building on developments in the 1990s, computers are used to create effects that would have previously been more expensive, from the subtle erasing of surrounding islands in cast away ( leaving tom hanks ' character stranded with no other land in sight ) to the vast battle scenes such as those in gladiator, the lord of the rings trilogy, the matrix reloaded and 300. In addition, film genres not known for their popular appeal in north america became increasingly attractive to filmgoers: films in foreign languages like crouching tiger, hidden dragon, the passion of the christ and letters from iwo jima; and documentary films like an inconvenient truth, march of the penguins, super size me, and fahrenheit 9/11, became very successful."

        "summary": "While you were using your iphone to browse facebook and read newser, a group of researchers was modifying an iphone 4s to be used as a portable artificial pancreas — and in a recent trial, the device successfully regulated the blood sugar levels of people with type 1 diabetes. About a third of people with type 1 diabetes, which is typically diagnosed in childhood, use an insulin pump to regulate their blood sugar rather than giving themselves insulin injections. But unlike those pumps, the bionic pancreas adjusts both insulin and glucagon, a hormone that works with insulin to regulate blood sugar, automatically, the new york times reports. It performed better than a regular pump for both adults and adolescents, according to the press release. The device is comprised of more than just the iphone: the patient has a sensor implanted under the skin near the abdomen, which sends readings of blood glucose levels to the attached phone. The phone then calculates and sends the correct dosage of insulin and glucagon through attached pumps and tubes every five minutes. Patients can also enter information about meals before they eat, and the phone will calculate and deliver the correct dose. Twice-daily finger pricks are still required, with the blood sugar readings entered into the phone. Adult participants had about 37 % fewer incidents during which low blood glucose levels required intervention — incidents that can be dangerous in the moment as well as cause health complications down the line — and the device could even allow patients to eat what they want, the boston globe notes. ( during the trial, participants \" went on a diabetes vacation, eating ice cream, candy bars, and other things they normally wouldn't eat, \" explains the lead researcher. ) it could be available by 2017, but larger trials are the next step.",

Type 1 diabetes, which usually starts in childhood or young adulthood, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin, the hormone that lowers blood sugar levels. Insulin works in conjunction with glucagon, a hormone that raises blood sugar. Together, they keep blood sugar in a healthy range. Currently about one-third of people with type 1 diabetes rely on insulin pumps to regulate blood sugar.

But these pumps do not automatically adjust to the patient's variable insulin needs, and they do not dispense glucagon. The new device, described in a report in the new england journal",
            "An artificial pancreas developed by boston researchers shows considerable promise to dramatically change the treatment of type 1 diabetes, potentially enabling 2 million americans to eat what they want without counting carbohydrates or calculating insulin injections, researchers announced sunday. Investigators from massachusetts general hospital and boston university developed the experimental device, which consists of an automated pump that releases the hormones insulin and glucagon and a glucose monitoring system controlled by an iphone app. Advertisement \"we encouraged them to eat whatever they wanted while they wore the bionic pancreas, \" said dr. Steven russell, an endocrinologist at massachusetts general hospital who led the study. \"they went on a diabetes vacation, eating ice cream, candy bars, and other things they normally wouldn't eat — like taking out a new sports car and seeing what it can do. \" in a new study published online in the new england journal of medicine, the researchers"

The good news for the creatures is that the us government is on their side: yesterday, the fish and wildlife service announced plans to set aside $ 3.2 million to save them. Officials will work to bring back milkweed in breeding hotspots like texas, oklahoma, and the midwest, including 200,000 acres stretching from texas to minnesota along interstate 35; half of monarchs migrate through the area during an incredible trip from mexico to canada, the washington post reports.

Deputies responded to a 5: 45am call reporting that the woman, variously reported as 28 or 30 years old, had been stuck in the chimney for two to three hours; neighbors called after hearing her screams, according to cbs la. Firefighters used jackhammers to partially dismantle the chimney and lubricated the flue with dish soap before lifting nunez-figueroa out. What was she doing in there in the first place? well, it's not clear, but she'd gone on six dates with the homeowner — who wasn't home at the time — after meeting him online, and he says he'd recently ended the relationship. The sheriff's department says her \" intent was unclear. \" whatever she was trying to do, this wasn't her first time: the homeowner also saw her on his roof two weeks ago and called the cops, but she fled, abc30 reports.

        "summary": "Apple has done a u-turn and scrapped restrictions introduced earlier this year on what tools developers can use to build applications for the iphone and ipad. Developers will now be allowed to use tools based on adobe's flash, and restrictions on other programming languages have been lifted, the wall street journal reports. Shares in adobe jumped after the news, though iphone and ipad users still won't be able to access flash-based content on the internet. Apple also addressed concerns that the application approval process is too secretive by releasing, for the first time, a list of guidelines developers should follow to avoid rejection. Analysts say the company's new-found openness appears to be a move to avoid giving an edge to the competition. \" apple is concerned enough about the shifting tide toward android that it feels it has to loosen restrictions to keep developers on its side, \" an analyst at forrester research tells the new york times.",

        "summary": "Five years after he addressed a huge crowd in berlin as a presidential candidate — and 50 years after john f. Kennedy proclaimed \" ich bin ein berliner \" — president obama gave an address at the iconic brandenburg gate today, calling for a major reduction in nuclear warheads. \" we may not live in fear of nuclear annihilation — but as long as nuclear weapons exist, we are not truly safe, \" obama declared, according to politico. He said the us could still defend itself with one third fewer nuclear weapons, and said he intended to negotiate a cut to that level with russia. That would mean taking the arsenals down to about 1,000 warheads each. Officials tell the wall street journal that the cuts may take place under a new treaty, to follow 2010's new start pact, but the white house will also consider reciprocal reductions without a treaty. Obama also spent plenty of time in the speech endearing himself to the crowd before him ( which usa today notes was limited to 6,000 invited guests ), with frequent jokes and stirring references to the city's history. \" i am proud to stand here and pay tribute to the past from the east side of the brandenburg, \" he said. Of course, hanging over everything was the nsa spying issue. At a joint press conference earlier, merkel said she and obama had held \" long and intensive \" talks about it, while obama offered assurances that the us wasn't \" rifling through the ordinary emails of german citizens... Or anybody else. \"",

The emails, published thursday by the new york times, touch on a central question of special counsel robert mueller's russia investigation: did stone have advance knowledge of wikileaks ' plans to release hacked material damaging to hillary clinton? stone says no, and the emails don't provide a definitive answer to that question. But the correspondence suggests stone wanted bannon to see him as plugged in to wikileaks as it was planning to publish documents that would upend the campaign. Us intelligence agencies have concluded russian agents were the source of info released by wikileaks during the 2016 campaign. Mueller's team questioned bannon last month about his exchanges with stone, a source says. Bannon's interview was with prosecutors, though other people close to stone have been called before a grand jury to discuss his ties to wikileaks. The source said bannon and other top campaign officials were skeptical of stone and his claims about having insight into wikileaks ' efforts. Stone, who confirmed the emails ' authenticity, denies being a conduit to wikileaks. \" what i am guilty of is using publicly available information and a solid tip to bluff, posture, hype, and punk democrats on twitter. This is called ' politics. ' it's not illegal, \" he said thursday in a daily caller op-ed. Stone tells the ap: \" i had no advanced notice of the source or content or the exact timing of the release of the wikileaks disclosures. \" ( stone thinks he knows who wrote the now infamous anonymous times op-ed. )",

A recent kenyan intelligence report alleged that ikrima was behind several foiled terror conspiracies against targets in kenya between 2011 and 2013. The most recent was a plot to attack mandera airport in kenya's north eastern province in april.

A recent kenyan intelligence report alleged that ikrima was behind several foiled terror conspiracies against targets in kenya between 2011 and 2013. The most recent was a plot to attack mandera airport in kenya's north eastern province in april. Kenyan officials said last year that ikrima had a significant role in recruiting and training kenyans in al-shabaab. He is thought to have been a close associate of saleh ali nabhan, a fellow kenyan and senior al qaeda operative in east africa, who was killed by u.s. Forces in 2009 in somalia.

Officials say the man was found in the 100-foot-deep gap thursday after he succeeded in making an emergency call from his cellphone following numerous failed attempts because of poor reception, the ap reports. The man had been reported missing by his father saturday on the rugged dachstein range southeast of the city of salzburg. State broadcaster orf cites an alpine rescue official as saying the man is only \" relatively lightly hurt \" considering the drop, with shoulder and foot injuries. Deutsche welle, which notes the poor weather and risk of avalanches made rescuers ' efforts more difficult, documents how police first found the man's car near a lake at the foot of the mountain wednesday night. He'd been trying to make calls from his phone, and finally one call went through, though only for a few seconds. A quick-thinking member of the rescue team switched communications over to texting, at which point the man was able to relay to them where he was. \" we would not have found him otherwise, \" another rescuer says. The man was flown by helicopter to a nearby hospital after the early morning rescue. He's not being identified due to austrian privacy laws.",

        "summary": "A louisiana historian wants oil and gas companies to help restore state wetlands that are vanishing by the day — but politicians are fighting him tooth and nail, the new york times magazine reports. John barry, a gritty ex-weightlifter who writes us history books, watches in horror as louisiana wetlands recede ( and the gulf of mexico advances ) by about a football field per hour. Dams and levees are partly to blame, as are tens of thousands of wells carved by oil and gas companies. The industry even admits to causing 36 % of southeastern louisiana's wetlands loss. A plan supported by scientists and industry to repair the land would cost about $ 50 billion, $ 20 billion of which can be paid by bp deepwater horizon oil-spill lawsuits. Barry believes oil-and-gas should pay at least $ 18 billion of the rest — or 36 % of the total. But oil-and-gas wants taxpayers to foot that bill, so barry fought back. In an ambitious move, the regional levee board of which barry was a member filed the biggest environmental lawsuit in us history against the oil and gas companies that affected the wetlands. \" the reality is that our case is overwhelming, \" says barry, adding that the companies \" violated the terms of their contract. They broke the law! \" most of the companies had, in fact, used permits that demanded any environmental damage be repaired. But the state legislature — which critics say is deeply influenced by oil-and-gas — argued that no laws had been broken, and passed a bill that crippled or perhaps killed the lawsuit before it reached a courtroom. Gov. Bobby jindal then signed the bill into law. Barry has started a nonprofit to keep the suit alive, and tells the times-picayune that \" it really comes down to is the most basic conservative american values. It's keep your word, obey the law, and take responsibility for your actions. \"",

        "summary": "Researchers believe they may know why so many people die during triathlons compared to other races, such as marathons. Approximately 1.5 people die out of every 100,000 who participate in a triathlon — which includes running, biking, and swimming portions, livescience reports. That's two to three times the death rate for marathon participants. According to a study published monday in bmj open sport &amp; exercise medicine, more than 72 % of triathlon deaths looked at by researchers happened in the water during the swimming portion of the race. And researchers believe the culprit is something called immersion pulmonary edema, or ipe. Ipe occurs when a person quickly gets into water, especially cold water. That causes the body to take blood from the arms, legs, and other extremities and move it toward the core. This changes the body's internal pressure and may force fluids from the blood into the lungs. This can cause people to experience confusion and difficulty breathing, sometimes to the point of death, according to a press release. A number of triathletes who died for no discernible reason had significantly enlarged hearts, even to a greater degree than other athletes. Researchers say this condition — left ventricular hypertrophy — is a risk factor for ipe. Researchers conclude future triathletes should be checked for the condition before participating in or training for a race. ( a boy with cerebral palsy inspires in triathlon finish. )",

But a small yet persistent number of tragedies have marred the triathlon boom. Triathletes have a death rate of approximately 1.5 people per 100,000 participants, according to a 2010 article in the journal jama. That's not many, but it is two to three times higher than the rate seen in marathons.

            "The popularity of triathlons — races in which competitors run, bike and swim — has exploded over the past 15 years. According to usa triathlon, the leading group that organizes races, the number of people with one-day memberships ( indicating race participation ) stood at more than 447,000 in 2014, compared with about 128,000 in 1999. But a small yet persistent number of tragedies have marred the triathlon boom. Triathletes have a death rate of approximately 1.5 people per 100,000 participants, according to a 2010 article in the journal jama. That's not many, but it is two to three times higher than the rate seen in marathons.

Nothing further was said regarding how the release came to be negotiated or how warmbier ended up in a coma. Pyongyang has claimed the 22-year-old contracted botulism and took a sleeping pill before falling into a coma immediately after his march 2016 trial, but at least one doctor disputes that. More: the washington post does have some further details regarding the release: it reports that after finally being informed of warmbier's health, state department special representative for north korea joseph yun helped facilitate his removal from the country. The post has more on the reaction to warmbier's homecoming from those in his hometown of wyoming, ohio, population 8,400, and more about warmbier himself: a salutatorian, homecoming king, and soccer team captain who was attending the university of virginia on a \" prestigious scholarship \" awarded to \" intellectually curious \" students. As for what befell warmbier, his parents may shine a light on that. Reuters reports fred and cindy warmbier will \" detail his mistreatment \" during a thursday morning press conference at their son's former high school. Fred warmbier did speak with tucker carlson on wednesday, in an interview that will air thursday at 8pm edt on fox news. We're \" adjusting to a different reality, \" he says. \" otto is not in great shape right now... [ he ] has been terrorized and brutalized for 18 months by a pariah regime in north korea. \" as for what the brutality was, the new york times cites an unnamed senior us official who says warmbier was beaten. \" the mystery is why, \" as the times puts it. By its count, 16 americans have been held by the country in the past 21 years, and they've typically been abused psychologically, not physically, though there have been exceptions ( robert park, detained in 2009, says north korean women used a club to beat his genitals ). The feeling seems to be that north korea is wary of further tarnishing the world's perception of its human rights record.",

Two and a half years ago he uprooted his family and moved from michigan to sin city.

Authorities say they're still working to find out how many people are being held in the lindt chocolat cafe, where five hostages were seen running from the building after being captive for seven hours, the sydney morning herald reports. Three men who ran from a fire exit were followed by two women, apparently cafe employees, who ran into the arms of police. Earlier, hostages could be seen holding up what appears to be an islamic flag. Police say they believe there are no more than 30 hostages in the cafe and as far as they know, nobody has been harmed. It's not clear whether there's more than one gunman involved. Hundreds of police officers have locked down part of the city's central business district and police presence has been massively boosted in other australian cities. The police commissioner for new south wales says the situation is tightly contained and officers are trying to resolve the situation peacefully, the guardian reports. He did not confirm or deny reports that radio host ray hadley had spoken to a hostage acting under instructions from a gunman. Abbott said at a press conference that australians should go about their lives as normal but stay alert, the bbc reports. \" i can think of almost nothing more distressing, more terrifying than to be caught up in such a situation, and our hearts go out to these people, \" he said. Uber, meanwhile, now says it's offering free rides out of central sydney. At the start of the hostage crisis, the company quadrupled its prices to a minimum $ 100 australian, saying \" demand is off the charts, \" mashable reports.",

Attorney brian virag, who secured in october a $ 546,000 jury verdict over bedbugs at a hilton garden inn, says the bites \" covering pretty much her entire body \" were among the worst he's seen. Jales st. Pierre was \" embarrassed, ashamed, and humiliated \" but had to keep working, he says, per the palm springs desert sun, adding \" she still experiences psychological trauma \" and is seeking monetary and punitive damages. Photos shared as part of the lawsuit, at least one of which includes a dated newspaper, show large red welts covering the model's shoulder, back, and legs, per the los angeles times. Describing the site of the 2016 incident as \" an independently owned and managed franchise property, \" hilton directed questions to embassy suites. The general manager of the palm desert location essentially accuses jales st. Pierre of lying. The hotel agreed to dry-clean her clothes after she complained, but officials and an outside pest-control company investigated and found no evidence of a bedbug infestation, carlos mendoza tells the desert sun. \" we did all the proper protocols, \" he says. \" now we have to go through the lawsuit to defend the reputation of the hotel. \" ( this family won $ 1.6 million over bedbugs. )",

Based on what prosecutors described as a \" one-in-a-billion \" dna match linking a discarded sweatshirt to bishop, the girls, and the murder scene, the convictions came exactly 31 years after bishop's acquittal on the same charges, reports the guardian. An ex-girlfriend had initially said the sweatshirt found discarded along bishop's route home in brighton belonged to him, but she denied that claim in court in 1987. \" certainly, if she had not changed her story, it might have been a wholly different thing, \" a prosecutor tells the telegraph, raising the possibility of a perjury investigation. Not only was bishop's dna found on karen's left forearm, but dried paint on the sweatshirt matched flakes found on her shirt and nicola's neck, according to prosecutors. They described bishop attacking the girls at a park around dusk, though defense attorneys instead suggested the involvement of nicola's father, who was brought to tears during the trial. Afterward, the family had harsh words for their daughter's killer, serving life for the 1990 attempted murder, kidnapping, and indecent assault of a 7-year-old girl, per the bbc: \" he is a monster.

The families of the two girls cheered members of the jury as the verdict was handed down at the old bailey on the anniversary of his original acquittal. Bishop was not in court having refused to leave his cell and attend. He will be sentenced on tuesday. Bishop was initially charged with shocking crimes in 1987, but was cleared by a jury at lewes crown court after a catalogue of forensic mistakes torpedoed the prosecution case.

In the ecuador case, $ 900 and a cellphone were taken from the 86-year-old and 52-year-old tourists, who were also assaulted. The girls are also suspected of the carjacking robberies of two philly pizza delivery drivers.
