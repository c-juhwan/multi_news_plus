        "summary": "Google handed out more than $ 2 million to more than 300 people in 2015 who spotted bugs and security issues, but one award in particular stands out, reports beta news. The odd sum of $ 6,006.13 went to sanmay ved, a former google employee and current mba candidate at babson college in massachusetts. Why the weird amount? it kind of spells \" google \" numerically. \" squint a little and you ' ll see it! \" says google's online security blog in a post on the 2015 awards. It seems ved was messing around with the google domains interface late one night in september ( because don't we all? ) when to his surprise the domain name google.com appeared as available for purchase. For $ 12. So he found himself buying — with a credit card and all — one of the world's most famous domains. His moment of glory was quite literally just that — within a minute google canceled the transaction, which google can do because it owns the registration service itself. Ved says he doesn't know exactly what caused the glitch on google's end, but he details the geekily sordid affair on his linkedin account. Cnet speculates that google missed a renewal deadline, and ved was able to capitalize. A nice footnote: when ved elected to donate his award to charity — it went to this education foundation — google doubled it. Microsoft ran into a similar problem back in 2003 but did not immediately cancel the sale of hotmail.co.uk. Fortunately for microsoft, the buyer returned it that same day, the register reported at the time. ( speaking of domains, google has bought the entire alphabet. )",

Stats released tuesday by the cdc show a nearly 20 % drop from 2008 to 2014 in what the newspaper calls \" the first sustained decline \" since diabetes began booming in the 1990s. Specifically, the us saw 1.4 million new cases in 2014, down from 1.7 million in 2008. There's still plenty of major trouble spots: the decline is pronounced among white people and less so for africanamericans and hispanics, and a notable gap remains in regard to education levels. \" it's not yet time for a parade, \" says the head of the diabetes program at massachusetts general hospital. But, he adds, \" it has finally entered into the consciousness of our population that the sedentary lifestyle is a real problem, that increased body weight is a real problem. \" cbs notes that 10 % of adults in the us are believed to have type 2 diabetes and that more than a third have prediabetes — a condition that can lead to the full disease — which makes any sign that the numbers have peaked welcome. A cdc researcher calls the results \" a little surprising \" given the decades-long increases. But \" it seems pretty clear now that incidence rates have actually started to drop. \" ( meanwhile, a novel new treatment could one day make daily insulin injections a thing of the past. )",

According to figures for 2013, the most recent available by state, 12.7 percent of alabama's residents had the disease. In the tiny town of eutaw, lynette carpenter got serious about staving off diabetes around the time her cousin's leg was amputated because of the disease. She started to make a dish she called sexy pork chops, involving a bell pepper, an onion and the oven. She weaned herself off coca-cola, going from about 50 cans a week to fewer than seven. And she started walking, leaving rubber bands in her mailbox to pull onto her arm — one for each mile walked — to remind her how many miles she had gone. The result made her doctor proud: she lost 42 pounds, and two years later has still not developed full-blown diabetes. Diabetes \"has got my respect and attention, \" she said. \"i take it real serious. \" robin williams, a music teacher in birmingham, lost 33 pounds by cutting out candy, packing her lunch and not buying fast food during long",

Over that period, the number of adults between 18 and 79 with newly diagnosed diabetes cases more than tripled -- jumping from 493,000 to more than 1.4 million new cases a year. About 21.9 million americans now live with the disease. A study last year estimated that nearly 10 percent of u.s. Adults have type 2 diabetes, and other research finds more than a third of adults have prediabetes, a high blood sugar condition that may lead to diabetes. But this latest cdc data shows a small but promising reversal. \" this is the first time i think we can really comfortably say we've seen a decrease in incidence in the rate of new cases.

            "Even here in alabama, which has the highest prevalence of diabetes in the country, the rate of new cases has begun to taper. According to figures for 2013, the most recent available by state, 12.7 percent of alabama's residents had the disease. In the tiny town of eutaw, lynette carpenter got serious about staving off diabetes around the time her cousin's leg was amputated because of the disease. She started to make a dish she called sexy pork chops, involving a bell pepper, an onion and the oven. She weaned herself off coca-cola, going from about 50 cans a week to fewer than seven. And she started walking, leaving rubber bands in her mailbox to pull onto her arm — one for each mile walked — to remind her how many miles she had gone. The result made her doctor proud: she lost 42 pounds, and two years later has still not developed full-blown diabetes. Diabetes \"has got my respect and attention, \" she said. \"i take it real serious. \" robin williams, a music teacher in birmingham, lost 33 pounds by cutting out candy, packing her lunch and not buying fast food during long",

            "New diabetes cases are down in the u.s. For the first time in decades, according to a new cdc report. There were 1.4 million new cases of diabetes in 2014, a drop from 1.7 million in 2008. It's the first time in a quarter century there's been a significant decline, the cdc reported. Over that period, the number of adults between 18 and 79 with newly diagnosed diabetes cases more than tripled -- jumping from 493,000 to more than 1.4 million new cases a year. About 21.9 million americans now live with the disease. A study last year estimated that nearly 10 percent of u.s. Adults have type 2 diabetes, and other research finds more than a third of adults have prediabetes, a high blood sugar condition that may lead to diabetes.

He has a point: the country produces about 197 million chickens annually, with the ability to ship about 36 million of them to other nations, a local poultry group says. And data from the bolivian institute of foreign trade notes the country saw a significant increase in the production of chicken meat and eggs from 2008 to 2013. Gates announced his \" coop dreams \" program earlier this month, noting he'd met, through his work with the bill and melinda gates foundation, plenty of poor people who raised the birds and that \" it's pretty clear to me that just about anyone who's living in extreme poverty is better off if they have chickens. \" he goes on to say that chickens are a cheap investment with easy maintenance and decent roi, the eggs they pop out help keep kids healthy, and they \" empower women \" ( a belief his wife apparently shares ). \" it sounds funny, but i mean it when i say that i am excited about chickens, \" his post concludes. An enthusiasm obviously not shared ( at least when it comes to his donation ) by what gizmodo labels bolivia's \" leftist, anti-imperialist government. \" bolivians \" do not need any gifted chicks in order to live — we have dignity, \" cocarico sniffed.

Reuters reports the bodies of three family members — the last three people believed missing — were pulled from a crushed car over the weekend in the rubble of genoa's morandi bridge, bringing the count of people killed in tuesday's catastrophe to 43. Via the washington post, the ansa news agency reports the family, which included a child, had been headed on vacation. Nine people remain hospitalized, four of them critically, per genoa's prefecture. A fire brigade official says the wreckage will continue to be searched to be doubly sure there isn't anyone they missed, though rescuers believe everyone who was on the bridge has been accounted for. The bbc reports that italian president sergio mattarella and prime minister giuseppe conte presided over a state funeral for nearly 20 of the victims over the weekend, though some families rejected the public overtures, either wanting to mourn privately or because they were fuming at the government for the tragedy. \" we do not want farcical ceremonies, \" one family member told a local newspaper. \" our children are not a tool for public parades. \" meanwhile, via the independent, a 1979 report has emerged from the bridge's engineer that warned about deterioration risks. Riccardo morandi noted the salty ocean air and pollution from a neighboring factory had led to a \" well-known loss of superficial chemical resistance of the concrete, \" and that the bridge would need constant upkeep to get rid of rust and other vulnerabilities.

With the cloud of controversy lifted, the clippers \" played as if on wings, flying around with hustle and heart \" before ecstatic fans who gave a standing ovation when two fans wearing t-shirts with sterling's face crossed out appeared on the video screen, writes bill plaschke at the los angeles times. More: if the nba hadn't chucked sterling, the game would never have happened, because both teams had planned to walk off the court in protest moments before it was supposed to begin, sports illustrated reveals. \" it was a real option, \" says warriors coach mark jackson. V. Stiviano, the woman sterling was recorded making racist remarks to, is \" saddened \" by the owner's lifetime ban and is \" devastated \" that the recording was released, her lawyer tells the los angeles times. He says that his client wasn't sterling's girlfriend and never had a romantic relationship with him. The lawyer says she was hired as an \" archivist \" — an archivist who received $ 1.8 million in gifts from sterling, according to a lawsuit filed by his wife of more than 50 years. What now for sterling? nba commissioner adam silver plans to push him to sell the team, and fellow team owners appear willing to follow the recommendation to force him out. He could fight back in the courts, but his chances of success are \" basically zero, \" a cnn legal analyst says. If he does sell, it will be for a huge profit: he bought the team for $ 12 million in 1981 and it is now valued at $ 575 million, though some experts believe it could sell for closer to $ 1 billion.",

Ida lockett says she was helping her son put together a playmobil pirate ship set when she came to instructions to put a shackle around the neck of one of the dark-skinned pirates. \"it's definitely racist, \" she tells cbs sacramento. \"it told my son to put a slave cuff around the black character's neck and then to play with the toy. \" the boy's aunt, who purchased the pirate ship set, posted on the playmobil facebook page that she was mortified. \" would it be too much to ask for you to just create a regular old black pirate? \" she asks. Playmobil issued a statement defending the toy as a portrayal of life on a 17th-century pirate ship. \"if you look at the box, you can see that the pirate figure is clearly a crew member on the pirate ship and not a captive, \" the statement reads. \"the figure was meant to represent a pirate who was a former slave in a historical context. \" but not everyone was mollified by the statement: the post reports the president of the sacramento naacp is calling for the toy to be removed from shelves. In her facebook post, the boy's aunt claims the pirate ship was the only playmobil set she could find with a black figure. ( playmobil once demanded a pastor stop crucifying toys. )",

A search led to holliman's overturned car in a ravine, apparently the result of a single-car crash and not visible from the road. The infant was found strapped in his car seat alive; holliman, 25, had been ejected and was dead. \" we're still trying to determine the timeline, but the mother was last seen thursday, \" greeley said. \" this is one of the most remarkable things i've ever experienced in my 11 years at this department. \" holliman's father, james, tells kark that kylen was able to unstrap himself and exit the car through the sunroof. \" when he climbed out of that car, seeing his mother dead like that like she was, he tried to wake his mom up, \" he says.

The fight is between a spam-fighting group, spamhaus, and a web-hosting company, cyberbunker, but it has grown to the point that it's affecting the entire internet and its infrastructure. Millions of users are experiencing delays while trying to reach websites or while using services like netflix, and experts fear that if the attacks continue to grow in power, people may not be able to access things like email or online banking. It all started when spamhaus, which publishes a blacklist that email providers use to weed out spam, put cyberbunker on its list of spammers. Cyberbunker retaliated, but its attack on spamhaus ended up having a much larger impact. One architect at a digital content provider likened it to, as the new york times puts it, using a machine gun in an effort to assassinate one person. The distributed denial of service ( ddos ) attacks \" are essentially like nuclear bombs \" that exploit the internet's domain name system ( dns ), says an exec at a group that tried to defend against the attacks and ended up becoming a target. \" it's so easy to cause so much damage. \" and, notes the architect, this is \" the largest publicly announced ddos attack in the history of the internet. \" cyberbunker says spamhaus is a vigilante group \" abusing [ its ] influence, \" but the architect notes that cyberbunker is \" just mad \" that it got caught spamming. One security researcher says the only way to stop the attack is to arrest the people responsible. Five cyber-police forces around the globe are investigating.",

According to the ap, fort san marcos — built in 1577 and occupied for five years — was discovered last month under a golf course on parris island by two researchers. They used improving technology, included radar and magnetic waves, to succeed where years of old-fashioned hole digging had failed, the post and courier reports. While the remains of fort san marcos are still buried, the location in itself is a hard-won and important find. \"this work will allow us to tell the story of the land that would eventually become the united states, \" one of the researchers says. Fort san marcos was built more than 100 years before english settlers arrived in what is now south carolina. Spanish documents give a description and drawing of the fort, but not its location — that was finally given away by the fort's old post holes. Fort san marcos was built in the settlement of santa elena, which was discovered in 1979 — nearly 100 years after it was abandoned in the midst of attacks by the english. It consisted of barracks, storerooms, and 11 cannons. Researchers employed the same method used to discover the location of fort san marcos to learn a little more about santa elena, mapping its shops, taverns, a church, and more.",

            "Improved technology helped archaeologists finally locate a 16th-century spanish fort on what is now marine corps recruit depot parris island. Archaeologists had been looking for san marcos, one of several forts built on the santa elena settlement, for more than 20 years. The location was nailed down using radar and magnetometers. The machines have been in play for archaeologists for years, but the computer programs interpreting the data have vastly improved in recent years, said university of georgia archaeologist victor thompson. Thompson has worked on the site with university of south carolina archaeologist chester depratter, whose search for san marcos began in 1993. The general location of the fort had been noted using documents archived in spain. There was a drawing of the fort and a written description but nothing detailing the location. Traditional digging methods had failed to find the fort. \"we can't go to a map and say 'oh,",
            "Archaeologists chester depratter ( left ) and victor thompson ( right ) have mapped the early colonial fort san marcos by running ground penetrating radar and using other high tech equipment. Five centuries ago, two spanish warships sailed to a marsh bank in the lowcountry, a coastal jungle haunted by panthers, bison, elk and people the sailors considered savages. The bank was a foothold into the new world also sought by the french. The ships carried wood posts and planking to build a fort. Today, researchers using radar, electric currents and magnetic waves have pinpointed exactly where they built it. Ground-penetrating radar and magnetometers located the outlines of the lost fort san marcos near beaufort, amid the footprint of a church, courts, shops, taverns and farms that comprised the 1566 settlement of santa elena. Archeologists knew about where it was, but the organic residue remains of the 16th century",

            "Improved technology helped archaeologists finally locate a 16th-century spanish fort on what is now marine corps recruit depot parris island. Archaeologists had been looking for san marcos, one of several forts built on the santa elena settlement, for more than 20 years. The location was nailed down using radar and magnetometers. The machines have been in play for archaeologists for years, but the computer programs interpreting the data have vastly improved in recent years, said university of georgia archaeologist victor thompson. Thompson has worked on the site with university of south carolina archaeologist chester depratter, whose search for san marcos began in 1993. The general location of the fort had been noted using documents archived in spain. There was a drawing of the fort and a written description but nothing detailing the location. Traditional digging methods had failed to find the fort. \"we can't go to a map and say 'oh,",
            "Archaeologists chester depratter ( left ) and victor thompson ( right ) have mapped the early colonial fort san marcos by running ground penetrating radar and using other high tech equipment. Five centuries ago, two spanish warships sailed to a marsh bank in the lowcountry, a coastal jungle haunted by panthers, bison, elk and people the sailors considered savages. The bank was a foothold into the new world also sought by the french. The ships carried wood posts and planking to build a fort. Today, researchers using radar, electric currents and magnetic waves have pinpointed exactly where they built it. Ground-penetrating radar and magnetometers located the outlines of the lost fort san marcos near beaufort, amid the footprint of a church, courts, shops, taverns and farms that comprised the 1566 settlement of santa elena. Archeologists knew about where it was, but the organic residue remains of the 16th century",

        "summary": "Rates of interracial marriage are increasing — and you might have online dating to thank, according to a new study. The mit technology review calls the results of the study a \" profound revelation \" and signs of an improving society. Researchers josue ortega and philipp hergovich found online dating has completely upended how society is formed. People have strong links to family and friends and weak links to a bunch of other people they're connected to through those strong links. Traditionally, it was those weak links that provided a romantic partner — think a friend's coworker or something. Then match.com and other dating sites arrived in the mid-90s. Online dating is now the most common way homosexual couples meet and second most common way heterosexual couples meet, and 15 % of americans say they've tried online dating, according to science alert. Suddenly, people were forming strong links with complete strangers, ignoring those weak links altogether. Hergovich and ortega developed a model to see how the rise of online dating affected interracial marriage. A lot, it turns out. \"our model predicts nearly complete racial integration upon the emergence of online dating, \" the researchers tell the technology review. And data from the real world supports their hypothesis. While the rate of interracial marriage has been increasing for decades, the rate notably jumped in the mid-90s, again in the 2000s when online dating got more popular, and once again in 2014 when tinder took over the dating world. Hergovich and ortega's model — and real-life data — also shows online dating is making marriages stronger.",

Bloomberg reports a 552-carat yellow diamond the size of a chicken egg ( picture here ) was found there in october, and it's now said to be the largest diamond ever unearthed in north america. The \" astonishing gemstone \" was discovered at the diavik mine, owned by the rio tinto group and dominion diamond mines, about 135 miles south of the arctic circle, per a press release. In addition to its north american honors, the diamond, which measures 33.74mm by 54.56mm, would rank among the 30 biggest stones ever discovered, per bloomberg estimates, as well as the seventh largest this century. The scratches on the diamond indicate it had a \" difficult journey, \" and that it remained intact during the recovery process is \" remarkable, \" the release notes. Also noteworthy is the fact that it came out of a mine in canada, which is known for having tough terrain to penetrate due to the sub-arctic conditions and dearth of access. \" it's very unusual for a diamond of this size in this part of the world, \" dominion chief executive officer shane durgin tells bloomberg. He adds that it's hard to say yet how much the diamond will ultimately be worth; it needs to be seen how it ends up once it's cut. Dominion will select a partner to do that job, and polish the stone to finish it off, in the next few weeks. ( a 163-carat white diamond went for $ 33.7m last year at auction. )",

City and county officials and employees honking for almost 10 years as they drive by to get back at you for placing a bid on a house: not so cool. Per courthouse news service, that's the claim of ohio resident garrick krlich's lawsuit filed thursday against the city of hubbard, trumbull county, and hubbard's police chief, all of whom krlich says \" intentionally turned a blind eye \" to an orchestrated campaign to \" harass, intimidate, terrorize, and retaliate against him, \" mainly via the car-honking. Why krlich says he's the object of retaliation: in 2007, he tried to buy at an auction a neighboring property that for nearly a century had been in the family of the town's fire chief at the time. Krlich says when he put in the highest offer, then-fire chief john clemente jr. Told him he'd better take it back or risk being \" bitter enemies. \" krlich kept his bid in, though for unspecified reasons, the property \" did not pass to him as it should have \" — and, he says, the harassment started anyway. Described on the krlich.com website ( subtitled \" small town terrorism \" ) as \" undeserved, uninterrupted, unyielding spite, \" the subsequent actions krlich says have been directed toward him — the relentless honking, an unsympathetic police department, a 911 service that hangs up on him — have been carried out by various hubbard firefighters driving city trucks, members of police chief james taafe's family, city councilmen, and others, per the suit. In a 2014 20/20 interview, krlich says the honking peaked at 100 times a day ( it's since died down to just a couple per day ); clemente and his wife noted in the same interview that krlich was simply litigious. \" if you beep your horn one time, he ' ll take you to court, \" marlene clemente said.",

She got a restraining order against belafonte on monday that bars him from her and their three children, tmz reports, and in the declaration, she says he's been physically abusing her, including choking her and punching her, since at least 2007. She says he also sexually abused her, forcing her to participate in three-ways that he sometimes taped, and that he has threatened to release the tapes to hurt her career — or to release them to children's services in an attempt to get her parental rights taken away. She says that in 2014 she attempted suicide by taking a bottle of aspirin, but then tried to call emergency services. Belafonte blocked her from doing so, she says, and locked her in the bedroom while telling her to die. She claims that every time she tried to leave, he threatened to destroy her life and take the children. She says that he got their nanny pregnant and suggested all of them live together, though ultimately, she claims, belafonte demanded the nanny terminate the pregnancy. She says multiple people saw evidence of the physical abuse over the years, but never reported it. Belafonte denies the allegations.",

This is an article from the issue the play that followed took place 30 years ago this month, but it's etched in my memory. Anders slalomed through traffic and headed upcourt, his spectacular jheri curl trailing him like tails on a kite. He passed half-court, picking up speed.

If somebody's done a great job and worked hard, it keeps the incentive to do a great job, \" he said. \" i think it's a nice thing to have the incentive, after a period of years, of being able to become a citizen. \" trump stressed, however, that the deal for roughly 700,000 dreamers would depend on securing $ 25 billion to build a border wall and $ 5 billion for other immigration-related spending. He said reporters could tell dreamers they had \" nothing to worry about. \" the proposal trump outlined sounds similar to one that senate minority leader chuck schumer said was \" off the table \" after the shutdown ended, the hill notes.

The 45.52-carat diamond has given up one of its secrets to french mineral scientist françois farges and jeffrey post, the smithsonian's curator of minerals. Their detective work involved computer modeling and a 17th-century lead replica that farges found in 2009 among the national d ' histoire naturelle's collection, and led them to an intriguing conclusion: when king louis xiv possessed the diamond, it was mounted on a gold background and cut in a way that could cause a sun to appear at the blue stone's center — all too appropriate for the sun king, whose colors were blue and gold, reports smithsonian magazine. Louis xiv bought the originally 112 3/16-carat, crudely cut diamond in 1668 from a french merchant who obtained the jewel somewhere in india. Five years later it was recut to its 67 1/8-carat size, according to the smithsonian encyclopedia, at which time it became known as the french blue. In the years between its theft ( in 1792, during the french revolution ) and reappearance ( in 1812, in britain ), it was again cut to its current size, obliterating those former dimensions — until farges uncovered the replica, which would have been used by jewelers in need of a stand-in for the actual diamond while creating settings. But the replica made clear that the french blue was cut in an unusual way, eschewing the sharp angles that maximize the reflection of light. In exploring the reasoning behind the cut, farges and post arrived at their conclusion. Interestingly, it was only with the discovery of the replica that it was conclusively proven that the french blue and the hope diamond were the same stone.

Dubbed the rq-180, the unmanned northrop grumman plane is thought to have better stealth design and aerodynamics than the lockheed martin rq-170 sentinel that often flew out of afghanistan ( one was apparently captured by iran ). The air force won't confirm, but northrop grumman's financial reports and area 51's big new hangars suggest that rq-180 testing is underway. This explains how the air force is planning to improve its isr ( intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance ) in \" contested \" areas — a problem they have admitted to before. \" the mix is not where it needs to be, \" said an air force isr official three months ago. \" we are over-invested in permissive isr and we have to transform the force to fight and win in contested environments. \" in other words, \" permissive \" areas like afghanistan and iraq are considered a thing of the past.

A week earlier and the storm would have struck earth on its orbit with \" catastrophic \" effects, nasa says, blacking out radios, damaging satellite communications and gps, and \" disabling everything that plugs into a wall socket. \" such a flare wouldn't hurt human life directly, and the southern and northern lights would be gorgeous, but the blast's mix of x-rays, extreme uv radiation, energetic particles, and massive clouds of magnetized plasma would cause an estimated $ 2 trillion in damage. It would also leave \" large parts of society \" crippled for months or years while workers replaced major transformers and substations, extremetech reports. The sun, on an 11-year solar-storm cycle, has nearly done this before: a massive storm called the \" carrington event \" struck earth in 1859 but couldn't inflict much electrical damage in the age of steam engines ( telegraph lines did spark and set fire ), and a pretty powerful storm caused blackouts across quebec in 1989. One physicist says there's a 12 % chance of a big solar blast hitting us over the next decade, which he calls a \" sobering figure. \" another is quoted in the guardian saying how lucky we are that the blast wasn't in sync with our orbit: \" earth and its inhabitants were incredibly fortunate that the 2012 eruption happened when it did, \" he says. \" we'd still be picking up the pieces. \" ( read about the sun's newly discovered \" long-lost brother. \" )",

The mcdowell county sheriff's department says thomas keith henderson of elkhorn was arrested late wednesday during a traffic stop on burke mountain near keystone. A criminal complaint says deputy r.l. Jones stopped the snow plow because the driver's side headlight was out. The deputy smelled alcohol and saw that jones ' eyes were bloodshot and glassy. The sheriff's department says henderson's blood alcohol level was 0.09. That's more than twice the 0.04 legal limit for commercial driver's license holders. Dot spokeswoman carrie bly confirmed henderson is employed by the department. She says the dot can't comment because it's an ongoing legal matter.

No. 2 on the list, ukrainian-born vladimir katriuk, has died in quebec at the age of 93, the toronto star reports. Katriuk, who moved to canada in 1951 and worked as a beekeeper for more than 50 years, was accused of being a \" particularly active participant \" in a massacre in what is now belarus in 1943, when he was a member of an ss battalion that allegedly carried out many atrocities, the guardian reports. Russia charged katriuk with genocide last month, but canadian authorities refused a request to send him to moscow, citing russia's actions in ukraine, reports the globe and mail. Katriuk had long been under suspicion, but the wheels of justice did not move quickly: in 1999, canadian authorities concluded he had entered the country under false pretenses, but in 2007 a decision to cancel his citizenship was overturned due to lack of evidence, the star reports. The man at the top of the most-wanted list is also 93 years old. Gerhard sommer is still alive in a hamburg-area nursing home, but german prosecutors say they've dropped their investigation because he suffers from dementia and isn't fit to stand trial, the ap reports. In 2005, he was one of 10 former ss officers an italian court found guilty of taking part in a massacre of 560 civilians in 1944, but german law didn't permit his extradition.",

Missing a train means waiting even longer in the suffocating heat of the rat-infested underground ovens that are new york subway stations. The trains are packed and sweaty, and the particularly unlucky commuter might get stuck in a car with broken air conditioning. But one brooklyn man has allegedly made a gutsy, incredibly dangerous habit to avoid all that, opting to ride on the outside of the train, \"where fresh breezes and mole people beckon from the velvety darkness, \" as gothamist put it. It was about 8: 30 a.m. Friday when the daring soul missed the northbound c train at the clinton-washington avenues stop in brooklyn. After the doors closed, the man, identified by the new york police department as 22-year-old isaiah thompson, grabbed onto the train from the outside. And off he went, surfing through the subway tunnel while some commuters — including one headphone-clad man looking at his phone — rode unsuspecting inside, according to a video captured by another subway rider, matthew beary. \"it was just sort of like spur-of-the-moment, take a camera out not knowing what was happening, but realizing as i ' m taking this video that this guy is clearly hanging on, \" beary told pix 11.

And the number of americans who engaged in not a single one of those 104 activities in all of 2014 is more than one in four of us: that's 83 million people, or 28 % of the us population over the age of 6, reports the wall street journal. \" we feel confident, in a sad way, that this is the largest number we've ever seen, \" says pac member and sports and fitness industry association exec tom cove, who adds it's the most dismal result he's seen in 24 years. The number of completely sedentary americans increased by 18 % since 2007. That's not to say we don't like the appearance of fitness, just the actuality of it: the journal notes the rise of \" athleisure \" apparel; such footwear saw sales jump 8 % in the year ending april 11, while performance shoes took an 18 % dive. The pac traces the decline to our schools, which help form our lifelong fitness habits and where kids are spending less time in gym class and recess. Another problem? the increasingly cutthroat nature of sports is forcing more casual athletes to the sidelines. Says cove: \" there are way too many kids who leave sports at age 9, 10, 11, because they simply have to make a decision: am i going to be a travel soccer kid and devote my life to this, or are there other things that i want to do? \" ( an editorial argues that it's not lack of exercise causing an obesity epidemic, it's the food industry's unhealthy products. )",

Joseph chen, a 47-year-old employee of evans transport, was crossing the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in his tractor-trailer around 12: 30pm, shortly after weather reports had indicated a level 1 wind advisory, meaning winds were clocking in at over 40mph, the virginian-pilot reports. The north carolina man was driving his truck southbound when his vehicle went over the side and into the 45-degree chesapeake bay. As his truck began to sink, chen was spotted standing atop it, offering hope he'd survive the freak accident. But after a navy chopper pulled him from the water, he died en route to the hospital. Just 30 minutes after chen's truck was swept off the bridge, the wind advisory was raised to a level 2, which means winds had crept up past 47mph. Between 1964 and 2011, 10 vehicles driving over that bridge have met similar fates, with only one survivor out of the bunch, per virginian-pilot records. A truck driver who crosses the bridge a couple of times a week tells wavy \" on a windy day, you can feel it \" and that his truck will sway from left to right, depending on the wind's direction. Meanwhile, chen's wife, billie jo, tells the virginian-pilot her husband \" was off the chain. \" they would've marked their 10-year anniversary in april. She added her husband, whom she said was \" awesome, \" had two kids from a previous marriage. ( a truck fell from the sky in san diego. )",

The medium ground finches of santa cruz island are having their newly hatched babies decimated by philornis downsi, a parasitic nest fly humans brought to the islands half a century ago. The flies lay their eggs inside the birds ' nests, and the hatching maggots feed on the young birds. \" this is like a really bad horror flick, \" study author dale clayton says. \" the babies can't withstand even one night with these parasites. \" according to discovery news, the flies were first spotted in the finches ' nests in 1997. Since then, the population has been growing, and none of the galapagos islands is free of the flies. Researchers looked at five years of field research on the medium ground finches specifically on santa cruz and came up with three scenarios — good, bad, and neutral — based on breeding, weather, and food supplies, discovery news reports. In both the bad and neutral scenarios, the finches have less than 100 years before they're extinct. According to smithsonian, the same fate is likely facing some of the other 14 species of darwin's finches. \" if darwin's finches go extinct, it will be because people brought this fly to the islands, \" clayton says. \" if the fly had gotten to the island more gradually, perhaps, maybe the birds would have had more time to adapt. \" researchers believe a 40 % reduction of nest infestations could save the finches and are looking at options to accomplish that, discovery news reports.

But the finches still bear darwin's name and are prized by biologists as one of the best examples of speciation — the process by which new species arise. Now, research suggests that at least some of darwin's famous finches might soon be driven to extinction by parasitic flies introduced to them by humans in the 1960s. A paper published this week in the journal of applied ecology blames the parasitic nest fly philornis downsi for the threat to geospitza fortis, also known as the medium ground finch. While adult p. Downsi flies are not themselves parasitic, they lay their eggs in bird nests. The eggs hatch into maggots, which feed on both brooding adult finches and their babies. The adult birds are unaffected, but it's another story with the tiny nestlings. P. Downsi kills huge numbers of baby birds among darwin's finches and other land birds.

The flies can be found on every island in the galápagos. \"this is like a really bad horror flick, \" senior author dale clayton, an ecologist and parasite specialist at the university of utah, says",
            "An even more compelling mystery concerns a common sight in springtime — bright blue eggs in a robin's nest. To human eyes, they are beautifully unmistakable. They stand out from both the nest and the parent birds, so why are they bright blue? no one yet knows for sure. Biologists do know that pigment glands in the mother bird's body deposit the blue coloration onto the eggs, so it must have a critical function. Perhaps the dark color camouflages the eggs when the eggs are at the bottom of a dark nest, or the blue might blend in with the sky for some viewers. Some researchers have even speculated that the striking color helps mother birds to find their own eggs. For now, however, the case of the mysteriously blue robin's egg has yet to be cracked. This adelie penguin laid a speckled egg that matches its environment. The matching phenomenon could lead to a twist to the old riddle: which came first, the chicken or the egg? in this case, the teaser could be: which came first, the egg color and pattern, or the choice of nesting site? by itself, the egg of a swan is just as visible as a bright white egg on a breakfast plate. Under the mother swan, however, the egg disappears"

Roseann j. Difrancesco apparently tripped and fell, causing her medical alert necklace to become caught on her walker, the patriot-news reports. The result, says coroner charles hall, was that her upper torso was suspended above the floor, creating pressure on her neck that cut off air and blood flow. Relatives had last spoken to difrancesco on feb. 12. A visiting nurse found the woman dead in her bathroom feb. 15, when the nurse entered difrancesco's home after unsuccessful attempts to summon her by knocking on the door. It is unclear when difrancesco died. Her death was ruled an accident, fox 43 reports. The device ( similar to the ones popularized by \" i've fallen and i can't get up \" commercials ) did not have a breakaway lanyard, as some do, per the patriot-news. The fda has warned of potential choking with such devices, which typically include a pendant with a button to call for help, saying the agency is aware of at least six serious injuries or deaths related to their use between 1998 and 2009. \" risks are greater for those with mobility limitations or for those who use wheelchairs, walkers, beds with guard rails, or other objects that could entangle with a neck cord, \" the fda says in a press release.

The left hemisphere has always been dominant when interpreting language, be it spoken, written, signed, or even clicked, explains new scientist. But that changed when german researcher onur güntürkün decided to study the whistled version of turkish. Güntürkün wanted to see if its musicality might require the brain's right hemisphere, which handles frequency, pitch, and melody. His study of 31 whistled turkish speakers showed the left hemisphere was 75 % dominant with spoken turkish, but the split between hemispheres was even with the whistled language. \" we've shown for the first time equal contributions from both hemispheres, \" says güntürkün, whose study was published in current biology. He tells the new yorker that this suggests our brain structure \" is not as fixed as we assume \" and that the way information is delivered changes it. The language developed because whistles carry further than spoken words, and its messages can be understood across mountains and valleys. ( the new yorker offers an example of a whistle that means, \" do you have fresh bread? \" ) it's lucky güntürkün got his study in when he did, as modern technology is killing off whistled turkish. \" you can gossip with a mobile phone, but you can't do that with whistling because the whole valley hears, \" he says.

Kuşköy is remarkable not for how it looks but for how it sounds: here, the roar of the water and the daily calls to prayer are often accompanied by loud, lilting whistles — the distinctive tones of the local language.

        "summary": "A new study on psychology research is essentially bashing all other psychology studies. The research area has gotten a bad rap recently thanks to retracted research papers, so psychologists set out to discover what was going on. When research is valid, others should be able to duplicate the study and come up with the same results. But when more than 250 scientists tried to re-create 100 studies from three respected psychology journals — working closely with original researchers — the results matched in just 39 cases. Even among those, 83 % were found to have smaller effects than first reported, reports the verge. The studies covered topics like personality, relationships, learning, and memory, and were the kind trusted by therapists and educators, reports the new york times. A scientist argues the reproducibility issue could apply across other fields, too. \" to see it so clearly, on such a large scale — it's unprecedented, \" adds another. \" there is little known about the reproducibility of research in general, \" says study author brian nosek. \" and there has been a growing concern that reproducibility may be lower than expected or desired. \" he adds that scientific journals tend to focus on new research, so those hoping to get published don't waste time testing older studies. Nosek doesn't consider the results \" negative or pessimistic, \" but he hopes they ' ll lead to self-correction and replication standards. So are these results reproducible? \" even this project itself is not a final word, a last word, a definitive word about reproducibility, \" nosek says.",

The 53-year-old says his revelations, which came during a week when the university was remembering brogan dulle, a student who hanged himself in 2014, were his way of shattering the mental illness stigma and supporting others with similar struggles. \" i felt that if i really wanted to break the silence, the right thing to do was to take advantage of the fact that i communicate with a lot of people over twitter and social media, \" he says. \" i wanted to get that message out to a broader audience. \" ono's message was lauded online and by colleagues like dr. Phil diller, head of the college's department of family and community medicine, who says ono was particularly affected after dulle's death and helped lobby for resources so the school could offer more mental health services, including five free counseling sessions to which every student is now entitled. Meanwhile, dulle's mom says ono has become a family friend. \" it's amazing that he was willing to share that to help other people, \" she says. \" it's not easy for people to talk about things like that. \" ono says he's now been free of symptoms for 25 years and that although he would've been \" petrified \" to talk about his struggles during his younger years, \" now i ' m speaking from a much stronger station in life, and it's important for me and others to speak about this to encourage legislators to support more programs. \" ( the suicide rate has jumped for most americans. )",

Three judges and a sloppily filled-in ballot have erased shelly simonds'dramatic one-vote virginia house win that made headlines tuesday, the new york times reports. Republican incumbent david yancey held a 10-vote lead after election day for virginia's 94th house district. But a recount tuesday gave challenger simonds a one-vote win and democrats a 50-50 tie in the virginia house. The recount ended 17 years of republican control in the virginia house, the washington post notes. But on wednesday, republicans took the recount result to court over a ballot that had been discarded by election officials during the recount, the virginian-pilot reports. The problem: bubbles for both yancey and simonds had been filled in. Judges on wednesday ruled the ballot should be counted as a vote for yancey. Simonds ' bubble had a strike through it, and all other votes on the ballot were for republicans. Yancey and simonds are now tied at 11,608 votes each, and republicans hold a 50-49 majority in the virginia house. The next representative of the 94th house district will now be chosen \" by lot, \" as per state law. The chairman of virginia's board of elections says this will most likely involve picking a name out of a bowl. Whoever loses the drawing can still petition for a second recount. \" i ' m really grateful that every vote has been counted, \" yancey says. But democrats are upset the ballot wasn't challenged until after republicans had approved the recount results and congratulated simonds on her victory.",

The country's president, tommy remengesau, is planning to introduce legislation restricting hotel development to five-star chains, a move that would effectively make palau a \" luxury only \" nation, the telegraph reports. Remengesau says mass tourism is damaging the environment of palau, which is made up of around 250 islands, and he wants to pursue a \" quality not quantity \" strategy. \" there's a right way to do things and there's a wrong way to do things, \" says the president, per the bbc. And when it comes to development, he adds, \" the best spots around the world have blended in with the environment. \" radio new zealand notes that the proposal comes after massive growth in tourism over the last couple of years, most of which involved package tours from mainland china. Remengesau says tourism spending actually went up after steps were taken to reduce the number of charter flights from china. ( a tourism slogan in australia is pretty darn explicit. )",

Seven months ago, the world anti-doping agency published a scathing report accusing russia of a doping scheme involving the government, law enforcement, athletes and coaches, and even doctors, a lab, and russia's anti-doping agency. Since then, the nation's track and field athletes have been suspended from international competition; russian authorities did not fight that suspension, though russia has denied the allegations. The iaaf, track and field's global governing body, made the decision about the rio games friday. Usa today says it will almost certainly be challenged, naming one pole vaulter who has threatened to file a discrimination case. Russian officials had volunteered to send only athletes who had never been disciplined for drug use. But, per a source familiar with the iaaf's decision, officials say russia hasn't done enough to convince the world its athletes are clean. The international olympic committee will discuss the iaaf's decision next week, but the times says it would be unusual for the ioc to amend the ruling. Whistleblowers have alleged that russia's doping scheme has allowed athletes to appear clean even when they're not. Before the iaaf's vote friday, russia's sports minister released an open letter insisting that the country was fighting doping and noting that uk authorities recently conducted independent testing of russian athletes. But wada had earlier alleged that many russian athletes evaded that testing and that russian officials threatened the testing authorities.",

But events have a way of intruding on presidential agendas. In this instance, it's unavoidable. Syria's brazen disregard for humanitarian norms cannot go unanswered. \" bad idea: just what the world needs, yet another western military intervention in an arab or muslim country, writes seumas milne at the guardian. Too many questions persist about the alleged chemical weapons attack, he writes, adding that military strikes would only escalate the war. \" the risk is that they will invite retaliation by syria or its allies — including against israel — draw the us in deeper and spread the conflict. \" better for the west to use its leverage with the rebels to try to force cease-fire talks. Slow down: this is remarkably similar to the run-ups to both the iraq and afghanistan wars, writes patrick l smith at salon. \" make that tragically similar. History proceeds, we americans insist on the virtue of ignorance, on learning nothing and knowing nothing. And what we are about to get is what we get, predictably and always. \" give the un investigators the time they need, he urges. Ask congress: whatever the final decision, president obama must consult with congress about it, writes amy davidson at the new yorker. \" having people, representatives, raise their hands before you do something is not an empty ritual, even when they don't vote the way you want them to, \" she writes. The white house can't just ignore the war powers act whenever it's convenient. \" the administration needs to be interrogated, sharply, about just what it thinks is going to happen after the two or maybe three days of missile strikes that leaks tell us to expect. \"",

The customer soon realized things were \" not going well, \" however, when shabani started chastising him for not keeping his head still, which earned him an ear-twisting, per the report. The situation got worse when shabani allegedly \" snipped \" his ear with the scissors, drawing blood, and used a \" zero \" buzzer ( which provides the closest cut ) to swoop right down the middle of his head. The result? the customer got a buzz that left him \" looking a bit like larry from the three stooges, \" despain says. Which is when the customer says he got up to leave, with shabani allegedly yelling after him, \" you want a zero, right? \" shabani was cited for mayhem and disorderly conduct while armed, which the journal notes is not a criminal charge but a county ordinance violation. \" while it is not a crime to give someone a bad haircut, you will get arrested for intentionally snipping their ear with a scissors, \" despain says. The customer had another stylist elsewhere shave his head all the way to rid himself of the stooges look. Per a police report, shabani told cops the ear-snipping was an accident, but buzzfeed reports on yelp reviews that note other bad experiences at the salon, including one ex-patron that says his visit felt like it \" [ bordered ] on assault. \"",

According to the union, van dyke has been unable to hold a job due to bad publicity, and threats forced his wife to close her business. \" this officer is in a very difficult situation financially, \" angelo tells the ap. \" he has a family, and we would do it for anybody that works as a chicago police officer. \" the announcement of van dyke's job with the police union on wednesday sparked immediate criticism, and protesters were outside the fraternal order of police thursday, nbc chicago reports. \" if i killed someone, i wouldn't get bail, \" one protester says. \" if i killed someone, i don't have a union to make sure that i ' m employed. \" van dyke posted bond on $ 1.5 million bail, which the prosecution was against. The protester calls his hiring by the union a slap in the face to chicago residents. In a facebook post, a catholic priest and social activist calls van dyke's hiring a \" disgrace \" and says \" every union member should demand he be fired. \" video released last year shows van dyke firing 16 shots at the 17-year-old mcdonald, who was holding a knife, as mcdonald walked away from officers in october 2014.",

Bloomberg notes that they offer \" little that's new \" about putin, but that doesn't mean there aren't interesting moments, such as putin being shown working out on an exercise machine, feeding a horse, or playing ice hockey. Three notable quotes: no bad days: \" i am not a woman, so i don't have bad days. I am not trying to insult anyone. That's just the nature of things. There are certain natural cycles. \" on whether he'd shower in a submarine next to a gay man: \" well, i prefer not to go to the shower with him. Why provoke him? but you know, i ' m a judo master. \" on the prospect of a war between nuclear superpowers: \" as of today a missile shield would not protect the territory of the united states. Nobody would survive. \" reviews for the documentary are varied, with many criticizing stone for seeming to encourage putin instead of challenging him. Foreign policy says the documentary \" somehow manages to both spout the kremlin line and fall back on the laziest american clichés about russia, \" while the daily beast calls it a \" wildly irresponsible love letter \" to putin. But other outlets are not so critical; variety, for example, says it's \" a surprisingly intimate set of conversations \" that creates \" a destabilizing portrait \" of putin.

A joint us-mexico team, however, managed to rediscover the species found by american naturalist william beebe in 1936 by using his original field notes to retrace his steps and search for the nocturnal snake, which blends in with the island's rock formations, the ap reports. The expedition found 11 of the snakes, and dna tests confirmed that the clarion island snake is a unique species, reports the bbc. The snake is related to snakes found on part of the mexican coast more than 500 miles away, and researchers believe its ancestors may have arrived on a tree trunk washed out to sea long ago. Beebe returned from a visit to the island, located 400-plus miles off mexico's pacific coast, nearly 80 years ago with a snake preserved in a jar, but his sample had long been considered a labeling error and his find was largely struck from taxonomic registries. The national museum of natural history praised the team's work, describing the snake as the \" only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error. \" the rediscovery \" is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in, \" the museum said in a statement.",

The charges came out of a police bust on march 9, when cops say they found shortey at a super 8 motel in moore with a 17-year-old boy in a room stinking of pot. An investigation was kicked off after the boy's girlfriend called his dad, who in turn contacted the authorities, per the tulsa world.

For most poor would be stressful and would be places with poor health among the poor, but that's not at all what these data suggest, \" he tells cbs news. Media reports note that local health policies may have an effect ( new york city and san francisco banned trans fats and restricted tobacco use early on ), and chetty agrees that \" thinking about policies that change health behaviors at a local level is likely to be important. \" the study's other findings highlight the crushing effects of inequality. By analyzing over a billion tax and social security records, the stanford researchers found that the richest 1 % of men live roughly 15 years longer than the poorest 1 % of men. And in the 21st century, life expectancy has risen 2.3 years for the richest 5 % of men and 3 years for the richest 5 % of women, while the poorest 5 % of americans saw hardly any improvement. An overall three-year boost in lifespan, the washington post notes, is about the difference we'd expect to see from curing cancer.

While the poor are at a disadvantage, the odds of living a longer life are better for less affluent people in certain parts of the country than others. Stanford researchers analyzed more than one billion tax and social security records and report that there's an increasing gap in life expectancy between the richest one percent in the united states and the poorest one percent. For men, the difference in life expectancy is 14.6 years. For women, being in the top one percent means living an average of 10.1 years longer.

        "summary": "The conservative party swept to power today in britain's parliamentary elections, winning a wholly unexpected and resounding victory and bringing the election to a much-quicker-than-expected conclusion. Polls ahead of election day showed conservatives locked in a tight race with the opposition labour party, raising the possibility of days or weeks of negotiations to form a government. Instead, the party won an outright majority, taking 326 of 650 seats. But as prime minister david cameron returns to 10 downing street in a stronger position than before, a trio of big names are out: labour party leader ed miliband, nick clegg of the liberal democrats, and independence party leader nigel farage have resigned in the election's wake. More: line of the night, from cameron: \" i want my party, and i hope a government that i would like to lead, to reclaim a mantle that we should never have lost — the mantle of one nation, one united kingdom. \" cnn runs down the implications of the conservative party win. Two big ones: expect to start reading the word \" brexit \" much more often, with cameron having vowed to hold a 2017 referendum on whether the uk should remain a part of the eu. And could scotland leave britain? cnn presents the possibility, noting that the scottish national party's victory was a staggering one, with it taking 56 out of the 59 uk parliamentary seats in scotland. Cnn points to \" rumblings in the british press \" that such an snp victory could spur yet another referendum, this one in 2016, on a split. The view from michael wolff: \" it might be argued that the cameron government's campaign last year to defeat the referendum for scottish independence helped propel the popularity of the snp, which in turn undermined the labour party's traditional strength in scotland, thereby helping to [ ensure ] the tory victory, \" he writes in usa today.

That's still partly true, but it's important to note that the clinton-era shutdowns took place against the background of a booming economy. Today we have a weak economy, with falling government spending one main cause of that weakness. A shutdown would amount to a further economic hit, which could become a big deal if the shutdown went on for a long time. Photo still, a government shutdown looks benign compared with the possibility that congress might refuse to raise the debt ceiling. First of all, hitting the ceiling would force a huge, immediate spending"

Her mother, yusniar, was trying to get her and two other children to safety at the time. Antara reported wednesday that the girl's grandfather, ibrahim, met a teenager who had traveled from another region, banda aceh, saying she was trying to find her way home. The girl said she could not remember any of her relatives ' names apart from one -- ibrahim, antara said. He became convinced the girl was wati, and her parents also later identified the girl as their daughter by a small mole and a scar over her eyebrow, antara said. It added that reporters were not immediately told what had happened to the girl during the time she was away."

            "For nearly seven years, wati's parents believed their daughter had died when a tsunami hit indonesia's aceh in december 2004. Yet on wednesday, the 15-year-old returned home alive, according to reports by indonesia's state news agency antara. Wati was 8 when the tsunami hit aceh and she lost grip of her mother's arm, antara reports. For years, the family believed the girl had drowned in the water. Yet on wednesday, wati's grandfather ibrahim received a visit from an acquaintance who brought a young girl that was looking for her home. The news service writes that the girl was seen in a coffee shop where she sat in silence, and people had thought she was a beggar. She reportedly did not remember her parents ' or relatives ' names, except for one -- ibrahim. According to antara, wati's parents were reunited with their daughter and reportedly confirmed the teenage girl was their child after recognizing a mole and a scar. The tsunami that hit the coast of aceh on december 26, 2004, was triggered by the world's most powerful earthquake in 40 years. The tsunami hit more than 10 countries. Nearly 170,000 people were killed and almost 130,000 went missing.",
            "A girl who was believed to have been swept away by a massive tsunami that devastated coastlines in asia has reportedly shown up alive, nearly seven years to the day after she vanished. Indonesian state news agency antara reported the girl, named only as wati, was aged eight when she was ripped from her mother's arms by the rushing waters near her home in west aceh, indonesia, in december 2004. Her mother, yusniar, was trying to get her and two other children to safety at the time. Antara reported wednesday that the girl's grandfather, ibrahim, met a teenager who had traveled from another region, banda aceh, saying she was trying to find her way home. The girl said she could not remember any of her relatives ' names apart from one -- ibrahim, antara said. He became convinced the girl was wati, and her parents also later identified the girl as their daughter by a small mole and a scar over her eyebrow, antara said. It added that reporters were not immediately told what had happened to the girl during the time she was away."

Mcalester officials want to put it on display as a piece of history. But the state says it's keeping old sparky in storage, just in case the relic needs to be fired up again. \" that would be possible, \" a state doc spokesperson tells the mcalester news-capital. Old sparky had its heyday from 1915 to 1966, when it was used to execute 82 inmates at the oklahoma state penitentiary in mcalester. It now sits mothballed in a state facility, as the city and the doc bicker over who owns it. The newspaper has a letter from the doc to the city in 2010 in which it explains why the state needed to keep the chair. \"in the event our lethal injection protocol is ruled unconstitutional, the electric chair must be used by the state as the back-up method of execution. \" that might have seemed far-fetched at the time, but the state's lethal injection policies are now, in fact, under review after the botched execution of an inmate last month. Tennessee, meanwhile, just brought back its electric chair. All that is understood, says mcalester's mayor, but... Old sparky? \"that chair has not been used since 1966, \" steve harrison tells the guardian. \"my assumption would be if it ever got to the point the electric chair was needed again they would start with a new one. \" ( click to read about how lawmakers elsewhere prefer the return of the firing squad. )",

Corrections spokesman jerry massie said the electric chair is in storage. \"we haven't had much discussion about it, because it's not been real pressing at the moment, \" massie said. \"we haven't had that discussion yet, seriously. \" asked if the chair would be rewired and used again, massie said: \"it is possible. \" but he added: \"there is not much possibility of that, unless lethal injection is declared unconstitutional. \" state law allows for the electric chair or a firing squad to be used only if lethal injection is found to be unconstitutional.

He was granted a stay of execution after lockett's death and is now scheduled to die on november 13. The dispute over the chair predates the current execution crisis. Massie told the mcalester news-capital on friday that he stands by the department's claim to the chair. Mcalester mayor steve harrison told the guardian that the electric chair should be on display for the public to see. \"i would like to get it displayed somewhere since it is a historical artefact, \" harrison said. \"i don't think it does anybody any good for it to sit in storage somewhere. \" he said the chair, nicknamed old sparky, had been in a museum mcalester – a town of about 18,000 that is home to the state's death chamber – until the corrections department took it back. \"the transfer happened a number of years ago, and i ' m not sure anybody has the complete story on who legally owns it, \" harrison said. \"i ' m not sure where it is. \" harrison said he expects if oklahoma planned to electrocute an inmate, the state would get a new electric chair. \"that chair has not been used since 1966, \" harrison said. \"my assumption would be if it ever got to the point the electric chair was needed again they would start with a new one"

A third of all smoking worldwide takes place in the country, and \" unless there is change in china, we won't proceed further in reducing the tobacco epidemic in the world, \" a senior adviser at the world lung foundation says. Smoking rates in china have dipped a little over the last few decades, but population growth means there are now more smokers in the country than even before, the new york times finds. The average number of cigarettes smoked daily per smoker has actually risen since 1980, from 15 to 22. Unlike in other countries, however, greater independence has not caused an increase in smoking among chinese women: only around 4 % of the country's smokers are female, down from 8 % in 1980.",

Bradford wilcox says that not only do families who live in \" red \" conservative counties \" enjoy somewhat stronger families \" than those who live in \" blue \" liberal counties: he's also analyzed data about individual families, not just geographical areas, and finds that self-identified republicans are more likely than self-identified democrats to be married and less likely to be divorced, the new york times reports. And of married people between the ages of 20 and 60 polled in the survey on the institute of family studies website, wilcox found that 67 % of gopers reported they were \" very happy \" in matrimony, while only 60 % of democrats were, and 60 % of independents. The gap did shrink to three percentage points once certain other demographic factors were taken into account ( e.g., whites and religious people were more likely to say they have happy marriages ). However, kevin drum writes for mother jones that we should probably \" call it a tie \" instead, since the study was done for a right-wing website — \" you have to figure it's as friendly toward republicans as possible, \" he notes — and because republicans may simply be less likely to admit when their marriages are rocky. \" as wilcox says, ' perhaps republicans are more optimistic, more charitable, or more inclined to look at their marriages through rose-colored glasses, ' \" drum points out. But david leonhardt writes for the times that \" it also seems possible that the more respect and even reverence for the idea of marriage in conservative communities affects people's behavior and attitudes toward their marriages, \" adding that, \" given the widespread anxiety right now about upward mobility … it's worth looking for potential lessons from any political ideology. \" ( a stunning 99 % of evangelical christians said they were happy a few years back. )",
