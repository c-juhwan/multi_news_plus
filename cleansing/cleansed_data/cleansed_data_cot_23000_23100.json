        "summary": "In what is surely one of the most extreme reminders that money cannot buy everything, iran on sunday announced a death sentence had been handed to babak zanjani, whose fortune is worth an estimated $ 14 billion. The 42-year-old was arrested in december 2013, shortly after the election of president hassan rouhani, who ordered a crackdown on corruption that allegedly occurred during the eight-year rule of president mahmoud ahmadinejad. The bbc reports zanjani was instrumental in helping iran evade sanctions that would have otherwise prevented foreign oil sales. Iran's oil ministry accused him of withholding oil revenues channeled through his companies and says he owes more than $ 2.25 billion; zanjani has denied the allegations and can appeal. Zanjani and two of his associates were sentenced to death for \" money laundering, \" among other charges, a judiciary spokesman said in brief remarks broadcast on state tv. Previous state media reports have said the three were charged with forgery and fraud, reports the ap. \" the court has recognized the three defendants as ' corruptors on earth ' and sentenced them to death, \" said gholamhossein mohseni ejehi. \" corruptors on earth \" is an islamic term referring to crimes that are punishable by death because they have a major impact on society. The verdict came after a nearly five-month trial. Iran has in the past executed other wealthy individuals found guilty of similar charges. In 2014, billionaire businessman mahafarid amir khosravi was hanged over corruption charges.",

Rembert is charged with strangling and raping one woman in 1997, another woman earlier this year, and gunning down his cousin and a family friend in september.

Rembert also is accused of fatally shooting his cousin, jerry rembert, and a longtime family friend, morgan nietzelon sept. 20., police caught rembert the day after the killing in nietzel's suv at a medina county truck stop.

Mccullough, 74, says his mother essentially accused him of maria ridulph's murder from the grave — she was sedated and lay dying in a hospital bed when she told mccullough's sisters, \" john did it, \" prompting police to re-open the murder investigation. Mccullough's attorneys say her accusation should have been considered hearsay and not disclosed in court; testimony revealed she was \" emotionally disturbed, \" \" confused, \" and at times \" basically comatose \" when she said it, and mccullough's sisters gave contradicting testimony on what their mother meant when she said \" it. \" mccullough's 80-page appeal also says \" nostalgia \" is to blame for his guilty verdict in what cnn calls the \" coldest case ever solved. \" \" i think the problem with jack's trial is, it was all emotion-based, \" says mccullough's stepdaughter. Wnij has a portion of the brief, which lists the evidence against mccullough as: \" personal memories of what occurred 55 years ago; a photo identification made 53 years after the incident; testimony from jailhouse informants; innocuous statements from the defendant; and an improperly admitted and inconclusive statement from the defendant's mother while on morphine and haldol just before her death. \" the star witness in mccullough's trial was kathy sigman chapman, the last person to see ridulph alive; she never identified mccullough as the stranger who gave her friend a piggyback ride just before her disappearance until 53 years later, and mccullough's appeal says the photo she identified differs from the description of the man she previously gave. His lawyers point out that the judge excluded police and fbi reports from the initial 1957 investigation from current-day testimony, and mccullough was not allowed to present reports from that investigation showing he had been questioned and cleared at the time. The judge also barred a police detective's conclusion in the 1990s that another man, now dead, was the murderer, and prevented mccullough from calling that detective as a witness, the appeal asserts. In another cold case recently solved, an alleged murderer from 1981 was found 33 years later, living as... A church deacon.",

        "summary": "How can more than $ 4 million in medicare money flow through a small doctor's office in brooklyn? seeking answers, the new york times reports on the world of physical therapy — where demand is on the rise, treatments vary wildly by region, and authorities are cracking down on doctors who cheat the system. The brooklyn doctor, wael bakry, insists he's no cheat, saying he actually runs three offices that give a total of 1,950 patients an average of 94 treatments per year. That's more than triple the national average, but brooklyn physical therapists tend to bill patients more than counterparts around the country. Why? according to federal authorities, brooklyn is a hot spot for physical therapists who cheat the system. Factor in aging baby boomers who need more medical help, and the comparatively loose guidelines of physical therapy, and it's all too easy: \" an area like physical therapy is a bit gray because there's no set guideline on how much a given patient needs, \" says a professor who suggests variances may be explained by \" more entrepreneurial physicians. \" a us physical therapist bills on average $ 49,000 to medicare annually, so bakry's numbers do stand out — yet he says he's just successful. Meanwhile, medicare fraud stories are rife around the ' net — with an ambulance service indicted in a $ 1.5 million scheme, bloomberg news reports, and 10 people charged in a $ 69.4 million scheme in houston just last week, the houston chronicle reports.",

        "summary": "A fake funeral was held saturday for breaking bad character walter white in albuquerque, offering some 200 fans a chance to pay their last respects to a show that, as one attendee put it, \" brought people into albuquerque, it brought attention into albuquerque, and it brought money into albuquerque. \" the funeral also raised $ 17,000 for a local charity, with mourners paying to shovel dirt onto an empty coffin. Nevertheless, not everyone was happy about the event, especially family members of those buried at sunset memorial park, kob.com reports. That's because the funeral may have been fake, but the coffin, the gravesite it was laid in, and the headstone were all very real. \" my son is buried about 15 yards from where the makeshift gravesite is, \" says one father. \" this is a place of mourning. It's not a spectacle. \" but officials at sunset memorial park say they will remove the memorial if it becomes too much of a tourist attraction. \" we are a cemetery first and foremost, \" says the general manager, per the albuquerque journal. \" our allegiance lies with our families that have allowed us to bury their loved ones here. \" at least one petition is already calling for the gravesite to be taken down.",

The warning came via us counterintelligence authorities, per the journal's sources, and was based on the belief that murdoch could be capitalizing on the relationship she had with kushner and wife ivanka trump to push the chinese government's agenda. It flags one particular point of concern: a proposed $ 100 million chinese garden at the national arboretum on an elevated patch of land within 5 miles of the white house; it was to feature a 70-foot tower that raised surveillance concerns. A rep for murdoch says she is unaware \" of any garden projects funded by the chinese government, \" and said government staunchly denied it. The paper notes that none of the parties involved have been accused of doing anything nefarious. The upshot seems to be that the warning \" was part of an effort \" to tell someone \" new to government [ of ] the need to be careful in his dealings with people whose interests may not align with those of the us. \" such a warning in such a scenario is not uncommon. New york magazine points out the story comes via a paper owned by news corp, whose ceo is murdoch's ex, rupert murdoch. It flags this monday tweet from fire and fury author michael wolff ( a co-founder of newser ), who also wrote a biography on rupert murdoch: \" since their divorce, murdoch has been telling anybody who would listen that wendi is a chinese spy -- and had been throughout the marriage. \"",

Well, more than some: it has at least 3,100 signatures — not quite 5 % of the workforce — and implores pichai to withdraw the company from project maven. That's a pentagon program focused on using artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage, and the new york times reports it could increase the precision of drone strikes. The times sees this fight as a sort of bellwether for what's to come as ai advances developed in silicon valley are more frequently put to use by the military. \" we believe that google should not be in the business of war, \" states what fast company calls a \" fiery \" letter. The employees write that they want the company to turn that sentiment into policy by pledging to never \" build warfare technology. \" though google says the company's role in project maven is limited to \" non-offensive purposes, \" the letter states that \" the technology is being built for the military, and once it's delivered it could easily be used to assist in \" tasks like launching weapons. The times makes the argument that the publicity around the contract — first revealed in march by gizmodo — could hamper google when it comes to the ultra-competitive recruitment of ai researchers, who might find the military connection off-putting. That said, amazon and microsoft also have pentagon contracts, but the letter-signers write that those companies ' military work \" doesn't make this any less risky for google.

            "Format: audio cd verified purchase i've been a bf5 fan since hearing \" the battle of who could care less \" on the radio in 1997. I was disappointed when they broke up, but understood... You can only play \" brick \" so many times before wanting to do something else. I've followed folds's career since then, and liked some albums/projects better than others... But always felt that the bf5 material was better, because sledge and jessee contributed to it as musical equals, rather than hired guns ( see the solo beatles catalogs for other examples of this phenomenon ). Anyhow, how's the record? it's really good!: ) \" erase me \" and \" do it anyway \" are ( imho ) the equal of anything in the bf5 catalog, and several of the other tunes are worthy as well... And even the weaker songs are much improved by the personality that is added through being ben folds five tracks rather than folds solo work. For me, this one sits about equal with tuborm... Maybe a few of the songs here are weaker than any on that record, but the best of these are better than any of those... If that makes sense. So buy it already. It's a good record, and we want to encourage them to make more. And go see the tour; that's pretty great, too, based on the show i saw. One more thing. I ' m very happy to report that ( again, imho ) this album isn't an exercise in nostalgia and trying to recapture the 90s. This is a new, current record that reflects where these 3 guys are now, and that's awesome. I'd say it shows progression and growth for the band, and points forward rather than looking behind. Only the coolest beans.: )",

Not surprisingly, the independent reports that many are suspicious the whole thing could be a hoax, or perhaps a pr stunt to bring attention to the bar where the ill-fated lovers supposedly met. ( the bar denies it. ) amyot says she's back in mooloolaba trying to find the six-foot-tall, tan, blond-haired, blue-eyed guy, the courier &amp; mail reports, and she's desperate because, well, first of all, it was \" love at first sight, \" and second of all, she has \" no family of my own. \" she also has a facebook page, where she's posted status updates like, \" i ' m shaking now i ' m in crying now...... What if he doesn't want to see me now, maybe he is shy.... Am so lonely right now. \" but, as the independent notes, her first facebook page ( which she linked on youtube ) disappeared, and the current page is a \" public figure \" account.",

But the company's ceo now says they eventually opted not to offer such a safety feature, because it appeared to not be very safe at all, per reuters. Waymo chief john krafcik says what the self-driving team saw during 2013 test runs, which involved google employees riding in the vehicles with video cameras installed to survey the scene, was \" pretty scary. \" the videos showed that human passengers lost track of what was going on, instead checking their phones, doing their makeup, and even dozing off — making it difficult for them to jump behind the wheel at a second's notice. \" it's hard [ for drivers ] to take over because they have lost contextual awareness, \" krafcik said. Instead, waymo passengers in a pilot program in phoenix are now given limited controls in their chrysler pacifica minivans via four buttons only, per wired: a \" help \" button, a button to lock and unlock the doors, a \" start ride \" button, and a \" pull over here \" button, which allows a passenger to hop out at any point during the ride or pick up another passenger. \" our technology takes care of all of the driving, allowing passengers to stay passengers, \" a company report said earlier this month. The verge mentions other waymo \" complications and unanswered questions, \" which the company is said to be \" furiously working to address \" in its quest for full self-driving autonomy. \" our goal … is to bring this technology to the public — to the world, \" krafcik says.

The terms are laid out in a spending bill president obama signed into law last week, which also includes reparation for victims of other terrorist attacks, including the 1998 us embassy bombings in east africa, reports the new york times. The 1981 agreement that secured the release of those taken hostage at the us embassy in tehran on nov. 4, 1979, barred them from seeking amends. Legal appeals were later blocked, though renewed pleas for compensation followed the release of 2012's argo. Finally, when bank bnp paribas was forced to pay $ 9 billion for violating sanctions against iran, sudan, and cuba, this year, congress moved to set aside $ 1 billion for terrorism victims. The 37 surviving hostages will receive up to $ 10,000 per day of captivity, while spouses and children can receive a lump sum of up to $ 600,000, per the times. The money should be awarded within a year. \" the money can't bring back family members, or the 444 days of their lives. But it would bring some closure and some justice, \" georgia sen. Johnny isakson tells the telegraph. \" i had to pull over to the side of the road, and i basically cried, \" a former embassy security guard says of hearing the news, noting it took \" 36 years, one month, 14 days \" for iran to be held accountable. \" i don't believe that they will ever, ever apologize, \" he adds. \" they don't believe that they did anything wrong. \" officials note many of the hostages were tortured and continue to suffer, including from ptsd. The law signed friday also designates $ 2.8 billion for victims of the 9/11 attacks and their families.",

At a presser, connie jones revealed how she'd dealt with threats from her ex ( who killed himself june 4 during a police standoff ) against her and her son since she'd filed for divorce in 2009, and that she'd always felt she would be the one her ex would attempt to murder. \" i knew one day we would be in a situation where he was trying to kill me, \" she told reporters, per the phoenix new times. \" his death is the best thing to come out of this ordeal. \" connie jones documents years of threats, including her ex saying he'd kill her, kidnap their son, kill both her and their son, or murder just their son to \" torture \" her. Cnn documents the steps she took to stay safe, including changing routines and schedules ( meaning they avoided favorite spots and kept switching grocers ), setting up multiple safe houses, and obtaining round-the-clock security. The los angeles times notes jones hired private investigator rick anglin to offer her \" extensive \" training in weapons and defensive driving; she ended up marrying him. Anglin was the one who put the pieces together and told cops his suspicions that dwight jones had carried out the murders. Connie jones says she's saddened over the killings but adds she was \" very happy \" when she heard her ex had died: \" [ i felt ] relief in my chest that this … would be the last that i had to deal with him. \"",

Add interest here are five storylines to watch out for today: from the present to the future the convention heard from two former presidents last night ( jimmy carter by video and bill clinton in person ), and tonight delegates will hear from soon-to-be former president barack obama and vice president joe biden. Both men have publicly lauded clinton and supported her campaign, and obama held a joint campaign appearance with clinton in north carolina earlier this month. At that appearance, he said that no one has ever been \"more qualified for this office than hillary clinton. \" meanwhile, biden went on the offensive against donald trump and his running mate, mike pence, during an interview with abc news on tuesday at the dnc, saying, \"these guys don't know what they're talking about \" when it comes to isis.

In the opinion piece, he didn't mention clinton once but explained that he decided not to run because \"my candidacy could lead to the election of donald trump or sen. Ted cruz. That is not a risk i can take in good conscience, \" he said of the two republicans who were in the midst of their party's primary contest"

This late in the calendar year, \" says national weather service meteorologist joe sirard. Records go back to 1877. However, sirard said that today's high could top the dtla landmark temperature. Official readings for downtown are measured at usc. Downtown's record high on monday bested the previous record of 98 degrees, which was set in 1965. Lax hit a record of 101, which beat 97 in ' 65, and long beach airport reached a stratospheric 105, topping 98 in ' 65, according to the national weather service. The late-october heatwave was being generated by a massive high-pressure system that extends from baja california to oregon. Not only is it producing rare triple-digit temperatures along the coast as offshore winds push cool ocean air back but it's also creating heat well into the evening hours.

            "Los angeles — as the baseball season has grown ever longer, occasionally running past halloween, the world series has provided vivid imagery of the cost of playing late at night so deep into the calendar. In series games in the northeast and midwest, it has become commonplace to see fans swaddled in blankets and winter wear looking no more comfortable than the players, who sometimes wear turtlenecks or hand warmers or, in more extreme cases, balaclavas that wrap around a person's head and face. Such measures, however, will not be necessary on tuesday, when the houston astros and the los angeles dodgers open the 2017 world series at dodger stadium. Temperatures in los angeles are forecast to reach triple digits on tuesday, and when the first pitch is thrown at 5: 08 p.m. Pacific time, it is expected to be right around 97 degrees — which would be a record high for a series game. The current high mark came during the 2001 world series, when the temperature was 94 degrees at the start of game 1, in phoenix, between the arizona diamondbacks and the yankees."

        "summary": "Police in britain say they believe the man behind london's deadliest terror attack since 2005 \" acted alone and was inspired by international terrorism \" — though they've also arrested seven people around the country in connection with the attack. London police counterterrorism chief mark rowley said thursday that hundreds of police officers worked through the night and raided six addresses, the bbc reports. He revised the death toll from the attack from five to four, including the attacker, who was shot dead by police after mowing down dozens of pedestrians on a bridge in his vehicle and fatally stabbing a police officer on the ground of parliament. The latest developments: prime minister theresa may, who was rushed away from parliament during the attack, issued a statement wednesday night denouncing \" the sick and depraved terrorist attack on the streets of our capital, \" the new york times reports. She said the full details of the attack are still emerging. Police haven't disclosed the identity of the attacker, though they say he was already known to authorities, cnn reports. Rowley said the attack appears to have been \" islamist-related terrorism. \" rowley said 29 people injured in the attack are still in the hospital, seven of them in critical condition, reuters reports. He did not confirm the nationalities of the dead, but he said the two members of the public killed were a woman in her mid-40s and a man in his mid-50s. The ap reports that a doctor who treated some of the people hit on the bridge by the attacker's hyundai suv said some received \" catastrophic \" injuries. The victims include three police officers, five south korean tourists, and three french teenagers who were on a school trip. May said parliament will resume as normal thursday and she plans to deliver an address in the house of commons, reports the washington post. The telegraph, which has a reconstruction of the attack, reports that according to members of parliament, the attacker entered the grounds through a well-known \" weak spot \" — a vehicle gate usually left unlocked and slightly ajar. Witnesses say the attacker plunged a knife into an unarmed police officer before another officer shot him dead. The guardian reports that lawmakers have returned to work.

Look again, and there are only women — because only women are allowed to live there, the guardian reports. Located in northern kenya, the matriarchal village is currently home to 47 women who have fled a culture of sexual violence, child marriage, and female genital mutilation among the semi-nomadic samburu people. Many will talk freely: one says she was \" traded for cows by my father when i was 11 years old \" to a 57-year-old man and fled the marriage on its first day. Another was raped by men in british-soldier uniforms and beaten by her husband when he found out. Village founder rebecca lolosoli says she was beaten for discussing women's rights in her village. Umoja was started 25 years ago by 15 women allegedly raped by british soldiers — and once raped, \" they are not clean any more in islam and qur ' an culture, \" a resident says. Several of them made rape allegations spanning 30 years, mostly against british soldiers, and presented their mixed-race children as evidence. But when royal military police investigated, no dna tests were made and all paperwork in the cases vanished. Police ultimately addressed rape allegations by 2,187 kenyan women and dismissed them all, reuters reported at the time. Despite their shared pain, umoja residents talk about the pleasures of selling home-made beads and raising children fathered by men in neighboring villages. \" i don't want to ever leave this supportive community of women, \" says one. \" we don't have much, but in umoja i have everything i need. \"",

The whale, who died monday, had been undergoing treatment for a pathogen, candida, in her bladder for months and was under \" constant care, \" the park says, per the san antonio express-news. A necropsy will determine the cause of death. Female killer whales typically live 30 to 50 years; a killer whale hasn't died of candida at seaworld for some 25 years, reports the washington post. However, a 2-year-old beluga whale suffering from gastrointestinal issues died at the park last month, four months after the death of a baby beluga born prematurely. \" after a review of each of these cases, none of the issues were related to each other, or to the care that the animals received, \" the park says, adding, \" we have no evidence that unna was stressed from her environment. \" animal rights activists are skeptical. While candida occurs both in wild and captive whale populations, they say stresses of life in captivity — including dehydration, cramped quarters, and abnormal diet — could hurt a whale's ability to fight an infection, per gawker. Seaworld's website notes unna received medication never before used on killer whales, as part of a plan developed by veterinarians and experts, because she didn't respond to conventional treatments.

Though politico reports he finished \" a distant \" third in west virginia's republican primary for us senate — state attorney general patrick morrisey secured the nomination — he still plans to vie for the seat and says he will run in november as the constitution party candidate. But whether he legally can do so is questionable. The state in march passed a bill that made its so-called \" sore loser \" law clear: it stipulates that candidates who try and fail to secure the nomination of a recognized political party during a primary cannot then switch to a \" minor party organization/unaffiliated candidate \" in order to get his or her name on the ballot. But it doesn't go into effect until june, and legal experts tell the charleston gazette-mail that the code's current wording could leave the door open to a legal challenge. It refers to \" candidates who are not already candidates in the primary election for public office. \" as one expert explains, there's a tense problem there: blankenship was a candidate, not is a candidate. Blankenship on monday indicated he's up for a legal fight, saying, \" although the establishment will likely begin their efforts against us by mounting a legal challenge to my candidacy, we are confident that — if challenged — our legal position will prevail, absent a politically motivated decision by the courts. \" should he succeed, the hill predicts he could seriously imperil morrisey's chances of taking the seat from democratic sen.

            "Pfeiffer syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the premature fusion of certain skull bones ( craniosynostosis ). This early fusion prevents the skull from growing normally and affects the shape of the head and face. Pfeiffer syndrome also affects bones in the hands and feet. Many of the characteristic facial features of pfeiffer syndrome result from premature fusion of the skull bones. Abnormal growth of these bones leads to bulging and, a high forehead, an underdeveloped upper jaw, and a beaked nose. More than half of all children with pfeiffer syndrome have hearing loss; dental problems are also common. In people with pfeiffer syndrome, the thumbs and first ( big ) toes are wide and bend away from the other digits. And ( brachydactyly ) are also common, and there may be some between the digits ( syndactyly ). Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three subtypes. Type 1, also known as classic pfeiffer syndrome, has symptoms as described above. Most individuals with type 1 pfeiffer syndrome have normal intelligence and a normal life span. Types 2 and 3 are more severe forms of pfeiffer syndrome that often involve problems with the nervous system. The premature fusion of skull bones can limit brain growth, leading to delayed development and other neurological problems. In addition, individuals with type 2 or 3 can have fusion of the bones ("

The existence of the plot was revealed late last month, and now police are providing details: khaled mahmoud khayat, 49, and mahmoud khayat, 32, were charged thursday with planning a terrorist act. Police on friday said the unsuspecting brother of one of the men was to carry an ied disguised as a meat mincer onto an etihad airways flight departing sydney for abu dhabi on july 15, reports reuters. The bomb had been created with guidance from isis, which allegedly mailed the men some of the necessary components via turkey. But though the luggage in which the ied had been placed entered sydney airport, it never made it beyond the check-in counter. The details here are a bit vague: the sydney morning herald reports the bag was determined to be too heavy and was never checked in. Reuters says it's believed one of the suspects left the airport with the bag; the unwitting brother boarded the flight. Police reportedly seized the ied device in raids last month. A security expert speculates on the methodology to reuters: \" if someone does a quick physical inspection it just looks like what it is, a meat grinder, because it's not electrical or electronic, it's less likely to be suspicious. \" under the direction of an isis operative in syria, the suspects were also trying to create a chemical device intended to release hydrogen sulfide in a crowded public area, \" potentially public transport, \" police say, per cnn.

It shows him sitting at a small desk as he peers through an opening into the room where her mother is in isolation. It's been shared 10,000 times and liked more than 13,000 times. Mackenna explains to cbs that after having radioactive iodine treatment her mom had to sequester herself for five days so as not to expose others to radiation. She says her dad initially sat in the backyard and spoke to his wife through a window, and moved inside for her two final solo days. \" the amount of love i've received is crazy and i didn't expect any of it, but i ' m so grateful, \" mackenna tells buzzfeed. As for what her father is doing, she says it's just \" how our family is; we take care of each other. \" ( see how this man paid for his wife's medical bills. )",

The fossilized eggs are 152 million years old and were dug up during a years-long excavation in portugal — with some of them found in dinosaur nests, strangely enough. Researchers say it's unclear why the crocodile eggs were in dinosaur nests, but it seems \" to suggest some form of biological relationship. \" the eggs were laid by members of a group of prehistoric crocodiles known as crocodylomorphs. The telegraph reports they appear to be from two different types of crocodylomorph. The newly discovered eggs are 40 million years older than the previous oldest known crocodile eggs and yet are strikingly similar to the eggs of modern crocodiles. One egg clutch contained 13 intact eggs, making it the most complete clutch of ancient crocodile eggs ever found. ( it turns out dinosaur eggs hatched in a potentially troublesome way. )",

The calf, which was a girl, was the first one to be born alive from that pod in three years, the washington post reports. \" it's unbelievably sad, \" a wildlife biologist with the northwest fisheries science center tells the times. Taylor shedd, who works for the soundwatch marine wildlife protection group, says the worry now is that the mother killer whale may be putting her own health at risk and has had trouble keeping pace with her pod while shoving her 400-pound calf along. \" she has 4 knots of current ripping at her, and she has to dive really deep to get the baby when it rolls off, to pick it up and keep pushing it in front of her, \" shedd says, noting the mother's breathing has become labored. J35 was last reported carrying her calf on thursday evening, in a show of grief that animal experts say isn't uncommon: at least seven other species carry the bodies of its deceased members, including three types of dolphin. \" she carried the calf in her womb from 17 to 18 months, she is bonded to it and she doesn't want to let it go, \" says the research chief for the wild orca nonprofit, calling the sight of j35's plight \" horrible. \" \" it is that simple.

On oct. 14, cops came into the store where eatman works to see if it was selling illegal cigarettes, and when they ran her name, they found a 1994 warrant for community service she hadn't completed for a minor drug-possession infraction. Eatman was arrested and waited in a jail cell for 10 days, at which point she was hauled before an irritated judge, denied bond, and thrown back in jail for another 39 days. The problem? the remainder of that old community service had been terminated by a judge at the time after it was deemed eatman had tried to fulfill it and couldn't due to logistical tie-ups that weren't her fault. The warrant in her name somehow remained, leading to her arrest more than two decades later. It was only when the cook county sheriff's office was doing an audit of jailed women that they found eatman's case and \" raised holy hell with the prosecutor's office, \" per sheriff's rep cara smith. Eatman, who tried to hide from her young son why she was gone by telling him she was at school or on business, was released the day after the sheriff's office intervened. Smith, who says eatman was let out \" without so much as an apology or an explanation, \" notes eatman is working extra hours to pay all the bills that racked up while she was in jail not earning money. \" you wonder why these communities don't trust law enforcement, \" smith says. \" can you imagine a more thoughtless, cruel way to handle this? \" ( parents at a nyc nursery school were wary of this celebrity's community service. )",

Only sparklers this time! \" reports the telegraph. After receiving dozens of angry responses, the embassy apologized, saying \" we meant to mark an event in history &amp; celebrate our strong friendship today. \" the war of 1812 attack forced president james madison — who headed to the field of battle armed with two pistols when he heard the british were approaching — to flee to a shack in virginia. \" it was one of the most humiliating military defeats of american history — to see their capital burned, their army literally running away, and president madison and his wife, dolley, forced to abandon the white house, \" historian peter snow tells national geographic. \" it was a catastrophe. \" the washington post has more on the british invasion — including dolley madison's rescue of a famous george washington painting, the looting of the white house by local vagrants, and the british decision to spare the patent office — while the bbc looks at the british officer who led the troops that burned the white house, and the american plot to burn down his home village as revenge.",

A us military rep adds that \" we were able to hear everything that was going on, \" including 10 warnings issued to the russian pilots, per the washington post. A turkish official tells the new york times that moscow shouldn't be surprised at what happened. \"i personally was expecting something like this, because in the past months there have been so many incidents like that, \" says the undersecretary of defense. \"our engagement rules were very clear, and any sovereign nation has a right to defend its airspace. \" russian officials have proposed canceling a proposed gas pipeline to turkey and a ban on turkish airlines in the aftermath, but so far have only told russian citizens to avoid turkey. Russia also plans to send s-400 anti-missile systems to its airbase in northwestern syria — a move that could further hamper the us-led coalition's moves against isis.

        "summary": "The new and supposedly improved healthcare.gov isn't off to a great start. The site flooded with traffic yesterday morning, slowing it to a crawl and spiking its error rate, the la times reports. By 10am the government had turned on a \" queuing \" feature, essentially putting would-be applicants on hold. At that point about 35,000 people were on the site — less than its promised capacity of 50,000. Later in the day the administration said that performance had improved, and that 750,000 had used the site by 5: 30pm. But here's the rub: many of those people might not actually be insured. Insurers began sounding the alarm yesterday, because errors are still plaguing the back end of the site where people actually buy coverage. Many may not actually be enrolled, nbc news reports. The administration says it's urging people to make sure they've submitted a payment, and to check with their insurer. It's an ongoing problem; roughly a third of enrollment attempts since oct. 1 have been plagued with errors, meaning those people might not have the coverage they expect, sources tell the washington post. The administration disputed that number, but wouldn't provide one of its own. \" health insurers are still seeing enrollments that are duplicated, missing information, things like that, \" the head of an industry group says. The administration met with insurance industry leaders yesterday in an attempt to clear up the problems with the forms, called \" 834s. \" many consumers, meanwhile, were frustrated. The queuing system let users put in their email address, saying they'd be notified when they could sign on. But the post talked to one woman who, upon getting the email, found she still couldn't log on. Some users took to twitter, and posted screenshots of their error messages; you can see examples on twitchy. \" i have been trying for two days and still can't get this system to do anything but make me redo it, \" one user wrote. \" this doesn't work fail! \"",

        "summary": "You're helping make the world a brighter place just by switching on your christmas lights. New data shows many us cities brighten by 20 % to 50 % between thanksgiving and new year's day, and it's all visible from space, wired reports. A research team used a nasa-noaa satellite camera — sensitive enough to pick up \" the faintest signal like a fishing boat, \" scientist miguel roman tells smithsonian — to photograph 70 us cities every night at 1am local time from 2012 to 2013. ( they picked cities free of snow, which disrupts readings. ) many got brighter in december. Researchers then plotted their findings on a map: red dots show a darker area compared to the rest of the year, yellow dots show no change, and green dots indicate a boost in brightness. The brighter areas tend to be \" in the suburbs and the exurbs and the periphery, \" says roman. Why? \" people are leaving work for the holidays and they're turning on the lights. \" but the trend isn't restricted to december, or to the us. Some middle eastern cities get 50 % brighter during the month of ramadan, space.com reports. Cities in jordan and egypt especially lit up as activity shifted to later at night, while those in israel and other countries saw no change. This could indicate unstable electrical grids, cultural differences, or conflict, researchers say. Interestingly, they found nighttime brightness fell 94 % in aleppo, syria, following a major battle in july 2012. The study as a whole will help experts track carbon emissions and energy demands.

            "San francisco — people love the holidays so much you can see it from space. Data collected by a satellite with a special nighttime sensor found that the glow from our collective light displays brightens many major u.s. Cities as much as 50 percent between thanksgiving and new year's day. A team led by nasa scientist miguel román presented nighttime light data from the suomi npp satellite yesterday during a press conference here at the american geophysical union meeting. The polar-orbiting satellite, jointly run by nasa and noaa, has an instrument that gathers data in 22 different bands of visible and infrared light. It can detect all sorts of light including fires, auroras, moonlight reflecting off of ice and clouds, the nocturnal glow of the atmosphere, highway lights, and even the light from a single boat in the sea. Román's team used an algorithm to filter out all the lights except for lights in 70 u.s. Cities for the past two years. They found that major cities such as dallas, washington d.c. And phoenix were between 20 and 50 percent brighter during the holiday season. They limited their study to cities that don't typically see snow, which is so reflective that it throws measurements off. \"where are the green areas? they are in the suburbs and the exurbs and the periphery, \" roman said."
