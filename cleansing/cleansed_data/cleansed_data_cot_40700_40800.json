Bland's family will accept $ 1.8 million from the waller county jail and $ 100,000 from the texas department of public safety, reports ktrk. The deal reached wednesday also requires the jail to have a nurse present for all shifts and use automated electronic sensors to ensure jail cells are checked regularly, reports cnn. A judge will also seek \" passage of state legislation for more funding for local jails regarding intake and booking, screening, and other jail support, \" says bland family attorney cannon lambert. Any legislation passed will be named for bland, her mother adds. Bland was found dead in her waller county jail cell in july 2015, three days after she was pulled over for not using a turn signal. A medical examiner determined she hanged herself with a garbage bag — a finding backed by an fbi investigation — but her family disagrees. A jail report revealed no guard had checked on bland for nearly two hours before she was found dead, though bland told officers she had previously attempted suicide. Lambert said a guard testified that he logged a check on bland that he didn't actually make, per the dallas morning news. The officer who arrested bland, whom he described as \" combative, \" was fired in march after he was indicted on a perjury charge; he pleaded not guilty in may.",

A spokesman said: \"we cannot exclude the possibility of time travel as it has not been disproven to our satisfaction. \" all things are possible until proven otherwise. \" but so far we have had applications from all round the world, and we do mean round - there are no flat-earthers here. \" the flexible policy suggests the professor undertook his own journey on the subject - over time.",

        "summary": "Working on your tan may actually be an addictive behavior — if shaved mice tell us anything. A new study published in cell followed mice with shaved backs who were given the equivalent of half an hour of bright sun daily for six weeks, the bbc reports. In addition to producing a protein that broke down into the pigment melanin ( that's what creates your tan ), massachusetts general hospital and harvard researchers found the uv exposure produced something else: pleasure-giving endorphins, which reuters points out \" function through the same biological pathway \" as heroin. Mice who received drugs to halt the endorphins ' work showed signs of withdrawal: teeth chattering and shaking among them. In a manner typical of addiction, they avoided the area where those drugs were provided. Discussing addiction, a researcher involved tells the bbc he feels \" reasonable confidence that this pathway really does exist and is probably present in everybody, \" and suggests there's an evolutionary component, with a developed \" addiction \" potentially related to our need for vitamin d. Other experts, however, aren't so sure. If people were really addicted to uv rays, \" you would have people giving up their family lives to get access to sunshine; you would have people who lose their jobs because they spend their day on the beach, \" says one. And the researchers didn't find that the mice aggressively sought out uv light, nor did they test whether the mice had a preference for uv light or non-uv light. Still, experts recommend sunscreen — perhaps even when you're getting your nails done.",

His waltons co-stars say they are devastated by his death, the ap reports. \" i loved him so much; i know he was so special to all of us. He was like a real father to me, \" said mary mcdonough, who played daughter erin walton. \" goodnight daddy. I love you. \" michael learned, who played wife olivia walton, says she is mourning a \" good honest actor and a good honest man. \" waite \" was my spiritual husband, \" she said. \" we loved each other for over 40 years.

Although al-balad has been a unesco cultural heritage site since 2014, many of its historical buildings have perished due to fire and disrepair. In the past 50 years, unesco has served to provide the incentive to preserve historical sites such as al-balad, which is considered a staple of hijazi architecture.

Just this week, republicans in at least four states introduced legislation restricting abortion, the new york daily news reports. In michigan, for instance, 23 republicans this week co-sponsored a version of the transvaginal ultrasound bill that proved so divisive in virginia. Last night michigan's republican house speaker said he wouldn't pass the bill, msnbc reports. \" i have absolutely no interest in forcing women to have a transvaginal ultrasound, \" he said. But michigan is hardly alone. A bill in tennessee would require women to undergo a standard ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion; another in alabama could regulate its remaining clinics out of business; and a pair in arkansas would forbid some insurance coverage for abortions and ban them entirely after 12 weeks. Publicly, dc republicans say these state efforts won't damage the national brand. But \" it can muddy the message the national party is trying to develop, \" one former house gop strategist admits.",

        "summary": "\" i think we're not done with the bin ladens yet. \" that's the conclusion of ali soufan in a 60 minutes interview focusing on the trove of documents taken from osama bin laden's compound upon his death. Soufan — the fbi's chief al-qaeda investigator in the wake of 9/11 — shares what he's learned in two years spent poring over the documents. A lot of it boils down to one man: hamza bin laden, the son of the al-qaeda leader. He's thought to be 28, and what we've known of him is minimal — no photos of him as an adult, for instance. But what soufan uncovered in the documents is snippets about a charismatic man who \" exhibited leadership skills early on, \" in january was added to the state department's specially designated global terrorist list, and just recently released another al-qaeda propaganda video, per newsweek. Soufan calls out one letter, written from son to father around the time of osama's death. Hamza hadn't seen his father for the eight years prior, and the letter expresses how much he both misses his dad ( \" he tells him... I remember every, every look you looked at me, every smile you gave me, every word you told me, \" says soufan ) and plans to be like him. Soufan quotes the letter as saying, \" i consider myself to be forged in steel, the path of jihad for the sake of god is what we live. \" soufan believes hamza was groomed to lead and is willing to do so, and the al-qaeda he'd head is very different from that of his father: at the time of 9/11, the group had just 400 afghanistan-based members. Now it's \" thousands and thousands of members, all over the middle east. \"",

Cbs news six years ago when navy seals hunted down and killed osama bin laden, it seemed as if the united states had the upper hand in the fight against al qaeda. But while the u.s.

        "summary": "Plants and animals aren't the only things that go extinct: most words are replaced every few thousand years, with a maximum survival of roughly 9,000 years, say linguists. But in a new study published yesterday, four british researchers say they have found 23 words that have persisted for a staggering 15,000 years. These \" ultraconserved words \" include some that you might expect ( you, me, mother, man ), others you might not ( spit, worm, bark ), and at least one somewhat heartwarming entry ( give ). Over the centuries, the words have retained the same meaning and almost the same sound, the washington post reports. The team claims that's because they all come from an ancient \" mother tongue \" that was used toward the end of the last ice age, the guardian reports. They assert that the ancient language eventually formed seven language families, which in turn formed the 700 modern languages used by more than half of the planet today. To find the ultraconserved words, linguists looked for cognates — words that have similar meanings and sounds in different languages, like \" father \" ( padre, pere, pater, pitar ) — shared by all seven of the aforementioned language families. They then translated the cognates into what they believed the cognates ' ancestral words ( known as proto-words ) would be, then compared those. They ultimately found 23 that were shared by at least four of the language families, including one ( thou ) that was shared by all seven. See all the words here.",

            "Languages spoken by billions of people across europe and asia are descended from an ancient tongue uttered in southern europe at the end of the last ice age, according to research. The claim, by scientists in britain, points to a common origin for vocabularies as varied as english and urdu, japanese and itelmen, a language spoken along the north-eastern edge of russia.

The colorado supreme court ruled 6-0 that businesses can fire employees who violate their drug policies, even if that drug use is legal in that state, is used for medicinal purposes, and isn't used at work, the denver post reports. The case arose after brandon coats failed a drug test in 2010 and lost his telephone operator job with dish, which has a zero-tolerance drug policy, the ap reports. His lawyer argued that because coats, who suffers violent muscle spasms, used pot only at home and worked a \" nonhazardous \" job, he should be exempt from such no-drug policies. The court's decision upheld previous rulings that because marijuana is still illegal on a federal level, businesses can prohibit it no matter the circumstances. The big question: whether medical marijuana use would be protected by the state's \" lawful off-duty activities statute, \" originally meant to protect cigarette smokers who smoke off the clock, the post notes. However, the justices in this case say that qualifying outside-of-work activities have to be legal per both state and federal law. Legal experts note this ruling could have wide implications for how employers in colorado and other states deal with both recreational and medicinal marijuana use, per the post. \" this is a sad day for colorado medical marijuana patients, who now have no protection for off-duty use of medical or recreational marijuana, \" a statement from the cannabis therapy institute reads, per kdvr. The dish network's statement, according to 7news denver: \" dish is committed to its drug-free workplace policy and compliance with federal law, which does not permit the use of marijuana, even for medicinal purposes. \"",

And at least one archeologist believes he knows what it holds. \" clearly it does look from the radar evidence as if the tomb continues, as i have predicted, \" nicholas reeves said at a news conference on saturday. \" i think it is nefertiti, and all the evidence points in that direction. \" the tomb of queen nefertiti has never definitively been found, and reeves believes king tut was actually buried in her tomb because his wasn't ready, with her being shunted off to a side room, according to the bbc. He came up with his theory while analyzing detailed scans of king tut's tomb used to create a replica for tourists. He claims those scans revealed two doorways that were covered up. Infrared scans made earlier this month seemed to support reeves'theory, showing differing heat patterns along the walls of the tomb, afp reports. According to the bbc, egypt's antiquities ministry did further scans to test the theory over the past few weeks, leading to saturday's \" 90 % \" estimate. The scans are being sent to japan for further analysis. And while experts are now fairly convinced reeves was right about the hidden chamber, the question of who — if anyone — is inside is still being debated. The afp reports the next step for researchers is to figure out how to get through the hidden doorways without damaging king tut's tomb. ( a giant sphinx was unearthed from the desert, but probably not the desert you were expecting. )",

        "summary": "Angry constituents confronting republican lawmakers at town hall meetings continue to make headlines. Here's a look at what both sides are saying: it's one thing president trump has in common with former president obama: the latter's white house also shrugged off town hall chaos as the work of organized agitators, writes aaron blake at the washington post. Will any of this matter? that's a definite maybe. \" it's just so difficult to know where to draw the line between flashy protests at town halls and legitimate, game-changing shifts in the political zeitgeist. \" read his assessment here. On wednesday, conservative tom cotton of arkansas faced one of the rowdiest town halls, with the audience erupting in applause when a woman asked, \" what kind of insurance do you have? \" see this video clip via cnn. At another point, a kid worried he'd lose his pbs shows because of the mexican border wall. Cnn also has that. Virginia's dave brat also faced a hostile crowd, and his strategy was to have the local mayor read the questions instead getting them directly from participants. Politico thinks it could be a blueprint for republicans as these continue. Michael moore thinks this is a legit movement, one that \" makes the tea party look like pre-school. \" read his comments at nbc news. A fox news contributor, however, says the movement \" exposes the left for who they are. They're intolerantly tolerant. \" read the exchange here. See examples from across the country as rounded up by usa today. As buzzfeed points out, politicians have a tough choice: face hours of angry questions or skip the town halls and be accused of cowardice. ( an example of the latter is this editorial in the kansas city star. ) marco rubio just missed one in florida — he had complained of the \" hostile atmosphere \" — and was mocked with cardboard cutouts, reports the tampa bay times.

It was the 1960s, an era marked by youth: vietnam war protests, psychedelic drugs, sexual revolutions. The young walker relished the culture of exultation, of joie de vivre, and yet was also acutely aware of its passing. He was haunted by the knowledge that ageing would eventually steal away his vitality – that with each passing day his body was slightly less robust, slightly more decayed. One evening he went for a drive in his convertible and vowed that by his 40th birthday, he would find a cure for ageing. Walker became a scientist to understand why he was mortal. \"certainly it wasn't due to original sin and punishment by god, as i was taught by nuns in catechism, \" he says. \"no, it was the result of a biological process",

Jason maloni, a spokesman for paul manafort, says manafort has dropped law firm wilmerhale, which had been speaking to investigators on his behalf, and now plans to hire miller &amp; chevalier, which specializes in international tax cases, to represent him in the special counsel's investigation. Reuters reports that manafort has previously been represented by miller &amp; chevalier's richard hibey, whose previous clients include clair george, a former cia deputy director convicted of lying to congress about the iran-contra scandal. Sources tell politico that former senior department of justice official kevin downing, who specializes in complex financial investigations, will be on manafort's new legal team. The sources say that the change suggests manafort has realized that the mueller investigation has turned up the heat and he needs more specialized legal help.

The study in the january 2016 issue of computers in human behavior found that 46 % of respondents reported feeling phubbed by their mates — meaning that, when together, the mate was distracted by his or her phone. The chicago tribune reports 23 % said phubbing caused conflict, while 37 % reported feeling depressed some of the time. Just 32 % of phubbing-prone subjects said they were very satisfied with their relationship. \" the results... Are astounding, \" study co-author james roberts says in a baylor university press release. \" something as common as cellphone use can undermine the bedrock of our happiness — our relationships with our romantic partners, \" he continues. First, researchers surveyed 308 subjects to create a nine-item partner phubbing scale; 145 adults then had to respond to the nine identified snubbing behaviors, assigning each a number one ( never ) to five ( all the time ). Among the statements: \" my partner glances at his/her cell phone when talking to me \" or \" places his or her cell phone where they can see it when we are together. \" researchers found that those with \" anxious attachment \" to their mate ( meaning they felt less secure together ) were more likely to be bothered by phubbing than those who had more secure attachments, the release notes.

        "summary": "Manatees passed a huge milestone this week, but not everybody was cheering about the removal of the marine mammals from the endangered species list after 50 years. The us fish and wildlife service called the change a \" success story \" for the species when it announced the change thursday, the day after manatee appreciation day, npr reports. In a statement, fws said the florida manatee population had rebounded from a few hundred in the early 1970s to an estimated 6,620 today. Fws said that in considering the downlisting, it had looked at populations of the west indian manatee throughout its range, which extends from the southeast us down as far as brazil, cnn reports. While there is still plenty of work to be done, \" manatee numbers are increasing and we are actively working with partners to address threats, \" said acting fws director jim kurth. But patrick rose, director of the save the manatee club, described the move as a \" devastating blow to manatees. \" he warned changing classification at this time will damage the \" chances of securing the manatee's long-term survival \" and said in light of the new administration's plans to cut regulations that protect wildlife and water quality, the move appears to be a political one. Manatees are now on the threatened list and fws says the reclassification will not diminish federal protections. ( some 16 % of florida's manatees died off in 2013. )",

        "summary": "More than 40 years after it was the centerpiece of what pri calls \" possibly the biggest and strangest covert operation \" of the cold war, a piece of cia history is headed for the scrap heap. After the soviet union failed to find one of its nuclear submarines that sank 1,500 miles northwest of hawaii in 1968, the cia swooped in, hoping to recover both the sub's nuclear missiles and its cryptography gear, according to reuters. Under the code name project azorian, the cia schemed to raise the 14 million-pound sub three miles to the surface — an undertaking considered impossible. \" i think given a better background in marine engineering, we likely would not have tried, \" says the retired cia employee who finally revealed the long-officially-secret story in 2012. The ship that the cia came up with — and what is now being scrapped: the hughes glomar explorer. The ship was unique to say the least: 619 feet long and too wide to fit in the panama canal, it featured massive hydraulics, ball bearings the size of bowling balls, and one huge claw with which to grab the sub wreck. The cia was able to cover up the construction of the ship for four years by convincing the world howard hughes was building it to mine manganese nodules from the ocean floor. Project azorian was modestly successful, with the hughes glomar only raising the bow of the soviet sub. The cia's infamous \" glomar response \" ( \" we can neither confirm nor deny... \" ) has its origins in the agency's attempt to keep the project secret even as details leaked. The ship has had a long post-cia career as an oil drilling rig, but with worldwide oil prices falling, owner transocean has decided to send the ship to the scrapyard. Fittingly enough for a longtime cia secret, transocean won't say where the hughes glomar is being scrapped. ( for more cold war secrets, check out these spy photos of lost cities. )",

Christened the hughes glomar explorer, after billionaire howard hughes was brought in on the cia's deception, the 619-foot vessel eventually became part of the fleet of ships used by swiss company transocean to drill for oil. But the oil price rout means the former spy ship now called gsf explorer is just one of 40 such offshore drilling rigs that have been consigned to scrap since last year. It's the end of a story that began when a soviet g-ii sub called the k-129 sank in september 1968 \" with all hands, 16,500 feet below the surface of the pacific \", according to an official u.s.

The sub sank with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and nearly 100 sailors, according to declassified documents at george washington university's national security archive.

But the artist took one tiny creative liberty: she's shown pinching her fingers together, and this text appears in the upper right: \" i have this much respect for the american judicial system. \" the painting was debuted to the world via his brother robert's twitter feed last night, along with the following: \" very proud to introduce @therealgeorgez's latest...

Shepard fairey, famed for using an ap photo as the basis for his famed hope poster, ended up settling his civil case with the ap for $ 1.6 million. Unlike fairey, zimmerman probably won't make millions off this painting, though: his blue flag painting went for $ 100,099.99 on ebay last month.",

I ' m not gonna deal with this, ok? \" that's what a firefighter in albuquerque, new mexico, was recorded telling a 911 caller after a 17-year-old was shot at a party. The exchange involved albuquerque fire department driver matthew sanchez, who was working dispatch on the night of june 26. In a roughly 30-second portion of the recorded call, posted by krqe, he's heard twice asking if jaydon chavez-silver was breathing. The caller responds, \" he's barely breathing. How many times do i have to f --- ing tell you? \" to which sanchez replies that he isn't going to \" deal with this \" and then hangs up. Jaydon later died from the gunshot, per krqe. The fire chief on monday said sanchez \" was immediately removed from the dispatch center and placed on administrative assignment. An internal investigation has been initiated. \" chief administrative officer rob perry subsequently announced that sanchez had resigned from the albuquerque fire department, where he had worked for 10 years, reports koat. Kob6 reports that police believe the shooter either walked or drove by the home where about 10 people were gathered and fired as many as six shots; no arrests have been made.

        "summary": "Dogs may hold the reputation as having the best noses among mammals, but when it comes to the number of genes associated with smell, the elephant stands alone. By a mile. New findings published in genome research suggest that african elephants have 2,000 active olfactory genes, the highest number among the 13 mammals studied, giving them twice the number found in dogs and five times that found in humans. Makes sense when you consider the nature of the trunk, where \" every time you touch something, you smell it, \" the lead scientist tells the washington post. But, researchers point out, the sheer number of genes doesn't mean that the elephant surpasses the dog in every way when it comes to sniffing. Dogs, for instance, have sensitive noses that detect specific odors even at low concentrations, which explains why they're great at following the scent of a trail. Elephants, meanwhile, likely have access to a much wider range of smells — and their noses seem to be more discerning. Previous research has found that elephants can tell 30 family members apart by sniffing their urine, and that they can even differentiate between two ethnic groups in kenya. ( they fear the maasai, who spear elephants, while they don't show the same aversion to the kamba, who don't. ) the great sense of smell likely compensates for the elephant's relatively weak vision, notes national geographic. Interestingly, olfactory genes are extremely species-specific; of the 10,000 genes studied across the 13 species, only three were shared among all 13, reports science.

According to a new study published tuesday in genome research, african elephants may best humans, mice and even dogs on the measure of olfactory receptor genes.

While the number of active olfactory genes in elephants is quite impressive — 2,000, which is twice the number found in dogs and five times the number found in humans — scientists say there isn't a clear connection between having more genes and being a better smeller in every way. It's not all about the number of olfactory receptor genes but also how an animal uses them. \"we don't really know how the number of olfactory receptor genes relates to olfactory ability, \" said study author yoshihito niimura, a researcher at the university of tokyo's department of applied biological chemistry. \"for example, dogs are known for their keen sense of smell — but we actually already knew that their number of genes was much smaller than mice, who we don't see with that same ability. \" dogs, niimura said, have very sensitive",

The 40-year-old inmate, who had a record of good behavior during his 20 years in a michigan prison, wasn't a kitchen worker but he managed to obtain a white kitchen uniform that helped him slip away and blend in with the snow, the ap finds. He then spent an hour using his hands to make holes in the inside and outside perimeter fences — even though they were electrically charged and equipped with motion sensors. A security vehicle was patrolling the perimeter at the time of the escape. Elliott, who carjacked a woman when he made it out, somehow \" was not zapped with electricity, and he was not picked up by the motion sensor, \" says a spokesman for the michigan prison, where an apparently somewhat overdue review of security measures has been launched, the bay city times reports. There was nothing in his file to indicate that he was an escape risk, but \" he obviously exploited a vulnerable part of our security system, \" the spokesman says. Gov. Rick snyder, who credits collaboration between officers in michigan and indiana with elliot's recapture, says he will demand an \" exhaustive assessment \" of the incident.",

The girl's mother said she had indeed seen scorpions many times at their home, so the doctors suspected that the girl had been bitten, and treated her by administering three vials of anti-venom. This treatment put a stop to the girl's uncontrollable eye movements and salivation, but she continued to experience the tremors. The patient also had a fever, and her heart rate was too high. Meanwhile, the doctors were not able to find any physical indication of a scorpion sting by examining the girl's skin. The patient's mother eventually revealed that the girl's grandmother temporarily left the tot alone with an aunt who used methamphetamines. The doctors then tested the child's urine and found she had indeed ingested the drug. This was confirmed several weeks later by the results of a blood test.

[ 6 strange meth facts ] when the girl arrived at the emergency department of a hospital in tucson, arizona, she was agitated, twitching throughout her entire body, sweating profusely and salivating excessively. Her doctors had previously seen such symptoms in patients bitten by the arizona bark scorpion, which is endemic to this region of the united states. The girl's mother said she had indeed seen scorpions many times at their home, so the doctors suspected that the girl had been bitten, and treated her by administering three vials of anti-venom. This treatment put a stop to the girl's uncontrollable eye movements and salivation, but she continued to experience the tremors. The patient also had a fever, and her heart rate was too high. Meanwhile, the doctors were not able to find any physical indication of a scorpion sting by examining the girl's skin. The patient's mother eventually revealed that the girl's grandmother temporarily left the tot alone with an aunt who used methamphetamines. The doctors then tested the child's urine and found she had indeed ingested the drug. This was confirmed several weeks later by the results of a blood test. However, it was not clear exactly how the ingestion occurred, the report said. After receiving treatment for methamphetamine intoxication, the girl recovered. There have been other reports of children in arizona ingesting methamphetamines and developing symptoms mistaken for those of scorpion envenomation. One likely reason for this phenomenon is"

The family, however, suspects foul play. Among the unanswered questions is who found jenkins and whether the freezer was actually fully functioning as a freezer at the time. \" i don't think anything has been ruled in or ruled out at this point, \" says a spokesman for the village of rosemont. \" it's just considered a death investigation at this point. \"",

In a speech last week, the house speaker likened his colleagues to crybabies who wanted to \" take the path of least resistance \" on immigration overhaul and avoid tough decisions. In a meeting with house gopers yesterday, boehner stressed that his remarks were lighthearted, and shifted blame for slow progress on immigration reform back to president obama, reports the new york times. \" you tease the ones you love, but some people misunderstood what i had to say, and i wanted to make sure the members understood that the biggest impediment we have to moving immigration reform is that the american people don't trust the president to enforce or implement the law, \" boehner said after the meeting. Some observers, however, see boehner's remarks last week as a sign that he has given up on trying to please the most conservative house republicans and may not stay on as speaker after this year's elections, the wall street journal reports. Democrats, meanwhile, welcomed his candor. \" i ' m glad he's complaining about his members for a change and i don't have to, \" quipped harry reid.",

        "summary": "An american professor was searching last year for a letter relating to samuel ward, one of the translators of the king james bible, in the archives of sidney sussex college in cambridge. \" i thought that would be my great discovery, \" jeffrey alan miller of montclair state university tells the new york times. Instead, that honor has ended up going to something else he found: a paperback-sized notebook once belonging to ward that had been cataloged in the 1980s as including \" verse-by-verse biblical commentary. \" as miller flipped through it, \" there was a kind of thunderstruck, leap-out-of-bathtub moment, \" he says. It looked to be an early draft of the king james bible, containing a book from the often-omitted section, the apocrypha, and pieces of the wisdom of solomon. King james i commissioned the new bible translation in 1604, and miller says the 70-page draft dates from 1604 to 1608. If validated, the find will become the earliest known draft of the king james bible, one of only four manuscripts of the text ever found, and the only one definitively written by a translator. It would also offer insights into how the book — which gave us phrases like \" fight the good fight \" and \" the skin of my teeth \" — came to be. The telegraph reports scholars worked to prepare it in teams or \" companies \" at the university of oxford, university of cambridge, and westminster. But miller says ward's notebook suggests he worked alone, at least in the early stages. \" it clearly shows him... Working out the translation for himself as he went along, making mistakes and changing his mind, \" miller writes in the times literary supplement, raising the possibility that the bible \" may be far more a patchwork of individual translations... Than has ever been properly recognized. \" ( the oldest known gospel was just found in a mummy mask. )",

The horry county sheriff's office identified the victims as mark carter king, 63, and debra collins rion, 61. Get push notifications with news, features and more. Local news station wbtw reported that king and rion used a generator in their home. While their bodies were found on saturday afternoon, they died at approximately 7: 45 p.m. On friday, when florence first made landfall, according to the outlet. As of sunday, the slow-moving storm — which began at sea as a category 4 hurricane, made landfall as a category 1 hurricane on friday, and has since been downgraded to a tropical depression — is centered around columbia, south carolina, and winds are down to a maximum of 35 mph, according to the national weather service. The storm, which is currently moving at 8 mph, is expected to make a turn towards the northeast. However, while florence continues to weaken, authorities are still concerned about flooding — and the long rebuilding process that will be necessary for some communities. \"the flood danger from this storm is more immediate today than when it made landfall just over 24 hours ago"

In addition to a detailed account of the campaign, it provides a look at its final hours. The bad news began about 7: 45pm when a democratic vote-counter stunned insiders by declaring that florida was lost. After 11, president obama called clinton and urged her to concede. Soon she did just that, with her first call to her rival to say, \" congratulations, donald \" and the second to obama to say, \" mr. President, i ' m sorry. \" so how did she get to that point? some takeaways from reviews of the book: npr: \" there is no big reveal, no shocking secret answer. Instead we get a slow-building case against the concept and execution of the clinton campaign, with plenty of fault falling squarely on the candidate herself. \" axios bullets some highlights, including that aide huma abedin \" couldn't be counted on to relay constructive criticism to hillary without pointing a finger at the critic. \" and another that obama thought clinton's handling of her email server mess \" amounted to political malpractice. \" daily beast: \" more damning than any anecdote of petty infighting or a deadly devotion to data, however, is the book's verdict on the main reason for clinton's loss: clinton herself. \" new york times: \" the portrait of the clinton campaign that emerges from these pages is that of a titanic-like disaster: an epic fail made up of a series of perverse and often avoidable missteps by an out-of-touch candidate and her strife-ridden staff that turned ' a winnable race ' into ' another iceberg-seeking campaign ship. ' \" among other things, the book notes that the campaign ignored the advice of bill clinton and others to more aggressively court white working-class voters and millennials.

        "summary": "Scientists think they've figured out why so many seabirds feast on plastic floating in the ocean, often with deadly consequences. It turns out that the plastic smells an awful lot like the small crustaceans known as krill that are a staple of the birds'diet, reports new scientist. The finding suggests that while the birds ' have a sophisticated sense of smell, it hasn't evolved fast enough to stay ahead of the deceptions of plastic, researcher matthew savoca of the university of california, davis, tells the new york times. The problem is a big one given the growing piles of plastic trash in the ocean and the growing number of birds found dead with plastic in their bellies. Seabirds use both their vision and sense of smell to find prey, an insight that led to the discovery. \" no one's actually tested the way plastic smells before, \" says savoca. To do so, they soaked plastic in seawater for three weeks, placed the samples in airtight vials, and found that, because of algae, the plastic ended up reeking of a particular sulfur compound. It appears to have a strikingly similar scent to the algae-eating krill the birds have eaten for thousands of years, reports the independent.

            "On 21 october 2016, the secretary-general of the united nations decided that the new honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls will be wonder woman, a fictional character, the rights to which are owned by dc comics, a for-profit entertainment corporation. Since that date, over 16,000 people have expressed their concern with this appointment. Wonder woman was created 75 years ago. Although the original creators may have intended wonder woman to represent a strong and independent \"warrior \" woman with a feminist message, the reality is that the character's current iteration is that of a large breasted, white woman of impossible proportions, scantily clad in a shimmery, thigh-baring body suit with an american flag motif and knee high boots – the epitome of a \"pin-up \" girl. This is the character that the united nations has decided to represent a globally important issue – that of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. It appears that this character will be promoted as the face of sustainable development goal 5 for the united nations at large. At a time when issues such as gender parity in senior roles and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of women and girls is at the top of the united nation's agenda, including the \"he for she \" campaign, this appointment is more than surprising.

        "summary": "A human being without water is a dead human being, which makes nasa's latest data on the world's water supply pretty chilling. About 35 % of the fresh water people use comes from large underground aquifers, but supplies are dwindling, with more water removed from 21 of the world's largest 37 aquifers over a decade than replenished. Thirteen aquifers are in serious distress. \" the situation is quite critical, \" head researcher jay famiglietti says. Beginning in 2003, nasa's grace satellites identified underground aquifers by measuring earth's gravitational pull, taking note of where the heavier weight of water wielded a greater pull, then charted changes until 2013, the washington post reports. Though the total capacity of the aquifers isn't clear, the data shows some aquifers may be smaller than previously believed. The aquifer under the most stress in the us is california's central valley aquifer, tapped to irrigate farm fields. \" we know we're taking more than we're putting back in — how long do we have before we can't do that anymore? \" a researcher tells the los angeles times. \" we don't know, but we keep pumping. Which to me is terrifying. \" the atlantic and gulf coastal plains aquifer, across the southeast and florida, is also depleting, the study finds. Still, aquifers in poor, densely populated areas like northwest india, pakistan, and north africa, are in the worst shape. Researchers say the arabian aquifer, used by more than 60 million people, shows little to no sign of replenishment. Aquifers take thousands of years to refill as it is. Famiglietti notes there's an added problem in that people nearest the equator pump more water from aquifers to cope with dry conditions, but that water then evaporates and circulates far away to the north and south. \" there's not an infinite supply of water, \" he concludes. \" we need to get our heads together on how we manage groundwater, because we're running out of it. \"",

Thirteen aquifers declined at rates that put them into the most troubled category. The researchers said this indicated a long-term problem that's likely to worsen as reliance on aquifers grows. Scientists had long suspected that humans were taxing the world's underground water supply, but the nasa data was the first detailed assessment to demonstrate that major aquifers were indeed struggling to keep pace with demands from agriculture, growing populations, and industries such as mining. \"the situation is quite critical, \" said jay famiglietti, senior water scientist at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory in california and principal investigator of the university of california irvine-led studies.

Bloomfield, wife ruth driskill, and friends elizabeth shelton and timothy tebbe had driven to tebbe's house and, per the ap, were en route back to the wedding reception when a single-vehicle crash occurred around 4pm. The bucyrus telegraph-forum reports that tebbe was driving and lost control of the dodge ram, which hit an embankment and began to roll, smashing into a utility pole before ending up in a cornfield. Wmfd reports that bloomfield and shelton, 26, were thrown from the truck; shelton died at the scene, and bloomfield later died in the hospital. The 37-year-old bride and tebbe were removed from the car using the jaws of life. Investigators suspect none of the passengers was wearing seat belts. Wyandot county sheriff michael r.

Louis post-dispatch — and that verdict just came in as an acquittal. The officer, jason stockley, had maintained he shot at anthony lamar smith five times because he thought smith was reaching for a gun, but prosecutors argued stockley planted the gun in smith's buick after it crashed. The decision by judge timothy wilson was announced by a circuit attorney press release, per the riverfront times, after previous remarks by activists there would be \" mass disruption \" if stockley was acquitted. \" it's going to look a lot like ferguson. It's going to be … three hundred-plus days of direct action, \" the post-dispatch previously quoted an activist as saying if stockley wasn't convicted. The chicago tribune looks back at the case, which started when stockley and his partner witnessed what looked like a drug transaction on dec. 20, 2011, in a fast-food restaurant parking lot. Smith, one of the parties present, drove away as the officers neared, and the shooting took place after the cops rammed their suv into smith's vehicle. \" of course, i ' m disappointed with the court's decision, \" circuit attorney kim gardner said in the release, adding: \" i remain committed to holding people accountable for violating the law, regardless of their race, gender, occupation, or station in life. \" st.

The 67-year-old ex-envoy for the vatican to the dominican republic, who was awaiting trial on charges of sexually abusing children there, died today of apparent natural causes, the vatican reports via the ap. His body was found in the room at the vatican where he's been holed up on house arrest, and a vatican prosecutor has mandated an autopsy. Wesolowski was hauled back to the vatican from the dr two years ago when reports started emerging in dominican media that he was abusing shoeshine boys in santo domingo, luring them by dressing \" in layman's clothes, [ donning ] a baseball cap, and [ visiting ] a beachfront area known to be frequented by impoverished child prostitutes, \" per christian today. After he was arrested and defrocked in 2014, it was also discovered he possessed large quantities of child porn — even while at the vatican. Wesolowski was set to go before a vatican tribunal on july 11, but he fell ill right before the trial and had to be hospitalized, notes the guardian. A new trial date had not yet been set. Why this trial would've been a big deal: wesolowski, the first vatican official to face criminal charges at the holy see for sexually abusing minors, was expected to be made an example of by pope francis, who has promised to punish church officials who've either abused children or helped cover for those who did, per the ap. The trial also would have been notable because wesolowski was considered a direct rep of the pope and had been ordained by pope john paul ii.

Swiss psychiatrist bertrand piccard says it helps him endure the long hours, including the plane's five-day flight from china to hawaii that began today. \" when you get into self-hypnosis, you turn your look from the outside to the inside, \" says piccard. \" you don't focus anymore on what happens outside, you focus only on the inside. \" in this state, he says, he's \" completely relaxed — the body is sleeping, but the mind is alert and can still check instruments, talk to mission control, and fly the plane. \" and if there's an emergency on the zero-fuel aircraft, his suit's sleeves will vibrate to let him know. Piccard says he taught himself self-hypnosis before taking part in a balloon race across the atlantic ocean in 1992. By his account, he managed to keep awake for 86 hours in a simulator while sleeping or hypnotizing himself for 20-minute stretches. Similarly, piccard plans to take 10 to 12 daily naps of 20 minutes each on the solar plane, called solar impulse 2; while awake, he mixes mindfulness techniques with self-hypnosis. He shares piloting duties with his solar impulse co-founder, swiss businessman andre borschberg, who stays alert his own way — with yoga techniques like meditation and healthy postures.

By saturday, one of them was dead, reports the telegraph. Philip goodeve-docker and his companions planned what goodeve-docker referred to as a \" frankly nutty adventure \": an up-to-35-day journey across greenland in which they were to drag their own supplies and share a single tent. That tent, however, was reportedly blown away in a rare and brutal snowstorm on friday. They radioed for help, but it didn't arrive until the next morning, local police tell the guardian. The expedition was intended as a charity fundraiser, and only one of the men had arctic experience. Goodeve-docker reportedly prepared for it through exercises like dragging tires, and wrote of the dangers the trio faced on his fundraising website: \" polar bears ( not cute and cuddly ), crevasses up to 500 meters deep, polar winds, [ and ] temperatures of 5c to -50c. \" says a greenland police official, \" they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. \" goodeve-docker's companions are said to have suffered frostbite and shock.",

After a monthslong investigation, central command released a statement saying two children were \" likely \" killed in a november strike in syria targeting the khorasan group, reports the guardian, which notes that the us has long denied causing any civilian casualties during the campaign in iraq and syria. \" we regret the unintentional loss of lives, \" the operation's commander said in the statement, adding that the coalition continues to \" take all reasonable measures during the targeting process to mitigate risks to non-combatants. \" officials say the military is investigating another report of civilian casualties in syria and two from iraq, though a defense official tells the washington post that the lack of us troops on the ground makes it hard to verify airstrike deaths. A pentagon spokeswoman says a total of 46 reports of civilian casualties have been examined since august, of which 35 were dismissed because they were deemed not credible or because there was no evidence, the bbc reports. The syrian observatory for human rights activist group says coalition strikes have killed 131 civilians, 42 of them children, along with more than 2,200 isis fighters and hundreds of militants from other groups. The pentagon also announced yesterday that it's sending 2,000 antitank weapons to iraqi forces to help them counter the suicide car bomb tactics that helped isis seize ramadi last week, the post reports. And isis now has more vehicles: the ap reported earlier this week that iraqi troops abandoned dozens of us-supplied military vehicles when they fled ramadi, including around half a dozen tanks.",

        "summary": "Lest we forget: the equal justice initiative today released a report that documents 3,959 \" racial terror lynchings \" throughout 12 southern states over the 1877 to 1950 period. That's \" at least 700 more lynchings of black people in these states than previously reported, \" reports the eji in what it calls \" the most comprehensive work done on lynching to date, \" the result of four years of research. The new york times reports that in 1882, the chicago tribune started annually publishing a list of the prior year's lynchings; the tuskegee institute and naacp published lists in the early 20th century, and researchers in 1995 used all the existing documentation to create a master list. As for the 700 names that hadn't previously been recorded, one of those 1995 researchers, em beck, says that the definition of a lynching varies from list to list ( the eji's includes some \" one-time massacres of large numbers of african-americans, \" per the times ). But \" if you're trying to make a point that the amount of racial violence is underestimated, well then, there's no doubt about it, \" says beck. The report asserts the lynchings were a form of terrorism, writing they \" were not ' frontier justice ' because they generally took place in communities where there was a functioning criminal justice system that was deemed too good for african americans. \" further, \" racial terror lynching was... A tactic for maintaining racial control, not merely punishment of an alleged perpetrator for an alleged crime. \" the report illustrates some of the social grievances men were lynched for: knocking on a white woman's door ( general lee, 1904, reevesville, sc ) and bumping into a white woman while running to catch a train ( jeff brown, 1916, cedar bluff, miss. ). The eji hopes to erect memorials or markers at some of the lynching sites; the guardian reports few currently exist and notes that eji director bryan stevenson expects challenges in terms of securing funding and approval.",

            "In 1919, a black soldier returned home to blakely, georgia, having survived the horrors of the first world war only to face the terrors of a white mob that awaited him in the jim crow-era south. When the soldier, william little, refused to remove his army uniform, the savage mob exacted their punishment. Little was just one of 3,959 african americans who were brutally and often publicly killed across the southern states between the end of the reconstruction era and the second world war, which is at least 700 more lynchings in these states than previously recorded, according to a report released on tuesday by the equal justice initiative ( eji ).

Little was just one of 3,959 african americans who were brutally and often publicly killed across the southern states between the end of the reconstruction era and the second world war, which is at least 700 more lynchings in these states than previously recorded, according to a report released on tuesday by the equal justice initiative ( eji ).

Judicial watch says 44 pages of emails from clinton's private server that weren't handed over to the government include damning evidence. Chief among that evidence is a 2009 exchange between clinton aide huma abedin and clinton foundation staffer doug band, according to bloomberg. Band tells abedin it's \" important to take care of \" someone whose name has been redacted from the email. Abedin responds that \" personnel has been sending him options. \" \"that the clinton foundation was calling in favors barely three months into hillary clinton's tenure at the state department is deeply troubling, \" bloomberg quotes an rnc spokesperson as saying. The clinton campaign responds that the emails were regarding a young person who worked for clinton's 2008 presidential campaign and who was neither a clinton foundation donor nor employee. \" the fact remains that hillary clinton never took action as secretary of state because of donations to the clinton foundation, \" npr quotes a clinton spokesperson as saying. Hillary clinton wasn't officially involved in the clinton foundation, which was founded by bill clinton, during her time as secretary of state, the wall street journal reports.",

Water temps there can hit 90 degrees fahrenheit, and that's causing the ships to lose power, cnn reports. During a defense committee meeting tuesday, mps interrogated company execs about the type 45 destroyers — said to be the country's most advanced warships ever and expected to last at least two more decades — and their assessments were less than encouraging. A director from ship designer rolls-royce — which claims it was never informed the 8,000-ton ships would sail for long periods in such warm waters, per the mirror — says that equipment is struggling to perform in \" far more arduous conditions [ than ] were initially required, \" resulting in \" total electrical failure. \" the sun explains what causes the ships to turn into \" sitting ducks \": there are two turbines on each ship that redistribute exhaust heat back to the engine, but in too-warm waters the turbines slow down; a \" domino effect \" leads to engine shutdown and, eventually, a complete power outage. Reaction in parliament was mainly astonishment. \" i ' m just absolutely stunned, \" one mp said. \" it's a [ $ 1.4 billion ] asset that you're putting into perhaps a war zone, and we don't know if these people … will go in there and come back out alive because there might be a problem with the power system on the ship. \" britain's defense ministry takes issue with these malfunction claims. \" the type 45 was designed for world-wide operations, from sub-arctic to extreme tropical environments, and continues to operate effectively in the gulf and the south atlantic all year round, \" a rep tells cnn.",

Iger, disney's chief executive. The project was given new impetus this week with the announcement that, after 20 years of negotiations, the company has finally received the blessing of the chinese government to open a theme park in shanghai, potentially unlocking a new giant market for all things mickey. Disney executives are treading carefully, and trying to keep a low profile, as they discuss how much they dare tweak one of the most durable characters in pop culture history to induce new generations of texting, tech-savvy children to embrace him. Disney executives will keenly watch how epic mickey is received, to inform the broader overhaul. Photo keeping cartoon characters trapped in amber is one of the surest routes to irrelevancy. While mickey remains a superstar in many homes, particularly overseas, his static nature has resulted in a generation of americans — the one that grew up with nickelodeon and pixar — that knows him, but may not love him.

            "The effort to re-engineer mickey is still in its early stages, but it involves the top creative and marketing minds in the company, all the way up to robert a. Iger, disney's chief executive. The project was given new impetus this week with the announcement that, after 20 years of negotiations, the company has finally received the blessing of the chinese government to open a theme park in shanghai, potentially unlocking a new giant market for all things mickey. Disney executives are treading carefully, and trying to keep a low profile, as they discuss how much they dare tweak one of the most durable characters in pop culture history to induce new generations of texting, tech-savvy children to embrace him. Disney executives will keenly watch how epic mickey is received, to inform the broader overhaul. Photo keeping cartoon characters trapped in amber is one of the surest routes to irrelevancy. While mickey remains a superstar in many homes, particularly overseas, his static nature has resulted in a generation of americans — the one that grew up with nickelodeon and pixar — that knows him, but may not love him.

To start, the department will ask congress to transfer $ 1.3 billion from funds originally allocated for military operations in iraq to pay for more marine security guards in libya. The new york times lists some of the faults laid out by the panel, led by retired ambassador thomas pickering and former joint chiefs chairman mike mullen: the state department relied on small-time local militias to guard the consulate, instead of more experienced personnel. The department ignored requests for more guards and safety improvements made by officials at the embassy in tripoli. The department waited for specific warnings of attacks instead of taking more proactive steps. Two key bureaus, near eastern affairs and diplomatic security, did not coordinate security plans.",

        "summary": "A \" landmark \" new study out of the national institutes of health helps explain why weight gain after weight loss is so common — and so difficult to avoid. Reporting in the journal obesity, researchers say that weight loss puts the body in a sort of fight mode and results in a \" strong increase in appetite, \" prompting people to eat an extra 100 calories for every two pounds lost. \" that's the very first time that number has been quantified. We never knew how big that number was before the study, \" says the lead author. \" we get patients all the time that hit these plateaus, and we're trying to figure out, what do we do? \" adds a researcher at the scripps clinic. \" it's real clear to us that you really need to deal with the food intake side, the driven appetite, from this paper. \" previous research has established that weight loss leads to a drop in metabolism that often leads to weight gain, reports webmd. These new findings suggest that the gain in appetite has an effect that is three times stronger than the drop in metabolism, and that taken together it's very hard to keep the scale from tipping back toward its starting point. That's the bad news. The good news is that drugs already exist to suppress appetite, and these findings may establish cause to add a prescription to the post-weight loss period, one researcher says. \" this helps to explain that it's not all your fault, \" another says. \" your body fights against the long-term maintenance of that weight. \" ( one oprah fan says that if oprah cannot buy permanent weight loss, maybe it can't be bought. )",

The plan unveiled thursday would provide a possibility of citizenship — contingent on \" work, education, and good moral character \" — to 1.8 million undocumented immigrants brought to the us as children, usa today reports. That's a million more dreamers than were protected by daca. The white house calls it a \" dramatic concession \" to democrats. In return for that concession, the white house is asking for a $ 25 billion \" trust fund \" to build parts of president trump's long-promised wall on the mexican border and improve security on the canadian border. More money would go to additional border guards and immigration judges. The plan restricts family-based immigration to only spouses and minor children. That change represents a 25 % reduction in legal immigration into the us — about 250,000 people per year. The plan also ends the visa lottery system, which provides 50,000 visas a year to people from countries under-represented in the us. Another part of the plan closes what the white house calls \" legal loopholes \" in order to allow for the deportation of more immigrants. White house senior adviser stephen miller says the goal is to get 60 votes in the senate; it's unclear enough democrats will support the plan for that to happen.",

But as the stage is being set for another dramatic showdown, uncertainty looms as to whether the 60 votes will be there to break a republican filibuster. As of wednesday morning, the end game wasn't clear. There was, it appeared, at least 60 non-concrete pledges from senators to back dadt repeal, with arkansas democrat mark pryor becoming the latest to reverse course and offer his support. But while several republicans signaled they informally support overturning the policy prohibiting gays from serving openly in the military, they have conditioned their support to procedural processes for passing the authorization bill as a whole. A lack of resolution to the debate over tax cuts and the budget, for instance, may provide a hook to oppose the defense legislation. As would a debate process that prohibited an arbitrary number of, or time for, amendments. Whether those requirements will be met is truly up to the whims of those laying out the requirements. Early in the day, talks between democratic leadership and sen. Susan collins ( r-me ) over procedural issues hit a snag, the plum line's greg sargent reported. Shortly thereafter, however",

The massive defense policy bill contains the provision to repeal the \" don't ask, don't tell \" law. Reid's first attempt to bring up the defense bill earlier this year failed to garner the 60 necessary votes to start debate. Without passage of the 2011 defense authorization bill this year, the chances for a repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military are dimmer next year, when republicans will hold a greater number of seats in the senate as well as the majority in the house. The gop is generally more skeptical of the administration's plan for repeal.sen. Carl levin ( d-mich ), the chairman of the senate armed services committee and a chief supporter of repeal, told reporters on tuesday that democrats have a \" good shot \" at getting the 60 votes necessary to start debating the defense bill.

But as the stage is being set for another dramatic showdown, uncertainty looms as to whether the 60 votes will be there to break a republican filibuster. As of wednesday morning, the end game wasn't clear. There was, it appeared, at least 60 non-concrete pledges from senators to back dadt repeal, with arkansas democrat mark pryor becoming the latest to reverse course and offer his support. But while several republicans signaled they informally support overturning the policy prohibiting gays from serving openly in the military, they have conditioned their support to procedural processes for passing the authorization bill as a whole. A lack of resolution to the debate over tax cuts and the budget, for instance, may provide a hook to oppose the defense legislation. As would a debate process that prohibited an arbitrary number of, or time for, amendments. Whether those requirements will be met is truly up to the whims of those laying out the requirements. Early in the day, talks between democratic leadership and sen. Susan collins ( r-me ) over procedural issues hit a snag, the plum line's greg sargent reported. Shortly thereafter, however",
            "' don't ask'repeal could come up for a vote in the senate wednesday by roxana tiron - senate majority leader harry reid ( d-nev. ) said he plans to bring up the 2011 defense authorization bill for debate as early as wednesday. The massive defense policy bill contains the provision to repeal the \" don't ask, don't tell \" law. Reid's first attempt to bring up the defense bill earlier this year failed to garner the 60 necessary votes to start debate. Without passage of the 2011 defense authorization bill this year, the chances for a repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military are dimmer next year, when republicans will hold a greater number of seats in the senate as well as the majority in the house. The gop is generally more skeptical of the administration's plan for repeal.sen. Carl levin ( d-mich ), the chairman of the senate armed services committee and a chief supporter of repeal, told reporters on tuesday that democrats have a \" good shot \" at getting the 60 votes necessary to start debating the defense bill. But reid's plan to reconsider the defense authorization bill may fail. His move depends on whether there will be any republican senators breaking with their caucus on their pledge to not back any bills until the senate passes"

        "summary": "Bill o'reilly settled with six women over harassment allegations, and one of them says she hasn't said a word — until now. As the new york times explains, these types of settlements typically include iron-clad confidentiality and nondisparagement clauses. Rachel witlieb bernstein says it was o'reilly who didn't adhere to the terms of their july 2002 settlement. In a suit filed monday, she accused him of defamation and breach of contract over comments he has publicly made about the allegations. The times says one of its own articles plays a role in the suit: in an april story on the allegations, it noted the network knew of allegations since 2002 and recounted an incident in which he publicly screamed at bernstein, then a \" young producer, \" in the newsroom ( she says she was not a source for the article ). Fox news and o'reilly responded to the article. Per the suit, the settlement restricted them to saying only \" the matter has been resolved ( or settled ). \" instead, she claims they not only violated that but defamed her, with fox news saying no reports about o'reilly were made to a hotline; she notes such a hotline didn't exist during her tenure, and that she went to hr many times. As for o'reilly, the suit says he \" portrayed himself as a'target ' \" and the women as \" extortionate. \" says lawyer nancy erika smith, \" this cynical falsehood about a nonexistent hotline was made to bolster o'reilly's claim that the women who received settlements must have fabricated their claims or they would have complained. \" bernstein claims the comments led to distress, lost income, and sickness, among other things.",
