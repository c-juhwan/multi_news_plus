        "summary": "If anyone can answer questions on a standardized test about the poems \" the real case \" and \" midnight, \" it should be sara holbrook — the poet who wrote them. But as the washington post reports, holbrook recently took a stab at a couple of state of texas assessments of academic readiness exams, and she didn't do so hot. \" such a dunce, \" was her first self-flagellating reaction to realizing she had no clue how to answer the questions about her own poems, described in a column she penned for the huffington post. Her self-doubt quickly turned to irritation, however, toward the test makers who decided to a ) include \" a real case, \" her \" most neurotic poem, \" on a test designed for seventh-graders, and b ) make the kids give a \" line-by-line dissection, painful and delivered without anesthetic. \" holbrook takes to task not only the \" sadistic behemoth pearson \" ( the company that administered the test in 2013 and 2014, the years in which her poems were featured ), but also poorly trained test scorers. Among the questions she couldn't answer were those about the poet's motivation for stanza breaks and for the capitalization of certain words. Holbrook implores parents, educators, and lawmakers to stop taking these test results so seriously. \" any test that questions the motivations of the author without asking the author is a big baloney sandwich, \" she writes. \" mostly test makers do this to dead people who can't protest. But i ' m not dead. I protest. \" ( an absence note from a chicago dad took on standardized tests. )",

But despite trump sounding unconcerned, others in the white house are very concerned: \" with gary gone, i just think, from a policy perspective, it means disaster, \" one official tells politico. Other aides expressed similar sentiments, explaining that cohn was one of the few remaining aides who could talk trump out of bad ideas. Others who spoke to politico say that cohn's departure will leave the national economic council without a leader, and that others on the nec who are loyal to cohn may also head for the door, particularly if navarro is chosen as his replacement. And then there's the fact that, as politico puts it, the white house has \" struggled to attract top-tier talent, \" and some high-profile republicans have privately expressed an unwillingness to take a position there. Meanwhile, bloomberg has details on the hours before cohn announced his resignation; sources say trump demanded cohn's cooperation on tariffs, cohn didn't answer, and within hours he had announced his resignation.

Paramount claims the film's use of the fictional language klingon adds up to copyright infringement; the filmmakers contend that attempting to copyright klingon is absurd given the language is an \" idea or a system. \" for legal precedent, they cite the system of bookkeeping: \" although copyright protects the author's expression of the system, it does not prevent others from using the system. \" but there's doesn't appear to be a quick and easy answer. The us copyright office doesn't specifically \" deal with the copyrightability of constructed or fictional languages, let alone klingon, \" observes consumerist, which was unable to dig up much in the way of case law on the matter. Paramount, which claims exclusive ownership over many star trek features, including characters, themes, plots, dialogue, settings, props, character makeup, costumes, sets, fictional language, and so forth, has responded to the filmmakers ' plea by noting that \" a language is only useful if it can be used to communicate with people, and there are no klingons with whom to communicate, \" reports torrentfreak.

David gaut, 54, was found dead in his home in new tredegar, wales, on saturday afternoon, the telegraph reports. Three local men — darren evesham, 47, ieuan harley, 23, and david osbourne, 51 — have been charged with his murder and residents suspect they acted after learning what gaut had done decades earlier. He was released from prison last november after serving 33 years for the murder of chi ming shek, the 17-month-old son of his then-girlfriend, jane pickthall. Prosecutors said gaut killed the boy while pickthall had gone for a night out with friends and then placed the body under a chest of drawers to make it look like an accident, the caerphilly observer reports. Experts testified that the boy's injuries had been caused by being punched, kicked, or thrown at a hard surface in what was apparently a prolonged attack. \" on the jury's finding you not only murdered that child but also tortured him, \" the sentencing judge said. Neighbors tell the sun that gaut said he had been in prison after he moved to the area around six weeks ago, but gave vague and inconsistent details. One resident says they looked him up online after seeing his full name on a letter, and were horrified to discover what he had done.",

At least two sets of newlyweds were among the tight-knit group. They were on their way from amsterdam, ny, where they all lived, to celebrate amy's birthday at a brewery in cooperstown when the limo crashed in schoharie, killing all the passengers as well as the driver and two pedestrians. Witnesses say the limo sped down a steep hill before losing control at the bottom, where two state highways intersect in a spot notorious for accidents, the new york times reports. The limo crashed into an empty vehicle in the parking lot of the apple barrel country store. National transportation safety board chairman robert sumwalt says the \" horrific \" number of fatalities makes it the worst us transportation accident since a plane crash near buffalo killed 50 people in 2009. Valeria abeling tells the washington post that her niece, 34-year-old erin mcgowan, died in the accident, along with shane, the husband she married in june. She says the group had rented a bus, but it broke down and the company sent the limo instead. Abeling says her daughter received a text from mcgowan 20 minutes before the crash saying the vehicle arrived in \" terrible condition. \"",

        "summary": "There's a contentious new issue surrounding environmental protection agency head scott pruitt, and this one has nothing to do with security. Pruitt on tuesday suggested a new rule that would allow the epa to only make use of scientific studies whose data has been made publicly available in full. He called it a way to bring transparency to the epa's decision-making process; the washington post reports it's a change conservatives have been hankering after for some time. To understand why many scientists aren't pleased with the proposal, know these two words: epidemiological studies. A rep for the american association for the advancement of science tells npr that these studies, which can look at the effects of things like pesticides or pollutants, often don't adhere to pruitt's standard for good reason. \" those studies involve people like you and me, signing confidentiality agreements that the scientists doing the studies won't reveal my personal health information, \" sean gallagher explains. \" it involves private data. \" the post reports that a letter sent to pruitt on monday in advance of his announcement was signed by 985 scientists who called the move a \" restricting \" one that would lead to \" policies and practices that will ignore significant risks to the health of every american. \" as far as risks go, others have taken issue with pruitt's assertion that the move would put an emphasis on science that is \" reproducible. \" as a rep for the union of concerned scientists says to the los angeles times, \" you can't ethically go back and redo studies on the impact of lead in drinking water on kids. \"",

Carneys point township says dupont dumped 100 million pounds of toxic waste at a 1,400-acre chemical manufacturing complex two miles outside of town, near the delaware river, and must now establish a $ 1.1 billion remediation trust. Dupont — which used mercury, benzene, and ethyl chloride at the site — has previously settled lawsuits related to contaminated drinking water in the area. The new jersey department of environmental protection says it will be 999 years before groundwater is safe to drink, reports courthouse news. Dupont transferred ownership of the complex — known as the chambers works site — to spinoff company chemours in 2015, but carneys point says that by failing to notify regulators of the change, dupont side-stepped a law that would have forced it to first clean up hazardous waste at the site. Dupont simply sought \" to shed 100 years of accumulated environmental liability to become a more attractive merger partner \" for dow chemical, the lawsuit states. The town now fears the proposed $ 130 billion dupont-dow merger will force chemours into bankruptcy, meaning \" chambers works would be left as a rusting industrial nightmare that the residents of new jersey will be left to clean up without the funds to do so. \"",

Researchers found the remains of an adult doe and two fawns in the snake's intestines, they report in bioinvasions record. ( they titled the report \" supersize me. \" ) that's a relatively short time for a snake to put down three big meals, notes study co-author scott boback. \" if a python is capable of eating three deer in three months, \" he marvels, then it clearly raises serious questions about the pythons ' impact on the everglades ecosystem. \" we don't even know how many of them are out there. \" what scientists do know is that ever since the burmese python first surfaced in the area in the 1980s — the reason is unclear, but careless pet owners are generally blamed — the population numbers of raccoons, rabbits, foxes, and other mammals have plummeted. \"all these studies are putting together a story that we just can't ignore anymore, \" boback tells vox, which takes a more in-depth look at the implications of the python invasion. As to how a python can take down a deer, this video via naples news of a florida hunter rescuing a deer in mid-strangle might provide an idea. And floridians outside the everglades will likely be unhappy to hear that the snakes appear to be expanding their territory to the florida keys and western palm beach county, reports the orlando sentinel.

But with san francisco residents seemingly ready to oppose drilling on the 5.5-acre property, the price fell to $ 9 million.

It was also used by russian hunters in the 19th century to catch otters. Then frank lloyd wright's son, mendel glickman, snagged it for just $ 50,000 in 1964 with the hope of extracting gas and creating a getaway hotel. Now his son david, the attorney in thailand, owns it and wants to sell. Bureaucratic headaches may await the next owner, but \" even if all the new buyer does is plant a flag that says ' mine ' on the top-most point of red rock island ( 172 feet above sea level, incidentally ), the bragging rights here are pretty extreme, \" says the chronicle.",

Now those researchers say they've managed to pinpoint exactly why, and it all boils down to family support policies. \" as social scientists we rarely completely explain anything, but in this case we completely \" do, lead researcher jennifer glass tells quartz. The researchers write that what they found \" was astonishing \": when there are good family support policies such as parental leave and paid vacation in place, \" the parental deficit in happiness was completely eliminated, accomplished by raising parent's happiness rather than lowering nonparents ' happiness. \" the chicago tribune reports a slew of factors were considered: unplanned parenthood, guaranteed paid sick days, the flexibility of work schedules, and a country's gdp, things that allowed researchers to confirm that more unexpected pregnancies, bigger families, or living in a richer country weren't the drivers. \" the negative effects of parenthood on happiness were entirely explained by the presence or absence of social policies allowing parents to better combine paid work with family obligations. \" further, those countries with the best policy \" packages \" had no happiness gap between parents and non-parents. Quips the tribune, \" it's almost like trying to raise children and earn a living in a country with zero weeks of guaranteed paid leave and child care that costs as much as college is draining.

On tuesday, the national science foundation announced its annual divvying-up of graduate research grants worth nearly $ 140,000 each, and it turns out the 26-year-old doctoral student was one of the recipients — except he had no clue, because the email from the nsf had gone right to spam, the burlington free press reports. \" i started getting cryptic texts from friends, \" nicholson says, per a uvm press release. \" at first, i had no clue what they were talking about. Then a friend who didn't know my middle name texted: ' if your full name is charles casey nicholson, you just won an nsf [ grant ]. \" it is, and he had. Nicholson checked his spam folder and there was the cheerful nsf missive announcing his award. The money — about $ 100,000 to him, $ 36,000 as an allowance to the school — will go toward three more years of his project studying the pollination of blueberry crops by native bees, the press notes. He ' ll also be able to have a real meal now and then. \" it's a pay bump. I ' ll be eating less pizza, \" he tells the paper. And the good luck keeps on buzzing: while he was on the nsf website, he noticed that his friend and uvm colleague samantha alger had won some cash of her own. He was the one who texted her to fill her in, per the press. ( read another wild email story involving a smuggled cellphone and an \" ingenious \" scheme. )",

        "summary": "This year's golden globes ceremony turned out to be quite the political affair, and sunday's oscars will likely be no different, especially with donald trump critic meryl streep in attendance. Here's what to expect: will host jimmy kimmel mention trump? it's a safe bet. He tells the new york times he likes to talk about \" what people are talking about, \" and trump \" is topic no. 1, 2 and 4 \" at the dinner table. Stars appearing on stage are likely to reference trump, too, reports the bbc. It lists streep as one of several celebrities that might make a political statement. Mahershala ali and casey affleck are two others. Should they use their time on stage to talk politics, they certainly won't be the first. The verge looks at the historical role of politics at the oscars, but notes that while a political speech is generally accepted today, it wasn't always that way. The los angeles times likewise identifies the 11 \" most notable political moments \" at the oscars, including the time in 1993 that richard gere opted to discuss china. The list gives the impression that such moments are becoming more frequent. But no matter what happens at this year's ceremony, there's a good chance trump won't like what he sees. He tweeted frequently about previous shows, and the new york daily news rounds up some of his slams, including: \" i should host the #oscars to shake things up — this is not good! \" in 2014, when ellen degeneres was hosting.",

            "Lenovo group ltd. ( 992 ), the biggest personal computer maker, said chief executive officer yang yuanqing will share at least $ 3 million of his bonus with workers for a second straight year after posting record sales. About 10,000 workers will get payments this month to recognize their contributions, gina qiao, senior vice president of human resources, said in a memo to some workers. The memo was confirmed by spokesman jeffrey shafer, who said the total payment will be about $ 3.25 million. Lenovo posted revenue of $ 34 billion and pc shipments of 52.4 million units in the 12 months ended march 31 as the company gained market share and expanded sales of smartphones and tablets. The 48-year-old yang, who gave $ 3 million from his bonus a year earlier, led the company past hewlett-packard co. ( hpq ) in the june quarter. \"this is quite rare, especially for a chairman of a chinese company, to use his personal money as a bonus to reward employees, \" said kirk yang, a managing director at barclays plc in hong kong who rates the shares overweight. Lenovo, which has headquarters in beijing and morrisville, north carolina, rose 0.7 percent to hk$ 7.55 in hong kong trading. The stock has climbed 7.6 percent this year while the city's benchmark hang seng index has dropped 2.1 percent.",

One west end resident tells the cbc that she was shocked, but her husband cracked up laughing as they heard one officer ask, \" can you give me a blow job? \" and another officer reply, \" you have too much body hair \" as the chopper flew over their home. Before the officers realized the mistake and turned the pa off, residents took to social media to share snippets of the conversation — and complain that they missed the x-rated parts. Police have apologized and say disciplinary measures for the officers involved are being considered, the winnipeg free press reports. \" we're sincerely apologetic about it, \" a spokesman says. \" we're going to review the situation, i can assure you, and members of the executive are very much aware of the sensitivity and the nature of what was broadcast, and they will be looking into it and ultimately make a determination from there. \" ( a southwest airlines pilot accidentally let dozens of other pilots hear his complaint about failing to score with flight attendants at \" one of the ugliest bases. \" )",

The administration, accused by critics of not being tough enough on russia, imposed sanctions on 19 russians last month and has joined dozens of other nations in expelling russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of an ex-spy in britain. \" if they do something tough like this, it may go some distance in reassuring angry members of congress and the public who are looking at the midterms and wondering if this administration is focused on the russian threat and taking moves to address it, \" former treasury official liz rosenberg tells the post. Sources say the sanctions will target around a half-dozen oligarchs from a list of russian business and political leaders the administration released earlier this year.

Cristea and burnaz had been in london to celebrate burnaz's birthday, and burnaz, who suffered a broken foot in the attack, had an even bigger surprise planned: he intended to ask cristea to marry him the same day as the attack. He joined her family in issuing a statement that described the \" crushing pain and emptiness \" now that cristea has passed, noting she was \" cruelly and brutally ripped away from our lives in the most heartless and spiritless way. \" they also added any leftover money people had donated to help fund her medical care would now go to charity.

Instead of debating each other, the candidates took two turns speaking over two hours, and delivered what the new york times calls \" strikingly uneven performances \" in which they focused their attacks on president obama and hillary clinton instead of their fellow republicans. Trump said he didn't have time to attend the event, though politico reports that he offered to attend if the union leader, which sponsored the \" voters first forum, \" gave him its endorsement. Sens. Ted cruz, marco rubio, and rand paul took part via telecast, having stayed in washington for the planned parenthood vote. Mike huckabee and jim gilmore, the 17th candidate, were absent. Some highlights from the forum: carly fiorina insisted she was the republican best able to take on clinton, saying the party needs a nominee \" who is going to throw every punch. \" in what politico sees as a sign of desperation from the candidate at the bottom of the polls, sen. Lindsey graham brought up the lewinsky scandal. \" i ' m fluent in clinton-speak, \" he said. \" when bill says i didn't have sex with that woman — he did. \" rick perry got plenty of laughs when he was asked what federal agencies he would cut, which the times notes is the same question that probably doomed his 2012 campaign. \" i've heard this question before, \" perry quipped. Cruz turned in one of the better performances and was his usual \" firebrand self, \" according to the hill. If the iran \" deal goes through, the obama administration will become the leading global financier of radical islamic terrorism, \" he said. Chris christie, who may not make the final cut on thursday, said, \" jack, you saying i ' m washed up? \" when moderator jack heath asked the nj governor if he would have had a better chance in 2012, per the times.",

        "summary": "For some, sexual identity isn't about whom you find attractive, but whether you feel much attraction at all. In wired, kat mcgowan suggests that our expanding understanding of sexuality may still have a long way to go. Asexual people are defined at the asexual visibility and education network as those \" who do not experience sexual attraction. \" that support network, wired reports, gave rise to the term \" demisexual, \" which demisexuality.org defines as an \" orientation in which someone feels sexual attraction only to people with whom they have an emotional bond. \" then there are gray-asexuals, also known as \" gray-aces, \" somewhere in between; their sexual desire level fluctuates, mcgowan writes. Among those mcgowan interviews, there are also varying degrees of nonsexual romantic feeling. Some are panromantic, with the potential to develop such feelings for anyone; others call themselves heteroromantic or aromantic. Though the labels exist, there's no need to get caught up in them, say those who use them: \" every single asexual i've met embraces fluidity — i might be gray or asexual or demisexual, \" says a 24-year-old. \" us aces are like: whatevs. \" it's unclear how common the experience is, with surveys putting the figure between 0.6 % and 5.5 % of the population. Its rarity means grappling with others ' assumptions: \" people ask, 'who hurt you? ' \" a student tells the pitt news. \" no one hurt me — this is just who i am. \" ( the internet offers a refuge to those who define themselves as asexual. )",

The principal is in serious but stable condition, ap reports. The student, identified as robert butler jr., fled the school and fatally shot himself in his car. Butler — who had transferred to the high school in october — did not shoot any students. In a rambling facebook post, he blamed omaha and the high school for changing him, and said he wanted people to remember the person he was before. \" he was popular with students and seemed real pleasant, \" the principal of his previous high school told the omaha world-herald, describing butler as \" a fairly normal, average \" student.

However, when the church calls a holy year, or jubilee year, it's a time for sins to be remitted and pardons welcomed from god, per the national catholic reporter; jubilee years have historically taken place every 25 to 50 years since the year 1300, the paper adds.

            "Answer yes. In the 1983 code of canon law ( cic ) eight other sins carry the penalty of automatic excommunication: apostasy, heresy, schism ( cic 1364: 1 ), violating the sacred species ( cic 1367 ), physically attacking the pope ( cic 1370: 1 ), sacramentally absolving an accomplice in a sexual sin ( cic 1378: 1 ), consecrating a bishop without authorization ( cic 1382 ), and directly violating the seal of confession ( 1388: 1 ). Apostasy is the total repudiation of the christian faith. Heresy is the obstinate doubt or denial, after baptism, of a defined catholic doctrine.

Bradley was rehired until 2014 after the us reached the second round of the 2010 world cup finals, but few people are surprised by the move now to replace him, the washington post notes.

A washington post-abc news poll reveals that if the election were held today, obama would lose the popular vote 45 % to 49 %. While the post reminds us that the electoral college, not the popular vote, is the ultimate decider, it notes that spread roughly mirrors the 4 points obama actually won by, and reflects plummeting support from his key demographics: obama won women by 11 points; now, his edge is down to one point. He won voters aged 18-39 by 18 points; that's down to two. He won voters earning less than $ 50,000 by 22 points; it's down to three. He's now nine points in the hole with voters without a college degree, after winning them by four points. While he'd still win 59 % of liberals, that's down from 75 % — and 20 % now say they'd vote for romney. Obama's approval rating has fallen 13 points this year to 42 %, tying its lowest mark ever in the poll. The culprit, as you might suspect, is at least in part the affordable care act rollout, which 63 % think has been handled poorly. The public now opposes the law itself 57 % -40 %, its worst numbers yet, and 71 % favor delaying the individual mandate.",

But researchers out of new york university report in sciencedaily that their latest study suggests it isn't just meat but highly processed \" bad \" carbohydrates ( think sugary soft drinks and pizza ) that are linked to higher cancer rates. They've presented their findings at the american society for nutrition scientific sessions and annual meeting, noting that the link is strongest to prostate cancer, which is nearly twice as common among men who eat \" bad \" carbs over \" good \" ones such as legumes and whole grains. The longitudinal study follows 3,100 volunteers as far back as the 1970s, with participants regularly reporting detailed food questionnaires starting in 1991. All foods were categorized by glycemic index, which measures carbohydrate quality by looking at its impact on blood sugar compared to a reference food, as well as glycemic load, which measures both the quantity and quality of carbs in each item. Controlling for many variables, they compared these results to the participants ' cancer rates. And while popular science notes that there are some holes in the study, including that 99 % of the participants were caucasian, the study is a \" robust \" one and will likely be followed up by additional investigations into the precise mechanism at play between carbs and cancers.

A new study highlights one more reason to avoid sugary beverages, processed foods and other energy-dense carbohydrate-containing foods -- cutting them may help reduce your risk of cancer. In the new study, regular consumption of sugary beverages was associated with a 3 times greater risk of prostate cancer and higher intake of processed lunch foods such as pizza, burgers and meat sandwiches doubled prostate cancer risk.

That was peta's argument against australian sheep shearers last year when the group revealed video shot by an undercover operative, abc news australia reports. But the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals disallowed the video for reasons that aren't clear, and the case turned on alleged verbal abuse. \" i think it is conceivable that verbal abuse of an extreme nature against an animal, whether it be human, sheep or otherwise, could constitute an act of violence, \" says nicolah donovan, president of lawyers for animals. But ken turner, head of the sheep-shearing station involved, scoffed at the notion. \" i still haven't had a sheep come to me ( to complain ) — they didn't even look offended to me after they were shorn, \" says turner, 9 news reports. \" i thought, is this a joke? is this april fools? \" peta lost the case, and some media outlets poked fun at the story. But video on peta's website ( warning: graphic content ) appears to show australian sheep shearers punching sheep in the face and striking them in the head with a hammer and metal clippers. Sheeps were reportedly left bleeding from their mouths, noses, and eyes. And some graziers recently admitted that livestock work requires \" a degree of intimidation, \" says abc. \" there is no such thing as ' humane ' wool, \" a peta official told nbc news last year. \" the industry is infested with violence and peta documented cruelty in nearly every shearing shed that we entered. \"",

What happens on the equinox — and why are day and night not quite equal? check out these five questions ( and answers ) to learn more. 1. What happens on the equinox? like the spring equinox in march, the autumnal equinox marks an astronomical turning point of the seasons. [ take the quiz — which season are you? ] since the earth is tilted on its axis of rotation by 23.5 degrees, the northern and southern hemispheres receive different amounts of amounts of sunlight throughout the year. On the equinox, however, the orbital plane of the equator becomes geometrically aligned with the center of the sun so that neither hemisphere is tilted away or toward the sun ( visualize earth's axis going into the screen in the image below ): from our earthbound perspective, the sun appears directly overhead along the equator, and day and night are roughly equal in length ( emphasis added — see no. 4 ). 2.

The documents, obtained in a freedom of information act request by a national security institute at george washington university, explain that area 51 got its start in 1955 because the government needed a place to test u-2 spy planes. Aliens in crashed spaceships are nowhere to be found in the documents. But here's one weird detail that is: the government initially called it \" paradise ranch \" to make the \" facility in the middle of nowhere \" sound more alluring to workers. The documents include a cia map of the site, which is pretty much the same one that has long been available in a google maps search for \" area 51, \" notes cnn. So what's the big deal here? it's \" clearly a conscious decision to acknowledge the name, the location rather than play pretend about the secrecy, \" says the researcher who filed the foia request, jeffrey richelson. It should pave the way for the release of even more information about the site, he adds. You can dig into the 400 pages of documents here.",

Traders were already nervous and the greek crisis had been sending prices downward even before the panic, the new york times notes.

        "summary": "It's official: sheriff joe arpaio of arizona has been criminally charged with federal contempt of court and could face up to six months in jail if convicted. The case stems from december 2011 when a federal judge barred the maricopa county sheriff's office from conducting arpaio's signature immigration patrols targeting latinos, solely on suspicion they were in the country illegally, as a racial-profiling case against the sheriff's office was playing out. Evidence, however, suggests officers continued with the program for at least another 18 months, reports the arizona republic. Lawyers for arpaio, 84, say he unintentionally violated the judge's order. Arpaio — who may still face a charge of obstruction of justice for allegedly failing to hand in evidence — has previously said a criminal-contempt charge would be nothing more than an effort to prevent his re-election to a seventh term. His dec. 6 trial date ensures he won't lose any time on the campaign trail, which he apparently needs: arpaio sits 15 points behind his democratic challenger, according to a poll released last week, per reuters. Arpaio's campaign manager, however, says internal polling has arpaio leading by 7.5 points.",

Kim \" just stated that the ' nuclear button is on his desk at all times, ' \" trump tweeted tuesday. \" will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that i too have a nuclear button, but it is a much bigger &amp; more powerful one than his, and my button works! \" trump, who appears to be stepping up his rhetoric against pyongyang after months of relatively restrained remarks, also brought back his \" rocket man \" nickname for kim earlier tuesday, the washington post reports. The reaction on social media ranged from shock that trump was treating the prospect of nuclear war so blithely to delight that trump was attacking kim and upsetting \" snowflakes \" at the same time, the new york times reports. Some — including cnn host brian stelter — argued that trump might be having some kind of meltdown, or argued that twitter should shut down his account for violating its terms of service. Others noted that trump doesn't actually have a big nuclear button on his desk — to launch a nuclear strike, he would have to use a briefcase known as the \" nuclear football. \" ( relations between north korea and south korea, meanwhile, may be improved by the winter olympics in the south next month. )",

It seems that the two are engaged in what discovery describes as a gravitational tug-of-war, and mars is going to win. It will take a while, about 30 million to 50 million years, but eventually phobos will literally fall apart. For now, mars is drawing the moon toward it at a rate of about 6 feet per century, though the two won't actually collide. Someday, phobos will drop low enough to reach what's known as the roche limit, explains universe today, and it will be \" torn apart \" by the planet's tidal forces. Researchers came to the conclusion by studying the moon's distinctive grooves, marks that were once thought to be created by asteroid strikes. Now, however, they liken them to \" stretch marks \" formed by this tug-of-war, the scientists say in a post at science daily. \" we think that phobos has already started to fail, and the first sign of this failure is the production of these grooves, \" says terry hurford of nasa's goddard space flight center. \" eventually, phobos will be ripped apart before it reaches mars'surface. \" phobos already holds the distinction of being the moon closest to its planet in our solar system, orbiting at a relatively scant distance of 3,700 miles. While the idea that the moon's grooves were formed by tidal forces, not impacts, was first floated years ago, it was generally rejected because phobos was thought to be too solid to succumb to such forces. The new thinking is that phobos ' interior is more like a \" rubble pile, barely holding together, \" according to nasa.

That's because prop 65 forces the state to add any item known to up one's cancer risk to a list; products containing a listed item in an amount over a certain threshold must carry a \" clear and reasonable warning. \" should the state add processed meat to the list in the wake of the who report that found such meats can cause colorectal cancer, required labeling could follow. It isn't clear what sort of warnings would be required. The law states a suitable warning can include a note on packaging or a sign where a product is sold, for instance, per the huffington post. But even if meat makes the list, \" meats will never have to be labeled in the state of california, \" a consultant with the national cattlemen's beef association tells reuters.

The person is killing well outside the london borough of croydon and claiming not just felines, but possibly foxes, rabbits, and birds, reports the guardian. Reports on the number of confirmed mutilated cat corpses conflict somewhat, but the independent says more than 40 have been found since october, and both it and the guardian put the overall victim count in excess of 100. \" it looks like the killer... Does what he does, then puts the cat back where he finds them. It is often right on people's doorsteps or driveways, \" says the co-founder of the south norwood animal rescue and liberty ( snarl ) charity. The rspca says its own post-mortem exams have determined \" blunt force trauma \" was the cause of death, with the mutilations — slashed neck or decapitation, slashed belly or organs removed, tail or leg severed — likely happening afterward. Snarl has been pushing the media to call the reaper the m25 animal killer, with m25 a reference to the 117-mile highway that nearly encircles london, as the mutilated animals have been found within and outside of it. Peta, for its part, has offered a roughly $ 7,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the killer, writing, \" history shows that past incidents involving cruelty to animals regularly appear in the records of serial rapists and murderers. \" but the brutality has yet to slow; the evening standard reports two more cats may have fallen victim to the killer last week.

However, she said stanley was put on a 12-month unpaid leave last month after another attendant complained. Lena masri, an attorney with michigan chapter of the council on american-islamic relations, says the employee's complaint against stanley had \" islamophobic \" overtones, noting she carried a book with \" foreign writings \" and wore a head scarf. Expressjet issued a statement saying the airline values diversity but could not comment on personnel matters."

        "summary": "You know what they say about drastic times. Rhino poaching has gotten so much worse in namibia in the past year that the government is moving forward with a drastic measure — cutting off the coveted horns before poachers can get to them. Unfortunately, even this may not fully deter poachers, who at least in zimbabwe have still killed dehorned rhinos to get what they could for the stubs that remained, reports the smithsonian. Trading rhino horns is banned by the un, but they're used in chinese medicine as a treatment for fevers and gout and in vietnam as a hangover remedy; their consumption is even becoming a status symbol among wealthy men in vietnam. Roughly a third of the planet's 4,800 black rhinos live in namibia, and on the surface, the fact that 14 rhinos were killed there this year may not sound alarming, especially when compared to what neighboring south africa has seen: 769 white rhinos poached this year, per bloomberg. \" it is minor in terms of the total population, but disturbing that more rhinos have been poached in the past year than the past 10 years combined, \" the managing director of the world wildlife fund tells vice news. The plan is to first anesthetize the rhinos, in some cases from helicopters, and use chainsaws or hacksaws to remove the horns. A new anti-poaching agency of 300 law enforcement officers and surveillance drones will also patrol the national parks. ( last year, poachers killed what may have been the last standing rhino in mozambique. )",

        "summary": "In the early 1980s, byron preiss buried 12 keys underground in north america that, when found, can be turned in for gems worth $ 1,000 each. He and a number of collaborators created a book called the secret: a treasure hunt!, published in 1982, that contains a dozen paintings and poems, each of which leads the way to the location of one key — as long as the finder is willing to dig three feet and unearth one of the ceramic casques that holds each key. Preiss was inspired by a wildly popular book with the same idea, masquerade, that was published in the uk in 1979 — but the secret wasn't nearly so popular, the clues are difficult, and just two keys have been found in the ensuing 32 years. Preiss, the only person who knew exactly where the keys are buried, died in 2005. But thanks to the book's resurgence on the internet, james renner is determined to unearth one of the keys, almost 30 years after he first became enchanted with the book as an 8-year-old boy at an ohio library, he writes in boing boing. A reddit post introduced the book to a new generation of treasure seekers late last year, and it includes links to all sorts of resources, including a comprehensive wiki about the book, high-resolution digital versions of the paintings, a map of the presumed locations of the keys, and much, much more. Or you can do things the hard way, buy the amazon kindle version of the book yourself, and try to decode it. As for the two keys found so far, the first was dug up by three kids in chicago in 1984, and the second was found by two lawyers in cleveland in 2004. The rest are still up for grabs — and, preiss ' widow confirms to renner, the gems are, too, so anyone who finds a key will be rewarded. Renner is set to interview the three kids from 1984 and then travel to various locations to search for more keys — all with a documentary crew in tow to film the hunt.

        "summary": "An incredibly rare and valuable stamp stolen right out of its exhibition frame at a 1955 convention resurfaced this month in new york and has promptly rocked the philatelic world. \" inverted jenny \" stamps are considered the most famous in america: a printing accident in 1918 produced a single sheet of 100 of the stamps, each featuring an upside-down curtiss jn-4h biplane, npr explains. In 1955, someone swiped a block of four from the collection of ethel stewart mccoy, whose father was a dow jones founder. It is \" one of the most notorious crimes in philatelic history, \" scott english, administrator of the american philatelic research library, tells the ap. The stamp was submitted this month to new york auction house spink usa by an unnamed man in his 20s who hails from the uk and says he inherited it from his grandfather; it's unclear if he knew it was stolen. A press release from spink usa states that the inverted jenny was \" determined to be position 76 in the pane of 100 subjects \" — the one in the bottom right of the block of four stolen. Identification took some sleuthing: in a long-ago attempt to disguise it, the stamp \" had been reperforated at right and most of the gum was removed, so the pencil position numbers written on the gummed side had been lost. \" positions 75 and 65 turned up in 1958 and 1982, respectively, and the new discovery leaves only one of the four stolen stamps unaccounted for. ( in 2014, a dealer offered a $ 50,000 reward for the missing inverted jennies. ) the american philatelic research library at the american philatelic society was given rights to the stamps by mccoy, who died in 1980, and is working with the auction house to take possession of the stamp. ( by one measure, this stamp is the most expensive thing ever sold. )",

These are among the key findings from a new report based on a survey of 802 teens that examines teens ' privacy management on social media sites: teens are sharing more information about themselves on social media sites than they did in the past. For the five different types of personal information that we measured in both 2006 and 2012, each is significantly more likely to be shared by teen social media users in our most recent survey.

            "Teens share a wide range of information about themselves on social media sites; indeed the sites themselves are designed to encourage the sharing of information and the expansion of networks. However, few teens embrace a fully public approach to social media. Instead, they take an array of steps to restrict and prune their profiles, and their patterns of reputation management on social media vary greatly according to their gender and network size. These are among the key findings from a new report based on a survey of 802 teens that examines teens ' privacy management on social media sites: teens are sharing more information about themselves on social media sites than they did in the past. For the five different types of personal information that we measured in both 2006 and 2012, each is significantly more likely to be shared by teen social media users in our most recent survey. Teen twitter use has grown significantly: 24 % of online teens use twitter, up from 16 % in 2011. The typical ( median ) teen facebook user has 300 friends, while the typical teen twitter user has 79 followers. Focus group discussions with teens show that they have waning enthusiasm for facebook, disliking the increasing adult presence, people sharing excessively, and stressful \"drama, \" but they keep using it because participation is an important part of overall teenage socializing. 60",

Its unesco world heritage listing describes it as \" the finest example of an 18th-century north european royal residence inspired by the palace of versailles. \" while the queen doesn't get into specifics about individual spirits, time cites a 2010 swedish article that references a \" gray man \" and a \" white lady \" said to roam there. As for backup, the king's sister, princess christina, agrees the castle is indeed a phantom favorite. \" there is much energy in this house. It would be strange if it didn't take the form of guises, \" she tells the filmmakers.
