        "summary": "People may well love palcohol, and that's exactly what some lawmakers are worried about. Introduced in 2012 and approved for sale by the feds last month, the powdered-alcohol product is running into strong opposition despite pleas from its inventor, the new york times reports. Six states have already banned it, and new york sen. Charles schumer has introduced federal legislation along the same lines. \" i am in total disbelief that our federal government has approved such an obviously dangerous product, \" forbes quotes him as saying. \" underage alcohol abuse is a growing epidemic with tragic consequences and powdered alcohol could exacerbate this. \" a new york doctor notes that it could also fall into the hands of alcoholics or be added to other drugs, like heroin, webmd reports. Palcohol's website didn't help matters by initially saying the powder could be snorted, sprinkled on guacamole, or smuggled into stadiums and theaters. Those suggestions have since been pulled, and palcohol inventor mark phillips is asking potential buyers to act responsibly. Snorting, for example, \" would take you an hour of pain to ingest the equivalent of one drink, \" he says. \" it really burns. \" if it hits the shelves, palcohol will come in five flavors ( cosmopolitan, lemon drop, rum, vodka, and margarita ) and sell in four-inch-by-six-inch packages that phillips says are hard to conceal. When mixed with six ounces of liquid, it makes a drink with 10 % alcohol — like a glass of wine. \" listen, people can snort black pepper... So do we ban it? \" says phillips. \" no, just because a few goofballs use a product irresponsibly doesn't mean you ban it. \"",

Sergio canavero's plan to transplant a human head is highly appealing, reports medical news today. \" i can hardly control my body now, \" says valery spiridonov, a computer scientist with werdnig-hoffman disease. \" i need help every day, every minute. I am now 30 years old, although people rarely live to more than 20 with this disease. \" canavero, an italian physician, says he's received many offers from people willing to undergo the world's first human head transplant — including transsexuals seeking another body, cnn reports. But canavero wanted someone suffering from muscle atrophy, and chose spiridonov. Canavero plans to reveal more about his project — first revealed in 2013 and dubbed heaven-gemini — in june at a medical conference in annapolis, md. He says the operation will require 150 doctors and nurses, many of whom have asked to join the team. \" i say two years is the time needed for the team to reach perfect synchronization, \" says canavero. After a 36-hour operation, the patient would lie in coma for about a month while doctors use electrical stimulation in an effort to connect spinal-cord nerves to the new head. But many experts dismiss his plan as laughable or dangerous; a monkey died after undergoing a head transplant in 1970. \" i would not wish this on anyone, \" says a prominent neurologist. \" there are a lot of things worse than death. \" ( one science writer calls it \" insane.

He had a handgun and weapon magazines with him, and a rifle was found nearby, reuters reports. Meanwhile, a picture of the troubled 24-year-old is emerging. In a court filing earlier this year, the mother of his infant daughter said she feared barnes might use his weapons against her or her family, cnn reports. She added that he may have been suffering from ptsd. Barnes was a struggling high school student and a loner before enlisting in the army in 2007. He was discharged for misconduct in november 2009, after being arrested for a dui and a weapons charge; it was after his discharge that he became obsessed with weapons, the seattle times notes. Last summer, his relationship with the mother of his daughter collapsed; she said he had threatened her with a knife and also threatened suicide. More recently, he lost a close friend and fellow soldier to suicide, lost his apartment and job, and began sleeping in his car in parking lots. He could only see his daughter with court-ordered supervision. \" he is a loose cannon, \" says a woman who rejected barnes romantically, whom he visited before anderson's shooting sunday. \" if he doesn't get his way or something makes him upset, he goes all the way out of control. \"",

        "summary": "Louis ck put on another unannounced show at the comedy cellar in new york over the weekend, but this time a female heckler is stealing all the headlines. During a lull in the routine as ck was checking his notes, klaire randall yelled, \" get your d --- out, \" reports vice. As randall recounts it, the comedian made eye contact with her and said, \" what? \" — she and her boyfriend were near the stage — and she repeated the slam, with an added f-bomb for emphasis. At that point, an employee came over to the couple and told her she couldn't yell at the comedians. Randall tells the cut that the employee \" motioned toward the door, \" and the pair walked out. \" it was not a forceful getting-kicked-out, but it was heavily implied, \" randall says. \" it was very much like: ' your tab is covered, go. ' \" the club manager tells vice that \" at no point was she asked to leave, told to leave — at no point. \" regardless of the specifics of the departure, randall's tweet about the incident has made her an internet sensation of sorts, with some calling her a \" hero \" online. That's in contrast to those \" jeering \" her at the show itself. \" there has been so much love and support, an overwhelming amount of women just saying that they're proud of me, \" she tells the cut. But she says the real credit goes to the multiple women who came forward with the revelation that the comedian masturbated in front of them without their consent. Randall says what angered her was that ck put out a \" feel bad for me \" vibe during the set instead of owning up to what he did.

Well, not intentionally, perhaps, but as a side effect of donning the all-popular spanx and other shapewear. The huffington post decided to dig into just how much harm the helpful undergarments might be inflicting, and turned to a gastroenterologist, dermatologist, and chiropractor for answers. The upshot: by its nature shapewear is a tight squeeze, and in doing its job it compresses your stomach, intestine, and colon, with potentially unpleasant and even damaging results. The doctors explain that compression can exacerbate acid reflux and heartburn, can make an already-existing incontinence problem worse, and can lead to erosive esophagitis. Less perilously, the tightness can cause temporary gas and bloating. And in putting what function as \" giant rubber bands around your upper thighs \" then sitting, circulation suffers, and blood clots can form. Shapewear also traps moisture, which can result in yeast or bacterial infections. The experts ' advice? moderation; don't wear it daily. And if you can't get it off \" without a struggle, \" you may need a bigger size. But a vascular medicine specialist tells today there's probably not much to worry about.

A 5-year-old girl in sandy, utah, can be thankful for her mom and dad's aural senses after they heard their front door open around 4: 30am friday; her father jumped out of bed and confronted a man outside who had allegedly dragged his daughter out of the house, ksl reports. Police say 46-year-old troy morley broke into the home, went into the basement, and snatched the sleeping child. When the father approached him outside the house, morley fled without the girl, reports fox13. Police found morley in a nearby home that he entered through a dog door — fitting, since he was subsequently subdued by a police k-9. Morley was taken to a local hospital to receive treatment for dog bites and was set to be booked into the salt lake county jail. Officials don't know if morley actually knew the girl or her folks or if he stumbled onto her during a random break-in, but either way, they're glad that her father was able to successfully intervene. \" it's probably one of a parents ' worst nightmares … someone trying to abduct their child, especially out of their own home, \" a police sergeant tells ksl.

            "In 15 years of dangerous missions — from midnight raids on al-qaeda safe houses in iraq to battling somali pirates from the deck of a heaving navy ship on the high seas — there had never been one so shadowed by dread. As robert james o ' neill contemplated his jump from a helicopter into osama bin laden's private garden, he was positive it would be his last. \"i didn't think i would survive, \" the former navy seal said. O ' neill, one of dozens of u.s. Special operators to storm bin laden's hideout on may 2, 2011, said he mentally prepared himself to face death from heavily armed gunmen or from the elaborate booby traps that would surely line the approaches to the al-qaeda leader's inner sanctum. What he never expected was that he would secure a place in history that night, as the man who fired the bullet that ended bin laden's life. O ' neill confirmed to the washington post that he was the unnamed seal who was first to tumble through the doorway of bin laden's bedroom that night, taking aim at the terrorist leader as he stood in darkness behind his youngest wife. In an account later confirmed by two other seals, the montana native described firing the round that hit bin laden squarely in the forehead,"

Steele's spokesman, doug heye, did not deny that such discussions took place, responding that the rnc never had a \"plan \" to buy a plane. \"i don't know what somebody might have discussed or might not have discussed. \" while steele has not purchased a plane, he continues to charter them. According to federal disclosure records, the rnc spent $ 17,514 on private aircraft in the month of february alone ( as well as $ 12,691 on limousines during the same period ). There are no readily identifiable private plane expenses for democratic national committee chairman tim kaine in the dnc's last three months of filings. The rnc explains that steele charters jets only when commercial service is unavailable, or when his tight schedule requires it. \"anytime the chairman has taken any private travel has been a either to a route that doesn '"

Within five hours, the lava had filled in the lake, up to 200 feet deep, and \" boiled away the water, \" usgs volcanologist sally sennert tells npr, expressing doubt the lake will ever return. \" i couldn't believe it, \" a college geography instructor says, per cnn. \" i've never even heard of anything like that happening before. \" elsewhere, the lava's move into kapoho bay tuesday — at a record pace of about five and a half football fields per hour, according to usgs — turned \" a playland for water sports into an ominous field of molten rock, \" per usa today. Nearly a mile of new land was created in the process, reports time, explaining it falls into state hands as it's outside the boundary of the hawaii volcanoes national park.

        "summary": "A strange phenomenon in an indian industrial district has put a factory on thin ice and a bunch of canines in the bathtub. A report in the hindustan times posted in mid-august noted that dogs with bright-blue fur had been spotted roaming in navi mumbai's taloja area. After initial head-scratching, maharashtra pollution control board officials now believe the dogs took a dip in the kasadi river and came out blue from untreated industrial waste. Officials also think they've found who's responsible for the pollutants: a factory that uses blue dye to make detergent. \" it was shocking to see how the dog's white fur had turned completely blue, \" says navi mumbai animal protection cell's chief. The guardian reports 11 blue dogs have so far been seen, though national geographic notes the dye seems to be water-based and the dogs don't seem to be suffering any ill effects ( lab tests are still ongoing ). A recent facebook post from the navi mumbai animal welfare group notes that pollutants from industrial activity — the guardian notes there are nearly 1,000 chemical, pharmaceutical, and other types of factories in the taloja area — may also be affecting birds, reptiles, and humans. The factory in question, identified as ducol organics pvt. Ltd., has been notified it will be shuttered if it doesn't meet pollution standards within 15 days, the hindustan times reports. Mpcb officials say the factory is also accused of releasing leftover dye powder into the air. A temporary gate has since been erected around the factory to keep the dogs out of the water nearby. National geographic also dives into the history behind india's huge population of \" community-owned \" dogs and why they're protected by law there. ( read about another atypically blue item. )",

The restrictions are making it harder for businesses to protect commercial secrets and for individuals to view overseas web sites that the chinese communist party deems politically sensitive.

More like nearly 15 as merkel waited to greet may on a red carpet. The scene spurred tweets like this one: \" brexit in a nutshell. Theresa may can't get out of her own locked car as europe looks on bewildered. \" the ap reports may is on a tour of european capitals as she looks to secure eu guarantees related to the \" backstop. \" it's a part of the brexit agreement that's meant to prevent the re-creation of a physical border between northern ireland ( uk ) and ireland ( eu ) post-brexit, and it's emerged as one of the chief sticking points. As the ap explains, the backstop dictates that if the two can't agree on ways to prevent the formation of a hard border, the uk will stay part of the eu customs union. The uk also can't exit the arrangement without the ok of the eu, spurring fears among british lawmakers that the uk could be \" trapped permanently in the backstop, \" as a british brexit minister puts it. The purpose of may's meetings is to get new language around it, and politico reports european commission president jean-claude juncker was absolute: further negotiation will not occur. But \" there is room enough to give further clarification, and further interpretations without opening the withdrawal agreement. That will not happen. \" as for the parliamentary vote to ratify the brexit deal that was delayed monday, a rep for may says it ' ll now occur by jan. 21.",

Previous findings have been \" limited to self-reports of subjective well-being, \" professor peter ditto tells the times. But \" if it's real happiness, it should show up in people's behavior. \" to examine that behavior, researchers looked at posts on social media and the habits of politicians. They reviewed, for instance, the positive and negative language of 4,000 twitter users defined as liberal or conservative based on who they followed on the site. They also looked at the language of politicians of both parties, as well as those politicians ' facial expressions. Conservatives, the researchers argue, are more likely to engage in \" self-enhancement, \" offering an overly positive perception of themselves, the times reports.

But a new study suggests that liberals might be the happier bunch -- and conservatives might just want to look good. Researchers believe that conservatives may have a reputation for being happy because it's in their nature to talk themselves up. Previous work on the \" happiness gap \" between liberals and conservatives took a relatively simple route: just asking. Study subjects were asked to self-report their own happiness levels. In several academic studies ( and one by pew ) conservatives repeatedly came out as generally cheerier than their left-wing countrymen. [ your brain's response to a gross photo can reveal your political leanings ] the new results, published thursday in the journal science, took a different approach. Led by sean wojcik, a doctoral student in psychology and social behavior at the university of california at irvine, the experiment analyzed photos and language analysis from the linkedin and twitter profiles of those identified as either liberal or conservative. \" common sense would dictate that if you want to know how happy someone is, you can ask them, \" said peter ditto, uci professor of psychology &amp; social behavior and co-author of the paper. \" but what do you do if someone says they're happy, but doesn't act that way? \" indeed, ditto and wojcik found more genuine smiles ( as measured by standard facial analysis ) and more positive language in the web trail of liberals, even though other members of that group self-reported as less happy in the very same study.

            "Conservatives are happier than liberals, or so decades of surveys that ask about life satisfaction would suggest. The existence of a so-called ideological happiness gap is so well established that recently social scientists have mostly tried to explain it. But a new series of studies questions the gap itself, raising the possibility that although conservatives may report greater happiness than liberals, they are no more likely to act in ways that indicate that they really are happier. \"if it's real happiness, it should show up in people's behavior, \" said peter ditto, a professor of psychology and social behavior at the university of california, irvine, and an author of an article about the studies, which were led by sean wojcik, a doctoral candidate at the university.",
            "Comparing the happiness of two political groups can get a bit hairy. ( karen bleier/afp/getty images ) when asked if they're happy, political conservatives are more likely to say yes than liberals. But a new study suggests that liberals might be the happier bunch -- and conservatives might just want to look good. Researchers believe that conservatives may have a reputation for being happy because it's in their nature to talk themselves up. Previous work on the \" happiness gap \" between liberals and conservatives took a relatively simple route: just asking. Study subjects were asked to self-report their own happiness levels. In several academic studies ( and one by pew ) conservatives repeatedly came out as generally cheerier than their left-wing countrymen. [ your brain's response to a gross photo can reveal your political leanings ] the new results, published thursday in the journal science, took a different approach. Led by sean wojcik, a doctoral student in psychology and social behavior at the university of california at irvine, the experiment analyzed photos and language analysis from the linkedin and twitter profiles of those identified as either liberal or conservative. \" common sense would dictate that if you want to know how happy someone is, you can ask them, \" said peter ditto, uci professor of psychology &amp; social behavior and co-author of the paper. \" but what do you do if someone says they're happy, but doesn't act that way? \" indeed, ditto and wojcik found more genuine smiles ( as measured by standard facial analysis ) and more positive language in the web trail of liberals, even though other members of that group self-reported as less happy in the very same study.

Owners of a toyota prius or lexus c200h who live in san francisco will be eligible for the pilot program, and anyone who rents one of the cars will be able to unlock and start it using a smartphone app thanks to a \" smart key box \" toyota developed. If the pilot is a success, toyota may sell the smart key box, which can be installed on a car's dashboard, to current toyota owners. ( just friday, toyota announced a $ 10 million investment in getaround, the consumerist reports. ) currently, 20 % of cars being rented out on getaround are toyotas, and sam zaid, the ceo of the company, says the average san francisco prius owner makes $ 500 a month by renting out their car. That involves making it available to rent 75 % of the time, but owners can choose when exactly it's available. For example, forbes reports, a person can rent out their car during the eight hours it would otherwise be parked at an office building. The cost of renting a car via getaround is typically $ 5 per hour. \" it really empowers people who may not be able to afford \" to buy a car otherwise, zaid says. \" the average person in san francisco can get a new prius as long they're willing to share it. \" under the pilot program, toyota will allow owners to make lease payments directly from rental earnings, and, for those who purchase after january, will also consider those earnings when looking at whether a driver qualifies to buy the car.",

Troop deployment is also on the table if the hungarian parliament approves. \" we will start a new era, \" government rep zoltan kovacs said. \" we will stop the inflow of illegal migrants over our green borders, \" though he added that \" official and legal ways to come to hungary, and therefore to the european union, remain open. \" several countries, including hungary, have opposed the eu commission's call for migrant quotas to spread the refugees more equitably throughout its 28 member countries, the ap reports.

Police will be stationed every 115 feet or so along the serbian border, per the new york times, and those trying to breach could be jailed or deported. Meanwhile, a un rep in serbia tells the paper that refugees, especially those from syria, should be offered protection. \" more than 70 % of the population escaping syria are refugees, running away from a situation that is for them a matter of life and death, and it is [ up ] to us to do all that we can to help them. \" kovacs ' counter, per the times: \" the [ migrants have ] arrived … from 100 different countries, proving that this is a migration crisis and not a refugee crisis. \" ( these images of migrants crossing hungary toward austria show the scale of the issue. )",

The man's wife, jenny barker, had gone to work wednesday believing husband matt barker would drop off their two children at a daycare center before catching his flight. Police say he dropped off his 5-year-old child around 7: 30am, but forgot his recently adopted daughter in her car seat in his truck, per usa today. Upon returning home, he called a ride-share service and headed to the airport. It wasn't until 5: 40pm that his wife realized what had happened and pulled the child from the vehicle, performing cpr until paramedics arrived. Katera barker was later pronounced dead at a hospital, becoming at least the seventh child to die in a hot car in the us this year, per the washington post. According to newschannel5, wednesday's high was 89 degrees, so \" the interior of the truck could've easily reached between 130-170 degrees. \" police don't expect to file charges against the father, who flew back home wednesday evening. Meanwhile, the founder of kidsandcars.org offers this tip to parents who fear leaving a child in a hot car, via wsmv: \" keep a stuffed animal in your child's car seat and when you put your child in the car seat put that up front in the passenger seat, \" or put \" anything in the backseat that you ' ll need to grab when you arrive at your destination. \"",

Free samples will also be banned. Unregulated tobacco products that hit stores after february 2007 must be approved by the fda, though this could take years. Experts say producers will need an fda application for every e-cigarette boasting a unique flavor and nicotine level, with one e-cig advocate telling usa today that each application will cost $ 1 million or more. The changes will allow the agency to review ingredients, scientific data, possible dangers, and claims that a product is \" light \" or \" mild, \" reports the new york times.

        "summary": "A new york times investigative story about facebook presents a brutal picture of how mark zuckerberg and coo sheryl sandberg handled the controversy over russian hacking in the 2016 election. The times uses three words to sum up company strategy: \" delay, deny, and deflect. \" the story, based on interviews with more than 50 people, makes the case that zuckerberg and sandberg \" ignored warning signs \" that russians were exploiting the platform, \" then sought to conceal them from public view. \" distracted by personal projects and issues, the pair delegated to subordinates key decisions on security and privacy. And when the scope of the problem became clear, sandberg then oversaw an aggressive lobbying campaign to not only undermine its critics but to shift public anger toward rivals such as google, according to the story. One key part of that campaign was to have a gop opposition-research firm link vocal anti-facebook critics to liberal financier george soros. Another was to depict the facebook criticism as anti-semitic. The story doesn't present a flattering view of sen. Chuck schumer, either, asserting that he did his best to blunt criticism of facebook on capitol hill. At one point, he ordered sen. Mark warner to back off his repeated criticism of the company. Schumer received more money from facebook employees than any other member of congress in 2016, and his daughter is a marketing manager there. One early reaction to the piece comes from siva vaidhyanathan at slate: \" facebook is now just another normal sleazy american company run by normal sleazy executives, engaged in normal sleazy lobbying and corporate propaganda. \" ( read the full times story here. )",

They're unhappy that the legislation doesn't include enough spending cuts. Cantor himself told reporters this afternoon, \" i do not support the bill, \" but added that no decisions have been made, cnn reports. Aides say that speaker john boehner also has concerns and is considering the complaints he's hearing, but has not yet taken a firm position, though he's repeatedly said he ' ll allow a vote on the bill. \" i would be shocked if this bill doesn't go back to the senate \" for amendments, said rep.

The new york times details other methods allegedly used by the bank between 2001 and 2008: the report claims it opened accounts for american customers in the name of offshore shell entities; pushed americans to visit switzerland to do their banking, with help from a code-named office at the zurich airport; dodged paper trails by sending staffers to the us; and even operated a remote-control elevator with no buttons in one of its offices. Indeed, senators refer to \" cloak-and-dagger schemes that belong in a spy novel, \" the guardian notes. \" financial institutions like credit suisse have profited from their offshore tax haven schemes while depriving the us economy of billions of dollars in tax revenues, \" says john mccain, ranking member of the senate permanent committee on investigations, which released the 176-page report.

The bank isn't the report's only target, however: it also slams the justice department for doing too little to respond to the issue. The report holds that despite prosecutors ' awareness of the issue for four years, no one has faced a trial, the washington post notes, and the department did little to push the bank to hand over 22,000 american clients ' names.

        "summary": "A few years ago, researcher jeremy feinberg was looking into why the new york city area's southern leopard frog had disappeared when he stumbled onto a strange call between a bunch of frogs on staten island. The chuck, chuck, chuck sound his team heard was definitely different from the sounds of known frogs in the area, and when feinberg found a video online from another team that had wondered the same thing, the hunt for a new species officially commenced, the star-ledger reports. \" pretty much within 10 seconds of hearing the calling, we said,'something is really weird here, ' \" feinberg says. According to a paper published in plos one, dna evidence has verified it is indeed a new species: the atlantic coast leopard frog. The \" cryptic species \" differs from other leopard frogs in two ways: in its croak and in the spots that run down the backs of its legs. As feinberg explains to national geographic, it's pretty remarkable the mating calls were heard at all, as the frog's breeding period is only a few weeks long and coincides with a time when spring peepers are noisy: \" you have to win the jackpot to hear them. \" it's only the second new frog species found in the us in three decades and the first amphibian found in new york since 1854. Scientists decided to make the frog's official name rana kauffeldi after herpetologist carl kauffeld, who had his own suspicions in 1936 that the area was home to not two but three species of leopard frogs, smithsonian reports. The number of leopard frog species worldwide now stands at 19, notes a press release. ( a tree-thinning project was tabled because of a rare frog. )",

At the heart of the rift: the \" women's column of strength \" statue in san francisco's st. Mary's square, which pays tribute to \" comfort women, \" the hundreds of thousands of women from china, korea, and other nations who provided sexual services to japanese service members in wwii. Since the statue — which shows three young girls standing in a circle, holding hands — went up last year, it's been vandalized a few times, reports the san francisco examiner. Yoshimura had made moves in november to start the termination, but then-san francisco mayor ed lee died in december, throwing things off. Yoshimura had asked lee, as well as breed, to remove the statue; both said no. Lillian sing, co-chair of the comfort women justice coalition, tells the examiner that the cities ' breakup is \" outrageous \" and that \" it shows how afraid the osaka mayor and japanese prime minister are of truth and are trying to deny history. \" yoshimura says he ' ll consider sister-city status again if the statue is excised, per al jazeera.",

Trump's executive order halted the entire us refugee programme and also instituted a 90-day travel ban for nationals from iran, iraq, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen. British foreign secretary boris johnson held conversations with the us government on sunday. The foreign office then advised british travellers that dual citizens were only affected if travelling to the us from one of the seven banned countries. \" we understand from the statement released this evening by the foreign and commonwealth office that the executive order will not apply to mo, and we are grateful to the fco for urgently clarifying the situation, \" said a spokesperson for farah, who has lived in oregon for six years with his family. \" mo is relieved that he",

President donald trump's immigration policy \" seems to have made me an alien \" and fears he may not be able to return to his u.s. Home. Farah is a british citizen who was born in somalia, one of seven predominantly muslim nations subject to the executive order signed by trump that temporarily bans entry to the united states. Farah currently is training in ethiopia. His family is based in portland, oregon. \" it's deeply troubling, \" the 33-year-old farah said in a statement on his facebook page, \" that i will have to tell my children that daddy might not be able to come home — to explain why the president has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice. \" britain's press association is reporting that farah and his representatives are trying to establish whether the fact he was born in somalia will now present a problem for him when he wishes to return to the united states. Farah does not have dual nationality or hold a somalian passport. Farah moved to britain from somalia at the age of 8 and is now regarded as one of the greatest-ever athletes in british sport after winning the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters at both the 2012 and 2016 olympic games and at the 2013 and '"

He's facing 33 federal charges for hate crimes resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death, per abc news. \" i went to that church in charleston and i did it \" is how roof's videotaped confession started, played for jurors in a charleston courtroom, nbc news reports. The interview with fbi agent michael stansbury took place on june 18, 2015, the day after the shooting, and included roof being read his rights and questioned, with little eye contact with the agent. The investigator said roof didn't seem to be under the influence of any substance during his statement, which was made without a lawyer present. Which means he likely won't be able to blame drugs or alcohol for telling the agent he let his bullets loose because his research showed black men were raping white women, or for admitting, \" i do consider myself a white supremacist, \" or for noting, \" i support hitler. \" roof also said he didn't say a word to his victims before he killed them, and he didn't initially appear to know how many people he had murdered. \" five, not really sure, \" he answered the agent when asked. \" it was very fast. \" when he was informed nine people had died, he replied, \" well, it makes me feel bad. \" yet he appeared to laugh when he relayed how he'd told one of the victims, polly sheppard, that he'd let her live to tell the tale of what had happened. And stansbury testified roof ate a hamburger during the interview and \" was not upset, crying, or showing any emotions. \" ( roof asked for a mistrial — and was denied. )",

They've made up for the lost income with what a government report describes as a multimillion-dollar insurance scam involving tour operators, helicopter companies, hotels, and even hospitals, reports outside. Nepal's tourism ministry on sunday issued new rules requiring the submission of rescue invoices to a government committee after the report found operators encouraged trekkers to abandon climbs for the slightest of reasons, then pressured them into taking expensive helicopter rides to hospitals, which overbilled insurers, per the guardian. In some cases, guides even served trekkers food laced with laxatives to sicken them, per the report. Hired to investigate why 2017 was the most expensive year for some insurers, british trekker danny kaine says a guide \" became quite aggressive \" in suggesting a helicopter rescue when he complained of a headache on a five-day trek to mount everest's base camp. \" my final bill was $ 12,800 — for a headache, \" kaine tells the guardian. \" they are losing money on each trek and need to make it up, \" he adds, noting some travelers were paid more than their $ 500 trek fee to feign illness. Another hiker suspects an operator pocketed $ 35,000 by telling 10 people flown together to a kathmandu hospital ( because one had a common cold ) to claim they had each traveled alone, per outside. That way, the bill was for 10 helicopter rides, not one. Several insurers had threatened to pull out of nepal if the country didn't act to interfere in the scam by sept. 1.",

The man and woman asked if he could help pay for their fare to the nearby town of laval. Feeling funny about the situation, malyk agreed to break his bills at a convenience store and, worried about the woman, pretended he was on his way to laval, too. \" my plan was to keep them in a public place where he wouldn't hurt her, \" he says. \" i decided to be friendly with the man and have him think i was his friend. I played my game and he seemed to trust me. \" malyk says he talked to the man during their bus and metro rides to laval, and when they arrived he offered to take them to a tim horton's and gave the guy $ 50 for dinner, reports cbc canada. Bonnet's cell phone was dead, so he excused himself to go to the restroom and hastily called police from a stranger's phone. They were there in five minutes, and malyk says the woman \" was almost crying. \" laval police raised $ 255 to reimburse malyk for the $ 120 he spent that night, money he never expected to get back. \" money ain't nothing, food ain't nothing. For a life? \" he says. Police plan to nominate malyk for a bravery award, and his story made the front page of the journal de montreal, while five people stopped to shake his hand during cbc's interview.

Her burst of 144 tweets, which took place over six hours and ended shortly before she took her life through suffocation, recounted the sexual abuse at the hands of a family member and other adults, and the frustration that arose when authorities failed to bring charges. \" this wasn't random, \" said ashly escamilla, her classmate and closest friend. \" she planned this for a reason.

Now escamilla is without the friend she said was closer than a sister, the special and caring person she instantly befriended last year in what she later described as a magical moment. Billasano had moved to rosenberg to live with her mother after the allegations of abuse became known to the family.

Then she killed herself. Friends say the suffering and depressed billasano decided to make her death count for something even as her life became unbearable. Her burst of 144 tweets, which took place over six hours and ended shortly before she took her life through suffocation, recounted the sexual abuse at the hands of a family member and other adults, and the frustration that arose when authorities failed to bring charges. \" this wasn't random, \" said ashly escamilla, her classmate and closest friend. \" she planned this for a reason. She made a decision that this was what she was going to do to get attention if she was not going to get justice. \" her closest friend billasano, known as billy to her good friends, always had a sense of theater. It was why she and escamilla would sometimes dress up as batman and robin for a late-night taco run. And it was why she was supposed to be in the upcoming musical production hairspray put on by the drama classes at b.f. Terry high school. Now escamilla is without the friend she said was closer than a sister, the special and caring person she instantly befriended last year in what she later described as a magical moment. Billasano had moved to rosenberg to live with her mother after the allegations of abuse became known to the family. In no time at all, the two girls were, in their words, like \" peas and carrots. \" shortly before she died, billasano gave the \" other \" ashly two of her glow-in-the-dark stars to put on the ceiling of her room. The stars were to remind escamilla of their friendship before she went to sleep at night. \" she wanted justice from the very beginning, \" escamilla said. \" she said police and cps acted",

The two drove away, and about seven miles later it hit the backseat employee that the bag wasn't in the car, cbs new york reports. They went back, but the money was gone, and surveillance video shows that a white van had pulled up shortly after they left and that a man had stepped out, grabbed the sack, and drove away. Cbs notes that an ambulance needed to be called for the distraught worker who had left the money on the curb.

Rubio himself says he's fine with his supporters voting for kasich in the ohio primary on tuesday, usa today reports. In return, rubio hopes kasich supporters will return the favor and vote for him in florida. \" any vote that doesn't go to me is helping donald trump win the 99 delegates that [ florida ] will award to the winner, \" rubio says, per politico. Mitt romney called for a similar strategy earlier this month. There's only one problem: none of rubio's rivals appear to be on board. \" we were going to win in ohio without his help, just as he's going to lose in florida without ours, \" politico quotes a kasich spokesperson as saying. Meanwhile, ted cruz continues to insist he's the only remaining candidate who can beat trump and wants no part of rubio's \" games. \" \" it's real, real simple, \" cruz says, per the times. \" how do you beat donald trump? you beat him. \" everyone involved admits it will be much harder to keep trump from being nominated if he wins either ohio or florida.",

Everywhere, \" an auctioneer says. It started when the unnamed-yet-very-lucky man started moving furniture and found a box of gold coins attached to the bottom of one piece. He continued poking around and soon found an old whisky box with more gold pieces hidden inside. By the time the treasure hunt ended, he had found 5,000 gold pieces, two gold bars, and 37 gold ingots. The entire haul weighed more than 200 pounds and was reportedly bought during the 1950s and 1960s. The telegraph reports that the house is in the town of evreux in normandy, the same general region where three builders found about $ 1 million worth of gold buried in a garden in 2011. The man has already sold his treasure to multiple buyers, but it's not quite the windfall it seems. He owes a 45 % inheritance tax on the gold, plus three years of back taxes if his relatives hadn't declared it. ( this man was caught smuggling his employer's gold in his butt. )",

Arriving in time for ( the second half of ) national cybersecurity awareness month, the cybertwins have a backstory to appeal to military kids: their mom is a government engineer, their dad is an army computer scientist, and they \" love to talk with other kids who love computers and cyber space as much as they do. \" that fits them right in with the other cryptokids – a goateed turtle named t-top whose uncle works for a computer manufacturer, sergeant sam the eagle who joined the military out of high school – who guide real-live youth through online crypto-themed puzzles and brainteasers. ( only one thing's missing from the cryptotwins ' rollout: cybersecurity tips for the underage. ) all this is a reminder that the most informative element of any spy agency's website is its kiddie korner, where spycraft meets the schoolyard for an awkward, barely appropriate encounter.

A spacecraft would then be launched to knock the asteroid off course. The ase also wants the un to run a practice deflection mission, to make sure the method actually works. Right now, no nation has an explicit responsibility to defend against an asteroid, and one former astronaut explained why the task should fall to the un, reports space.com: \" if something goes wrong in the middle of the deflection, you have now caused havoc in some other nation that was not at risk. And, therefore, this decision of what to do, how to do it, and what systems to use have to be coordinated internationally. \" further, early detection is essential, because the deflecting spacecraft will likely have to hit the rock five years before its rendezvous with earth in order to be successful. \" if we don't find it until a year out, make yourself a nice cocktail and go out and watch, \" one former astronaut says.

        "summary": "An ethiopian airlines plane was hijacked early today by its own co-pilot, who was seeking asylum in switzerland. The co-pilot locked himself in the cockpit when the pilot went to the toilet, and flew the boeing 767-300 — which had taken off from ethiopian capital addis ababa and was headed to rome — to geneva, where it landed at about 6am local time. No one onboard was injured in the incident — in fact, none of the 202 passengers realized the plane had been hijacked, despite the fact that two italian fighter jets were scrambled to accompany it, the ap reports. As the plane circled geneva's airspace before eventually landing, the hijacker told the control tower, \" you have to give us lastly permission on board for asylum, \" cnn reports. After landing, the co-pilot exited the cockpit through the window using a rope, announced to nearby police that he was the hijacker, and surrendered. It's not clear why the co-pilot, an ethiopian man born in 1983, wanted asylum, but the ap notes that the ethiopian government owns the airline and has been criticized over human rights issues. The hijacking likely didn't help his cause: a geneva prosecutor says he ' ll be charged with taking hostages and could face up to 20 years in prison, and adds, \" technically there is no connection between asylum and the fact he committed a crime to come here. But i think his chances are not very high. \"",

That's a new record; previous antarctic specimens were revived after about eight years, per the study, published last month in cryobiology. In november 1983, moss samples were collected during a japanese antarctic expedition and stored at -4 degrees fahrenheit. In march 2014, researchers thawed the specimens and found two tardigrades whose bodies were not fully extended, extension being a mark of tardigrade death. They were dubbed sleeping beauty-1 and sleeping beauty-2; an extracted egg was called sleeping beauty-3. Sb-2 died after 20 days — but the other made a total recovery and the once-frozen egg hatched. The study charts sb-1's emergence: \" sb-1 started to slowly crawl on the agar surface of the culture well on day 9, and started to eat the algal food provided. \" it ultimately laid 19 eggs, of which 14 hatched. As for the egg sb-3, it hatched 6 days after rehydration and laid 15 eggs, of which 7 hatched. The goal of the undertaking is \" to unravel the mechanism for long-term survival by looking into damage to tardigrades'dna and their ability to repair it, \" says a researcher, per the bbc. Though tardigardes are known for their ability to survive extreme conditions, such as heat, pressure, and lack of oxygen, a previous study had suggested that 10 years was the survival threshold for the creatures under typical atmospheric oxygen conditions. Gizmodo points out the tardigrade doesn't hold the all-time record, though: the nematode worm tylenchus polyhypnus was recovered after nearly 39 years frozen.

He stuck himself inside me. \" in december that year, she says he turned up at her apartment after she had been drinking and forced himself on her again. \" i said, ' i don't want to do this, ' \" she says. \" he kept humping me and it was disgusting. He's like a pig... He raped me. \" after the second assault, she says, \" he looked at me and said, ' i ' ll put you in a play. ' he left and i never heard from him again.

Teams sent across brazil's 3,288,000 square miles, encompassing about half of the world's remaining tropical forest, will sample about 20,000 points at 20-kilometer intervals. Researchers will log the number, height, diameter, and species of trees, along with soil types, biomass carbon stocks, and even local people's interactions with the forest at each site. Once completed, it will the most comprehensive national inventory in brazil since 1983. Brazil, once one of the world's largest deforesters, is now among conservation's greatest turnaround stories. Last year, brazil reported the lowest level of deforestation in decades: 1,797 square miles of amazon. That's almost 80 percent lower than in 2004, reports mongabay. And the government plans to go lower still. The country has publicly committed to reducing deforestation by 80 percent below 2004 levels by 2020. It's well on its way: the environment ministry said deforestation was down 76.27 percent compared to its baseline, well ahead of schedule. The inventory should help those gains stick. Just as the u.s. Census helps formulate social and economic policy, brazil plans to shape its policies and planning around the forest data, says minister of environment izabella teixeira. \"brazilian society does not have enough information about the country's forests, \" said teixeira in a usaid statement,",

The washington post interviews justice department investigators and reports they have \" all but concluded \" that they have no case against darren wilson. The inquiry isn't done yet, and the story includes quotes from officials who say it's \" irresponsible \" to draw conclusions in advance, but it doesn't seem to be a huge surprise. The new york times previously came to a similar conclusion. ( the root thinks the leaks that led to the times story are a sign that officials want to prepare people for the fact that wilson will face no charges. ) in terms of the civil rights case, the main problem is the high threshold required to bring charges, explains the post. Prosecutors would have to prove that wilson intended to violate brown's constitutional rights. Separately, a grand jury continues to review the shooting, and its results are expected soon. On the federal level, however, supporters of brown may have to settle for the results of a broader justice department investigation into the ferguson police department that could require reforms. Today, for example, the department announced that after an inquiry into allegations over the excessive use of force, police in albuquerque, nm, have agreed to overhaul their training programs, reports ap.",

The president-elect didn't elaborate on what he meant. Politico notes that the comment came a day after he met with several military officers at his florida resort, though it was unclear whether they spoke of the nation's nuclear arsenal. He also met with his future national security adviser, michael flynn. Looking for context, the ap calls attention to trump's transition website, which states that trump \" recognizes the uniquely catastrophic threats posed by nuclear weapons \" but adds that he \" will ensure our strategic nuclear triad is modernized to ensure it continues to be an effective deterrent. \" the triad refers to the us ability to launch weapons from land, sea, and air. In one presidential debate, trump complained that \" our nuclear program has fallen way behind, \" recalls cnn, which points out that all of america's nuclear submarines are more than 30 years old.
