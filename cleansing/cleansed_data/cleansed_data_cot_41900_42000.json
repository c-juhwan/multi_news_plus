        "summary": "Thirteen bald eagles found dead on farmland in maryland's eastern shore in the state's largest die-off of the birds in 30 years died from ingesting a banned pesticide, wildlife officials say. The carcasses of the eagles, mostly immature, were discovered in federalsburg in february 2016 with no outward signs of distress. However, a six-month investigation by the fish and wildlife service, first reported this week by wnav, found five of six carcasses sent for testing included remains of an undigested raccoon containing carbofuran, a highly toxic pesticide previously blamed for the deaths of 2 million birds per year, reports the washington post. Though banned in the us in both granular and liquid forms, carbofuran is still used by some farmers to kill pest and predator animals like raccoons and coyotes, reports the new york times. \" it probably wasn't intentional to kill the eagles, \" but \" it definitely was a human cause, \" says a wildlife service spokesperson. Despite that, and the fact that killing a bald eagle can result in a two-year prison sentence and a $ 250,000 fine, officials closed the case without making any arrests. \" it's very frustrating \" but \" there was no smoking gun, \" says investigator john lacorte, who interviewed more than a dozen landowners and property managers about the case. The 89-year-old farmer on whose property the eagles were found near a tainted raccoon carcass denies ever using the pesticide, and lacorte says he believes him. It's possible an eagle carried the raccoon to the property, he tells the post, citing an \" epidemic \" of wildlife poisonings in the area. Across the country, though, bald eagles are making a \" groundbreaking comeback, \" per fox news.",

And steer clear of the canned stuff. University college london researchers reviewed the diets of 65,000 people; they found that those who ate more fresh fruits and vegetables tended to live longer, and the magic threshold seemed to be seven-plus servings every day. Those who hit that level reduced their risk of death \" from all causes \" by 42 % as compared to those who ate less than one portion daily, the guardian reports. More specifically, those big on fruits and veggies saw a 31 % lower risk of heart disease and a 25 % lower risk of cancer. Hitting five is, of course, still beneficial: eat three to five portions, and overall risk drops 29 %, while five to seven means a 36 % lower risk, time reports. In the us, the standard slogan when it comes to fruits and vegetables is \" more matters, \" but the best advice is australia's, says a researcher; in that country, the advice is \" go for 2+5, \" or two servings of fruits and five of vegetables. \" from our study it looks like vegetables are better than fruit, \" she says. Be warned: canned and frozen fruit, the study finds, may actually increase heart disease, stroke, and cancer risk, the guardian notes. Researchers are cautious about that finding, however, suggesting it could be because canned fruit is often smothered in sugary syrup. ( so eat more veggies... But maybe run less. )",

        "summary": "Betty shelby's defense team tried ( and failed ) to get her a special early arraignment thursday for the shooting death of unarmed black man terence crutcher, hoping to avoid the \" utter chaos \" of the media covering the high-profile case, the tulsa world reports. Now shelby is set to head back to court friday, as per the original schedule, notes usa today, where the tulsa, okla., cop will find out a date for the preliminary hearing that will determine whether there's enough evidence to go to trial. And shelby's attorney, scott wood, who says she ' ll plead not guilty to first-degree manslaughter, laid out an interesting new defense thursday for his client: \" auditory exclusion, \" in which people experiencing it don't hear the sounds going on around them during high-stress situations, per the ap and huffington post. \" she didn't hear the gunshot, didn't hear the sirens coming up behind her just prior to the shot, \" wood says, per the ap, calling it \" the no. 1 perceptual distortion by people i have represented who have been involved in shootings. \" david klinger, a u of missouri-st. Louis law professor — and ex-lapd cop who fatally shot someone himself as a rookie — notes he interviewed 80 law enforcement officers who had shot citizens in 113 discrete cases, and that in 82 % of those cases, \" diminished sound \" was the most common perceptual distortion they experienced. Other distortions can include time warping ( where everything seems to move in slow motion ) and tunnel vision. But twitter is balking, with one poster noting, \" even if she was temporarily deaf, #bettyshelby still should have seen that #terrencecrutcher wasn't a threat. \" ex-nfl player shannon sharpe simply says, \" is this for real? \"",

        "summary": "Michigan has given the ok to nestle's controversial request to increase the amount of water it pumps from the state — despite the fact that a record number of public comments were made on the matter, and 80,945 of those comments were against the plan. Just 75 were in favor. The michigan department of environmental quality found that the plan, which will see nestle pumping up to 400 gallons of water per minute from the white pine springs well in the great lakes basin instead of the 250 gallons per minute it currently extracts, complied with legal standards, npr reports. Most of the public comments opposing the plan \" related to issues of public policy which are not, and should not be, part of an administrative permit decision, \" the director of the agency said when approving nestle's permit. Water is a particularly tender subject in michigan, where detroit once shut off water to thousands of customers who were behind on paying their water bills — and where the water in flint, four years later, still isn't safe to drink. Nestle extracts the water to bottle it for sale under its ice mountain label, and all it costs the company is a $ 200-per-year permit from the deq — an amount that won't change under the new permit, the detroit free press reports. Per a michigan radio journalist, the top three themes of public comments opposing nestle's plan were \" corporate greed versus people and the environment, \" \" water is not for profit, \" and \" worries about privatizing water. \" the policy director for the michigan environmental council says that while the new permit includes additional monitoring and oversight requirements, it does not include any \" improvement projects brought to the table by nestle. \"",

The aid — tens of millions of dollars of it, in some cases — has been awarded to hundreds of businesses closely linked to the regime, some of which are under us or european union sanctions. Government departments, including the military-controlled national blood bank, have also received aid, as has a charity controlled by assad's wife, asma al-assad. The un says it has saved many lives and often has little choice but to cooperate with the regime. It points to the $ 9 million it has spent at the four seasons in damascus, which is one-third owned by a government ministry — and is the safest place in the city for its workers to stay. Critics, however, say the un has become far too close to the regime and its support of the assad-controlled relief effort may be actually prolonging the war, notes a separate piece in the guardian. \" in the name of delivering aid to some needy people in opposition-held areas, the un is subsidizing the syrian government's war-crimes strategy of targeting those same people, \" says kenneth roth, executive director of human rights watch. \" that's hardly the tough-minded pragmatism that the un claims is informing its aid efforts. \" roth is among those calling for an independent review of the un's syria aid program, which has so far spent around $ 4 billion in the country; many want secretary-general ban ki-moon to intervene personally.

            "( cnn ) they're the king and queen of olympic track cycling -- and nobody at rio 2016 had any way of dethroning them. Jason kenny and laura trott made it 10 olympic gold medals between them tuesday after a dramatic night of track cycling at the velodrome. The british riders, who will get married next month, stole the show in contrasting style. Trott took her golden tally to four as she defended her women's omnium title -- making her britain's most successful female olympian. And kenny then made history of his own -- equaling his former teammate chris hoy's all-time british record of six gold medals after winning a nerve-shredding keirin race, in which he was almost disqualified. Fellow cyclist bradley wiggins had become britain's most decorated olympian when he collected his eighth medal after helping the men's pursuit team to victory last friday -- five of that tally being gold. At just 24 years of age, few would bet against trott surpassing the trio. She helped the british women's team win the pursuit at the weekend, adding to her two golds in london four years ago.",

Sherman's sources say fox execs are also leaning against o'reilly because they are alarmed by a decline in ad revenue even bigger than the one that led to glenn beck's exit, and because ditching the host would likely please british regulators due to rule next month on whether fox is a \" fit and proper \" company to take over media giant sky.",

Now researchers are showing for the first time that current and past marital status can play a big role in survival rates following a stroke, reports medicalxpress. After tracking the outcomes of more than 2,300 stroke survivors for five years, researchers report in the journal of the american heart association that 1,362 people died in that period, and that people who'd never married were 71 % more likely to have died than stroke patients in lengthy, \" continuous \" marriages. People who had divorced or been widowed were also at a higher risk of dying after stroke. While the study doesn't explain exactly why, reports the american heart association, the researchers hypothesize that married couples have better social support, not to mention someone helping the survivor follow medication regimens and practice healthier habits. \" what we don't know is whether other forms of social support might have similar benefits, \" one expert tells us news &amp; world report. He adds that, because depression is common following stroke, it \" needs to be recognized and treated, \" which may be less likely in unmarried stroke survivors. Another expert says that while unmarried stroke survivors should seek help, many don't, so \" be the ' nudge ' who makes sure they're taking care of themselves. \" ( a playboy model died of a stroke at age 34. )",

A piece in the atlantic details how anderson works to uncover fraudulent military claims, using both his facebook page and website — the latter of which was instrumental in 2013 in exposing an american idol contestant who claimed he had suffered a brain injury after an ied explosion while serving in iraq — to get the word out on the scammers. Anderson started his amateur investigative service about five years ago and gets some of his leads from doug sterner, an ex-combat engineer in vietnam who first came across some of his own fakers while setting up a database of real military heroes. When he gets a tip, anderson — himself a staff sergeant with south carolina's national guard — first heads to his computer for some online scouring, where he hopes to match a name with a dob or social security number. With that info, it's easier for him to track down the basics ( e.g., where a person served and when ). If he needs more details, he can file a foia request. Anderson says he just wants the truth in his searches, and he takes false accusations seriously, making sure to try to contact alleged fraudsters to get their side. As for whether he feels more \" distaste \" for civilians playing military or service members hyping up their contributions, anderson notes: \" if you served, you should know better than a civilian what it means. … for somebody else to claim it when they haven't earned it, it just makes you angry. \" ( prosecutors say a veteran faked war wounds to get a purple heart and $ 750k in benefits. )",

That's because that woman had in her possession something even better: a tin of chocolates made in 1900, one of the gifts queen victoria had commissioned for soldiers fighting overseas in the boer war to boost morale, the bbc reports. The red, gold, and blue container, made by hudson scott and sons in carlisle, was designed with \" rounded corners for ease of storage in a soldier's knapsack \" and to hold 8 ounces of vanilla chocolate, per the national army museum. That confection, the auction house tells the bbc, was \" probably the most controversial chocolate ever made. \" that's because the three main chocolate-makers in the uk at the time — js fry, rowntree, and cadbury — were helmed by pacifist quakers who didn't want to be seen as making money from the war. They didn't want to spurn the queen, however, so their compromise was to donate the chocolate for free, as well as brand the chocolate with their company names ( the queen wanted soldiers to know they were getting the best ), but not the tins. As for how the unnamed woman came to have this 118-year-old tin, she says it's been sitting for a long time in a cupboard drawer and thinks it came from her late husband's family. A nestle archivist tells the express the chocolate inside is \" probably not in as bad a condition as you might think, but i wouldn't recommend eating it. \" the yorkshire post reports the tin, which will go up for auction tuesday, could fetch up to $ 400.

Meanwhile, some 50 to 75 buildings were ruined or suffered severe damage. As to what caused the explosion, it could be six months before we know for sure, the wall street journal notes — though nothing has suggested it wasn't simply an accident. The company didn't have sprinklers, blast walls, or fire walls installed because it wasn't dealing with flammable materials, it said in a 2011 federal filing, per the ap.

During the same period, according to the naacp, \" 1,368 men have been executed, \" writes steven thrasher in the guardian. He notes that gissendaner, convicted in the 1997 murder of her husband, saw her final supreme court petition denied in october and lost a clemency appeal last week — even testimony from a man the new york times calls \" one of the world's most prominent theologians \" couldn't save her. During her time in prison, gissendaner developed a strong interest in theology, studying in a prisoner program conducted by divinity schools around atlanta. Her work drew her to german theologian jürgen moltmann. \" she wrote to him, and a friendship developed, \" says one of her teachers. He ended up testifying in the clemency effort last week, alongside her professors and other inmates whom gissendaner herself has helped with spiritual matters. \" i have found her very sensitive, and not a monster, as the newspapers depicted her, \" moltmann tells the times. \" she has changed her mind, and her life. \" winter weather delayed her scheduled execution on wednesday; she requested as her last meal two burger king whoppers, salad, fries, and cornbread, wxia adds.",

True, the supermarket in question is waitrose, britain's poshest, where tony blair used to get his groceries, but still. Of course, royals have been publishing books for donkey's years, and while the occasional comment piece by prince charles about where he gets his suits is unlikely to provoke any ire, this is a slightly different deal, and one which will raise eyebrows at the palace, where the young royals have been noted for their olympian self-control in accepting no freebies. Pippa was banned by the palace from promoting her recent book on entertaining, and forced to decline an opportunity to be an nbc special correspondent.

Much of the buzz centers on the vehicle's automated driving system — it falls short of being considered a self-driving car, explains ceo elon musk, but it comes pretty close in some ways, reports the wall street journal. The vehicles have radar, sonar, and cameras that allow them to detect trouble and evade a crash on their own, adjust speed automatically, and even self-park. \"you ' ll be able to step out of the car and have it park itself in your garage, \" promises musk. Also of note: this new \" d \" line of its model s sedans will have two motors ( the \" d \" stands for \" dual \" ) and all-wheel drive, and its ability to go from zero to 60 in 3.2 seconds \" put[ s ] it in a class with the quickest production cars on the road, \" writes will oremus at slate. As with the previous teslas, all this comes at a price: the 60d model starts at $ 75,000, the 85d at $ 85,000, and the high-performance p85d at $ 120,000. Drivers of the latter model can choose a performance setting of \" normal, \" \" sport, \" or \" insane, \" notes cnnmoney. The company let car writers take the new ds for a spin, and the reviews seem universally positive in terms of both automotive power and whiz-bang gadgetry. But that price? \" now that it's re-established its position as the true innovator in the auto industry, maybe tesla can go back to work on building a wonderful electric car more of us can take home, \" writes alex davies at wired.",

        "summary": "Between november and january, five trucks rolled over on a single highway ramp in georgia's dekalb county. \" i ' m not an engineer, \" says a wsb-tv traffic reporter, \" but common sense says there's something wrong there. \" now experts may be able to explain it. There are two key issues, says a road engineering consultant. For one thing, the curve on the ramp linking interstate 285 southbound and interstate 20 eastbound comes right after more than half a mile of straight highway — and drivers tend to speed up on straightaways, meaning they're in some cases going as fast as 75mph when the curve ( recommended speed 35mph ) comes upon them. Trees add to the problem, making it hard to spot the curve in advance. The second issue is that drivers ' eyes seem to trick them, and it's something a state engineer noticed. A lane to the right of drivers ( on the other side of a low median barrier wall ) keeps going straight as the ramp's lanes curve. \" there's a bit of an optical illusion … where if you don't notice the curve coming, and you're looking straight ahead, it looks as if the road continues, \" says a rep for gdot. It plans to take action: gdot says it will install six truck tip-over signs and new speed warnings. As for the optical illusion, officials will shield the problematic lane from view by placing reflective panels atop the median wall. Interestingly, optical illusions have also been used to achieve the opposite effect: safer driving. These have ranged from a 3d image of a girl chasing a ball into the street, as the globe and mail reported in 2012, to \" hash marks \" spaced to trick drivers.",

But two lower courts ruled the charge should be switched to a misdemeanor, and yesterday the new york state court of appeals upheld those decisions, agreeing terrance williams should face a misdemeanor reckless endangerment charge instead, the ap reports. Although the court majority wrote that williams ' actions were \" reckless, selfish, and reprehensible, \" they found he didn't show \" depraved indifference \" — a required element of a felony charge. One judge did dissent, writing that williams lied more than once, showing \" utter indifference \" to his partner. Williams was found to be hiv positive in december 2009, the syracuse post-standard reported in 2011. He then had sexual relations with the unnamed partner between july and november 2010; the victim was diagnosed as hiv positive in february 2011. Court papers cited in the post-standard say williams sent a remorseful, \" guilt-ridden \" message to the victim in april 2011. Williams ' appellate lawyer argued that the partner's risk of contracting hiv after four or five sexual encounters was \" low \" and the chances of dying from it \" extraordinarily low \" thanks to treatment advances. The assistant district attorney disagreed, saying, \" it's still a potentially deadly disease. It's not always a death sentence, but it can be. \" if convicted of the misdemeanor, williams could face a year in jail, as opposed to the seven the felony charge could have brought, the ap notes.",

As reuters reports, dicaprio himself is not charged with any wrongdoing, but he received those items as gifts from people who are. Another unusual hollywood-esque twist related to the inquiry: the us is trying to seize the rights to the movies dumb and dumber to, starring jim carrey, and daddy's home, starring will ferrell, per the hollywood reporter. The justice department alleges the movies were partially funded with shady money. Last year, they similarly began action to seize the rights of the wolf of wall street, starring dicaprio, for the same reason. All of this stems from the 1malaysia development berhad fund, or 1mdb, set up in 2009 by malaysian prime minister najib razak to stimulate economic development in his country. The justice department says fund officials pilfered more than $ 4.5 billion from it and essentially tried to launder the money in the us through various enterprises, one of which was funding movies. They also lavished gifts on celebrities, which the feds are now trying to recover. The gifts include the $ 3.28 million picasso, a $ 9 million jean-michel basquiat painting, and a $ 750,000 diane arbus photo, all given to dicaprio; and an 11.72-carat diamond allegedly given to model miranda kerr, the wife of snapchat's evan spiegel.",

The company says credit and debit card data was stolen by malware in payment terminals at 1,025 us locations, all of them franchisee-owned, restaurant news reports. The data theft began in late fall last year, wendy's says. The chain has urged customers to check their statements for possible fraudulent purchases and has set up a website for people to check whether a wendy's restaurant they visited has been affected by what the bbc describes as one of the most significant hacks in us history. Wendy's announced earlier this year that it was investigating malware in around 300 stores, but it later discovered that the hack was much more wide-ranging than it thought, the ap reports. The company says the hackers were able to obtain card numbers, names, expiration dates, and codes, some of which were used to make fraudulent purchases elsewhere. Security researcher graham cluley warns that many victims won't realize they're at risk. \" for most of us, it's not a red letter day if we go to somewhere like wendy's, \" he tells the bbc. \" and people won't have registered which one they went to and where they were in the country when it happened. \" the assistance wendy's is offering affected customers includes free credit monitoring for a year.",

The latter is the number of victims whose names we know thanks to the efforts the yad vashem holocaust memorial has made since 1954. And on monday, which marks israel's annual holocaust remembrance day, the focus is on bolstering that count before it's too late. More on that effort and the day: the bbc follows one 89-year-old woman as she fills out a \" page of testimony \" that will add the name of her father to the roster of known names. In october 1944 he conveyed a message to the women's camp at auschwitz, asking that any survivors from his hometown of khust, czechoslovakia, be told that \" 200 men were brought back from the coal mine. Tell them that tomorrow we won't be here anymore. \" the bbc's article notes that roughly 95 % of western and central european jewish victims have been named; but the figure that represents eastern europe jewish victims is far lower. Only about half the 1.5 million child victims are named. Says one man who works with survivors, \" it's one of the saddest things. We have reports where parents are named with say three or four children, unnamed. They were little children and people just don't remember. \" for two minutes on monday, israel commemorated the day as it does: by sounding a siren that wails for 2 minutes. Things freeze during that time, the ap reports, with cars not just puling over on major highways, but with drivers exiting their cars and bowing their heads in observation. The jerusalem post reports on another annual gathering that coincides with holocaust remembrance day: the international march of the living. Since its start in 1988, some 250,000 people have on this day walked the roughly 2-mile path linking auschwitz and birkenau in poland. This year saw 10,000 participants, and the march chairman had this to say: \" elie wiesel, who was with us in our very first march in 1988, said, ' if you listen to a witness you become a witness. ' \" \" we mourn, we remember, we pray, and we pledge: ' never again. ' \" so said president trump in a video address to the world jewish congress plenary assembly in new york.

Dylan disappeared in 2012 while visiting his father in vallecito, colorado, for thanksgiving, a trip that followed a contentious divorce between mark redwine and dylan's mother, elaine hall. Authorities say hall reported her son missing the day after his arrival. Some of the boy's remains were discovered 10 miles away from redwine's home in 2013 and his skull was found by hikers two years later. The skull showed injuries consistent with blunt force trauma. During the course of the nearly five-year, multi-agency investigation, officials found dylan's blood in his father's living room, and cadaver dogs were able to determine that a dead body had been in the older man's home and the bed of his truck, cnn reports. According to the indictment, redwine and hall were in the midst of a bitter custody battle at the time of dylan's disappearance and the boy was not happy about visiting his father. Redwine is currently being held by police in bellingham, washington, on a cash-only $ 1 million bond. His prosecution will begin once he is extradited back to colorado.",

The findings, published in jama internal medicine, are described as \" the first national estimates of indoor tanning – related injuries treated in us hospital emergency departments. \" that estimate places those er-worthy injuries at an average of 3,234 per year. As the washington post puts it, \" that's nearly nine skin burns, fainting spells, eye injuries, lacerations, strains, sprains, bruises, or dislocations every day that could have been avoided. \" and the true number is likely much higher, since the research excluded those injuries that were dealt with by private physicians, urgent care centers, or at home. Skin burns account for roughly 80 % of the injuries; the majority of those who sustain any type of injury are women ( 82.2 % ) and between 18 and 34 ( 62.4 % ). The one encouraging figure: the injuries nosedived during the 2003-to-2012 period that was studied: from 6,487 at the start to 1,957 in 2012, reports usa today. Researcher gery p. Guy suspects the decline is tied to the declining use of tanning beds. Still, he notes these injuries could lead to bigger issues down the line, as skin and eye burns up the risk for skin cancer and eye melanoma, respectively.

Over several seasons of excavations at this site, which dates to the time of king david, archaeologists have also unearthed two gates, a palace, storerooms, dwellings, and cultic rooms. The team says the finding is an indication that writing was far more widespread at this point than previously thought, and also that eshba ' al ben beda ' was likely a prominent figure — possibly the owner of a large agricultural estate, which would have sent out its goods in jars bearing his name. \" the name beda ' is unique and does not occur in ancient inscriptions or in the biblical tradition, \" one researcher tells the israel ministry of foreign affairs, while eshba ' al \" was a common name only during \" the reign of david.

That's the conclusion of a new survey analyzing how different types of alcohol make people feel. The reasons behind the feelings aren't fully understood, but researchers say there are clear trends in the emotions certain alcoholic beverages brought out in 30,000 people, aged 18 to 34, from 21 countries. For example, more than 60 % said red wine made them feel sleepy, while 53 % said it made them feel relaxed, reports the guardian. Similarly, nearly 60 % of participants said spirits made them feel confident and energetic, while 42 % said spirits made them feel sexy. But almost 50 % said spirits made them feel ill, while 30 % drew a link with aggression, according to public health wales. Men and heavy drinkers were more prone to report aggression, per the independent, while women were more likely to report all other emotions, tearfulness among them. Tearfulness was reported by almost 25 % of spirit drinkers, 17 % of red wine drinkers, and 9 % of beer and white wine drinkers, reports the telegraph. Half of participants also said beer made them feel relaxed, compared to 33 % of white wine drinkers, researchers write in bmj open. The study didn't consider the mixing of alcohols. It's also unclear if social situation or other factors affected participants ' feelings. Still, researchers say drinkers, as well as those who study alcohol abuse, should take the trends into account.",

While those in the european union are guaranteed at least 20 paid vacation days a year ( and 25 or even 30 days in some countries ), most americans get about 10 paid days a year and use only half, according to a new survey reported in marketwatch. And of those actually on vacation, 61 % confess to working while vacationing, with one in four saying they were contacted by a colleague and one in five saying they were contacted by a boss. Things were apparently better in 1976 when 9 million americans took a week of vacation in july, reports vox. This past july, even with 60 million more americans employed than in 1976, only 7 million took a week off. Some calculations put just 56 % of workers taking a weeklong vacation in a given year, a figure that used to be as high as 80 %. Top reasons for people taking less vacation time are less accrual of days and fear of hurting one's career or place at work. \" that's not healthy, \" writes scott martelle in the la times.

Doctors at upmc presbyterian hospital soon intend to float 10 patients in the space between life and death, in a bid to extend the time doctors have to fix their injuries. In these cases, patients will have a potentially fatal knife or gunshot wound and have suffered cardiac arrest, have lost about half their blood, and will have not revived following attempts to restart their heart. Based on those requirements, the hospital expects to see one likely candidate a month — a patient who, without the technique, has a 93 % chance of dying. New scientist calls the technique \" suspended animation \"; one of the hospital's surgeons prefer the less science-fiction-sounding \" emergency preservation and resuscitation. \" how it works: the patient's body temp will be drastically and rapidly cooled by swapping every drop of his blood for a cold saline solution; his cells will then be able to survive for hours without oxygen — though he ' ll be clinically dead. The technique was proven to work on pigs in 2002, and is one that has never been tried to this extent in humans ( in some surgeries, blood is chilled through a cooling system, but that process requires time and planning — two things not present with a traumatic wound ). In the case of the pigs, most survived, and the doctor behind the research told the telegraph, \" by cooling rapidly in this fashion we can convert almost certain death into a 90 % survival rate. \" doctors believe the technique will give them two hours to operate on the selected patients.",

            "Doctors will try to save the lives of 10 patients with knife or gunshot wounds by placing them in suspended animation, buying time to fix their injuries neither dead or alive, knife-wound or gunshot victims will be cooled down and placed in suspended animation later this month, as a groundbreaking emergency technique is tested out for the first time. Surgeons are now on call at the upmc presbyterian hospital in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, to perform the operation, which will buy doctors time to fix injuries that would otherwise be lethal. \" we are suspending life, but we don't like to call it suspended animation because it sounds like science fiction, \" says samuel tisherman, a surgeon at the hospital, who is leading the trial. \" so we call it emergency preservation and resuscitation. \" the technique involves replacing all of a patient's blood with a cold saline solution, which rapidly cools the body and stops almost all cellular activity. \" if a patient comes to us two hours after dying you can't bring them back to life. But if they're dying and you suspend them, you have a chance to bring them back after their structural problems have been fixed, \" says surgeon peter rhee at the university of arizona in tucson, who helped develop the technique. The benefits of cooling, or induced hypothermia, have been known for decades. At normal body temperature – around 37 ° c – cells need a regular oxygen supply to produce energy. When the heart stops beating, blood no longer carries oxygen to cells. Without oxygen the brain can only survive for about 5 minutes before the damage is irreversible.

            "Doctors will try to save the lives of 10 patients with knife or gunshot wounds by placing them in suspended animation, buying time to fix their injuries neither dead or alive, knife-wound or gunshot victims will be cooled down and placed in suspended animation later this month, as a groundbreaking emergency technique is tested out for the first time. Surgeons are now on call at the upmc presbyterian hospital in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, to perform the operation, which will buy doctors time to fix injuries that would otherwise be lethal. \" we are suspending life, but we don't like to call it suspended animation because it sounds like science fiction, \" says samuel tisherman, a surgeon at the hospital, who is leading the trial. \" so we call it emergency preservation and resuscitation. \" the technique involves replacing all of a patient's blood with a cold saline solution, which rapidly cools the body and stops almost all cellular activity. \" if a patient comes to us two hours after dying you can't bring them back to life. But if they're dying and you suspend them, you have a chance to bring them back after their structural problems have been fixed, \" says surgeon peter rhee at the university of arizona in tucson, who helped develop the technique. The benefits of cooling, or induced hypothermia, have been known for decades. At normal body temperature – around 37 ° c – cells need a regular oxygen supply to produce energy. When the heart stops beating, blood no longer carries oxygen to cells. Without oxygen the brain can only survive for about 5 minutes before the damage is irreversible. However, at lower temperatures, cells need less oxygen because all chemical reactions slow down. This explains why people who fall into icy lakes can sometimes be revived more than half an hour after they have stopped breathing. Just before heart and brain surgery, doctors sometimes lower body temperature using ice packs, and by circulating the blood through an external cooling system.

        "summary": "The roman invasion of britain signified an empire at its peak. Now, archaeologists believe they've identified the very spot where the romans began their assault more than 2,000 years ago and more than a century before britain was won. For millennia, historians have had little more than julius caesar's own account of two invasions ( in 55bc and 54bc ) on which to base their theories as to where the operation began, reports the bbc. But an investigation near ebbsfleet on pegwell bay in kent — across the strait of dover from calais, france — has revealed a 6-foot-deep, 15-foot-wide defensive ditch archaeologists from the university of leicester believe was part of a fort spanning 50 acres, constructed to protect caesar's intimidating force of 800 ships, 20,000 soldiers, and 2,000 horses, per the guardian and telegraph. The ditch, similar to roman defenses in france dating to 52bc, housed pottery from the era, along with a roman javelin and bones showing evidence of violence, per the guardian. In addition, \" the location of the site fits very closely with what julius caesar gives in a series of clues, \" describing its high ground and open bay, archaeologist andrew fitzpatrick tells the bbc. Though the 55bc and 54bc invasions led to no new territory for rome, they did result in the appointment of kings allied to the empire, which allowed for a \" rapid \" conquest of the region beginning in ad43 under emperor claudius, explains project leader colin haselgrove. \" this was the beginning of the permanent roman occupation of britain, which included wales and some of scotland and lasted for almost 400 years, \" he says.

The tweets she put up, which the journal notes were barely acknowledged online, rebutted posts written about everything from her husband's response to the nfl anthem protests to a historical note on a 1970s attack on her father-in-law, gop sen. Charles goodell. The journal describes how it figured out it was her, scouring the twitter account to see who the account followed and finding — among media outlets, sports personalities, and even ryan seacreast — a handful of accounts linked to the high school attended by her twin daughters with goodell. \" i have always passionately defended the hard-working guy i love — and i always will, \" she writes in her statement about the man she's been married to for 20 years. \" i just may not use twitter to do so in the future! \" an nfl rep says goodell himself was unaware of his wife's \" secret admirer \" account.",

With ontario premier doug ford imposing the all-powerful \" notwithstanding \" clause to slash the city council in half, councilors voted 26-10 thursday to fight back by all legal means, the toronto star reports. The decision came after toronto's city clerk said the city had reached a \" tipping point \" in which it was \" virtually impossible \" to have a fair election by oct. 22: \" every hour that goes by, every day that goes by creates greater uncertainty and raises in me a huge concern over the proper conduct of this election, \" she said at the emergency thursday meeting, per cp24. Meanwhile, the provincial bill to cut toronto's council passed its first reading this week amid protests and arrests at queen's park, per the star. At issue is ford's use of the \" notwithstanding \" clause to override a court ruling against his proposed council cut; the judge deemed it a violation of free speech because it was enacted right before the municipal election. As the bbc explains, the clause allows ontario to override \" fundamental freedoms \" of association, expression, and religion, and deny people the right to life, liberty, and personal security. Critics say that ford — dubbed \" canada's donald trump \" for his aggressive political conservatism — is misusing a clause intended only for emergencies, per the globe &amp; mail. Others accuse ford of gerrymandering the council to be more conservative, per pressprogress. Ford maintains that his election victory gives him the mandate to reduce toronto's council by any possible means. Both sides are expected before an appeals court on tuesday.",

Professor gregory okin was interested in the environmental impacts of our pets and — in a paper published wednesday in plos one — calculates that american cats and dogs create about 64 million tons of carbon dioxide per year due to eating meat. That's equivalent to the yearly output of 13.6 million cars. \" the numbers are surprisingly large, \" he tells the sacramento bee. All told, cats and dogs account for 25 % to 30 % of the environmental impact of meat consumption in the us. Okin says that's \" huge. \" and yet, he's \" not saying people should go out and kill their animals or feed them something that isn't appropriate \" — like an all-veggie diet. Okin does identify a number of possible ways to lessen the problem: people could transition to vegetarian pets, such as hamsters, birds, and chickens ( which have the added benefit of providing protein for their owners ); the pet food industry could get more sustainable and find alternate sources of protein; and, according to the santa monica mirror, pet owners can make sure they're not over-feeding their dogs and cats.

The problem is that doctors can find no physical cause of her paralysis.

It's quite difficult to reuse at that point. \" how it ideally works: after the stage-one rocket booster separates from the dragon, its engine will fire it around to the unmanned barge, some 200 miles east of jacksonville, fla. The barge has gps sensors, and what plait says is \" the ability to hold its position under its own power even in strong currents. \" the times notes that spacex has added \" grid fins \" to the rocket that fold out and help it steer. If it works, musk has his eye on developing an entirely recyclable rocket, which he tells the times should cuts his costs to one-hundredth of what they currently are.",

Now, ghomeshi has published a long essay in the new york review of books, titled \"reflections from a hashtag. \" in it, ghomeshi aims to \"inject nuance \" into his story and says he has faced \"enough humiliation for a lifetime \" as a victim of \"mass shaming. \" he also claims to have learned some lessons that have made him a better man:",
            "New york ( ap ) — the editor of the new york review of books has abruptly left his post following an outcry when the magazine published an essay by a former radio host accused of sexual misconduct that many deemed self-serving. Ian buruma, who was appointed to lead the magazine last year, is \" no longer the editor, \" according to nicholas during, a publicist for the new york review of books. It was unclear if buruma was fired or resigned. The magazine came under fire last week for publishing \" reflections from a hashtag, \" an essay by jian ghomeshi, who has been accused of sexual assault and punching and choking women without their consent. Critics say the 3,400-word essay had inaccuracies, minimized ghomeshi's actions and was an egotistical attempt to rehabilitate himself. Farrah khan of ryerson university wondered why the magazine gave ghomeshi such a platform while many people affected by sexual violence are not. Ghomeshi was acquitted in march 2016 of four counts of sexual assault and one count of choking involving three complainants. He also apologized to a fourth complainant and signed a peace bond that saw another count of sexual assault withdrawn. Buruma later defended publishing the essay in an interview with slate, saying he was \" no judge of the rights and wrongs of every allegation \" and that the specifics of ghomeshi's"

A report released yesterday by the cdc's national center for health statistics tracks \" the prevalence and the magnitude \" of bladder and bowel incontinence and finds nearly 51 % all us seniors who live at home suffer from it. Some 44 % reported urinary leakage, and 17 % bowel leakage ( some people experience both ); 25 % have moderate, severe, or very severe urinary cases, healthday news reports. Women are much more likely to suffer from it, due to loss of muscle control following childbirth and declining estrogen levels after menopause. In men, incontinence can be caused by prostate problems or nerve damage. The report also gathered data on incontinence among nursing home, residential care, and hospice facility residents ( though it notes that different definitions of incontinence were used for the various populations ). Nearly 76 % percent of long-term nursing home residents couldn't completely control bladder or bowel function 14 days prior to the survey, the washington post adds. Experts hope the study will diminish the stigma attached to discussing the problem, which can be treated with diet, drugs, and surgery.

A bill banning non-prescription sunscreens containing two chemicals believed to cause coral bleaching easily passed hawaii's legislature tuesday — there were just four votes against it in the house — meaning it now goes to gov. David ige's desk, reports npr. If ige signs the bill, hawaii will become the first us state to impose a law banning oxybenzone and octinoxate, to take effect in 2021, reports the honolulu star-advertiser. State sen. Mike gabbard, who introduced the bill, says it would also be \" a first-in-the-world law. \" and \" our island paradise, surrounded by coral reefs, is the perfect place to set the gold standard for the world to follow. \" as oxybenzone and octinoxate are found in more than 3,500 sunscreen products, including from brands hawaiian tropic, coppertone, and banana boat, critics fear a ban will encourage people to go without, increasing instances of skin cancer, per npr and usa today. But there are plenty of all-natural, hawaiian-made sunscreens tourists can choose from, reports outside. It quotes ecotoxicologist craig downs, who found 29,000 nanongrams of oxybenzone per liter of seawater at oahu's hanauma bay nature reserve in 2017. \" anything above basically 50 nanograms per liter... Can induce toxicity in a variety of marine organisms, \" he says. A 2015 study cited by npr notes oxybenzone \" leaches the coral of its nutrients \" and can \" disrupt the development of fish and other wildlife. \"",

        "summary": "Some 250 million years ago, earth had one continent — pangaea. Today, there are seven, and in another 50 million years or so, there could be eight. That's according to geologists studying a massive crack that recently appeared in southwestern kenya, taking out homes and a section of highway, after seismic activity and heavy rain in the area. Located within the appropriately named east african rift valley, where two tectonic plates pull away from each other, the crack is several miles long, up to 65 feet across, more than 50 feet deep, and still growing, reports national geographic. As christy till of arizona state university explains, per usa today, \" a rift like this once eventually separated the african and south american continents to form the atlantic ocean and the rift in east africa may be the very early stages of this. \" if that is the case, the breakup of the african continent is still tens of millions of years away. \" the process just occurs very slowly, \" till says. Still, geologists have an idea of how it might happen. With one tectonic plate moving to the west, and the other to the east, researchers predict a portion of east africa — including somalia and parts of kenya, ethiopia, and tanzania — will eventually break apart to float between madagascar and the larger african continent. ( usa today has a diagram. ) while the region's residents don't need to worry about the breakup itself, the rift does present plenty of infrastructure issues, per daily nation, though portions of it have reportedly been filled with concrete and rocks. A geologist tells daily nation the crack was probably there a while, but filled with volcanic ash that rain only recently washed away.",

        "summary": "With a partial shutdown of the department of homeland security just hours away, house republicans appear to have decided to back away from the cliff and pass a \" clean \" funding bill that will keep the department open — for a few weeks. After a house gop meeting yesterday on a stopgap bill to fund dhs for three weeks, rep. Walter b. Jones told the washington post that a \" majority, probably, are inclined to support it, \" although he personally doesn't support a bill that doesn't link funding to president obama's actions on immigration. Democratic leaders urged house speaker john boehner to bring the measure to a vote and not try to add any immigration riders, the post reports. The house is expected to vote on the stopgap bill today, reports the ap, which notes that if the move to extend current homeland security funding levels until march 19 fails to pass, some 30,000 dhs workers will be furloughed at midnight and 200,000 will be expected to work without pay. A longer-term spending bill with no link to immigration is making its way through the senate, politico reports, and some of the less hard-line house republicans predict that the house will eventually have to accept it. \" the only question is when — tomorrow or in three weeks, \" rep. Charlie dent tells the ap. \" some folks just have a harder time facing political reality than others. \"",

            "House republicans on thursday presented a plan for a stopgap bill that would fund the department of homeland security for three weeks, raising hopes of averting a looming shutdown of the agency. The plan, which the leaders pitched to rank-and-file republicans in a closed-door meeting, was the first sign they were willing to pass a new bill after passing another one weeks ago that takes aim at president obama's executive actions on immigration and has been blocked in the senate. But the plan faces an uncertain outlook, as house democratic leadership decided to marshal support against it. Facing a friday-night-into-saturday-morning shutdown deadline, the plan might ultimately win support from lawmakers in both parties on friday. But its passage would only continue a standoff between the house and the senate over longer-term dhs funding. Separately, the senate was moving toward a final vote on a funding bill that would not go after obama's immigration directives. Exiting the house gop meeting, republican members said the leadership presented the plan as a way to allow time for the house and senate to try to go to conference on their competing bills.

But that will leave the house and senate just three weeks to bridge their fundamental differences on funding the department for the long term and blocking president barack obama's changes to the enforcement of immigration policy.
