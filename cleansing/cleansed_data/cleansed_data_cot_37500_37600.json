        "summary": "An lgbt advocacy group, a hollywood star, and a supreme court justice have all taken on donald trump in recent weeks — and now the chief executive of a vegan food products company has jumped into the mix. Joshua tetrick, ceo of hampton creek, took out a full-page ad blasting the gop's presumptive nominee in sunday's new york times and, strategically, in the cleveland plain dealer ( the republican national convention begins in that city on monday ), the washington post reports. \" americans are frustrated and angry and scared, \" tetrick writes in the eye-catching ad, which quartz shows contained only an enormous \" dear donald \" at the top, followed by six short paragraphs, tetrick's signature, and his phone number. \" you've channeled this into your nomination. … your campaign doesn't just seem wrong. It feels un-american. \" what tetrick paid for the ad is unclear, but both quartz and the washington post offer estimates based on media kit numbers that range from about $ 152,000 to $ 193,000. Tetrick has opted for full-page times missives before ( the hampton creek site lists them ), but those ads have typically linked somehow to agriculture or the food industry — more in line with a food-tech company that sells an egg-free, mayo-like spread and other food items. Tetrick — who notes to fortune his gambit \" might \" hurt sales, but that he'd \" feel sick if i didn't do anything \" — tells quartz he hoped his ad would spur other business bigwigs to step up in support of our country's \" courageous and kind \" citizens. \" you should respect women. Immigrants make this country better. We should be civil to each other.... There are these basic things that we don't need to argue about, \" tetrick, who calls himself a moderate democrat, tells cnnmoney, adding he was inspired by the recent death of elie wiesel. The ad's final message to trump: \" turning away from you is a way to say who we are. \"",

Alex honnold, 31, scaled the nearly 3,000-foot peak on saturday going free solo, meaning he didn't use ropes, harness, or other safety equipment. \" this is the 'moon landing ' of free-soloing, \" fellow climber tommy caldwell tells national geographic. It's a particularly daunting prospect since the guardian notes the granite peak is ranked as among the most difficult, with some hand-holds the width of raisins. After stunning the climbing world with other rope-free feats, honnold had quietly trained for his latest exploit for more than a year. After spending the night in his van, honnold pulled on a red t-shirt, nylon pants, and sticky-soled climbing shoes. With chalk to keep his hands dry tucked in a bag around his waist, honnold set off at 5: 32am. He made the summit three hours and 56 minutes later. \" so stoked to realize a life dream today: ) \" he tweeted. Caldwell and a national geographic crew were along for the climb, which they filmed for a documentary. \" alex was on fire, \" caldwell tells the mag, which called the feat the greatest in the history of pure rock climbing. Honnold had ditched an earlier bid to climb el capitan in november, saying it didn't feel right. This time around, honnold confesses he was \" slightly nervous \" at the bottom. \" i mean it's a freaking big wall above you. \" but as he began his ascent, he adds, \" the climbing just felt amazing. \" ( tense moments when a 1,500-pound rock pinned this climber. )",

        "summary": "The state has declined to file criminal charges against four corrections officers who allegedly boiled a schizophrenic inmate alive in a florida prison shower five years ago, the miami new times reports. Darren rainey was serving time in dade correctional institute for cocaine possession when corrections officers allegedly trapped him in the shower for two hours under 180-degree water. Inmates said they could hear rainey scream as the guards laughed and asked if the shower was \" hot enough. \" a prison nurse later said there were burns on 90 % of rainey's body and his skin fell off when it was touched. According to the miami herald, at least six inmates say the shower was used to punish inmates, many of them mentally ill. But a report released late friday by the miami-dade state attorney's office found no evidence the guards had committed a crime. The report determined rainey died of a combination of complications from schizophrenia, a heart condition, and being \" confined in the shower. \" but it concluded the guards didn't \" grossly disregard \" his health. The report mostly relied on an autopsy that has never been made public. It dismissed testimony from inmates, as well as a report from a prison captain who measured the shower's temperature at 160 degrees following rainey's death. State law caps prison showers at 120 degrees. And prison medical workers say they were pressured to keep quiet by the private contractor that runs the prison. A lawyer for rainey's family says they are \" appalled \" by the report.",

        "summary": "Although responses to pope francis have been chiefly positive, one dark stain in church history is raising serious questions about the new pope — the church's role during the dictatorship in argentina, reports the guardian. The church backed the dictatorship during its rule from 1976 to 1983, urging its followers to be patriotic and support the regime, too, even as thousands of people were abducted and murdered by the government, including many progressive priests. As the head of the jesuit order in argentina from 1973 to 1979, jorge bergoglio was part of the church hierarchy and has been accused of working with the dictatorship. In 2005, bergoglio was accused in a lawsuit of withdrawing church protection from two anti-government priests, leading to their incarceration under brutal conditions in 1976, reports the new york times. Bergoglio has called the allegation \" slander \" and claimed he worked behind the scenes to help the priests, but he has twice refused to testify in court about what his role had been. \" i still have many doubts about his role regarding the jesuits who went missing under the dictatorship, \" says the leader of a group of left-wing priests. Others praise bergoglio for his role in the \" monumental task \" of healing the church's black eye after the war: \" if he can restore the credibility of the church ( in argentina ), \" says one expert, \" he can handle the scandals that have befallen the church worldwide.",

The chicago daily law bulletin reports the 7th us circuit court of appeals in chicago made the ruling in a lawsuit brought by a self-declared satanist, kenneth mayle. He argued that the motto propagates a religious view he opposes. A lower court had tossed the suit, citing a supreme court decision that a motto on currency isn't something people display prominently and thus are not forced to publicly advertise views that clash with their own, the ap reports. Mayle appealed to restore the suit, but the 7th circuit refused, describing the phrase as a \" historical reminder \" of the nation's heritage.

The parents of three siblings, ages 9, 10, and 14, have been locked in a bitter divorce battle for years, and the last custody hearing ended with the judge ordering the siblings to a juvenile detention facility and telling them they would be there until they graduate from high school unless they could act like \" normal human beings \" and build a healthy relationship with their father, whom she described as a \" good man, \" nbc news reports. The siblings have been detained since june 24 and the next hearing isn't scheduled until september, according to buzzfeed. According to a transcript obtained by fox detroit, the hearing began with the judge finding the 14-year-old boy in contempt for failing to communicate with his father and sending him to juvenile hall. She then ordered his 10-year-old brother and 9-year-old sister to have lunch with their father and sent them to juvenile hall as well when they refused — stipulating that they have no contact with each other or with their mother, whom she accuses of \" brainwashing \" the younger children to hate their father, the detroit news reports. A family law expert familiar with the case tells the news that getting the children out of detention will be up to the parents and that his impression is that the \" wrong people may be in jail. \" ( a turkey baster was at the center of another custody ruling. )",

Video from security cameras at the hospital in belgorod captured the dec. 29 attack by a doctor identified as ilya zelendinov, reports the bbc. An autopsy of the patient — identified by rt.com as 56-year-old evgeny vakhtin — revealed a traumatic brain injury. The video shows zelendinov bursting into an examination room and punching vakhtin, who falls to the ground, as well as a second man. The doctor was fired and is now under house arrest facing two years in prison. Because an investigative committee found no evidence that zelendinov meant to kill the man, the attack has been classified as negligence. Cnn, citing russia's ria novosti, says the patient had earlier kicked a nurse, thus enraging the doctor. A friend of vakhtin's, however, says the kick was unintentional and came during a medical procedure. \" i apologized to her for him, saying it was accidental, \" says aleksandr avilov, per rt. When the doctor came in throwing punches, avilov says he tried to calm him, \" but only received a series of blows myself. \" after the attack, the video shows zelendinov trying to revive the fallen vakhtin with chest compressions. Later, he is dragged out of the room and a hospital employee begins mopping the floor.",

        "summary": "The city of norfolk has agreed to pay $ 4.9 million to four former sailors who were wrongly convicted of a woman's rape and murder based on intimidating police interrogations. A copy of the settlement agreement for the \" norfolk four \" was obtained by the ap. The state also has agreed to pay $ 3.5 million. The payments close out a decades-long case that drew widespread attention as the men's innocence claims were backed by dozens of former fbi agents, ex-prosecutors, and crime novelist john grisham. \" these guys can now put all this behind them and try to recoup their lives, \" said tony troy, a lawyer who represented one of the sailors. The men — eric wilson, danial williams, joseph dick, and derek tice — were pardoned by then-virginia gov. Terry mcauliffe last year of the 1997 rape and murder of michelle moore-bosko. Moore-bosko's husband found her stabbed and strangled body in their apartment in july of that year after returning from a week at sea. Williams, who lived in the same building, was quickly identified as a suspect because a neighbor told police he had a crush on the victim. Williams admitted to her rape and murder — the first of a series of confessions, which conflicted with each other, that the men, then-sailors at the naval base in norfolk, say were forced by police. Dna evidence matched only one person: omar ballard, the fifth man convicted in the case. Ballard, who pleaded guilty in 2000, acknowledged he was solely responsible and is serving a life sentence. Ballard's account was the only one containing information matching the crime scene. In vacating some of the norfolk four's convictions, a federal judge once declared that \" no sane human being \" could find them guilty. ( much more on the case here. )",

        "summary": "Is there a reason neurotic people tend to be bigger worriers but also more creative than the rest of us? a newly published theory says yes, and it has to do with daydreaming. Neurotics — famous ones include isaac newton, winston churchill, and, of course, woody allen — get anxious and obsessed with everyday things, are risk-averse and brooding, and avoid dangerous jobs, explains time. But psychologist adam perkins wanted to know what all that had to do with being more creative and better at problem-solving. His breakthrough came when he attended a lecture on the connection between daydreaming and creativity by jonathan smallwood. He \" talked about the way daydreamers ' minds wander when they're feeling kind of blue, and my ears perked up, \" says perkins. According to the new study by perkins and smallwood, neuroticism may be caused by hyperactivity in the brain's medial prefrontal cortex, which handles threat-related thoughts. They came to this connection thanks to a previous smallwood study in which he put volunteers into mri machines with nothing to do, leaving them to daydream. The medial prefrontal cortex is more active in neurotics, who tended to dwell on problems and threats for much longer while daydreaming, according to the hindu. It could be exactly this inclination to dwell on problems for much longer than other people that allows neurotics to come up with more creative solutions. In short, \" the authors argue that the part of the brain responsible for self-generated thought is highly active in neuroticism, which yields both of the trait's positives ( e.g., creativity ) and negatives ( e.g., misery ), \" according to a press release. Or as forbes puts it, \" the capacity to conjure up threats that don't necessarily exist could also help you conjure up other types of ideas, ones that are insightful and valuable to problem-solving — i.e., creativity. \" ( of course, neuroticism has its downsides, too. )",

        "summary": "Up until now, the world's tallest water slide has been brazil's \" insano, \" at 134.5 feet; those who brave it travel at speeds of 65mph. But a new attraction at a kansas water park will apparently dwarf those figures. Schlitterbahn park is keeping a lid on the exact height and speed of the under-construction verruckt meg-a-blaster, usa today reports. But it will be about 17 stories high, reports the kansas city star, which notes a \" measuring event \" will take place in advance of the slide's may 23 opening. Verruckt is german for \" insane, \" which is what you might have to be to ride the thing. ( indeed, a promotional video asks \" r u insane? \" ) it's \" going to be a game-changer for our industry, \" says a park co-owner. \" our greatest challenge will be to find thrill seekers brave enough to ride. \" and brave enough to climb the slide's 264 steps, to the top of a tower made from chopped-up railroad tanker cars, before descending in a four-person inflatable raft. Even after the initial descent, the thrills continue: there's an extra hump at the bottom, gawker notes via midwestinfoguide. Adds another park spokesperson: \" we have always been family friendly, but this will attract those adrenaline junkies. \" many more photos here.",

Rosa holds that the adventurer's father was vladislav iii, who was not killed in 1444 as thought. Instead, he went into exile, married a portuguese noblewoman, and fathered columbus — who lied to protect his father's real identity, rosa tells the daily telegraph. Columbus'station would explain both his ability to marry a noble and his knowledge of everything from geography to cartography, which rosa says points to a top-notch education. \" the marriage was approved by the king of portugal, something that could never have happened if we believe the myth that columbus washed up in a shipwreck in portugal, \" writes rosa. More evidence: columbus was \"reddish-haired, fair-skinned and blue-eyed, \" and his coat of arms looks like the polish king's.

The origins of the man who discovered the americas has long been a subject of speculation. Contemporary accounts named his birth place as the italian port of genoa to a family of wool weavers but over the centuries it has been claimed that he was a native of greece, spain, france, portugal and even scotland. Others claimed his origins were hidden because he was jewish or secretly working as a double agent for the portuguese royal family.

        "summary": "You may have more in common with your spouse than you think — like dna, a new study suggests. Scientists came to their conclusion, published yesterday in the journal pnas, after reviewing data on 9,429 non-hispanic whites, a group that included 825 wedded couples. The bigger number of the study: 1.7 million. That's how many single nucleotide polymorphisms — which the los angeles times describes as \" the point at which a sequence of dna differs between individuals \" — the researchers reviewed. They observed that spouses often share other traits, like education level, and set out to \" estimate the genome-wide genetic similarity of spouses and compare the magnitude \" of it to that educational similarity, they write. Their conclusion: married couples were indeed more genetically similar than two randomly chosen individuals, but that similarity wasn't as pronounced as the educational one: it's no more than one-third the magnitude of educational similarity, they found. Livescience points out that genes have a hand in a number of traits that may come into play in coupling, like geographical origin and intelligence. It notes that the researchers did control for geography, and their genetic conclusion still held. But the researchers call their results \" only a first step \" and note other limits, specifically the opposite-sex, white makeup of the couples they reviewed. ( more marriage research touches on another similarity, involving booze. )",

British officials did not identify the victim, but the french president, françois hollande, referred to him as \"a soldier \" in expressing france's sympathy to the visiting british prime minister, david cameron. Mr. Cameron had been en route to paris from brussels when the attack took place. Two suspects were shot and wounded by the police, officials said, and were in separate hospitals under",

One of the suspects is understood to be 28-year-old muslim convert michael adebolajo, according to sources. He and another man are under arrest in hospital after being shot by police after wednesday's attack in woolwich.

The spectrum in which investigators will be working now is broad, and the characters within it unstable and unpredictable. In the immediate aftermath of the attack in south london, detectives might have been reluctant to tell the home secretary, theresa may, conclusively that this was the work of jihadists, but as the hours passed any doubts must have evaporated. The language attributed to one of the men filmed at the scene,",
            "Scores of supporters of the english defence league threw bottles at police and chanted anti-muslim slogans in woolwich hours after the murder of one man and the shooting of his two suspected assailants. About 100 men, including some wearing balaclavas printed with \" edl \", engaged in running battles with police for less than an hour. A police commander said officers cited section 60 of the public order act, which allowed them to stop and search individuals within a specific area without evidence of a crime being committed. Edl leader tommy robinson said: \" they're chopping our soldiers ' heads off. This is islam. That's what we've seen today."

        "summary": "President trump has deleted some of his tweets about alabama's republican us senate primary — but it's not an election the gop will be able to move on from quickly. Former state supreme court chief justice roy moore, a conservative christian who was supported by anti-establishment forces including steve bannon, defeated sen. Luther strange, who was endorsed by president trump and strongly supported by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. Analysts say the result is likely to intensify a \" civil war \" in the gop ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. A roundup of coverage: at moore's victory party, bannon described the win as the start of a \" revolution, \" politico reports. \" you're going to see in state, after state, after state, people that follow the model of judge moore — that do not need to raise money from the elites, from the crony capitalists, from the fat cats in washington, dc, \" he said. Strange wished moore well after the result, though he admitted he was confused by the race, the ap reports. \" we're dealing with a political environment that i've never had any experience with, \" he said. \" i ' m telling you, the political seas and winds in this country right now... Are very hard to navigate, very hard to understand. \" the washington post predicts \" all-out war \" between establishment and anti-establishment forces in the republican party, which will cause many retirements and primary challenges in the months ahead. At his victory party, moore told the crowd he had put his fate \" in the hands of the almighty \" and said he supports trump, despite the president's endorsement of his rival, the new york times reports. \" together, we can make america great, \" he said. \" don't let anybody in the press think that because he supported my opponent that i do not support him. \" analysts predict an \" ugly, exciting \" race between moore and democratic candidate doug jones before the dec. 12 special election, al.com reports. The winner will take the senate seat formerly held by attorney general jeff sessions. The hill lists five takeaways from the alabama race. Among them is the fact that the deeply controversial moore, who has argued that \" homosexual conduct should be illegal, \" could give fellow republicans \" heartburn \" if opponents try to link them to his opinions. The alabama result capped a terrible day for mcconnell, cnn reports. Earlier, senate republicans said they wouldn't vote on the latest obamacare repeal bill, and mcconnell ally sen.

        "summary": "President obama made the case tonight that he's not offering a \" mass amnesty \" to immigrants who have entered the country illegally, reports cnn. In fact, he said in a speech laying out his executive actions on immigration that the \" real amnesty \" would be leaving the current system in place. Some highlights: \" mass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. What i ' m describing is accountability — a common-sense, middle-ground approach. \" \" if you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you're a criminal, you ' ll be deported. If you plan to enter the us illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up. \" immigration officers will focus on \" felons, not families. \" \" the actions i ' m taking are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every single republican president and every democratic president for the past half-century. \" \" to those members of congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where congress has failed, i have one answer: pass a bill. \" read the full transcript here. As had been widely reported, up to 5 million undocumented immigrants could gain protections, with most falling into one category: parents whose kids are us citizens or legal permanent residents. The washington post reports that those who have lived here five years can submit applications in the spring and that the protections would be in place for three years. Obama, derided in advance by republicans accusing him of abusing his power, also said he would make it easier for \" high-skilled \" immigrants to remain in the country.",

While previous studies haven't shown that holding kids back leads to better test scores or income later in life, stanford researchers found kids with less inattention and hyperactivity — both part of adhd — did better in school, quartz reports. And prior research shows higher self-control levels are linked to achievement. Dee and his team suggest that kids who start school later have more unstructured playtime and thus enter kindergarten with a healthier state of mind. This theory of \" the more time children get to play, the better, \" is a big one cited by parents who choose to have their kids start later, notes the huffington post.

        "summary": "Utah's most defining feature, the great salt lake, may not be long for this world. Scientists report in a utah state university white paper that 150 years of human diversions from the rivers running into the lake have reduced water levels by 11 feet, \" exposing much of the lake bed \" and amounting to a roughly 50 % loss of volume in that time, reports utah public radio. In what the houston chronicle calls a \" damning \" paper, the researchers go on to point their fingers at state senate bill 80, which was heard on the same day the paper was published, calling for additional water diversions to help develop bear river as the state's population continues to rise. \" we hope this starts a conversation, \" a spokesperson for the utah division of water resources tells utah public radio. \" we hope that skier or that person who cares about the economy or the wildlife on the lake will not only look into what's happening with the lake, but look into how they can be part of the solution instead of part of the problem. \" his team estimates that the bear river project alone would result in another 8.5-inch drop in elevation and the exposure of another 30 square miles of lake bed. Researchers note that california's owens river, destroyed by diversions in the 1920s, remains one of the country's largest sources of particulate matter, causing asthma and other health problems across the region; likewise with shrinking salt lakes in iran and uzbekistan.

The twittersphere went a step further, with fans pondering who could play a black willy on the big screen, per entertainment weekly. One suggested tituss burgess. \" ummmmm oh the fun i would have! \" burgess tweeted in response. With nearly 1 million in sales, charlie was dahl's top-selling book, per the guardian, but the complicated author's success came with controversy. In the first edition, oompa-loompas were depicted as african pygmies. After the naacp complained, dahl made them orange, per npr. Dahl, who died in 1990, was also dogged by charges of anti-semitism.

According to the moscow times, a construction worker in the city of krasnodar found a cellphone sept. 11 that contained gruesome images: a man taking a selfie with a severed hand in his mouth, severed heads, and dismembered women. Authorities say police traced the phone's sim card to 35-year-old dmitry baksheev, who initially claimed he found the body parts in a dumpster and took pictures with them. He allegedly later confessed that he and his wife had killed and eaten perhaps 30 people, which would put them among russia's worst serial killers. While many details of the case are unknown or unconfirmed, authorities say the alleged murders date back to at least 1999, cnn reports. That's the time stamp on a photo found in the couple's home that appears to show a severed head and fruit on a serving plate. Authorities say they also found eight body parts preserved in jars with saline solution, the remains of seven people, and a how-to video on cannibalism in the couple's apartment. According to the bbc, \" food fragments and frozen meat pieces of unknown origin \" found in the apartment are being tested for human dna. Authorities say baksheev and his wife, natalia baksheeva, would knock their victims out with sedatives, though it's unclear how they chose their victims. So far authorities have only charged baksheev with a single count of murder.",

The atlantic reports researchers in the 1970s caught a few types of fish that indicated a reef might be present along the coast of northeastern brazil, but it wasn't taken seriously. The waters at the mouth of the amazon are some of the muddiest in the world, according to the guardian. Sediment and other debris from all over south america are rocketed hundreds of miles out to sea, blocking the sunlight believed necessary for coral reefs to form. Even so, a brazilian oceanographer hitched a ride on an unrelated research mission and convinced them to hunt for the rumored reef. The result of that expedition, which was announced friday, was a 600-mile-long reef of coral and sponges containing 73 species of fish, 60 species of sponges, and more. Researcher patricia yager tells the atlantic she was \" flabbergasted \" to find a reef where conditions seemed to preclude its existence. But that existence — under environmentally difficult conditions — could be a great sign for the future of reefs currently being threatened by climate change. ( nearly the entire great barrier reef is currently suffering from coral bleaching and much of it may not recover, science alert reports. ) unfortunately for the new reef, its existence is only getting more difficult. The brazilian government is allowing dozens of oil drilling operations essentially on top of the newly discovered reef. ( under yellowstone, scientists found an enormous magma reservoir. )",

That doesn't mean north korea is in the clear, however; on the contrary, the north has been known to route its attacks through such addresses, and the revelation has only \" strengthened speculation \" that north korea was at the wheel, reports the bbc. The malware used in this attack is called \" darkseoul \" and was first identified a year ago, reports the new york times. State-sponsored cyberattacks tend to be stealthy, but this malware was not disguised, leading some to question whether north korean hackers were behind it — or whether the north wanted to send a clear message. \" this could be the start of a full-fledged cyber war, \" one intelligence official tells the chosun ilbo, warning that the south's nuclear power plants and railways could be future targets. Meanwhile, the ap reports that as of today, only one of the six companies targeted is back online; the other five may not all be up and running until next week.",

Police say building managers found a seriously wounded woman inside the apartment tuesday morning, and responding officers arrived to find both women dead. The incident was originally reported as a stabbing, patch reports, but their causes of death have not yet been officially determined. The medical examiner has also not yet confirmed their identities, but the bangkok post ids them as two close friends from thailand. Seattle police say there are no outstanding suspects, which could indicate a murder-suicide; according to the thaiger, there are also reports the apartment was locked from the inside when the women were found. Per the post, the women are kornkamol leenavarat and thiti-orn chotchuangsap. According to her older brother, leenavarat, 25, had just flown to the us two weeks prior to get her master's degree in law; he says chotchuangsap was her roommate. Immigration records reportedly show that she, too, had only recently left thailand. A local official says leenavarat had called her family every day since leaving for the us, and when they didn't hear from her saturday, they asked a relative in seattle to check on her. The relative reportedly could not get in touch with her and ultimately asked the building manager to do a welfare check after the family also learned she had been absent from class. The nation notes that leenavarat's family is well-known in their thai province due to some members being local politicians.",

When the two kids first started playing together, tyler was curious why gabby always wore head coverings, and his parents filled him in on her condition: alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the head and other parts of the body. Gabby had gone through myriad treatments to spur hair growth, but none of them had worked, which got tyler thinking about how he could help his friend. His solution: he'd grow his own hair out so that gabby could make a wig out of it. \" it's just hair, i can grow hair, \" he said at the time, per his mom. And so for two years tyler let his hair grow down to his shoulders, shrugging off bullies and being mistaken for a girl. \" i ' m used to it now, \" he says, per ktla. \" i just want to make her happy. \" the kids headed to a mall hair salon in brandon, fla., on dec. 29, where gabby did the honors of lopping off tyler's ponytail to usher in his new'do ( he opted for a buzz cut ). \" this is tyler's personality … not something we encouraged him to do, \" his dad tells abc.

Although hunting is permitted at a handful of national parks, including grand teton in wyoming, hunting or even firing a gun is unlawful in yellowstone, according to park literature. The forested campsite where the shooting occurred sits near a developed area in the wyoming section of the park known as grant village, which features a ranger station, lodge, stores and other amenities.

            "Yellowstone national park officials are investigating after an idaho woman reported her 3-year-old daughter shot herself with a handgun in a campground. Park rangers responded saturday morning to grant village campground, but resuscitation efforts failed, resulting in what officials said was the first shooting death in the park since 1978. Park spokesman al nash said sunday that part of the campground remained cordoned off while park rangers and special park agents conduct the investigation. He said he didn't know where the girl's body was taken. \" we don't have all of the information, and we haven't drawn any conclusions, \" nash said. He said he didn't know how many family members were camping or where they are from in idaho. Names haven't been released. A federal law went into effect feb. 22, 2010, allowing visitors to possess firearms in the park. Nash said records show two shooting deaths occurred in the park in 1978, but he didn't have details. \" given the 3 million visitors we see here every year, there thankfully are very few fatalities reported in the park, \" nash said. He said heart attacks were the primary cause of human deaths in the park. The park recently reported that through august, about 2.5 million people have visited the park. Portions of the"

A witness tells the bbc she saw more than 50 chibok girls just three weeks ago in northeastern nigeria, but little else is known of the girls ' whereabouts. An amnesty international report finds boko haram has abducted 2,000 girls since january 2014 to serve as sex slaves, cooks, and fighters, some of whom were later killed, a witness says. But the group says the chibok girls have been married off. Muhammadu buhari, nigeria's incoming president, vows his government will \" do everything in its power to bring them home \" but \" i cannot promise that we can find them. \" a director for unicef says the kidnapping of the chibok girls is only one of many \" endless tragedies being replicated on an epic scale \" in the area. Under boko haram's violent run, some 7,300 were killed in 2014 and more than 1,000 have died so far this year, the guardian reports. A unicef report released yesterday finds some 800,000 children have been displaced by fighting — twice as many as a year ago. Meanwhile, \" scores of girls and boys have gone missing in nigeria — abducted, recruited by armed groups, attacked, used as weapons, or forced to flee violence, \" the director says. Buhari's government along with \" recent military successes might spell the beginning of the end for boko haram, but there is a huge amount to be done, \" amnesty international's secretary general adds.",

        "summary": "The sequoia trees of california's sierra nevada mountain range are obvious marvels. But according to new research, an unlikely and far-off source deserves a significant portion of the credit for allowing them to stand tall. The mineral that helps trees grow, phosphorus, is actually found in short supply in the granite formations of the region, so scientists have wondered how the monster trees were able to thrive, reports seeker. Researchers, however, had a theory involving dust. To see if their theory was correct, they collected dust from four sites of varying elevations in the sierra nevada mountains — using a trap consisting of a bundt cake pan filled with marbles on a six-foot-tall post — then studied its isotopes to determine where the dust originated. Of no surprise, especially as the study took place in the middle of california's drought, was that the majority of dust came from the state's central valley, per popular science. But 20 % of dust at the lowest elevation and 45 % at the highest elevation came from asia — more specifically, the gobi desert — and carried more phosphorus than the area's bedrock. Researchers explain specks of dust fly around the world at high elevations, falling only when they hit something. This dust was already known to replenish the soil of tropical ecosystems as rainfall washes nutrients away. But this study suggests dust is also \" fertilizing way more of the world than we had ever anticipated, \" says the study author. \" without tiny particles from asia, \" popular science notes, california's sequoias might be lost.

        "summary": "Christmas weekend was grim in chicago even by this year's wretched standards for gun violence: police say at least 41 people were shot, 11 fatally, between friday evening and sunday night, the chicago sun-times reports. The victims include james gill, 18, and roy gill, 21, who were killed when somebody came out of an alley and opened fire on a front porch during a family party, the chicago tribune reports. Five others were wounded in that shooting alone, two of them critically. Hours earlier, a man around 40 was pronounced dead in a south side hospital after having been shot multiple times near the apostolic labor of love church, where a pool of blood could be seen on the front step. Chicago police department spokesman jose estrada tells the new york times that the number of homicides in the city so far this year is 745, up from 476 at this time last year, and marking the first time since 1997 that there have been more than 700. He says the total number of shooting victims so far this year is 4,252, up 47 % from 2,884 at this time in 2015. Most victims are men under 30. The number of murders in chicago this year is on course to top that of los angeles and new york city combined. Police blame the high rate of gun violence on gang warfare and a \" small subset \" of extremely violent offenders.",

The weekend's most recent homicide happened about 9: 20 p.m. Sunday in an east chatham neighborhood mass shooting that left two men dead and five others wounded, two critically, on the south side, according to chicago police. People were gathered for a party on the porch of a home in the 8600 block of south maryland when someone wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt walked out from an alley and opened fire. The shooter then ran away. James gill, 18, was shot in the head and pronounced dead at the scene, and 21-year-old roy gill iii died of multiple gunshot wounds at christ medical center in oak lawn, according to police and the cook county medical examiner's office. A 35-year-old man suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was also taken to christ, where he was listed in critical condition, and a fourth male shot in the body was taken in critical condition to stroger hospital. Also, a 27-year-old man and 21-year-old woman each suffered a gunshot wound to the leg and were taken to stroger, where their conditions were stabilized.

        "summary": "An increasing number of women may be getting one or both breasts removed following a certain early stage breast cancer diagnosis without actually decreasing their odds of dying from the disease, the new york times reports. A study published today comes to the conclusion that many thousands of women are getting \" sometimes disfiguring \" treatments unnecessarily after being diagnosed with dcis, long considered a precursor of breast cancer. Advances in mammogram technology have increased diagnoses of dcis — abnormal cells in the milk duct — from a few hundred a year in 1980 to 60,000 a year today. That increase in early dcis detection should correspond to a decrease in breast cancer cases, but it hasn't. Researchers looked at more than 100,000 women with dcis — almost all of whom had lumpectomies, mastectomies, or double mastectomies following their diagnosis — and concluded they had a 3.3 % chance of dying of breast cancer in the next 20 years, the times reports. That's about the same as any random woman off the street ( though young and/or black dcis patients had a slightly higher mortality rate ), according to healthday. A doctor behind the study tells the times it shows the best treatment for dcis is to do nothing, and the american cancer society's chief medical officer says treatment of dcis has been excessive. \" in medicine, we have a tendency to get too enthusiastic, \" he says. Not everyone agrees. A chief breast cancer surgeon at one cancer center said she doesn't see a reason to change the current system.",

        "summary": "A new proposal by the us fish and wildlife service to declare chimpanzees living in captivity as \" endangered \" rather than \" threatened \" is more than just semantics: it will help protect the primates from being the subjects of medical research. Since 1990, only wild chimps have classified by the us as an endangered species, while their captive counterparts have been available for science experiments, the washington post reports. \" the rule proposed today would correct this inconsistency, \" says the agency in a press release. The us is the only first-world country that still allows great apes to be used for research, according to the post. Under the changes, research with chimps would still be allowed, but would require a permit, the new york times reports. The change would also have implications for the import and export of chimpanzees and their movements across state lines. How it would affect chimps in the entertainment industry is still up for discussion, but the humane society says it will be pushing for restrictions.",

But which drugs are most addictive? as eric bowman points out in an article in the conversation, the answer to that question is not as cut and dry as it may seem. From varying points of view, a drug's addictiveness can be judged by its street value, the harm it causes, withdrawal symptoms, or how pleasurable its effects are, among other factors. For his list of the five most addictive drugs, bowman relies largely on research gleaned from surveying addiction experts. Here's what he came up with ( in order of addictiveness ): heroin: based on how it tweaks the brain's award system ( increasing dopamine levels by up to 200 % ), heroin — dope, junk, horse, china white, etc. — is deemed the most addictive drug. With a deadly dose being just five times higher than a normal one, it's also a dangerous drug. Alcohol: this legal drug can increase dopamine levels by 40 % to 360 % ( at least in rats ). And about 22 % of people who imbibe will develop alcohol dependence at some point. Cocaine: \" abnormal activation of the brain's reward pathways \" resulting from cocaine use can cause dopamine levels to rise more than three times the typical level. And some 21 % of people who try cocaine will develop a dependence on it at some point. Bowman notes that coke is similar to other addictive stimulants, such as meth. Click for the full top 5.",

The idol is more than twice as old as the great pyramid of giza, three times older than the ancient city of babylon, and five times as old as al khazneh, the most famous of the ruins in the ancient city of petra. Radiocarbon dating conducted in 1997 gave the statue an age of 9,500 years old, but the results were controversial. To confirm the statue's age, seven \" minuscule \" samples of wood were sent to germany for analysis by accelerated mass spectrometry, the siberian times reported. The new analysis found the sculpture to be 11,000 years old, and made from a larch that was 157 years old"

Rolling stone, entertainment weekly, and usa today round up highlights from the film: he knew right away he wanted to play the lead in 10 things i hate about you. He told his friend as much just after reading the script, despite the fact that he was relatively inexperienced at the time. He landed the role, which was his career breakout. He told his agent he had bombed the screen test for the patriot. In fact, he stopped in the middle of doing it to say, \" sorry, i ' m wasting your time. \" after he got the part, ledger still struggled with what his agent calls a \" crisis of confidence. \" such self-doubt continued to plague him: \" he almost pulled out of every movie he ended up doing, \" his agent says. He hated having to \" sell \" his movies. His agent recalls that he got increasingly uncomfortable while doing interviews for a knight's tale. Once, \" he was getting very uncomfortable and fidgeting; he finally whispered to me that he needed to leave and get out of the room for a second. \" he turned down the lead role in sam raimi's spider-man. \" he said,'that makes no sense for me, i can't possibly be peter parker, ' \" his agent recalls. The role eventually went to tobey maguire. He played chess almost every day. His father says he was only a few points away from grandmaster status. His attraction to michelle williams was obvious right away. She twisted her knee her first day shooting brokeback mountain, and ledger held her hand all the way to the hospital. He \" tried to comfort her and it was pretty obvious he was interested in her, \" recalls director ang lee. He constantly licked his lips while playing the joker in order to keep his lip prosthetics from falling off. Though the tic ended up adding to the villain's terrifying nature, ledger originally did all that licking to avoid having to spend more time in the makeup chair; the lip prosthetics he wore loosened as he talked.",

Now researchers report in the journal nature ecology &amp; evolution that \" positional bias \" is in fact observed in multiple mammal species, and they say the reason for it is likely neurological, as the bbc reports. Turns out that this positioning on the left activates the brain's right hemisphere, responsible for processing social activities like communication and bonding. \" we suggest that this bias is even more widespread and may be a characteristic of all mammals, with few exceptions, \" one researcher says. Studying wild animals — including horses, walruses, reindeer, sheep, and kangaroos — the team also found a \" positional bias, \" but it varied depending on the situation. They found, for example, that young animals tend to keep their mothers on their left and watch her with mainly their left eye. In dangerous situations, however, the mothers would swap spots to keep their young on their left for better monitoring, reports new scientist. The scientists recorded nearly 11,000 position choices across 175 pairs of infants and mothers. That the positional bias is so widespread among mammals suggests, as one researcher puts it, that the mechanism is \" ancient and really basic. \" meanwhile, the orange county register reports on a thrilling drone sighting of a mother and calf whale migrating south — with predictable positioning.

Advertisement in mammals, the brain's right hemisphere is responsible for processing social cues and building relationships. It is also the half of the brain that receives signals from the left eye. Some researchers think this explains why human and ape mothers tend to cradle their babies on the left: it is so they can better monitor their facial expressions with their left eye.

The baby – thought to be just days old – suddenly veered away from its mother and headed toward whale watchers on sunday afternoon. \"they're coming right toward us, guys, \" said girardeau, a photographer who frequents whale-watching charters to capture footage of creatures in the wild. \"wait, the baby just split up, the baby is coming straight toward us! oh, wow.

            "Stefanie neumann/plainpicture mothers hold their children more on the left and wild mammals seem to keep their young more on that side too, at least when fleeing predators. Now it seems many mammal babies prefer to approach their mother from one side too – and the explanation may lie in the contrasting talents of each half of the brain. Advertisement in mammals, the brain's right hemisphere is responsible for processing social cues and building relationships. It is also the half of the brain that receives signals from the left eye. Some researchers think this explains why human and ape mothers tend to cradle their babies on the left: it is so they can better monitor their facial expressions with their left eye.

Thus vinson, 26 and also black, acted lawfully when he shot scott, murray said, per usa today.

Murray added that speculation scott was holding a book, not a gun, proved to be false. \" a reading book was not found in the front or back seats of mr.

Charlotte saw rioting, violence, and protests in the days following scott's death, and police are on alert for community reaction to the announcement that no charges will be filed. Scott, a convicted felon who suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2015, was seen allegedly rolling marijuana in his suv when police officers were attempting to serve an arrest warrant on an unrelated suspect.

Now, 39 years since the state's eugenics program ended in 1974, it will finally make reparations, with lawmakers earmarking $ 10 million to compensate victims, reports the wall street journal. \" no amount that we can afford to pay is enough, \" says a state lawmaker. \" but this is sufficient for the living victims to know that the state of north carolina sincerely regrets the injustice that we've done to them. \" the state has only identified 177 victims of the program so far. It estimates three-quarters of those sterilized are now dead, and others are difficult to track down due to incomplete records, name changes, and marriages. Part of the $ 10 million will go to the administrative costs of tracking down more victims. North carolina was just one of 33 states with eugenics programs, reports cnn. More than 60,000 people across the country were forcibly sterilized last century — 20,000 in california alone. But north carolina will be the first state to compensate its victims. \" the money don't take up the place of what happened, \" says one man, now 80, who was sterilized at age 14, per the journal. \" i ' m glad they did something, though. \"",

        "summary": "The world's eyes are on hamburg, where g20 leaders are meeting — and where vladimir putin and president trump shook hands for the first time friday. The two will hold a much-anticipated one-on-one meeting later in the day. Trump tweeted early friday that he is looking forward to all his meetings with world leaders and he has \" much to discuss \" with putin. Officials say the men will meet for around an hour friday afternoon. A roundup of coverage: cnn lists five things to look out for including optics and body language — the things that tend to define a meeting like this, most of which is expected to be off-limits to the press. The handshake will be \" over-analyzed for weeks, \" cnn predicts. The bbc looks at the issues putin and trump have staked out different views on in recent weeks, including ukraine and the paris climate deal, and notes that the russian media are not expecting much from the meeting. Analysts tell the new york times that the meeting looks like a \" win-win situation \" for putin. If little comes of it, russia can claim that trump is weak and unable to act because of problems in the us. But if deals emerge, putin will be able to take credit for rebuilding the relationship despite issues including alleged election interference. The kremlin says one issue that will definitely be raised is the return of two diplomatic compounds in the us seized in the final weeks of the obama administration as payback for election meddling and other issues, reports the washington post. The white house declined to comment on what trump might ask of putin, though secretary of state rex tillerson says trump wants to discuss syria and possible areas of cooperation \" including no-fly zones, on-the-ground ceasefire observers, and coordinated delivery of humanitarian assistance, \" reports reuters. Trump's critics say they worry trump will be at a major disadvantage because of his lack of political experience compared to putin, the telegraph reports. \" there's nothing... The kremlin would like to see more than a president who will settle for a grip and a grin and walk away saying that he had this fabulous meeting with the kremlin autocrat, \" says democratic rep. Adam schiff. The guardian reports that ahead of friday's meetings, there have been massive protests in hamburg, with more than 100 police officers injured and at least 40 people arrested.",

You had one job, law writers: on scotusblog, lyle denniston writes that \" the one negative note in the roberts opinion, and he repeated it in several different ways in announcing the decision orally, was a complaint that congress had done a rather sloppy job of composing the aca, making it very difficult for the courts to make sense of all of it. \" oh, save it: at hot air, conservative blogger allahpundit, no fan of obamacare, is feeling fatalistic and rolls his eyes at the typical gop reaction, like this from jeb bush. \" honestly, at this point, i'd prefer that our candidates simply admit defeat than feed me more lies about how we're going to repeal and replace obamacare once the gop is back in the white house. \" hillary's all set: chris cillizza at the washington post observes that hillary clinton now has a pat answer when obamacare comes up. She can \" make the very strong case that the law has been fought judicially, legislatively, and through campaigns and, in each instance, has survived those challenges.'this is old news, ' you can hear clinton saying.'the affordable care act is the the law of the land.

Chism has been held without bail since shortly after the oct. 22 slaying of 24-year-old colleen ritzer, whose body was found behind danvers high school. He was indicted thursday on charges of murder, aggravated sexual assault, and armed robbery. Authorities say he sexually assaulted ritzer with an object before killing and robbing her. \" the indictments returned today detail horrific and unspeakable acts, \" essex county district attorney jonathan blodgett said. The indictment says chism, armed with a box"

        "summary": "A texas couple is suing apple, claiming its facetime app is responsible for the death of their 5-year-old daughter. James and bethany modisette say apple was granted a patent in 2014 for a facetime design that would've used gps tracking to determine speed of travel to prevent people from using the app while driving, reports courthouse news. Yet apple never implemented the design, nor did it strongly warn drivers against using the app, per the lawsuit filed friday. As a result, garrett wilhelm, 22, was able to use facetime while driving 65mph on interstate 35 near dallas on christmas eve in 2014, when he slammed into the back of the modisettes'vehicle, which had slowed with other vehicles because of a traffic accident, say police. Wilhelm's vehicle rolled \" up and over the driver's side of the modisette car, \" the lawsuit states. Driver james and 5-year-old moriah, seated behind him, were both critically injured. James, bethany, and 8-year-old daughter isabella were taken by ambulance to denton regional medical center, along with wilhelm, while moriah was airlifted to cook children's medical center in fort worth, where she died of her injuries, reports the denton record-chronicle. Wilhelm — whose facetime app was still active when officers arrived on the scene, say police — now faces a manslaughter charge. But apple's failures \" were a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs ' injuries and decedent's death, \" the lawsuit states. Apple has not responded.

Robert and michelle duchouquette of plano, texas, say they hired dallas ' prestigious pets to check in on their two dogs and fish while they took a trip to california. But a camera mounted on their fish bowl soon revealed their fish was being overfed and the water had turned cloudy. Upon the couple's return, michelle voiced this complaint ( \" the one star is for potentially harming my fish, otherwise it would have been 2 stars \" ) and others concerning the company's fees — including a $ 15 charge to get house keys returned — in a one-star yelp review posted oct. 28, reports cbs dfw. Prestigious pets posted a seemingly-friendly response and all seemed well — until the duchouquettes received a cease-and-desist letter. \" i was beyond shocked and a bit scared, \" michelle says. When she failed to take the review down, prestigious pets sued for $ 6,766, arguing the couple signed a contract with a non-disparagement clause barring customers from taking any negative action against the company, per consumerist. A lawyer says similar challenges have failed on the argument that the clauses violate free speech; they're illegal in california, and a federal ban is being considered. Prestigious pets admits \" a judge's decision may not even be in our favor. Or we may even choose not to follow through. We are honest people seeking protection from dishonest individuals, not other honest ones. \" ( this pet owner's reviews led to a $ 65,000 suit. )",

A black man has accused... ( associated press ) middletown, r.i. ( ap ) — a black man yelled at former white house press secretary sean spicer in a bookstore and accused spicer of calling him a racial slur when they were students at a prep school decades ago. Spicer was \" taken aback \" by the man's \" outrageous claim \" and had no recollection of him or of being in school with him, his publicist said on saturday. Spicer was at a book signing in middletown on friday to promote his new book reflecting on his time at the press podium for president donald trump. Alex lombard, who was standing behind a small group of people waiting in line to meet spicer and get him to sign the book, called out spicer's name and said they went to portsmouth abbey school together. Spicer waved to him and said, \" hey. Yeah. How are you? \" lombard, a newport native who now lives in cambridge, massachusetts, then accused spicer of calling him the n-word and trying to fight him when they were at school. \" you don't remember that you tried to fight me? \" lombard asked. \" but you called me a ( n-word ) first. \" a security guard approached lombard and led him away as he kept talking: \" i was 14 then.

        "summary": "Dr. Robert lustig previously argued that sugar is as bad as tobacco or cocaine. Now, he's advocating for a sugar tax in the guardian based on a new diet study of obese kids. Lustig and colleagues asked 43 black and hispanic children, aged 8 to 18 — each with symptoms of metabolic syndrome, which can lead to diabetes — about their eating habits and daily calorie intake, then created a nine-day menu with the same number of daily calories. In each case, researchers limited sugars to 10 % of those daily calories, down from an average 28 %, and substituted with starches, reports the wall street journal. \" everything got better, \" lustig tells time. Diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, and ldl cholesterol levels declined, per the new york times, fasting blood sugar levels dropped 53 % overall, kids showed less fat in their livers, and some switched from being \" insulin resistant \" to \" insulin sensitive. \" the reduction of foods with added sugar \" reversed virtually every aspect of their metabolic syndrome, \" says lustig. By replacing chicken teriyaki with turkey hot dogs and sweetened yogurt with bagels, \" we can turn a child's metabolic health around in 10 days without changing calories and without changing weight. \" that doesn't mean you or your kids should follow the study diet. \" we gave them crappy food... Processed food — and they still got better … that's the point, \" lustig says. Though lustig and his team told kids to eat more if they found they were losing weight, some lost weight anyway, reports time. That's something critics are focusing on, since weight loss can cause metabolic changes. \" we can't be completely certain that the changes are fully attributable to changes in sugar intake, \" one doctor says.

Seeing on tv the democratic party's chaotic convention in chicago — where a massive police force clashed with anti-war protesters — the president feared that delegates would reject his vietnam-war policy and chosen successor, hubert humphrey. So he called convention staff and discussed a plan to helicopter in and run for the nomination himself, the daily mail reports. But lbj scuttled the plan when the secret service said they might not be able protect him. A worthy side-note: johnson also called chicago mayor richard daley to congratulate him on his handling of the protesters, the bbc reports. The bbc details another story that got some press a few years ago — about johnson knowing of richard nixon's undermining of vietnam peace talks in 1968. But johnson kept quiet, fearing that it would lead to revelations that the fbi had been bugging the south vietnamese ambassador's phone, and cause a bigger national security scandal.",

The boys, ages 1 and 3, suffered non-life-threatening injuries. An hour earlier, around 7pm, the unidentified man had argued with his wife and threatened to hurt their children in pequannock before driving away with the two boys in a white suv, reports cbs new york. Police tracked the vehicle to the overpass on interstate 287 in wanaque township using the man's cellphone signal, but they found it empty, report abc 7 and nj.com. The man's body was then found beneath the overpass in a wooded area near the wanaque river. His children, found conscious, were taken to a hospital with concussions, per wpix. The youngest also suffered a bruised lung. A police officer says it's a \" miracle \" they survived at all, adding, \" i was expecting the worst outcome when i arrived at the scene, and i was amazed last night and even this morning on the condition of the children. \" they reportedly fell between 20 and 100 feet, per the washington post; the distance wasn't immediately clear in the dark.",

        "summary": "The holiday season kicked off with a bah-humbug bang this week with reports of an ambitious theft from a florida costco. Miami-dade police are trying to find two 53-foot semi-truck trailers crammed with 500 christmas trees each, taken sometime between 8pm and midnight tuesday from outside the kendall warehouse, the miami herald reports. The trailers themselves were worth $ 78,000 in total. \" they were brand new — 2015, \" frank ducassi, a rep for the refrigerated-truck company that delivered the trees, tells the paper. Conflicting media reports make it unclear whether the trees were worth $ 18,000 in total, as the herald reports, or if each trailer's haul was worth that much, putting the cost closer to $ 36,000 altogether. The fraser firs are sold right off the truck to customers for $ 30 each, and it's the only time all year that non-costco equipment stays on site overnight, a store gm tells the herald. A special pin lock is typically used to secure costco trailers so they can't be hauled off, which ducassi says he thinks was in the costco contract, but the store gm says he thought he only had to lock up the trailer doors. \" it's going to be a black eye for costco if they were supposed to secure the trailers and didn't, \" he tells the paper.

According to a year-old state investigation, in february 2016 the florida department of agriculture and consumer services stopped using a national database to approve such applications. The worker overseeing background checks, lisa wilde, couldn't log into the fbi's national instant criminal background check system — a problem that persisted until another employee noticed it in march 2017. The state has since fired wilde and says any improper applications from that time were revoked. Wilde did report the log-in failure, investigators say, but failed to follow up. Agriculture commissioner adam putnam, a strongly pro-nra republican running for governor, released a statement calling wilde \" deceitful and negligent \" and said that 365 applications requiring further review from that time \" resulted in 291 revocations. \" but the florida democratic party is accusing putnam of \" gross mismanagement \" that likely \" put the lives of thousands of floridians at risk, \" quotes the orlando weekly. The background-check bungle coincided with the pulse nightclub shooting, which took 50 lives, and a historic uptick in florida concealed-weapons applications.
