        "summary": "A babysitter in south carolina has confessed to physically abusing a 7-month-old boy in her care — and the child's parents give credit to the loyal family dog. As wcsc explains, they grew suspicious when their otherwise mellow dog, killian, started routinely growling at the family's 21-year-old babysitter and standing between her and the child. The parents placed an iphone under the couch one day to record audio: \" it started with cussing, \" says dad benjamin jordan. \" then you hear slap noises and his crying changes from a distress cry to a pain cry. \" they got young finn checked out at the hospital ( he's fine ), then turned the recording over to charleston police, who secured a confession from alexis khan, reports abc news. She pleaded guilty last monday to assault and battery, will serve 1 to 3 years in jail, and will be placed on a registry to keep her from working with kids ever again. She had worked as finn's babysitter for five months. \"who knows how many children she has abused or how many more she would have had it not been for our dog, \" says jordan.",

        "summary": "A lost memory may not be lost for good. That's the takeaway from a \" radical \" new study that's transforming how scientists view long-term memory and giving hope to early alzheimer's patients. Many neuroscientists have long-believed that memories are held in the connections between brain cells, known as synapses, which are degraded by alzheimer's disease. But new research out of ucla has turned that idea on its head, eurekalert reports. It offers evidence that long-term memory is actually stored elsewhere and, most importantly, \" the nervous system appears to be able to regenerate lost synaptic connections, \" a study author says. He adds it's \" possible \" that a lost memory will resurface \" if you can restore the synaptic connections. \" researchers base this conclusion on a study of the aplysia marine snail, which has cellular and molecular processes similar to humans. In experiments with the snail, as well as neurons in a petri dish, researchers found synapses to be crucial in the creation of memories, but not in their storage. In fact, attempts to disrupt synaptic function with protein inhibitors left long-term memories intact, upi reports. The study author guesses memories are stored \" in the nucleus of the neurons. We haven't proved that, though, \" he says. If he's correct, \" as long as the neurons are still alive, the memory will still be there, which means you may be able to recover some of the lost memories in the early stages of alzheimer's. \" in the later stages of the disease, unfortunately, neurons do die.

        "summary": "If you thought pg-13 movies were less violent than r-rated flicks, think again. More gun violence plays out on the big screen in movies open to all ages than in r-rated box office blockbusters, reports fastco.exist. Researchers found that gun violence in pg-13 action movies is on the rise with hollywood increasingly relying on shoot- ' em-up scenes to fill seats. Building on an earlier study, they sampled 30 top-grossing films between 2012 and 2015 to determine the number of five-minute segments in which a character fires a gun at someone. Writing in the journal pediatrics, they report the rate of gun violence in pg-13 movies in 2012 equaled that of r-rated films, restricted to 17 and older, and outpaced those films in later years. Kids of all ages are allowed into cinemas showing pg-13 movies, though parents are \" strongly cautioned. \" some of the most violent pg-13 films were some of the most popular like 2015's star wars: the force awakens. \" ( see the full list here. ) of note: the authors say films often remove the consequences of gunplay. Thus, children and their parents are being \" desensitized \" to these effects, they contend, comparing on-screen bloodshed to behaviors like smoking and drinking that can young people often imitate. Previous research has shown that repeated exposure to violence on screen can make kids more aggressive. \" we know less about the potential effects of films that glorify the use of guns, \" the authors write. Until more is known, they say, pediatricians should advise parents \" to be cautious about exposing their children \" to violent films. ( violent superheroes can make kids more aggressive. )",

Men who entered into fatherhood at around age 25 saw a 68 % increase of depressive symptoms over their first five years of being dads — if they lived at the same home as their children. The study, which was published in the journal pediatrics, looked at 10,623 young men who were participating in the national longitudinal study of adolescent health.

The south china morning post describes one delivered by one journalist to another as the \" country's biggest political event of the year. \" the new york times sees it as a \" rare puncturing of the artifice \" surrounding the ongoing national people's congress. You can watch it in this clip. A reporter in red begins posing a long-winded softball question to a government minister, and a fellow reporter in blue can't contain her disdain as the question nears the 40-second mark. She turns and gives her colleague a withering look, followed by the eye roll, which was captured by national news broadcaster cctv. It went viral quickly, spreading across chinese social media until government censors began blocking searches. The washington post manages to identify the women. The reporter in red is zhang huijun of american multimedia television, which is based in california but affiliated with the state-owned cctv. The woman in blue is liang xiangyi of yicai media, a financial news service, and her name soon became the most-censored term on social media site weibo, per the times. Despite the censorship, images riffing on the incident were proliferating. A translation of the boring-in-any-language question might help explain liang's frustration. \"the transformation of the responsibility of supervision for state assets is a topic of universal concern, \" zhang says. \" therefore, as the director of the state-owned assets supervision and administration commission of the state council, what new moves will you make in 2018? \" and on and on.",

At around 2,600 feet, the tunnel is the longest ever found along the california-mexico border, reports the san diego union-tribune. The unusually narrow tunnel is only about 3 feet wide, equipped with a rail system, lighting, and ventilation. It's the 13th sophisticated secret passage found along california's border since 2006. The tunnel is unusual because it was being used for cocaine, not just marijuana, laura duffy, us attorney for the southern district of california, told reporters on wednesday. Tunnels are often built for marijuana because its bulk and odor make it more difficult to escape border inspectors'scrutiny than cocaine and other drugs. The elevator, big enough for eight to 10 people, is located in the closet of a tijuana house. The tunnel zig-zags to the fenced commercial lot in san diego, where the exit was covered by a large trash bin. Other tunnels that have ended in california were inside houses and warehouses. \" it's a rabbit hole, \" duffy said. \" just the whole way that it comes up and that it comes up out right into the open, it is a bit ingenious, i think, and it's something completely different than what we've seen. \" ( an alaska fugitive was found in an elaborate tunnel system under a trailer park. )",

And a 68-year-old california raisin farmer has spent the last 11 years fighting it. The washington post reports the very unusual and very fascinating story of marvin horne, who it dubs the greatest \" outlaw... In the world of dried fruit. \" for more than a decade, horne has been defying a truman-era regulation that for the past 64 years has given the usda the ability to seize a portion of farmers ' raisin crops if it believes supply will outpace demand; the fruit is deposited in locations around california, where it can be sold to foreigners, fed to cows, or just sit. And while the intention is to drive up the prices the remaining crop can fetch, the feds often don't pay the farmers for what they do take ( revenue from overseas sales goes first to storage, related salaries, and the promotion of raisins ). In 2002, horne had had enough, and stopped complying. He has since racked up $ 650,000 in fines, logged 1.2 million pounds of unpaid raisins, and notched himself one supreme court decision. The court last month ruled that a lower court has to decide whether marketing order 989 is constitutional. ( the wall street journal has a good succinct recap of the legal wranglings here. ) the post piece is full of colorful lines from horne, among them: \" the hell with the whole mess.... It's like being a serf.... You have heard of the rape of the sabine women? this is even worse. \" the post has more on his ordeal, which included private eyes staking out his farm.

The washington post reports there's been a recent uptick in various media — including jezebel and elle — and on facebook and twitter covering the option of long-term intrauterine devices, or iuds, as well as implanted contraception rods, so \" women can keep their uteruses as vacant as antonin scalia's supreme court seat, \" writes erin gloria ryan at the daily beast. \" i recommend the iud right now especially because it's long term, which with 20 million-plus americans potentially losing their health insurance and potentially right to an abortion, is important, \" writer sophia benoit tells the intercept. Iuds ( which can last for up to a decade ) and hormonal implants have a high success rate in preventing pregnancy, per the cdc. While trump hasn't actually turned his sights on banning birth control, he has curried favor with pro-life groups by promising to defund planned parenthood, which offers birth control. He's also threatened to repeal obamacare, which currently requires certain contraception to be covered by most health insurance plans. Advocates ' hopes aren't high on the contraceptive front from vice president-elect mike pence, either, who ryan notes \" during his tenure as governor of indiana \" has made \" birth control a lot more difficult for women to access. \" \" in a world where reproductive rights already seem too fragile, this is a huge blow, \" writer rosa schwartzburg tells the intercept.

In a bizarre case, anchorage police say there indeed appeared to be a plot among the students to harm a classmate at the school last week. The substance the children planned to use as a poison, silica gel, is generally considered to be non-toxic but the students believed it was harmful, according to a letter the school sent to parents. Jennifer castro, spokeswoman for apd, says a fellow student alerted adults when he or she learned of the plan. \" we're grateful that that student was able to speak up and obviously at such a young age, \" castro said. Parents of first-grade students received an email from the school principal notifying them of the incident on march 22. It says, in part, \" three students in the class were planning on using the silica gel packets ( these are not actually poison, but the students believed they were ) from their lunchtime seaweed to poison and kill another student. \" the plot was never put into action according to castro. A school resource officer responded to the school and investigated the case. \" the important lesson",

One topic over which the two may bond: fighting terrorism, which modi addressed un a speech sunday to members of the indian diaspora in virginia.

Although estes, 60, beat thompson 53 % to 46 %, that seven-point margin was substantially slimmer than the 27-point lead donald trump enjoyed when he won that district himself — a \" sharp turnaround \" triggered by an \" energized democratic base, \" politico notes. Thompson says he's going to vie for the seat again in 2018. It was a surprisingly close outcome for a race that the new york times notes wasn't even on most people's radar until the last week or so. Estes will fill the seat vacated by mike pompeo to become cia director. While the gop may now be warily eyeing 2018 races, others says special elections aren't always indicative of larger trends. \" i would not say this is any kind of referendum on donald trump, \" kelly arnold, kansas ' gop chair, said before tuesday's vote. But thompson seemed cheery even in defeat. \" mr. Estes did not beat us, \" he said. \" it took a president of the united states, the vice president, the speaker of the house, a senator coming into our state, and a bunch of lies to try to drum up a vote. \" for his part, estes crowed at his victory speech late tuesday: \" the pundits were talking about — this wasn't a seat we were going to win, \" he said. \" we really showed the pundits tonight, didn't we? \" the ap notes the next special election, to be held in georgia on april 18 to fill the seat left open by hhs secretary tom price, may be \" tougher \" to win.",

Marco rubio dropped his support for the pipa bill he co-sponsored and he was joined by 17 others, including six co-sponsors, leaving the bill's supporters without a majority, gizmodo reports. More than a dozen former backers of the house's sopa also announced their opposition. As pipa and sopa took a beating, rep. Darrell issa and sen. Ron wyden sought support for their alternative anti-piracy bill, dubbed the open act, reports the seattle times. The bill would have the quasi-governmental international trade commission — which already investigates counterfeit imports — handle rogue overseas websites instead of the justice department. Its backers say it avoids potential internet censorship, but the entertainment industry and other sopa/pipa supporters say it doesn't go far enough to tackle piracy.",

The filing follow years of bad news for the company, which had been struggling with huge debts, falling sales, and major losses. Its share price has gone from a high of around $ 141 in early 2007 to less than 50 cents today.

Sears once dominated the american retail landscape.

The operator of sears and kmart stores joins a growing list of retailers that have filed for bankruptcy or liquidated in the last few years amid a fiercely competitive climate. Some like payless shoesource have had success emerging from reorganization in bankruptcy court but plenty of others haven't, like toys r us and bon-ton stores inc.

The filing in federal bankruptcy court in new york came in the early hours of monday morning. The company issued a statement saying it intends to stay in business, keeping open stores that are profitable, along with the sears and kmart websites. As of the filing, about 700 stores remained open and the company employed 68,000 workers. That's down from 1,000 stores with 89,000 employees that it had as recently as february. But sears said that it's looking for a buyer for a large number of its remaining stores, and it will close at least 142 stores near the end of this year. That's in addition to the 46 store closings already planned for next month. The company did not rule out additional store closings as the bankruptcy process proceeds.

Sears has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy... ( associated press ) new york ( ap ) — sears has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, buckling under its massive debt load and staggering losses. Sears once dominated the american retail landscape. But the big question is whether the shrunken version of itself can be viable or will it be forced to go out of business, closing the final chapter for an iconic name that originated more than a century ago. The company, which started out as a mail order catalog in the 1880s, has been on a slow march toward extinction as it lagged far behind its peers and has incurred massive losses over the years. The operator of sears and kmart stores joins a growing list of retailers that have filed for bankruptcy or liquidated in the last few years amid a fiercely competitive climate. Some like payless shoesource have had success emerging from reorganization in bankruptcy court but plenty of others haven't, like toys r us and bon-ton stores inc. Both retailers were forced to shutter their operations this year soon after a chapter 11 filing. \" this is a company that in the 1950s stood like a colossus over",
            "New york ( cnn business ) sears, the once-dominant retail chain that changed how americans shopped and lived, has filed for bankruptcy. Sears holdings ( shld ), the parent company of sears and kmart, is among dozens of prominent retailers to declare bankruptcy in the era of amazon ( amzn ). The filing in federal bankruptcy court in new york came in the early hours of monday morning. The company issued a statement saying it intends to stay in business, keeping open stores that are profitable, along with the sears and kmart websites. As of the filing, about 700 stores remained open and the company employed 68,000 workers. That's down from 1,000 stores with 89,000 employees that it had as recently as february. But sears said that it's looking for a buyer for a large number of its remaining stores, and it will close at least 142 stores near the end of this year. That's in addition to the 46 store closings already planned for next month. The company did not rule out additional store closings as the bankruptcy process proceeds. Eddie lampert, the company's chairman and largest shareholder, gave up the title of ceo. The company will now be run by three of the company's top executives. For years, lampert has claimed the company was making progress"

That's the upshot of a new study in the british medical journal that tracked the eating habits of 180,000 subjects over nearly 30 years. The simplified findings: those who ate five servings of whole blueberries a week had a 26 % lower risk of contracting type 2 diabetes, reports the new york times. Grapes and apples also did well, followed by prunes, pears, bananas, and grapefruit. Other fruits didn't seem to have much of an effect in terms of diabetes. One striking part of the study is that fruit juice might actually raise the risk for the disease, notes national geographic. That's probably in part because dietary fiber and nutrients are lost in the juicing process, explains bloomberg. So are blueberries a silver bullet? not even close. \"we don't want to leave the impression that there's any magical fruit, \" says a co-author of the study, per the boston globe. And, he adds, no amount of blueberries in the world will compensate for things like a lack of exercise, an otherwise lousy diet, or a pack of smokes.

The child's frozen corpse was found in 1985 on aconcagua, the tallest mountain beyond asia. Science explains that the elevation and dryness gave modern-day researchers hope — followed by confirmation — there was recoverable dna. They biopsied a 350-milligram sample from the boy's lung and found that the boy's mitochondrial genome — that's the 37 genes that specifically pass from mother to child — placed him \" perfectly \" within the genetic population c1b that is typical of native americans and that ultimately appears to come from beringia ( the land mass they crossed from siberia to alaska ). But science explains there are many subgroups within c1b, and the boy belonged to none of them. Researchers, who wrote in the journal scientific reports that their \" main aim [ was ] to shed light on the genetic variation existing at the time, \" slotted him in the new subgroup c1bi ( for inca ). They ran his dna through a genetic database and found only four matches, reports the guardian: three people in peru and bolivia and one ancient member of the wari empire, which flourished before the inca in peru. While there's scant sign of c1bi now, the confirmation of two ancient c1bi samples suggests it may have been far more common, with a geneticist not involved in the study pointing out that as little as 10 % of the native population survived after the spanish reached their lands. What we have here is as if \" the inca put genetic samples in deep freeze for us, \" an archaeologist tells science. The researchers are now working on the boy's nuclear genome, which hails from both parents. ( the incas may have done this to their child-sacrifice victims first. )",

The canadian embassy in washington also rush-ordered a $ 110 cut-out of trudeau ahead of canada day celebrations last year.

A conservative mp has used the opportunity to compare trudeau to a cut-out, noting his \" shallow façade, \" while a party spokesman argues the \" canadian brand is much more than the prime minister. \" global affairs canada, however, gave no reason for its order to abandon the trudeau cut-outs, which can still be purchased by anyone at historicalcutouts.com.

Huge orange-clad crowds gathered in the dutch capital to say farewell to the popular queen and celebrate the annual queen's day holiday, which will be king's day next year, the bbc reports. Crowds watched giant screens in the city's dam square outside the palace as beatrix, willem-alexander, and his argentine-born wife signed the papers before emerging on a palace balcony, followed by the couple's three young daughters. The new king and queen's eldest daughter, catharina-amalia, is now princess of orange and next in line for the throne. Willem-alexander — who says he wants to be \" a king that can bring society together \" — was later inaugurated in a ceremony attended by royal guests from 18 countries, though it wasn't a crowning. \" a dutch monarch is never crowned, \" the guardian explains. \" it's not a coronation.

        "summary": "A biologist in germany is ready to revolutionize caviar, and her plan could save fish lives even as it cuts costs for consumers. Caviar comes from sturgeon — \" an animal as old as dinosaurs, today nearly extinguished from its natural habitats, \" as dr. Angela köhler's company puts it. And traditionally, getting at the eggs requires killing the fish, she tells civil eats. That fish could be decades old, the smithsonian notes. \" it doesn't make much sense to take a fish that needs seven or eight years to mature and then, when it has its first eggs, kill it, \" köhler says, via npr. The solution? a high-tech system that involves massaging the eggs out of the fish, resulting in \" correct caviar. \" when an ultrasound shows a sturgeon's eggs are ready for harvest, the fish receives a labor-inducing protein; then, the massaging begins. Köhler believes the german farm using the system, called vivace gmbh, could ultimately produce some 10 tons of caviar every year. If the procedure is widely adopted, prices could drop to $ 20 an ounce from the current $ 105 per ounce for conventional caviar, she estimates. But npr offers some caveats: it finds that the resulting caviar's taste doesn't match the traditional stuff. What's more, asks a sturgeon farmer, \" why would producers of caviar want prices to continue to drop? \" ( meanwhile, in california, efforts to save another type of fish is killing... Farmland. )",

But scientists in new zealand got to work with more than just poster board; they used fancy cameras and software to study the way cheeses behave when cooked, and, in the journal of food science, called their paper \" quantification of pizza baking properties of different cheeses, and their correlation with cheese functionality. \" mozzarella, it turns out, is very elastic because it is made from fresh curds that are stretched and molded repeatedly. This elasticity allows bubbles to grow very large before bursting, and oil slides off those bubbles, allowing the tops of the cheese to brown. Other findings in the name of science: while cheddar lacks that stretch factor, it does brown evenly, whereas gruyere bubbles great but doesn't brown well. \" when we understand food right down to its micro-structural level, it gives us the levers we need to change the way it behaves, \" one researcher tells npr, adding that this kind of investigation could lead to all sorts of little improvements in cooking, such as, perhaps, the development of a low-fat cheese that's just as tasty on pizza.

        "summary": "How big could a potential new drug for huntington's disease be? the bbc puts it this way: \" experts say it could be the biggest breakthrough in neurodegenerative diseases for 50 years. \" the news is preliminary — full trial results should be published in 2018 — but early indications are good. As the guardian explains, the only currently available treatments address solely symptoms, allowing the disease to march on to its deadly conclusion, which can occur within a decade of diagnosis. But this drug, called ionis-httrx, appears to have slowed the progression. Cnn reports huntington's is caused by a single gene defect that causes cells to produce a toxic form of the huntingtin protein, which kills nerve cells in the brain. \" you end up in almost a vegetative state, \" says a trial participant. Ionis-httrx prevents the toxic protein from being made. Some 46 patients in the early stages of the disease participated in the uk trial and received four spinal injections — either the drug or a placebo — a month apart. Trial leader sarah tabrizi calls it \" probably the most significant moment in the history of huntington's since the gene [ was isolated ].... For the first time a drug has lowered the level of the toxic disease-causing protein in the nervous system, and the drug was safe and well-tolerated. \" but the trial needs to be bigger and longer, and that's what is happening next. If the findings are confirmed, tabrizi envisions a future where those with the gene take the drug in a preventative manner. But the implications could be even bigger: \" the drug's like lego, \" says a neurologist involved in the trial. \" you can target [ any protein ], \" meaning applications for diseases like alzheimer's may be possible.",

The company, which has 400 million customers, called on all countries to publish the number of warrants they have issued. Based on vodaphone's report, the guardian published a table showing how countries monitor customers: italy issued the most metadata warrants ( 605,601 ) and spain the most content warrants ( 24,212 ), but most countries blocked such information by law or vodaphone left it blank for other reasons ( like those governments report such data themselves or vodaphone can't uncover it ).

The \" mistake \" becker was accused of, per court documents: heading upstairs with the two 18-year-old female victims to go to sleep after the april 2 party ended, only for the women to wake up ( all three reportedly fell asleep on the same bed ) to find becker assaulting them with his finger. Per the police report, becker said he hadn't had sexual contact with one of the young women, and that the other teen hadn't stopped him, so he figured it was ok, wwlp reports. One of the victims told cops that she had heard rumors of becker — called \" david the rapist \" by some of her friends, she said — assaulting other women, claims that rooke tells the republican have been debunked. Thanks to his probation, rooke says becker can now lead a \" productive life without being burdened with the stigma \" of sex offender status and head to college.

Google is on the latter side, the journal notes, but the company says it has already received some 90,000 removal requests, sky news reports; it's agreed to more than half of them, it says. Requested removals range from embarrassing pictures to online bullying to criminal records, sky notes. Google's debate tour is hitting seven european capitals, starting with madrid today. Google's question, as the bbc reports: how \" one person's right to be forgotten should be balanced with the public's right to information. \" among its panelists are executive chair eric schmidt, wikipedia founder jimmy wales, a un human rights official, and the former head of spain's data protection body, reuters reports. A privacy leader in france has doubts about the tour, seeing a \" pr war, \" she tells reuters. \" google is trying to set the terms of the debate, \" she says. \" they want to be seen as being open and virtuous, but they handpicked the members of the council, will control who is in the audience and what comes out of the meetings. \" european officials are set to gather later this month to clarify \" right to be forgotten \" rules.",

In what the magazine calls a \" raw and real \" take, teigen reveals her experience after the april 2016 birth of her daughter, luna, whom teigen describes as \" perfect. \" \" i had everything i needed to be happy, \" teigen writes of the days following luna's arrival. \" and yet, for much of the last year, i felt unhappy. \" teigen talks about her initial reluctance to acknowledge or talk about the fact that she suffers from ppd, a jarring development after a \" wonderful, energetic pregnancy. \" after luna was born, teigen suddenly felt weepy, distant, and cranky, never wanting to leave the house and enduring intense back, wrist, and shoulder pain. It wasn't until december that a doctor finally diagnosed her, she started taking an antidepressant, and she came to terms with the fact that the condition can strike any new mom, regardless of her situation. She's also planning on starting therapy soon. \" i felt selfish, icky, and weird saying aloud that i ' m struggling. Sometimes i still do, \" teigen writes, adding that she knows how lucky she is to have the resources to deal with ppd that others may not. \" but postpartum does not discriminate. \" teigen's full take on her experience here, including the goofy thing legend has done to make her smile.

It's an inherent conflict of interest. \" trump also says curiel is a friend of one of the plaintiff's attorneys because they once worked together as federal prosecutors. But that attorney, jason forge, says he and curiel never met socially. \"neither judge curiel's ethnicity nor the fact that we crossed paths as prosecutors in the us attorney's office well over a decade ago \" is a factor, he says. Trump has thus far not taken any steps to try to have curiel tossed off the case, though he said he is keeping that option open. The journal and the washington post talk to a number of legal observers who say that while criticism of federal judges isn't unusual, it is so in this case given that trump is a presumptive presidential nominee and the attacks are so personal in nature. Curiel himself hasn't commented on trump's criticism, though his brother says he's \" taking it pretty much in stride. \" politico, meanwhile, calls out trump spokesperson katrina pierson for an apparent mistake after she noted that curiel belongs to the la raza lawyers association. \" this is an organization that has been out there organizing anti-trump protesters with the mexican flags, \" she said.

It's a convoluted tale, but the gist is that an arms dealer accused gingrich's wife at the time, marianne, of soliciting a multimillion-dollar bribe. In exchange, she would use her sway with newt to get the iraqi arms embargo lifted. Marianne gingrich says none of it is true, the arms dealer is now dead, and all this allegedly happened about 15 years ago. At hot air, ed morrissey accuses the post of a \" hit job \" on gingrich. \" so, let's get this straight. The fbi heard second- and third-hand that an arms dealer was bragging about having connections to gingrich, who would singlehandedly lift the arms embargo on saddam hussein's iraq... Because a ' cooperating witness'told them that he talked to someone who said he was acting on marianne gingrich's behalf. \" the fbi looked into it and passed \" because they had no evidence that gingrich even knew any of this was taking place. \" this, he concludes, is a \" non-story \" that would not have been published against a democratic candidate.

A 2014 deadline also came and went without a launch. Sixteen teams were still in the running until the end of last year, when only teams that had secured launch contracts for 2017 were allowed to move forward, geekwire reports. The five remaining teams have until dec. 31 of this year to launch their spacecrafts. The first team to get to the moon, travel at least 500 meters on its surface, and send back high-definition photos and live video will win $ 20 million, the verge reports. There's also a $ 5 million second-place prize and additional prizes for visiting historic sites, traveling long distances, and such. The five finalists are spaceil ( israel ), which wants to build excitement for space exploration; moon express ( us ), which wants to mine the moon for resources; synergy moon ( international collaboration ), which wants to make spaceflight more accessible; team indus ( india ); and hakuto ( japan ), which wants to explore lunar caves as possibilities for human habitats.

Meanwhile, new details are emerging about how samarin apparently fooled high school officials. \" it was not my idea, i just want to let you know it was not my idea, \" samarin tells whtm from dauphin county prison. He says his family was \" starving \" in ukraine and his mother and grandparents gave him the last of their money to start a new life in the us. He arrived in 2012 on a three-month exchange visitor visa, then received a tourist visa. When that expired, samarin — who dreamed of being a nasa researcher, per pennlive — says michael and stephayne potts helped him get a birth certificate and social security card with the name asher potts and a birth date in 1997, then adopted him. But they often threatened to call authorities, samarin says. It was \" pretty much like a slave driver system … i was afraid … so i was cleaning the toilet, i was cooking for them, i was doing everything. \" officials say an anonymous tip clued them in to the ruse on dec. 11. The caller said a man was attending high school illegally and \" having sexual relationships with female students. \" officials are still investigating, but more arrests are expected. As for whether samarin regrets the ruse, he says, \" no, i ' m not regretting doing it. I have spent all of my free time on education.... I tried to do better for the society. \"",

Asher potts must have seemed an academic prodigy. From the moment he enrolled at the high school in 2012 as a freshman, potts excelled at everything. He was a member of the national honor society, his grade point average consistently exceeding 4.0. His test scores were so high, he skewed the grading curve on tests - much to the chagrin of other fellow top performers. Potts had his sights set on earning a doctorate degree in aerospace engineering and becoming a nasa researcher. Embry-riddle aeronautical university in florida had accepted him into its college of engineering. Potts espoused his commitment to education. \" i will not give up, because education is a key to success, \" he wrote in an essay recently. \" the challenges are there for a reason. By overcoming them, we are getting stronger mentally and physically. I have learned that no one is going to do my job for me. \" outside the classroom, potts excelled with equal zeal and poise.

( whtm ) – twenty-three-year-old artur samarin, who posed as a harrisburg high school student since the fall of 2012, has now been charged with statutory sexual assault and corruption of minors. Police said he was having sexual relationships with female students while claiming to be an 18-year-old senior at the school. According to police, samarin had a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student in 2014 when he was 22 years old. Investigators said samarin was also a student at harrisburg university. Samarin, who went by the name \"asher potts, \" was arrested on tuesday and charged with false identification. He previously was facing identity theft and tampering with public records charges. According to police, samarin is a ukrainian immigrant. He graduated high school and attended two years of college there. Investigators said samarin arrived in the u.s. On a three-month exchange visitor visa and worked for a local company during that time. Police said after his visa expired, samarin received a tourist visa. The tourist visa expired march 1, 2013. Investigators said he used falsified documents to enroll at harrisburg high school, including a social security card that he received after going to several social security administration offices. Harrisburg police said they are still investigating with help from the u.s. Department of state, fbi, the ukrainian embassy, and u.s. Immigration and customs."

Uk intelligence reports say that president obama does not want any additional military actions before next november's elections, but that mounting worries over iran's nuclear programs and a new tehran belligerence could force action.

But the team's ship, the aurora, was blown out to sea in a blizzard, and the ten men had to survive together in a hut, reports huffington post. Three died before the aurora returned to rescue them in 1917 — including expedition photographer arnold smith, who likely snapped the photos. New zealand's antarctic heritage trust discovered his cellulose nitrate negatives in a box in the hut's darkroom, cnn reports.

There were 22 unexposed and unprocessed negatives which had been taken by the group's photographer. They were found in an old check-up hut preserved in a block of ice. Back in 1915, an ill-fated voyage which was called the ross sea party started out on the new zealand side of antarctica to try and launch supply depots for travelers coming to antarctica. But their ship ended up coming loose from the moorings it was attached to. This left the six men stranded and struggling just to survive. They would end up living over three years on the continent before they were ultimately rescued. Now, almost a century later, the discovery of the undeveloped photographs shows that the individuals might have left behind more than anyone knew. The amazing discovery was found by the new zealand antarctic heritage trust. They were in the process of working to refurbish one of the expedition's old living huts. The 22 negatives were most likely left there by the ross sea party, while they were stranded those years. The negatives were not in very good shape when they were first discovered, but a new zealand photography studio decided to take the time to carefully process and bring them back until they could reveal what was on them",

Crew members from the ill-fated 1915 antarctic expedition narrowly survived for more than three years after their ship, the aurora, drifted out to sea during a blizzard, leaving them stranded on ice and forced to inhabit an abandoned hut. No one has seen what those lost years were like, until now. New zealand's antarctic heritage trust has brought to life 22 unprocessed photographic negatives that miraculously survived in that hut for nearly 100 years. The images were released after painstaking restoration work. The negatives were found earlier this year by conservators who were working on a project to restore historic expedition sites in antarctica, specifically the supply huts used by the ross sea party. The box of negatives was discovered in a solid block of ice inside a photographer's darkroom at the base at cape evans where the members of the ross tea party took refuge, according to the antarctic heritage trust.

They would end up living over three years on the continent before they were ultimately rescued. Now, almost a century later, the discovery of the undeveloped photographs shows that the individuals might have left behind more than anyone knew. The amazing discovery was found by the new zealand antarctic heritage trust. They were in the process of working to refurbish one of the expedition's old living huts. The 22 negatives were most likely left there by the ross sea party, while they were stranded those years. The negatives were not in very good shape when they were first discovered, but a new zealand photography studio decided to take the time to carefully process and bring them back until they could reveal what was on them",
            "The story of the ross sea party is one of unlikely survival. Crew members from the ill-fated 1915 antarctic expedition narrowly survived for more than three years after their ship, the aurora, drifted out to sea during a blizzard, leaving them stranded on ice and forced to inhabit an abandoned hut. No one has seen what those lost years were like, until now. New zealand's antarctic heritage trust has brought to life 22 unprocessed photographic negatives that miraculously survived in that hut for nearly 100 years. The images were released after painstaking restoration work. The negatives were found earlier this year by conservators who were working on a project to restore historic expedition sites in antarctica, specifically the supply huts used by the ross sea party. The box of negatives was discovered in a solid block of ice inside a photographer's darkroom at the base at cape evans where the members of the ross tea party took refuge, according to the antarctic heritage trust. ( story continues below. ) one of the restored images taken from the deck of the aurora, looking south to hut point peninsula. The images, many of which were damaged around the edges, were brought back to new zealand and restored by photographic conservator mark strange, who separated and cleaned the frozen cellulose nitrate negatives, according to 3 news. \" it '"

One recent report found that 24 % of cities have banned panhandling altogether and 76 % forbid it in certain areas. Still, the practice is considered a safety issue, and berry, the city's first republican mayor in 30 years, said he began talking to the homeless about what to do about it. The city launched the program last september with a $ 50,000 grant to st. Martin's hospitality center, according to the blaze. A van recruits about 10 workers each day but could easily take more. So far, the program has doled out 932 jobs and cleared 69,601 pounds of weeds and garbage. And 100 people have found permanent jobs through the program. \"sometimes it takes a little catalyst in their lives to stop the downward spiral, to let them catch their breath, and it's remarkable, \" berry tells the post.",

The young nurse had been out with friends earlier in the evening, and a police spokesman tells abc news the crime is believed to be \" a very rare, random act of violence. \" cops think the suspect entered the building looking for unlocked apartment doors, was able to access ferguson's apartment, took some valuables and put them outside, and then returned to the apartment. \" the attack on ferguson is believed to have come during his reentry, \" police say. Police recovered a \" very sharp object, \" and are awaiting autopsy results. Molly cox tells abc that her sister was having trouble with the lock, which is likely why her door was unlocked.

He says he plans to share some more of his free meals with friends and family. But there's one other person he owes a burger first: the tattoo artist who made the whole thing possible. \" i ' m going to take a trip to san antonio and i ' m taking his whole tattoo shop to whataburger, \" the chronicle quotes miller as saying.

Document 3 also talks about Blake Miller winning the free Whataburger, his act of delivering meals to the homeless, and sharing the winnings with friends and family, which relates to the summary. However, Document 2 is not directly relevant to the summary as it provides general information about Whataburger, not focusing on Blake Miller, his tattoo, or his act of generosity. Therefore, the irrelevant document is: Document 2"
