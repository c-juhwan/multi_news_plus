        "summary": "Apparently firearms aren't all that go missing over at the atf: a justice department report says feds lost track of some 2.1 million packs of cigarettes, worth $ 127 million, from at least 20 undercover and unapproved stings between 2005 and 2011, the washington post reports. The $ 162 million garnered from the illegal transactions, or \" churning investigations, \" was used to offset the bureau's expenses as is allowed, but in one case, an informant kept $ 4.9 million of a $ 5.2 million payout without submitting proper paperwork. Even worse: none of the cases were approved by the atf's undercover review committee — it mysteriously didn't meet for almost seven years. Though not mentioned in the report, the milwaukee journal-sentinel details one 2011 sting where a pallet of cigarettes was left behind, and thieves swiped two cases of smokes worth about $ 10,000. The report cited \" a serious lack of oversight, \" plus funds spent in \" improper, unnecessary, and unreasonable \" ways, but the atf has come out swinging. A rep says the bureau's own \" more thorough \" audit shows just 447,218 cartons missing, and it has updated its policies to address the report's concerns. But for some, the \" disappointing report reiterates what we already know — that atf management continues to struggle with its day-to-day operations, \" says darrell issa, who calls the report \" unfathomable. \"",

        "summary": "It appears rayhaneh jabbari will not die today, but the 26-year-old iranian woman's plight continues to grab international headlines. Jabbari has been sentenced to death for the 2007 killing of a would-be rapist, and fox news yesterday reported that she managed to place a phone call to her mother saying she was being transported to rajaiy shahr prison where she would be hanged. Her mother now tells fox news that the execution has been delayed, as it previously was in april. Jabbari was at 19 convicted in the fatal stabbing of former iranian intelligence ministry worker morteza abdolali sarbandi and sentenced to death two years later, reports the independent. A petition aimed at saving her describes her version of the events: while at a coffee shop, sarbandi allegedly heard her talking about her work as a decorator and asked her to come to his office to discuss a renovation. She says he instead took her to a decrepit building, offered her a drink laced with a sedative ( human rights advocates say police testing confirmed this ), and tried to rape her. Using a small pocket knife, she stabbed him in the shoulder and left. He bled to death and she confessed to murder under duress. Amnesty international writes that jabbari did admit to stabbing sarbandi once, but she says a second man was in the building at the time and is the true killer. Her supporters point out that considering sarbandi's large size and the type of injury, her wound would not have done him in. ( meanwhile, iran last week executed a 37-year-old psychologist, in part because of his take on the story of jonah and the whale. )",

        "summary": "Amazon is so determined to get your order to you quickly, it wants to use drones — but it's also considering a decidedly more old-fashioned delivery method: taxis. In san francisco and la, the company recently tested using cabs as delivery vehicles, sources tell the wall street journal. Amazon partnered with flywheel, a mobile app used to hail cabs; the taxis were summoned to small distribution centers and loaded up with packages to be delivered within one hour, generally in the early morning, when drivers were less likely to have other fares ( or to be noticed delivering packages ). Amazon paid about $ 5 per package, and the cabs carried as many as 10 at a time, all to the same zip code, the sources say, adding that the effort could be broadened eventually. The move is just the latest attempt by amazon to stay on top of the delivery game: the company has also tested using its own delivery service and partnering with usps for sunday deliveries, among other things. Not only does amazon want to compete with physical stores — another recent experiment involved partnering with usps to deliver groceries — it also wants to come up with alternatives to fedex and ups after last year's christmas shipping delay debacle, the journal notes, and it likely wants to find ways to keep rising shipping costs down. One analyst says the company might be coming up with a \" same-day delivery algorithm \" that would be able to determine, in the moment, the fastest and cheapest of amazon's many available delivery services. As alissa walker notes on gizmodo, \" taxis sound low-tech but logistically they make sense. They're more direct than ups or fedex, and much cheaper than courier services. \" adds devindra hardawar on engadget, \" amazon will need as many methods as possible to make the dream of one-hour deliveries a reality. \" ( another amazon idea: shipping items before they're even ordered. )",

        "summary": "Authorities say they've found an islamic state flag in the home of the 17-year-old afghan migrant shot dead monday after slashing five people in germany. The hand-painted flag was found in the teen's room in his foster home in ochsenfurt, where he had only lived for two weeks, along with a text in pashtun showing the migrant may have been \" self-radicalized, \" says bavarian interior minister joachim herrmann. An isis-linked news agency describes the teen as an isis \" fighter \" who \" carried out the operation in answer to the calls to target the countries of the coalition fighting the islamic state, \" per the bbc. People who knew the teen — who arrived in germany about two years ago — say he was calm and quiet, visiting a mosque \" on special occasions, \" but never showed signs of radical behavior. Meanwhile, authorities say four victims of the attack are from hong kong, though it doesn't appear they were targeted for that reason. The south china morning post identifies the injured as a 62-year-old man; his 58-year-old wife; their 27-year-old daughter; and her boyfriend, 31. A source tells the paper that the men — both of whom are critically injured — tried to protect the women. Another witness adds the train compartment \" looked like a slaughterhouse. \" herrmann says the suspect — whom a witness reported hearing shout \" allahu akbar \" — fled the train in the town of heiligenfeld, attacked a local woman, then tried to assault police before he was killed, reports reuters. Though migrants arriving in germany have dwindled recently, the bbc notes the attack brought out \" racist and xenophobic comments against asylum seekers \" on twitter.",

A new study out of the university of florida suggests that rude parents can cause serious, even deadly, consequences. Researchers who staged emergency situations in a neonatal intensive care unit at an israeli hospital found that doctors and nurses performed significantly worse when confronted with an actress playing an angry mother. While there is much concern about medical errors, the third-leading cause of death in the us, medical professionals are \" not paying attention at all to the effect that social interactions can have on performance, \" co-author amir erez tells healthday. The new findings, he adds, \" could potentially save lives. \" in the study, four medical teams were assigned to treat infant dummies during day-long emergency situations including respiratory distress and shock. An actress playing a rude mom harangued three of the teams first thing in the morning, accusing them of doling out \" third world \" care and threatening to seek treatment elsewhere. The fourth team served as a control group and was spared the hostility. The teams exposed to rudeness underperformed in all of the study's 11 measures throughout the day. But researchers found they could \" immunize \" doctors to rudeness by prepping them ahead of time with computer games that desensitized them to sharp emotions. In the end, the lesson is that doctors and nurses are people, too, and find it harder to work when they're \" being emotionally attacked, \" says an american academy of pediatrics rep.

Now us and uk officials are saying that the hostages had been moved just days before the rescue attempt — and that the white house sat on intelligence about the hostages ' original location in syria for a month before acting, the daily beast reports. British sources say london had narrowed it down to two or three sites by the end of may, and had a \" positive identification \" in early june that was shared with the us, the beast reports; the rescue mission wasn't carried out until july 4. A us official acknowledges the white house did receive intelligence, but that it wasn't trusted because it was from a foreign source. A spokeswoman for the nsc tells the beast that \" us forces conducted this [ rescue ] operation as soon as the president and his national-security team were confident the mission could be carried out successfully. \" last august, nsc adviser ben rhodes insisted in a white house press briefing, \" we have done everything that we can possibly do to try to bring home our hostages. \" and in a buzzfeed interview this week, the president said that \" we... Always devote enormous resources to freeing captives or hostages anywhere in the world. I deployed an entire operation at significant risk to rescue not only [ mueller ], but the other individuals … and probably missed them by a day or two. \" but foley's mother, diane foley, long vocal about her displeasure over efforts to save her son, tells the beast that french officials reportedly had a location in march 2014. \" that's what's been so tough for us as families, because apparently they were held in the same place all those months. \"",

        "summary": "The saga of the django unchained actress who said she was handcuffed for kissing her white boyfriend is coming to an end. The brouhaha started in september, when officers confronted daniele watts and brian james lucas because someone called to complain that they were having sex in a parked car in la. Watts accused officers of racism and said they must have assumed the biracial couple was a prostitute and her client; cops said she was lying, and ultimately watts and lucas were charged with lewd conduct. They both ended up pleading no contest yesterday to \" disturbing the peace with loudness \" in exchange for those lewd conduct charges being dropped, the guardian reports. As part of the plea deal, they must apologize in writing to the officers watts accused of racial profiling, as well as the occupants of the building near where the incident occurred. They also got 40 hours of community service. Watts ' attorney says she will, indeed, apologize. Nbc news notes that she originally swore she never would, but her attorney now tells the ap that watts \" wishes she hadn't said some of the things she said \" to police. However, he adds, she is not admitting that she and lucas actually engaged in lewd conduct ( she initially said they were just kissing ).",

        "summary": "President trump might soften his stance on his media \" enemies \" after seeing their takes on his address to a joint session of congress on tuesday night. Trump has won praise for what is being widely described as his most presidential moment yet, an optimistic speech that used lofty rhetoric in a call to set aside \" trivial fights \" and unify for a \" new chapter of american greatness. \" a roundup of coverage: chris cillizza at the washington post rounds up winners and losers from the address. Winners, besides trump himself, include steve bannon and ivanka trump, whose influences on the speech were clear — bannon for the economic nationalism, and ivanka for the call to pass paid family leave. Losers include people hoping for trump's \" imminent demise. \" \" he's not going anywhere, folks, \" cillizza writes. \" and that speech suggests he might have more upside than almost anyone thought. \" cnn is among those praising the address for its statesmanlike and unifying tone, noting that it \" ticked almost all the boxes of a traditional state of the union style appearance. \" at the national review, rich lowry agrees that it was the \" best trump speech yet \" and praises him for delivering his core message in a way that was \" domesticated to the presidency, \" though he complains that there was \" zero social conservatism in the speech. \" the hill lists the takeaways from trump's speech, noting that while it was short on policy details, congressional republicans will be relieved that \" he set out clear objectives in a way that could boost his party's rank-and-file. \" the san francisco chronicle describes the tone as \" softer and unusually aspirational, \" though it notes that on issues like obamacare, there was no sign of bipartisan proposals to match trump's bipartisan language. It was presidential, but was it accurate? the new york times fact-checks the speech and takes issue with several of trump's claims, including the assertion that \" obamacare is collapsing. \" the times ' glenn thrush tweeted during the speech that unlike some trump speeches, it appeared to have been \" nominally fact-checked. \" politico looks at some of the things trump didn't mention during the speech, including russia, iraq, crowd sizes, and the \" dishonest media. \" the ap reports on the muted ways democrats registered their dissent during the address. There were some empty democratic seats, and house women wore suffragettes ' white in a show of support for women's issues.",

        "summary": "When americans heard that mitt romney pays a 15 % tax rate, most probably assumed that was less than they pay — and they're probably wrong. Romney, after all, wasn't talking about his tax bracket, but his effective tax rate, meaning what percentage of his income he actually winds up paying, usa today points out. The average american's effective federal tax rate is just 11 %, according to 2009 irs data, and if you make less than $ 50,000, that falls to 5 %. Yes, that's low — taxes are at a 40-year nadir, david leonhardt of the new york times points out. But most people think taxes are high, both because of weak wage growth and because they \" sense, and not incorrectly, that others are benefiting from tax breaks unavailable to them, \" he writes. The wealthy have seen their taxes fall the most, and they also benefit more from deductions. And then there's the fact that capital gains — which likely make up most of romney's income — are only taxed at 15 %, a part of the tax code that \" favors assets over wages, \" writes jared bernstein in the christian science monitor. \" i suspect few begrudge the wealth. What i think bothers people is the tax breaks on the wealth. \"",

            "Romney's 15 percent is the going rate on capital gains and dividends, which is where he gets the bulk of his income ( along with many others in the top income brackets ). This chart shows the distribution of \" capital gains \" income over different income levels. The top income levels have a much higher proportion of capital gains, which are taxed at a far lower rate than regular income. Republican candidate mitt romney believes his effective tax rate — the share of his income he pays in federal taxes is around 15 %, or, as he put it, \"probably closer to the 15 percent rate than anything. \" 15 % is the current rate on capital gains and dividends, which presumably comprise most of his income. The figure below, using data recently released by the tax policy center, shows who mostly gets this type of income. To be clear, this is not yet the \"bitter politics of envy \" … so far, it's just numbers. Ordinary income, like paychecks, is taxed at a top rate of 35 %, going to about 40 % if the sun should ever set on the highend bush cuts. The average effective rate for federal taxes these days is around 20 %, about five points higher than mitt's. Basically, he's paying what a middle class family — average income, around $ 65k, pays in federal taxes. Is this a problem? well, the fact that our tax code favors assets over wages is one factor behind the rise in income inequality. It's also one reason we're starved for revenues — this new report from the joint committee on taxation shows that the favorable treatment of cap gains and dividends will cost the treasury about $ 450 billion between 2011 and 2015 ( that's the whole american jobs act, right there! ). Then there's basic fairness … ( whoops, straying from the numbers! ) and for what? the evidence doesn't support the view that favoring asset-based income raises investment, productivity, or job growth. Frankly, i doubt many people are envious about the above. I suspect few begrudge the wealth. What i think bothers people is the tax breaks on the wealth. And that's more anger and disgust than envy.

Thanks to an agreement between the us and mexico, water from the river has reached the sea of cortez in northwestern mexico for the first time since either 1998 ( according to national geographic ) or 1993 ( according to ap ). Either way, it's been a long time, and conservationists hope last week's milestone becomes a regular occurrence. The water was released in march from the morelos dam near the us-mexico border, and it took about 8 weeks to complete the journey to the sea. The idea is to restore life to the colorado river delta, which has pretty much dried up since the advent of the big-dam era. In fact, the experiment is the first time water from the river has been diverted solely for environmental purposes, reports arizona public media. While the initial \" pulse flow \" is now shut off, smaller amounts of water will be released to the delta over the next few years, and conservationists think it can revive the dormant habitat.

Speaking at a wednesday custody hearing regarding sini and wesley mathews ' biological daughter, dr. Suzanne dakil said she examined sherin in march and found her to have bone fractures in her arms and legs, and they were inconsistent with her parents ' various explanations, including that her sister had pushed her off a couch. Dakil said she called cps to warn of possible abuse by the parents who adopted the girl from india in 2016. Why no action was taken is now under investigation. A day before sherin is believed to have died, police say her parents left her home alone while they went to dinner with their biological daughter, also 3, who is now living with relatives. Sini mathews is charged with abandoning or endangering a child based on that allegation. Wesley mathews faces the more serious charge of felony injury to a child after police say he admitted sherin died while he \" physically assisted \" her in drinking milk on oct. 7. He later admitted to dumping her body in a culvert less than a mile from the family's home, where she was found more than two weeks later, police say.

        "summary": "An american-iranian man was among a group of environmentalists detained in iran last month during efforts to foil a protest, bringing the number of us citizens held in the country to at least five, family members and human rights groups say. Morad tahbaz of the persian heritage wildlife association — which protects at-risk animals, per reuters — was taken to evin prison in late january at the same time as canadian-iranian kavous seyed emami, who died there, reports the wall street journal. Iranian officials say 63-year-old seyed emami hanged himself, though family members are doubtful. This and the continued detention of 81-year-old american-iranian baquer namazi — against the advice of iran's medical examiner and following two hospitalizations in two weeks — raises fears for tahbaz as the us state department works to confirm his arrest. While the department calls \" for the immediate release of all us citizens unjustly detained \" in the country, iran has refused to release namazi on humanitarian grounds, even as his family claims \" he could die at any time, \" per abc news. Namazi was detained in 2016 while trying to procure the release of his son, 46-year-old siamak namazi, also a us citizen, per the journal. Both were convicted of spying for the us, as was xiyue wang. Another american, karan vafadari, was sentenced in january to 27 years in prison. Tahbaz's detention puts increased pressure on the trump administration, which has been unsuccessful at establishing a direct channel with iran to negotiate prisoner releases. Us officials have tried four times since december but received no response, reports the journal.

Scientists reviewed data in which subjects slept in a darkened room where they couldn't see the moon.

But most of the hacked accounts ( 339 million ) were from adultfriendfinder. The data includes names, email addresses, and passwords — a mix of encrypted and plain text versions. Security researchers were able to unscramble 99 % of the leaked passwords. Friend finder network has not acknowledged the breach, but reporters at zdnet were able to independently contact some victims, who confirmed that their details had been lifted from the site. Worryingly, the hack appears to contain information from some 15 million \" deleted \" accounts for which adultfriendfinder still maintained login information. The culprit behind the attack is unknown, although the security researcher who first reported a vulnerability at the site blames russian hackers. The number of hacked accounts is about 10 times that of those affected in an ashley madison hack last year, and there's no speculation at this point about how many accounts might be bogus.

            "San francisco — the list of newly minted millionaires from twitter's public offering will be longer than the average tweet. But the list of who stands to make into the hundreds of millions of dollars is tiny, and shows that sometimes when you roll the dice early in a company's life the payoff can be enormous. A public filing thursday listed some of twitter's biggest winners — five investment firms and a host of board members and current and former executives — that own sizable stakes in the company. But missing from the filing were two co-founders, several investors who took a chance on a scrappy young start-up with no business model and a few who were cautious in twitter's early years and threw the proverbial lottery ticket away. Among the more obvious winners listed were evan williams, who co-founded the company seven years ago. With a 12 percent stake worth about $ 1.2 billion based on twitter's most recent valuation of its shares, he is twitter's largest shareholder. Jack dorsey, another co-founder and twitter's chairman, owns just under 5 percent of the company, worth about $ 483 million. Missing from the filing entirely was biz stone, who co-founded twitter with mr. Williams and mr. Dorsey in 2006 and left the company in 2011. Mr. Stone, two people close to"

Sources close to deen tell tmz that he believes his aggressive on-screen persona is getting confused with his real-life persona, and it's noted that nothing has been reported to police.

Biden tells the ap that trump shouldn't be publicly attacking intelligence officials — or making comparisons to nazi germany.

        "summary": "Even if general appeals to one's health aren't enough to convince people to quit smoking, perhaps this new research out of sweden will give men some pause. An uppsala university study published yesterday in science says that male smokers are, on average, three times more likely to lose y chromosomes as their nonsmoking counterparts, reuters reports. The study also found that the more men smoked, the more y chromosomes they lost, livescience reports. \" the cells that lose the y chromosome … don't die, \" says study co-author lars forsberg. \" but we think that they … have a disrupted biological function. \" specifically, that disrupted function may mean that blood cells missing the y's can't fight off disease, he explains — and because only men have y chromosomes, that cell-weakening could be the link to men's higher cancer rates. The study looked at blood pressure, as well as drinking, exercising, and smoking habits, and collected blood samples of 6,000 men taking part in three separate studies in sweden. Forsberg and his team had previously linked the loss of the y chromosomes in blood to shorter life spans and a jump in the rate of non-blood-related cancers, so they controlled for age in this study to isolate other factors that might lead to this loss: only smoking had a correlation. There's good news to be found from the study, though: forsberg says that some study participants who eventually kicked the habit ended up recouping their lost y chromosomes, suggesting the chromosome loss may be reversible. \" this discovery could be very persuasive for motivating smokers to quit, \" he says.

        "summary": "The water shortage in california has people cutting down on shower times and keeping usage to a minimum — which has led activists to rail against nestle waters, accused of profiting off its water-bottling operations at the expense of the environment, newsweek reports. Backing up these claims is an investigation by the desert sun that unearthed a lack of oversight on nestle's practices, including the revelation that there's been little to no assessment on how bottling water in the state affects water supplies and ecosystems. Also: nestle's permit to suck up this water expired in 1988. The us forest service says it will do an \" environmental analysis, \" but \" only this year, after a group of critics raised concerns in letters and after the desert sun inquired about the expired permit, \" notes the newspaper. Of the 108 water-bottling plants in california, five are operated by nestle, the leading bottled-water supplier worldwide. No state agency monitors how much water is extracted by these plants, notes the sun. Nestle released a statement that said its 2014 water usage in california was 705 million gallons — which it calls a relatively modest amount, about what it would take to irrigate two golf courses. But critics tell the paper that in the mid-2000s the forest service scrutinized permits for forest cabin owners, not saying boo about nestle. \" we made the little people do the right thing, and we're not making the big people do the right thing, \" a retired biologist with the service tells the paper.

That's because the timepiece, dreamed up by danny hillis in 1989, per cnbc, is designed to run for 10,000 years without any human intervention. Hillis ' vision was for the clock to tick once a year, for its hand to advance every 100 years, and for the cuckoo to emerge every 1,000. And it's on its way to becoming a reality, with jeff bezos on tuesday sharing a video of the construction currently underway inside a remote texas mountain located in a desert. A post by bezos, who has been on board with the project for the last five years or so, calls it \" a special clock, designed to be a symbol, an icon for long-term thinking. \" as for a completion date, bezos just vaguely says the clock won't be finished until \" many years into the future. \" those who want to visit it once it's done can email a blank message to clockinterest@10000yearclock.net, which will put you on the \" clock interest \" list. It may not be a journey for the casual daytripper, though. Bezos writes that it's a multiple-hour drive from the nearest airport, and \" the foot trail to the clock is rugged, rising almost 2,000 feet above the valley floor. \" the bbc reports the land where the clock is being built is owned by bezos, and notes that it ' ll be powered by the earth's thermal cycles.

Abdul latif zayani, general secretary of the coalition of persian gulf nations, who was mediating the crisis, was infuriated when saleh refused to finalize the deal by providing five signatories from his side, according to senior opposition officials and one gcc mediator, who all asked not to be identified. The officials said saleh had asked zayani to have five members each from the opposition joint meeting parties and the government sign on to the deal to strengthen its validity. After zayani received the five jmp signatures, he asked saleh to bring forth his five. Saleh refused, claiming the five signatories chosen by the jmp were not satisfactory, the officials said. The two sides had reached the deal earlier in the day, boosting hopes that the political conflict that has led to anti-saleh demonstrations throughout yemen would be resolved. Previous attempts to reach a similar agreement also have come close to being finalized, only to fall through. Ahmed soufi, president saleh's media adviser, said that \" the difference took place when mohammed basendowah, the president of the opposition dialogue committee, was chosen to sign on behalf of the jmp instead of their president"

        "summary": "If you live in one of 15 states and you buy milk, you could be entitled to some cash back. Usa today reports that some people who bought dairy products since 2003 are due refunds as part of a $ 52 million settlement spun out of the alleged mass slaughter of 500,000 cows. The class-action lawsuit filed in 2011 charged that cooperatives working together paid its members — dairy farmers who produce 70 % of the nation's milk — inflated prices for their dairy cows, which were then prematurely killed, reports bloomberg. The alleged goal was to reduce the supply and bump up prices. A university of missouri professor tells usa today the 2003-2010 \" herd retirement program \" did just that, cutting our milk supply by some 1.2 billion gallons while doubling the price of raw milk. A lawyer for the plaintiffs called the program a \" classic price-fixing scheme \"; the milk producers denied the charges but said they settled to avoid expensive litigation. Milk products included in the deal are cream, yogurt, cottage cheese, half and half, cream cheese and sour cream. The states involved are arizona, california, kansas, massachusetts, michigan, missouri, nebraska, nevada, new hampshire, oregon, south dakota, tennessee, vermont, west virginia, and wisconsin, plus dc. Refunds will vary according to how many people apply, per time. The deadline to apply is jan. 31. See www.boughtmilk.com, which as of this writing projects individuals can get up to $ 20.

Nineteen years later, investigators and an assistant state's attorney are still devoting eight hours each week to the murder case — and may be close to solving it. Recently, the team submitted jovin's clothing for touch dna analysis, sought help from the fbi, interviewed new and old witnesses across the country, and hired a hypnotist to work with a witness who might've seen the yale student minutes before she was killed, reports the hartford courant. The new strides were revealed in a recent freedom of information hearing after documentary filmmakers requested case files be released. In denying the request, an foi hearing officer noted the files could compromise the ongoing investigation, adding \" a prospective law enforcement action is a reasonable possibility. \" she did not elaborate. Several suspects have surfaced since jovin, 21, was found on dec. 4, 1998, two miles from the yale campus, a location authorities believe she was driven to, a&e noted when highlighting the case earlier this year. Among them is jovin's professor and thesis adviser, james van de velde, though he maintains his innocence and won at least $ 200,000 in a 2013 settlement with yale and new haven over damage to his reputation. A witness also described a man with \" blondish hair \" and \" chiseled features \" running from the scene. ( jovin's murder isn't the only one to haunt yale. )",

Here's what people are saying: david weigel at slate is predicting a \" gulf of difference between american coverage, in which thatcher will be remembered as a glass ceiling-shattering pal of ronald reagan; and british coverage, which will reflect how hated thatcher was by her political foes. \" he notes that one labour mp actually tweeted the phrase \" tramp the dirt down, \" a reference to an elvis costello song about how great thatcher's death would be. Sure enough, slate colleague lionel shriver has a piece praising thatcher as a \" real feminist, \" who focused on actions, not words. \" she did not pursue justice for her gender, \" but she definitely \" wanted to live in a world in which girls were so unfettered that they could grow up to become prime ministers, \" and her success \" continues to inspire young women to act on their own convictions. \" the economist, meanwhile, praises her politics. \" the essence of thatcherism was to oppose the status quo and bet on freedom — odd, since as a prim control freak, she was in some ways the embodiment of conservatism, \" it muses. \" this is a crucial time to hang on to margaret thatcher's central perception: \" that people should \" push back against the advance of the state. \" \" i grew up in a community where the utterance of her name could cleave a room in two, \" writes tim stanley at the telegraph.

            "A russian spy ship is patrolling off the east coast of the united states, reports cbs news national security correspondent david martin. The ship, known as an agi ( auxiliary, general intelligence ), made a port call in cuba and has been working its way up the east coast. Currently the ship is off the coast of delaware, well in international waters. It is expected to continue north until it gets to the sub base at new london, conn., then turn around and head south toward cuba. The presence of foreign vessels and aircraft near u.s. Territory is nothing new. In 2015, there was a flap about a russian spy ship hanging out in a spot where the transatlantic cables are laid. The ship's presence is one of various russian provocations of late to test the obama and now, the trump administration, martin reports.

That might seem surprising since half of all immigrants since 1965 have come from latin america — 28 % from mexico — but an \" abrupt slowdown \" of illegal immigration from mexico has cut into that, the report notes, per the new york times. Just 1.7 million immigrants from central and south america arrived in the last five years, compared to 2.5 million from asia, reports cnn, which notes 11.3 million immigrants are considered unauthorized. By 2065, the us population is expected to rise to 441 million, with new immigrants and their children responsible for 88 % of growth, reports the los angeles times. How do americans feel? about 45 % say immigrants are making the country a better place, while 37 % say they're making it worse.

The bodies of two women had already been found when 35-year-old juan david ortiz arrived at a gas station with a third woman around 9pm friday. She ran to a state trooper for help, while ortiz took off. He's alleged to have killed two more women before authorities found him at another gas station around 1am saturday, per cnn. Ortiz ran to a hotel parking garage and tried to use his phone to suggest he had a weapon, but was arrested without incident, says federico garza of the webb county sheriff's office, per the new york times. Authorities say ortiz may have used his service weapon to kill the \" vulnerable \" women — all us citizens — with drug or alcohol problems or ties to prostitution. Ortiz allegedly befriended sex workers before shooting them each in the head. The killing spree began sept. 3 with the fatal shooting of melissa ramirez, 29, found near texas highway 255 in northern laredo. Last thursday, the body of claudine luera, 42, was found along the same highway just two miles east. Shortly thereafter, the bodies of a 28-year-old transgender woman and a fourth unidentified victim were discovered separately along interstate 35, which ortiz knew well as part of the border patrol's highway interdiction team. \" we're thinking that maybe he was preying on them … [ thinking ] no one's going to wonder if they go missing, \" luera's sister tells the times.

But there's currently a dearth of that cut, because this year's hogs are so obese that their hind legs are too large for the half-ham process. \" seven-pound hams are in the highest demand and in the lowest supply, \" the cfo for a honeybaked ham division tells bloomberg. The cause: a nasty virus wiped out millions of piglets, leading farmers to feed surviving pigs longer in an effort to make up the poundage. Ham during the holidays is big business: half of our yearly ham consumption takes place during thanksgiving and christmas dinners. If you are able to track down a 7-pounder this holiday season, there will probably be a hefty price tag: prices through the end of september rose 24 % to $ 3.389 per pound, a record high, though ham prices have been rising overall for the past few years ( up 32 % since 2010, yahoo reports ). It's not all bad news from the pen: there is an excess of certain types of hams — plenty of 23- to 27-pounders, bloomberg notes — and these big pigs are aiding pork production overall, which is up 2 % this september over a year prior.

In march, retail food prices rose 0.4 % from the preceding month, matching february's increase. These marked the largest monthly gains in food prices since september 2011, according to data from the bureau of labor statistics ( bls ). Food prices are often volatile and are affected by a number of factors. While certain factors reflect human decision -- such as the changing tastes of consumers and farmers ' planting choices -- others are forces over which farmers have very little control. Issues such as weather conditions and diseases can cause severe supply shortages that cause the price of products to rise.

Vazquez may not have actually killed all 79; one official said that in some cases, a number of shooters — including, allegedly, vazquez — fired at the intended targets.

It also claims that he unearthed \" forensic evidence \" among the \" host of clues \" he found. New york spoke with harpercollins publicist tina andreadis, who shines a little more light on the origins of the book, which the publishing house's lawyers felt \" was legally sound \" upon review, she says. Who didn't review it: the san francisco police department, which the book alleges \" knew more than they're willing to admit. \" the killings took place in northern california beginning in the late 1960s, and andreadis notes that stewart's father has both a resemblance to sketches of the killer and a criminal record for misdeeds like bad checks in san francisco.

            "A lone gray wolf spent just 18 minutes feeding on a dead bull last month above missoula's south hills, but photos of its visit have extended the stay.

            "Officials with the flathead national forest in montana say a snowboarder been fined for harassing wildlife after a video of him chasing a moose was posted on facebook. Flathead national forest spokesman wade muehlhof told the missoulian newspaper that 21-year-old charlie rush was fined $ 225 for violating a federal regulation that prohibits molesting wildlife during the dec. 19 downhill excursion. \" it's one of the tools, especially with the video going viral, that law enforcement has to reinforce the educational message that people should not engage wildlife, \" muehlhof told the newspaper. \"they should have kept their distance. \" the 52-second video, which was filmed and posted to facebook by rush's snowboarding companion, was forwarded to flathead national forest authorities by personnel at whitefish mountain resort, according to the report. The video shows rush heading down the ski resort trail with the moose galloping in front of him. The facebook video posting has been \" liked \" nearly 900 times, shared almost 400 times and drawn the attention of national media outlets. Rush, who is reportedly considering contesting the citation, told cnn reporter jeanne moos that he loves moose and would never intentionally hurt an animal. \" i never realized how big they were till i got that close to one, \" he said in a recent interview. Muehlhof said the snowboarder is lucky that a citation is all that came from the experience. \" if moose feel threatened and go to protect themselves - a person can be seriously injured by them. At the end of the video, you notice that the moose stops and turns. That could have had a very bad outcome for the snowboarder, \" muehlhof told mtn news. \" we're very happy that neither the moose nor the snowboarder were injured.

        "summary": "Indonesian authorities have started to recover the bones of world war ii sailors whose metal coffins were reportedly ripped apart by salvagers hoping to make a buck. Following reports that the bones of sailors were dumped in a shallow mass grave in indonesia, officials have begun excavating three sites, including a cemetery near the port city of brondong in east java, a local police official tells the guardian. The development comes almost exactly 76 years since the soldiers lost their lives in the battle of the java sea, which pitted japan against allied forces. Dozens of british, american, australian, dutch, and japanese warships were left scattered on the seafloor, and many have disappeared in recent years, with salvage workers emerging as the main suspects. Indeed, workers at brondong port, who pointed authorities to the sites, say they were contracted to cut up warships between 2014 and 2016. They told police they found bones in at least one ship to be dismantled, but they didn't know it was a warship at the time, reports afp. The workers admitted to burying some bones and throwing smaller remains in the ocean, says a police rep, adding enough bones \" to fill a small box \" were found during a dig last week. Though indonesia's foreign ministry hasn't commented on the excavation, the guardian reports the ministry and dutch embassy are involved, including at a site called suko cemetery. Meanwhile, relatives of sailors are calling for more severe punishments for those caught desecrating war graves, reports the telegraph. ( wwii warships can be quite valuable. )",

        "summary": "Both mormon leaders and gay rights advocates are praising new legislation known as \" the utah compromise. \" passed in the republican-controlled legislature last night amid cheers, it prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in housing and employment, the new york times reports, while simultaneously protecting religious groups that protest homosexuality. The bill, which passed 65-10 after clearing the senate last week, states employers and property owners can't discriminate against lgbt people, just as they can't discriminate based on race, sex, or age. However, religious groups and affiliates — including the boy scouts of america — would be exempt. Gov. Gary herbert is expected to sign the bill into law today, reports the salt lake tribune. \" this vote proves that protections for gay and transgender people can gracefully coexist with the rights of people of faith, \" says the director of equality utah. \" one does not exist at the expense of the other. \" it would require every county to have a person willing to perform same-sex marriages, but state officials could decline, fox13 reports. It would also protect religious expression, noting workers can't be fired for speaking about their beliefs, as long as they aren't \" harassing, \" the times reports. Rep. Gregory hughes says the fact that the legislation was backed by mormon leaders worked in its favor as the mormon religion is the \" predominant faith here in utah \" and 80 % of state lawmakers are mormon. A southern baptist convention leader says, \" christians and other religious people... Are not really addressed in terms of their freedom of conscience, \" but a human rights campaign rep calls the bill \" a landmark, \" noting \" this will be the first time that a republican-controlled process has led to extension of protections for lgbt people. \"",

The lopez brothers are also under investigation by us center for safesport, which in april banned jean lopez for sexual misconduct, including sexual misconduct with a minor.

The lawsuit is graphic: as reported on npr, gilbert alleges that jean lopez assaulted her in a hotel room in 2002 after she won a gold medal at the pan american games. Meloon details how jean lopez allegedly assaulted her in a hotel room in 1997 when she was 15.

In fact his estate is suing s-town, one of the most popular podcasts ever, saying it revealed highly personal details of mclemore's sexuality, friendships, and mental-health issues without his consent after he died, vox reports. \" the podcast itself acknowledges that mclemore did not wish certain information... [ to ] be publicly known, particularly with respect to mclemore's sexual orientation, \" says the suit. The podcast began in 2012 when this american life producer brian reed visited mclemore in his hometown of woodstock, alabama, to pursue mclemore's belief that a murder and cover-up had occurred. Reed dismissed the murder story, but found mclemore fascinating. S-town probes deep into mclemore's life, revealing a manic-depressive, gold-hoarding, antique-clock-fixing, liberal conspiracist with a photographic memory, per an earlier vox story. But mclemore's estate claims reed never got mclemore's written consent to reveal all this. For his part, reed says \" trying to understand another person is a worthwhile thing to do \" and argues that others corroborated details revealed in the podcast. Media opinions are worth checking out, with the guardian in april 2017 calling s-town \" morally indefensible \"; the atlantic at the same time asked whether the achievement was worth the possible exploitation: \" these questions are worth asking in a larger way, especially if s-town helps give rise to a trend in podcasting where in-depth explorations of a single life are told as bingey-worth narratives, \" the atlantic says.",

This poetry pushed against genre-based and societal boundaries of what was or wasn't acceptable to talk about. In the early days of this movement, the 1950s and 1960s, examples included plath's unfiltered accounts of her suicidal thoughts or sexton's thoughts on menstruation at age 40. Bishop, meanwhile, hated confessional poetry. She didn't much like that shift in lowell's later poems, and she definitely didn't like the tell-all poems about sexual"

The unexpected attack sealed the doom of the tenuous ceasefire between rebels and the syrian government, the end of which had been announced just hours earlier.

And then the circle of madness began, \" he adds. The us has blamed syria and its russian allies for the attack on the un/red crescent convoy, with the times finding evidence of a \" sustained, coordinated attack, \" backed by interviews, photos, videos, and other data ( russia and syria deny this, with russia claiming the convoy may have simply caught fire, per cbs news ). A russian drone tracked the convoy beforehand, and there were about 30 explosions over several hours once the assault began, per the times. \" we saw fire, injured people, human parts, some people burning in their vehicles, \" salmo says.

        "summary": "You can add drug abuse to the long list of nazi exploits, according to author norman ohler, who claims adolf hitler's soldiers were as high as a kite during world war ii. When a friend mentioned nazi soldiers used drugs, ohler began scouring us and german archives and uncovered some surprises, described in his new book der totale rausch ( total rush ), per deutsche welle. First, notes from hitler's personal physician describe him receiving 800 injections of animal hormones and the opiate eukodal, which ohler calls \" a pharmaceutical cousin of heroin, \" over 1,349 days, reports the independent. But ohler also uncovered evidence that nazi soldiers were on drugs during major offenses. Though the nazis condemned cocaine, opium, and morphine as \" jewish, \" nazi chemist fritz hauschild developed a new drug, pervitin, which was basically crystal meth in a pill, ohler says. It wasn't some secret operation: pervitin was openly available in germany in 1937 and used as a kind of medicine to make people feel alert. It was even put in chocolates so housewives could take part in the high. \" it became a drug of choice, like people drink coffee to boost their energy, \" ohler says. \" for the first couple of days, you don't need to sleep. \" that made it perfect for when hitler's armies invaded poland in 1939. Ahead of the attack on france, some 35 million tablets were ordered for the army, ohler says. General erwin rommel, a decorated tank commander known as the \" desert fox, \" reportedly consumed pervitin like it was his \" daily bread, \" reports the independent. Even after the drug was banned in germany in 1941, the army continued using it, ohler says, and the enemy took notice. British soldiers, and american soldiers in britain, began using amphetamines \" to keep up with these crazed german soldiers. \" ( another surprising wwii story involves the escape of two nazi pows...

        "summary": "In the final hours before the first presidential debate of the 2012 election, a host of new polls to consider: president obama has a significant lead in the battleground state of ohio, 51 % to mitt romney's 43 %, according to an nbc news/wall street journal poll. That's been consistent since three weeks ago, when his lead was 50 % to 43 %. But in florida and virginia, also key states, obama and romney are statistically tied, the poll finds. Obama leads 47 % to 46 % in florida, where he was leading 49 % to 45 % in mid-september. In virginia, the president leads 48 % to 46 %; last month that was 49 % to 45 %. But a roanoke college poll finds obama is up 47 % to 39 % in virginia, though his approval rate in the state is just 46 % compared to a 45 % disapproval rate. Meanwhile, an npr poll finds obama leads by 7 points nationally among those likely to vote — and is ahead by 6 points in a dozen battleground states. But romney, npr says, is \" very much within striking distance. \" and the debates could very well have an impact: npr also found that more than 80 % of those polled planned to watch, and one in four said their vote could be influenced by what they hear. Obama is definitively winning in one area: campaign messages. Politico reports on a poll that tested 12 quotes from each candidate, asking respondents whether they found the messages believable, how the quotes impacted their feelings toward the candidate, and whether the quotes changed their likelihood of voting for the candidate. In the resulting analysis, obama snagged all of the top eight spots. Click for more results from recent polls.",
