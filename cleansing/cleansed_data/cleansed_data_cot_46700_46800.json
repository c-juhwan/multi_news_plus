Problem? a group known as the sandy hook truthers are using the amazon reviews to trash author scarlett lewis — and to push their belief that the shooting was a hoax orchestrated by the government to get tougher gun laws, reports the seattle times. It's nasty stuff: \"scarlett lewis is a fraud and a sellout to all of humanity, \" writes one. \"'scarlett'should be put in jail! zero stars!! this book should be labled ( ( fiction ) ) the sandy hook event is *proven* to have been a 'drill, ' \" writes another. They're giving lewis ' nurturing healing love: a mother's journey of hope and forgiveness one-star ratings in an attempt to discredit it, which the newspaper says is an increasingly common tactic made possible by amazon's policy of allowing reviews of products by people who haven't actually made a purchase. Raw story notes that the hoax theory is the most common of several conspiracy theories floating around about sandy hook, and it's getting a high-profile push from the likes of conservative radio host alex jones. In fact, after the recent shooting at a community college in oregon, the local sheriff got into hot water when it emerged that he'd shared a video spreading the idea. Lewis herself seems unfazed, telling the times, \"once you've had a child murdered, shot in the forehead, there's not a lot that can ruffle your feathers. \" so who on earth would believe such crackpot theories? researchers once thought that conspiracy believers were generally people \" primed to see patterns everywhere, \" in the words of live science, which reports a first-of-its kind swiss study casts doubt on that. While it doesn't explain why theories such as the one about sandy hook gain traction, researchers say it debunks a commonly held explanation. ( another sandy hook parent found solace in music. )",

            "Hackers who stole sensitive customer information from the cheating site ashleymadison.com appear to have made good on their threat to post the data online. A data dump, 9.7 gigabytes in size, was posted on tuesday to the dark web using an onion address accessible only through the tor browser. The files appear to include account details and log-ins for some 32 million users of the social networking site, touted as the premier site for married individuals seeking partners for affairs. Seven years worth of credit card and other payment transaction details are also part of the dump. Ashleymadison.com claimed to have nearly 40 million users at the time of the breach about a month ago, all apparently in the market for clandestine hookups. \" ashley madison is the most famous name in infidelity and married dating, \" the site asserts on its homepage. \" have an affair today on ashley madison. Thousands of cheating",
            "Well, this should be interesting. Hackers who claim to have stolen data from ashley madison, the dating site for cheaters, recently posted nearly 10-gigabytes of said stolen data. That includes member email addresses, credit card transactions, and even profiles. This should be very interesting. The data can be found on the dark web, and those who've already downloaded it say they're finding all kinds of juicy gossip. ( one person searched for british government emails, for instance. ) the hackers themselves, however, don't seem at all miffed about this massive release of purportedly private and possibly damaging information. Because ashley madison's parent company, avid life media, refused the hackers'demand to take down the site, they don't think the users deserve privacy. Advertisement calling themselves the impact team, the hackers said: we have explained",
            "Gigabytes worth of data taken during last month's hack of the ashley madison dating website for cheaters has been published online — an act that could be highly embarrassing for the men and women who have used the service over the years. A 10-gigabyte file containing e-mails, member profiles, credit-card transactions and other sensitive ashley madison information became available as a bittorrent download in the past few hours. Ars downloaded the massive file and it appeared to contain a trove of details taken from a clandestine dating site, but so far there is nothing definitively linking it to ashley madison. User data included e-mail addresses, profile descriptions, addresses provided by users, weight, and height. A separate file containing credit card transaction data didn't include full payment card numbers or billing addresses. Rob graham, ceo of errata security, said the dump also included user passwords that were cryptographically protected"

And kinkade's relationship with pinto was also seemingly troubled: los gatos police confirmed they had responded \" a couple \" of times to kinkade's home, and a neighbor says those calls involved domestic disputes. \" they'd get into some nasty fights, \" he says. The mercury news notes kinkade and pinto started dating six months after kinkade's wife nanette filed for legal separation and had been together about a year and a half.

The two had been dating for the past 18 months, pinto said, about six months after his wife, nanette, filed for legal separation. Nanette and the couple's two teenage daughters were in australia at the time of his death. The santa clara county coroner's office said an autopsy was performed monday on kinkade but the cause of death might not be determined for months. Results of toxicology and other tests could take 12 to 20 weeks, because of a backup at the county lab. \"the fact that he's famous has nothing to do with the toxicology turnaround time, \" said a spokeswoman from the coroner's office who didn't want her name used. In recent years, bouts with alcohol and bankruptcy painted a darker image of the man who described himself as the \"painter of light. \" he was known for his paintings of bucolic pastoral scenes and charming cottages, candlelit images made into calendars and decorative plates that are said to fill one in 20 homes in california. Although the fine-art world often derided his work as tacky, mainstream americans flocked to his paintings. Kinkade created several hundred thomas kinkade signature galleries to sell his work. In 2010, the recession took its toll and his morgan hill art company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing nearly $ 6.2 million in creditors ' claims. On monday, the ceo of kinkade's galleries said in a statement they were overwhelmed by the \"outpouring of appreciation and interest in thom's work. \" \"he strived to make his paintings available and affordable to the public and his collectors, \" john hasting, ceo of the thomas kinkade co., said monday. \"in his honor, we will continue his legacy and do what we can to carry on.

According to the miami news times, the pink pony gentleman's club was raided and shut down by police during \" tasteful tuesday \" this week. The herald reports police were contacted by the friend's mother, who saw cellphone videos and photos from inside the club. Those images allegedly show the girls smoking marijuana and doing cocaine and at least one of them pole dancing with a stripper. The herald says both girls were on stage at some point, though it's not clear whether they were clothed. The friend's mother described the videos as \" disgusting \" to cbs miami. Jose arguelles, 59, has been charged with child neglect, supplying drugs to a child, and eight counts of sexual performance of a child to promote sex. His attorney says he gets the first two charges but doesn't quite see the last one. \" judge look, i know this is serious, but dancing on a stripper pole is not simulated sexual intercourse, \" he said, according to cbs. Police say arguelles has taken the girls to the club multiple times and let them drink. They also say they've got video taken on arguelles ' boat that shows the bikini-clad girls dancing on a stripper pole.

In addition to that, however, he's got a packed week of meetings with fellow world leaders, a format that one analyst compares to \" speed dating from hell, \" via cnn. Aides have previewed some of the big topics trump is expected to hit, with north korea, iran's nuclear program, global terrorism, the venezuelan economic meltdown, and un reform among them. But much of the advance focus is on how trump will interact with his fellow leaders in front of an organization he has previously belittled. Un ambassador nikki haley offered a preview on sunday: \" i personally think he slaps the right people, he hugs the right people, and he comes out with the us being very strong in the end, \" she said in regard to his tuesday speech, per the new york times. Some highlights: ( vladimir putin, china's xi jinping, and germany's angela merkel are not expected to attend, notes usa today ): monday: trumps meets with the leaders of france and israel, with iran expected to be a big focus, reports the hill. He also hosts a dinner with latin american leaders, at which venezuela is likely to be the no. 1 topic. Tuesday: trump delivers his speech to the general assembly, his first as president to the full body. Wednesday: trump meets with the leaders of britain, jordan, egypt, and the palestinian authority, and hosts a lunch with leaders from africa. Thursday: in addition to meetings with the leaders of turkey, afghanistan, and ukraine, he hosts a lunch with the leaders of south korea and japan. The latter could be key in determining what comes next in regard to north korea. Key quote: \" the world is still trying to take the measure of this president, \" says jon alterman of the center for strategic and international studies in washington. \" for a number of leaders, this is going to be their first chance to see him, to judge him, to try to get on his good side....

Last month, the president set off a controversy when he retweeted three anti-muslim videos posted by jayda fransen of the anti-immigration group britain first. Fransen boasted of trump's retweets at the time, but she won't be able to post anything new for a while: her account and at least two others linked to her group are now suspended, reports cnn. Twitter says it will not comment about decisions made regarding particular accounts, per the bbc, but the move comes just as the site announced that it was enforcing new rules to curb \" hateful conduct and abusive behavior. \" it's not clear whether the britain first accounts will be allowed to resurface. \" if an account's profile information includes a violent threat or multiple slurs, epithets, racist or sexist tropes, incites fear, or reduces someone to less than human, it will be permanently suspended, \" reads a company post.

Up until now, the five tastes humans were known to be able to sense were sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. According to new scientist, it might be time to add \" starchy \" to that list. Researcher juyun lim notes that \" every culture has a major source of complex carbohydrate, \" be it rice or pasta or potatoes, and it \" doesn't make sense \" that humans wouldn't be able to taste those. But because enzymes in our mouths break carbohydrates down to simple sugars, scientists always assumed we were just tasting sweet. Lim disputes that in a study published in chemical sense. She found that people could pick out a solution containing carbohydrate chains — it tasted \" like eating flour \" — even when given a compound that blocked their tongues'sweet receptors. That indicates that starchy is its own taste. It makes evolutionary sense that humans would be able to taste starch, which is an excellent source of sustained energy. And this could also explain why we find starchy foods comforting, the guardian reports. However, lim and her team still need to find starch receptors on the tongue in order to qualify it as a primary taste. Other scientists are looking into the possibilities that fat, calcium, blood, and more are their own tastes. ( penguins can't taste the fish they eat. )",

An airplane delivered jennifer neyman, 36, and christopher hanna, 45, to bear glacier in harding ice field on friday, but bad weather prevented their plane from returning, reports the alaska dispatch news. By saturday, the pair from soldotna had texted a friend with a satellite phone to say wind and snow had ripped their tent to shreds and they were running low on supplies, per the dispatch news. They then dug a snow cave. A plane was able to drop supplies on monday — it isn't clear if the pair reached them — while four alaska air national guard rescuers parachuted onto the glacier and began trekking toward the pair's location, which they reached tuesday. \" they had to dig out four feet of snow around the survivors to get to them, \" says a helicopter pilot, adding \" the terrain there is pretty gnarly. \" a helicopter was able to evacuate neyman and hanna to a hospital shortly after noon.

High levels of phosphorus _ a common ingredient in detergents and fertilizers _ were found in 40 percent of rivers and streams. Another problem detected was development.

In the eastern highlands, 63 % of river and stream miles were in poor shape, while in the plains and lowlands regions ( roughly the country's midsection and much of the south ), 58 % fell into that category. Excessive nitrogen and phosphorus levels, sedimentation and denuded riverbanks were among the leading problems.

The results, released tuesday, found that of the three climatic regions discussed in the report, the west -- with its large swaths of undeveloped land -- was in the best shape: 42 % of its river and stream length was in good ecological condition, 27 % in fair condition and 30 % in poor condition. In the eastern highlands, 63 % of river and stream miles were in poor shape, while in the plains and lowlands regions ( roughly the country's midsection and much of the south ), 58 % fell into that category. Excessive nitrogen and phosphorus levels, sedimentation and denuded riverbanks were among the leading problems. Unsafe bacteria levels were found in 9 % of river and stream miles, and potentially unsafe levels of mercury were detected in fish in more than 13,000 miles of rivers across the country."

Two men in their early 20s have been arrested and charged with attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, reports the chicago tribune.

This \" happy heart \" study, published in the european heart journal, examined data collected from 1,750 tts patients who had signed up with the international takotsubo registry, a database of both men and women from the us and eight european countries, per live science. The researchers found 485 of those with tts — which temporarily weakens heart muscles and makes the left ventricle balloon at the bottom while the neck stays narrow, causing symptoms similar to a heart attack, including chest pain — had experienced a \" definite emotional trigger. \" of those triggers, 96 % were linked to sad or stressful events, but 4 % were tied to joyous events such as a surprise party or a favorite sports team winning a game. A stunning 95 % of both \" broken heart \" and \" happy heart \" patients were women. There was a slight difference in how the tts played out, too: more \" happy heart \" patients ( 35 % ) had hearts that ballooned out in the mid-ventricle than their brokenhearted counterparts ( 16 % ), though researchers have to study this more to see what it means. \" we believe that tts is a classic example of an intertwined feedback mechanism, involving the psychological and/or physical stimuli, the brain, and the cardiovascular system, \" co-author dr. Christian templin says. \" perhaps both happy and sad life events, while inherently distinct, share final common pathways in the central nervous system output, which ultimately lead to [ tts ]. \" ( yoga may help tts patients. )",

Historians have long thought that the city of angkor was abandoned in the 15th century amid a siamese attack and occupation, but the research finds no evidence to suggest that a million people uprooted themselves in a mass migration, reports cambodia daily. Instead, it appears that the population remained and thrived, boasting complex waterway systems that emerged centuries earlier than thought. \" what we had was basically a scatter of disconnected points on the map denoting temple sites, \" lead archaeologist damian evans of australia tells afp. \" now it's like having a detailed street map of the entire city. \" he says more maps will be published in the months ahead, but his second round of scans, which were taken in 2015 after the first round in 2012, has his peers abuzz. \" it is as if a bright light has been switched on to illuminate the previous dark veil that covered these great sites, \" says new zealand archaeologist charles higham. \" it is wonderful to be alive as these new discoveries are being made. \" the technology, called lidar, forms a 3d model of any stark changes in ground height.

            "The white house is said to be considering gov. Brian sandoval ( r-nev. ) as a nominee to replace justice antonin scalia on the supreme court. Here's what you need to know about him. ( sarah parnass/the washington post ) the white house is considering picking the republican governor from nevada to fill the current vacancy on the supreme court, scrambling political calculations in what is expected to be a contentious confirmation battle in which senate republicans have pledged to play the role of roadblock. President obama is weighing the selection of brian sandoval, a centrist former federal judge who has served as governor since 2011, according to two people familiar with the process. Though the review process is in its initial phases and it is unclear whether the governor could ultimately emerge as the president's pick, even the prospect of his nomination poses a difficult dilemma for senate republicans who have promised not to consider any nomination before november's elections. After the washington post published news of sandoval's consideration wednesday, gop leaders insisted that obama nominating a republican would make no difference. Senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ), who on tuesday pledged \"no action \" on any supreme court nomination before the election, said in a statement that the nominee \"will be determined by whoever wins the presidency in the fall. \" the no.",

        "summary": "In a piece last week on slate, laura helmuth took a long and interesting look at what she dubs \" the most important difference between the world today and 150 years ago \": the doubling of our lifespan, from about 40 years to about 80. She looked at the big reasons why, of which you probably could come up with a few — like vaccines, clean water, refrigeration. But helmuth's fascinating follow-up piece takes things a step further, and her headline says it all: \" fourteen oddball reasons you're not dead yet. \" here are our favorite four: cotton: before we started wearing cotton we wore wool, which was tougher to clean. That made it a more welcoming home for body lice, which spread one of history's big killers: typhus. Satellites: helmuth is referring to the weather-observing kind, which alert us to hurricanes with enough time to prepare and, importantly, evacuate. To wit, she cites a 1900 hurricane that killed 8,000 in galveston. Hurricane ike brought a higher storm surge in 2008, but the texas department of state health services identified just 74 deaths. Window screens: they keep out houseflies, and that has saved us from more than just some hand-swatting. Though helmuth acknowledges that clean water and sewage treatment were the biggest factors in squashing the spread of potentially fatal diarrhea, flies were also a vector. Shoes: if you think disease-carrying flies sound gross, well, meet hookworms. These parasites find their way from the feces of an infected person ( which were ostensibly on the ground ) and into the body of another person through the feet. They did so frequently in the southeast before wearing shoes became an encouraged practice. Head to slate for the other 10 items on her list, which includes the residents of framingham, mass.",

Ike produced a damaging, destructive, and deadly storm surge across the upper texas and southwestern louisiana coasts. Thirty-four texas counties were declared disaster areas by the federal emergency management agency; 15 counties were under mandatory evacuation orders. To describe causes of death associated with this hurricane and identify prevention strategies during the response and recovery phases, the texas department of state health services ( dshs ) monitored mortality data in 44 counties throughout the state. This report summarizes ike-related deaths reported by texas medical examiners, justices of the peace ( coroners ), forensic centers, public health officials, and hospitals. Methods: based on the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) disaster-related mortality surveillance form, dshs developed a state-specific 1-page form",

        "summary": "Airbnb's commitment to building a connection between hosts and guests in the interest of safety is actually helping them discriminate against each other, the washington post reports. Harvard researchers sent out 6,400 requests to airbnb hosts in los angeles, st. Louis, dc, baltimore, and dallas using fake accounts. The accounts were identical except for the names, which were either stereotypically white or black. The study — published wednesday — found guests with \" black \" names were 16 % less likely to be accepted. That's about the same level of discrimination found in everything from the job market to classified ad rates, the post reports. \" this is absolutely not a story about how people are bigots on airbnb, \" study coauthor michael luca says. \" this is entirely about the choices that online platforms make that either facilitate or prevent discrimination. \" researchers found discrimination came from all hosts — black, white, female, male, expensive properties, cheap properties, etc. The post reports the only exception was black female hosts, who didn't appear to discriminate against black female guests. According to the study, this discrimination came at a financial cost, as hosts who turned down guests only found replacements 35 % of the time. But the researchers aren't just pointing out the problem, they're helping solve it. According to forbes, they partnered with some computer scientists to create a downloadable tool called debias yourself. Airbnb users with chrome can download the tool, and debias yourself will scrub the names and photos of hosts and guests from the site.",

Bethany thompson, a sixth-grader in cable, ohio, had been free of cancer after undergoing radiation therapy for a brain tumor at the age of 3, but the treatments marred her nerves, leaving her with a \" crooked \" smile. That, along with her curly hair, led to the bullying against bethany, particularly by a certain group of boys — and on oct. 19, after telling her best friend she was going to end her life, bethany hunted for and found a loaded handgun on a high shelf inside her family's home and shot herself before her friend's father could contact bethany's mom, says paul thompson, bethany's dad, per the columbus dispatch. Triad middle school was aware of the bullying — the school's superintendent confirmed with cnn that it \" investigated a complaint raised by the student and appropriately resolved the same \" — with feucht noting she had had a conversation with the principal about it just a few days earlier. She says she found out that bethany, who saw a counselor to help her deal with self-esteem issues, and her friends had even crafted anti-bullying signs but were prohibited by at least one school administrator from displaying them. \" i ' m sure she felt pretty defeated, \" feucht tells the dispatch. \" i've had this constant in my life for 12 years and now it's gone, \" she adds to cnn. \" nothing's going to be able to fill that hole. \" ( a 13-year-old staten island boy who killed himself in august left behind a note on bullying. )",

Jay nixon in 2014 ( jahi chikwendiu/the washington post ) fed up with what they say is \"reprehensible \" underfunding, missouri public defenders are calling out their governor by forcing the man they blame for a lack of resources to take a case of his own. The state's top public defender laid out his grievances in a letter to democratic gov. Jay nixon: a vetoed bill that would have lightened public defenders ' caseloads. Repeated budget cuts. Unfairly withholding money allotted to the office. Using a power granted to him in a single line of state law, missouri's top public defender appointed nixon as attorney for a central missouri man charged with assault. But the decision has little to do with the man's case — it's an attention-grabbing cry for help in a state where public defenders have long said they are overworked and underfunded. \"given the extraordinary circumstances that compel me to entertain any and all avenues for relief, it strikes me that i should begin with the one attorney in the state who not only created this problem, but is in a unique position to address it, \" michael barrett, director of the missouri state public defender system, wrote in a letter to the governor. Missouri law allows the director of the public defender's office to appoint a member of the state bar — any member — to represent someone who can't afford a private lawyer. In theory, barrett said, the law was created so that people's constitutional right to a defense could be fulfilled even during hard times. For the public defender's office, he said, that hard time is happening right now. \"when you're in dire straits, you have to use all the tools available to you, \" he told the post.

Jay nixon in 2014 ( jahi chikwendiu/the washington post ) fed up with what they say is \"reprehensible \" underfunding, missouri public defenders are calling out their governor by forcing the man they blame for a lack of resources to take a case of his own. The state's top public defender laid out his grievances in a letter to democratic gov. Jay nixon: a vetoed bill that would have lightened public defenders ' caseloads. Repeated budget cuts. Unfairly withholding money allotted to the office. Using a power granted to him in a single line of state law, missouri's top public defender appointed nixon as attorney for a central missouri man charged with assault. But the decision has little to do with the man's case — it's an attention-grabbing cry for help in a state where public defenders have long said they are overworked and underfunded. \"given the extraordinary circumstances that compel me to entertain any and all avenues for relief, it strikes me that i should begin with the one attorney in the state who not only created this problem, but is in a unique position to address it, \" michael barrett, director of the missouri state public defender system, wrote in a letter to the governor. Missouri law allows the director of the public defender's office to appoint a member of the state bar — any member — to represent someone who can't afford a private lawyer. In theory, barrett said, the law was created so that people's constitutional right to a defense could be fulfilled even during hard times. For the public defender's office, he said, that hard time is happening right now. \"when you're in dire straits, you have to use all the tools available to you, \" he told the post. [ [ i ' m a public defender. It's impossible for me to do a good job representing my clients. ] ] as far as barrett knows, it's the first time anyone has called upon a governor to serve as a public defender. It may seem extreme, he said, but it's necessary to bring attention to what he calls a \"reprehensible \" lack of funding. Despite a $ 4.5 million budget increase granted by the missouri legislature in june — much less than the",

Many of them are old-hat ( he wanted to kill obama, he thought about rebranding al-qaeda ). Other highlights: a former intelligence official tells the washington post that, according to his writings, bin laden was none-too-pleased about an idea cooked up by al-qaeda-linked terrorists: to build a \" human lawnmower \" out of a pickup truck and rotating blades that could be driven into crowds. Bin laden \" felt it conflicted with his vision for what he wanted al-qaeda to be. \" msnbc confirms that bin laden was not a leader in name only. \" everything \" went through him, \" down to communications from field ops. The post notes that he pushed to have oversight over what had become a scattered network of terrorists that had reached yemen and somalia. But he sweated the small stuff, too, weighing in on less consequential topics like which crops al-shabab allies in somalia should farm. The new york post reports, by way of the times of london, that the pakistani doctor who assisted the cia in its hunt for bin laden via a fake vaccination program did more than just that: he helped confirm the presence of bin laden at the compound by getting his hands on bin laden's courier's phone number and calling him. The doctor is apparently being held by isi. And, some quirk: want your very own piece of where bin laden spent his final days? the contractor who razed the abbottabad compound is selling bricks...

He's big into podcasting, owning his own smodcast brand, but most of his money comes from live appearances in which he talks to audiences about whatever strikes his fancy for a few hours. \" he's in the business of giving his followers more and more kevin smith, and business is quite good, \" writes riesman. Smith may no longer be part of the mainstream pop-culture conversation, but that could change. He's been directing tv shows such as the flash, supergirl, and the goldbergs; he's adapting the comic book sam and twitch for tv; and he's got a movie in the works in which the duo of jay and silent bob ( the latter played by smith himself, as usual ) will return. What's more, smith's long and nasty feud with critics appears to be over ( he explains that his film yoga hosers was in part an apology to them ), and he says he is, for the first time, happy. The only drawback: \" happy people don't really make great art, you know? \" but he's not interested in going \" through negative s --- anymore. \" ( click for the full profile. )",

As a potential candidate, bachmann already has an opponent in lt. Gov. Tina smith, who's been tapped to replace franken starting wednesday. Smith has pledged to run in the november special election to replace franken for the final two years of his term, as has state sen. Karin housley, a republican. Ever the outsider, bachmann said she also has a foe in the washington establishment. \" it is really tough...

It's a sentiment widely shared out there, with brian merchant at vice chiming in, \" from where i ' m sitting, it's the death knell for traditional cable television. \" after all, people who hate the expensive bundles offered by cable companies will be able to cut the cord and still get high-quality shows. Other entities such as the nfl, comedy central, amc, and, now, cbs, offer similar options, and hbo's entry means \" there's almost no conceivable reason you'd need a cable subscription, \" writes merchant. People finally will be able to pick and choose what they will pay to watch. Skeptics say those most likely to sign up for the hbo service are probably young, tech-savvy adults who already skip cable, and thus the move won't lead to a significant jump in cord-cutters, writes derek thompson at the atlantic. But even if it simply curbs cable's growth by preventing new sign-ups, \" that's bad enough, \" he writes. The cable industry may still be \" ridiculously profitable \" but the \" empire is shrinking \" as subscriptions stagnate. \" bundling has worked, \" he writes. \" now it's ending. Somebody has to lose this game. \" of course, cable companies also are in the business of providing internet service, so expect them to try to boost profits on that front. In fact, at forbes, howard homonoff thinks the biggest loser in all this isn't the cable industry — he figures most people will stick with cable for the foreseeable future — but amazon, which recently signed a content deal with hbo for its prime service.",

Once outside the egg, he ' ll eat plenty of ginger — allowing his blood vessels to expand, increasing body heat — to help him keep the chicken eggs at a minimum of 98 degrees while inside a glass encasement at the museum in a performance dubbed \" egg. \" after the eggs hatch, the chicks will \" go and live with my parents, \" poincheval says.

            "Abraham poincheval during his solo performances, abraham poincheval pushes back his physical and mental limits. For him, life in autarky, enclosure, immobility or the progressive loss of senses are all means to explore the world and human nature. As with the giant bottle, inside which abraham poincheval is currently going up the river rhône, inhabitable sculptures in which, or on which, he has lived for several days, will be scattered throughout the spaces of palais de tokyo. By testing out the artist's body, they lead him to experience the temporalities of the animal and mineral worlds. Abraham poincheval is pursing his exploration of closed, confined spaces by living inside a rock installed in palais de tokyo for a week. Surrounded by visitors and the art center's activities, the artist vanishes inside the denseness of the stone, which encloses him like a protective envelope or an isolation cell. In the other performance, abraham poincheval measures himself up against the rhythm of life. While experiencing immobility, and the waiting during a gestation, he sits on hen's eggs which hatches out thanks to the heat of his own body.

Now two of the three are dead and the third is charged with double murder. Authorities say ricardo vaca — who was married may 29 — returned home from a father's day celebration with his sister around 9: 30pm and saw his neighbor's wife clinging to a door frame as her husband tried to drag her into the garage, reports the news-press. Vaca said he wanted to check on 44-year-old amparo moreno and ran over to her driveway. Soon after, vaca's sister heard multiple gunshots and found her brother and moreno lying riddled with bullets on the driveway, police say. As she tried to help, placido moreno-torres, 47, held a silver revolver to her forehead, according to a police report. She \" began to plead for her life, at which time she dropped to the ground, rolled down the driveway, and ran for safety, \" the report says. When moreno-torres took off on foot, \" we all got together to see what we can do but we couldn't save any lives, \" a neighbor tells wptv. They drove the victims to an intersection, where they met with paramedics, but both were pronounced dead. Moreno-torres — who was arrested early sunday with \" numerous cuts and abrasions covering his body, suggesting he'd been traveling through dense foliage \" — faces two counts of homicide and one count of aggravated assault. Meanwhile, family members are mourning vaca and the fact that his daughter will grow up without him. \" he was an amazing person, always happy and trying to make people smile, \" a cousin tells the news-press. \" we as a family are devastated. \" ( at least two other good samaritans have lost their lives in 2016. )",

        "summary": "As far as price tags go, it's an attention grabber: $ 546 for six liters of water and 54 grams of salt. But that's what one patient was charged for what the new york times calls \" one of the most common components of emergency medicine \": the iv bag. Nina bernstein digs into the numbers by way of a 2012 food poisoning outbreak in upstate new york. She reviewed some of the more than 100 affected patients ' bills, and quickly realized that some were charged as much as 200 times the manufacturer's price for a liter of saline — which has recently ranged from 44 cents to $ 1 — plus another change for \" iv administration. \" a patient at white plains hospital got a bill that included $ 91 for a single unit of hospira iv ( hospital's cost: 86 cents ), plus $ 127 for administering it. The $ 546 figure comes from the bill of a woman who spent three days in the same hospital, which paid $ 5.16 for her six liters of saline. Bernstein acknowledges we're pretty numb to the reality of inflated health-care costs, but sees something more in \" the tale of the humble iv bag \": \" secrecy that helps keep prices high. \" it's the product of purchasing organizations and distributors and other players who make deals that \" so obscure prices and profits that even participants cannot say what the simplest component of care actually costs, let alone what it should cost, \" she writes. \" and that leaves taxpayers and patients alike with an inflated bottom line and little or no way to challenge it. \" read her full piece here.",

The tunisia set for the tatooine city of mos espa in star wars episode i: the phantom menace is expected to soon be buried by the oncoming dune, say scientists, whose observation is more than just a bit of hollywood trivia. They've actually used the set as a stationary reference point in their study of barchans, or crescent-shaped dunes, the bbc reports. Satellite images have shown the us- and tunisia-based scientists that this particular barchan is chugging along at a rate of about 50 feet per year. Per tourism photos taken this year, it looks to be already touching the edge of the set, which wouldn't be the first to suffer such a fate: a neighboring site that featured in star wars episode iv was blanketed in sand in 2003, the independent notes. The good news for star wars fans: \" given the importance of this site to the tourism industry of tunisia, it may be that it is a candidate for mitigation measures [ like constructing fences ], not being pursued at present, \" the scientists say. And if nothing is done to stop it, the dune should keep going after it covers the city, bringing mos espa once again to light — though probably with some damage.

Now ahmad al-mahdi, a former employee with mali's education department, is facing war crimes charges at the hague for directing this cultural decimation, pleading guilty monday at the international criminal court — the icc's first prosecution of such a case, the new york times reports. \" all the charges brought against me are accurate and correct. I am really sorry, \" al-mahdi told the court, noting his following of islam led him to repent. \" we have to be truthful, even if it burns our own hands. \" and the lead prosecutor says al-mahdi used his own hands during the rampage, showing \" determination and focus \" to turn the revered structures to rubble. \" we must eliminate from the landscape everything that doesn't belong, \" al-mahdi, believed to be around 40, said in a 2012 video shown in court. Although he could have faced up to 30 years in prison, al-mahdi struck a deal that will likely net him just nine to 11 years behind bars. Although al-madhi was suspected of other crimes, too, the icc prosecutor purposely limited charges to the cultural destruction as a symbolic move, per swissinfo.ch. Some experts say the case could spur the prosecution of other culturally related war crimes in countries like iraq and syria, which the icc doesn't have reach over. Al-mahdi promised in court he wouldn't commit such a transgression ever again, asked timbuktu residents to forgive him \" as a son who has lost his way, \" and said he hoped the \" evil spirits \" that took him over will be purged in prison, per the guardian.

Once they arrive at the moon, the two washing machine-sized probes will fly in formation, with instruments sensitive enough to detect a hair's breadth separation. Along with those gravity-mapping instruments, grail will carry something called moonkam — \" moon knowledge acquired by middle school students. \" logging in from schools around the country, students will be able to virtually coast a few miles above the surface of the moon, scanning the pallid dirt for craters or perhaps an open plain that might someday make a nice lunar homestead",
            "This still from a nasa broadcast shows the delta 2 rocket carrying nasa's twin grail moon gravity probes on sept. 10, just one hour away from a morning launch attempt - the second liftoff try for the mission. After two days of delay caused by bad weather and a technical glitch, nasa is once again ready to launch two probes toward the moon to unlock the secrets of lunar gravity. The twin grail spacecraft are expected to launch from florida's cape canaveral air force station today ( sept. 10 ) at 8: 29 a.m. Edt ( 1229 gmt ), with a second opportunity available at 9: 08 a.m. Edt ( 1308 gmt ), if needed, nasa officials said. The $ 496 million moon probes were initially slated to launch atop their unmanned delta 2 rocket on thursday ( sept. 8 ), but unacceptable high-altitude winds forced nasa to delay the liftoff. Another chance on friday was called off to give engineers time to assess the rocket's propulsion system after a potential glitch was detected.after a series of reviews, the team concluded that there are no issues with the rocket or its propulsion system, nasa"

Paul points out that he never used the word \" citizenship \" in his speech. \"i think the whole debate on immigration is trapped in a couple of words: path to citizenship and amnesty, \" he tells the post politics blog of the washington post. \"can't we just have reform and not refer to them by names? \" the blog adds later: \" paul's advisers say there is little difference between the current law and what paul is proposing, at least when it comes to citizenship. \" others weighing in: benjy sarlin, talking points memo: \" the plan paul laid out in his afternoon call sounded identical in principle to plans put forward by a group of bipartisan senators and by the white house, both of which contain a so-called ' path to citizenship'that would allow illegal immigrants here today to obtain green cards ( after meeting certain conditions ) and eventually naturalize. \" erick erickson, redstate: \" feel free to disagree with senator paul if you must. Just don't claim he's pursuing a path to citizenship he never even mentioned. \" kevin robillard, politico: \" in a conference call that paul held with reporters later in the day, it became clear that differences between the senator's plan and the conventional definition of a path to citizenship were few, if they existed at all. \" erica werner in the ap's latest story: paul said \" the nation's illegal immigrants should be able to become citizens eventually, but amid a furor from conservative activists on the explosive issue he quickly sought to make clear that, while they would not be sent home, they couldn't get in line in front of anyone else. \" paul himself on his plan: \" basically what i want to do is to expand the worker visa program, have border security and then as far as how people become citizens, there already is a process for how people become citizens. The main difference is i wouldn't have people be forced to go home. You '",

Carol denise richardson, 49, was among hundreds of non-violent drug offenders granted clemency by obama, who was persuaded by arguments from activists that drug laws were unfair, the washington post reports. They argued that defendants like richardson found in possession of solid crack cocaine — in her case 50 grams — suffered unduly harsh sentences compared with those possessing powder cocaine, which weighs less and carries a lighter penalty. Richardson had served 10 years in prison when she was released in july 2016 as part of the largest prisoner release in us history. But she lost her freedom when she was arrested for theft on april 13. Defense lawyer mark diaz tells the houston chronicle that richardson couldn't kick her crack habit and had stolen $ 60 worth of laundry detergent that she planned to sell to buy drugs. The same federal judge who sent richardson to prison in 2006 rejected her lawyer's plea for rehab last week, ordering richardson back to the slammer for 14 months, followed by five years of supervised release. \" this defendant was literally given a second chance to become a productive member of society and has wasted it, \" assistant us attorney ted imperato said, per the chronicle.

The girl, now 15, was placed in protective custody on sunday after telling police she had been his captive since march 2014, when a stranger forced her into a car in saitama prefecture. Terauchi, who bore neck injuries when he was found, did not resist when police took him into custody and was identified by his driver's license. He said he attempted to kill himself by slashing his throat with the cutter, an investigative source said. He was taken to hospital and is expected to be discharged in a few days. The police said they plan to arrest the chiba university graduate after he recovers and charge him with confining the girl.

Ajibade died in police custody on new year's day following his arrest on domestic violence charges. Authorities say he resisted arrest and then got combative during booking, with one female deputy suffering a broken nose and a concussion. Deputies put ajibade in an isolation cell strapped to a chair, and he was later found unresponsive, reports the ap. The coroner's report lists blunt force trauma as the cause of death, and nine deputies have been fired. \" there were abrasions around the head and a little bit of blood inside the skull case, \" says chatham county coroner bill wessinger. Both stories point out that in this context, homicide means only that another person was involved in the death, and that it wasn't necessarily a crime. Yesterday, sheriff al st. Lawrence avoided the specifics of the case but defended the use of force when necessary, reports gpb, saying, \" i ' m not running a summer camp here; i ' m running a prison. And i intend to run it as it should be run. \" the local district attorney hasn't decided yet whether to file criminal charges.
