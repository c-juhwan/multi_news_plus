Highlights from seth meyers, trevor noah, and stephen colbert, via the week, the new york daily news, and the daily beast: seth meyers: the host got serious, noting the past week \" feels very much like a pivotal point for our democracy, \" adding: \" it's actually disorienting how blatant trump is about all the shady stuff he does. Trump just admits to wrongdoing and then dares the rest of us to do something about it. \" ( see his clip here. ) meyers: \" nixon famously said, ' i am not a crook.'trump is basically saying: ' i am a crook, and there's nothing you can do about it. In fact, after dinner tonight, i ' m having three scoops of ice cream. ' \" trevor noah: \" i knew something was up when we saw president trump with the russians and they were smiling. [ there are ] only two times a russian man smiles: the day he dies and this. \" ( see his clip here. ) noah: \" what's really sad about this is that donald trump is trying to impress the russians with the fact that he's president? they know! the guy's there like, ' yeah, do you guys know that i ' m president?, ' and they're like, ' yes, that is how we planned it — yes, of course. ' \" stephen colbert: the late show host had perhaps the most blunt take of the night: \" donald trump, if you're watching, first of all: you're a bad president. Please resign. \" ( see his clip here. ) colbert does want one remnant of trump's administration to remain: \" please, please, please don't take sean spicer from us! where am i going to get my daily dose of veiled anger and condescension? \"",

        "summary": "The us state department is warning travelers to mexico about \" tainted or substandard alcohol \" after reports of people blacking out and waking with injuries — or sometimes not waking at all. Since its investigation into abbey conner's death in january, the milwaukee journal sentinel has uncovered more than three dozen cases in which visitors to mexican resorts blacked out after drinking numerous kinds of alcohol, including tequila, rum, and beer. Many victims lost consciousness after only a drink or two and woke hours later with no recollection of what had happened, including how they got to a hospital or their hotel room. One woman alleges she was sexually assaulted while blacked out, while family members say others died. Conner's family believes tainted alcohol may have been to blame in her death, per abc news; she was found unconscious in a pool at the five-star iberostar paraiso del mar resort near playa del carmen after doing a shot at a swim-up bar. Iberostar says it only purchases sealed bottles of alcohol that meet regulatory standards. However, a 2015 report from mexico's tax administration service found 43 % of all alcohol consumed in mexico is illegally made, meaning it could contain dangerous concentrations of chemicals; more than 1.4 million gallons of tainted alcohol has been seized from mexican businesses, including resorts, since 2010.

        "summary": "Tech analysts are comparing it to the early days of twitter: users of a new social media app getting acquainted with something fresh — and sharing some incredibly mundane stuff in the process. Freshly launched live-streaming app periscope ( which twitter recently acquired ) has a lot in common with popular rival meerkat, but one big difference appears to be that users of the former appear very fond of using smartphone live-streaming to show each other the contents of their fridges, writes lindsey weber at the daily dot. The \" fridging \" meme is a \" weirdly reasonable and quite pg prompt for a live-streaming service, \" writes weber, who was expecting to see \" nothing but masturbators \" when she logged on to the service at midnight and was surprised by the diversity of content — and the number of fridges. Product hunt founder ryan hoover tells techcrunch that odd behavior on periscope — and on meerkat, where a man describing a pineapple gained a huge live audience — is a way of overcoming awkwardness in the services ' early days. The fridge thing is \" sort of this insider club that only certain people know about, and it gives everyone a commonality, \" he says. Analysts say it's too early to tell which app will prevail — or whether there's space for two rival live-streaming apps. Mat honan at buzzfeed says periscope is \" gorgeous and fast \" but might struggle to overcome meerkat's \" head start. \" like its rival, periscope is full of \" fascinating, boring, amazing stuff, \" he writes. \" it aims to be a window on the world, but an interactive window that supports not just real-time live video, but also real-time conversations around those videos. \" ( click for more on meerkat, which has been a massive hit. )",

        "summary": "The wisconsin state crime laboratory is testing unusually old blood samples: some that could be from abraham lincoln himself. Today marks the 150th anniversary of lincoln's assassination, and the start of a story around a beige bedspread. It's said lincoln was laid on it at a rooming house across the street from ford's theatre after being shot. It was given to richard lloyd jones — the man who bought the farm lincoln was born on and who would later own the wisconsin state journal — in 1907, reports reuters. He says it came from the nieces of the boarding home's owner; they were moving to italy and wanted it kept in america. In 1919, he gave it to the wisconsin historical society, but he admitted to forgetting the women's names. \" there are spots on it, \" leslie bellais, the society's curator of social history, tells the journal sentinel. \" they could be iron rust spots, but blood has iron in it. \" but there are some possible holes in the story: bellais hasn't been able to prove the existence of any nieces of boardinghouse owner anna petersen, who would have been in the right place at the time jones specified. Further, a photo that exists of the president's deathbed shows a spread without fringe on it, which the blanket in question has, reports wkow. Why test now? \" until recently, you had to cut out a piece of fabric for dna testing, \" bellais explains, \" but now you can just swab it and not destroy the piece. \" so bellais reached out to majid sarmadi, a professor of textile science at uw-madison, who carefully removed a single fiber from the bedspread. That was passed to the state crime lab, which will confirm whether the spots are blood and, if so, try to find dna. Reuters reports preliminary tests were run, with more tests planned for today.

        "summary": "As five more states voted to legalize recreational marijuana last week, denver took it a step further: a ballot measure to allow social marijuana use has narrowly passed, according to vote count updates released tuesday, the denver post reports. The measure will allow marijuana use in \" consumption areas \" at businesses including bars, cafes, and even yoga studios. Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational marijuana, but public consumption remained banned. Backers of the latest measure described it as a way to give tourists — and residents whose landlords ban pot — a place to legally smoke or vape marijuana. \" this is a victory for cannabis consumers who, like alcohol consumers, simply want the option to enjoy cannabis in social settings, \" said kayvan khalatbari, who co-owns a marijuana business and was the measure's main supporter. Under the four-year pilot program, which supporters hope will serve as an example for the rest of the country, \" pot patios \" could spring up at bars and other businesses, though state law bans the consumption of marijuana at places that sell it, krem reports. And because colorado law bans smoking in almost all indoor public areas, you still won't be able to smoke a joint at a bar — unless it's a cigar bar.",

        "summary": "Frequently drinking too much booze does not mean you're an alcoholic. In fact, it means that only rarely. A new study by the cdc and the substance abuse and mental health services administration finds that 1 in 3 american adults meet the definition of heavy drinking — for men, having five or more drinks in one sitting or 15 or more in a week; for women, having four or more drinks in one sitting or eight or more in a week. But of those so-called \" excessive \" drinkers, only 1 in 10 also meets the definition of alcoholism or alcohol dependency, which the cdc says involves \" a current or past history of excessive drinking, a strong craving for alcohol, continued use despite repeated problems with drinking, and an inability to control alcohol consumption. \" the survey of 138,100 adults ultimately suggests that excessive drinking may actually be easier ( though still not easy ) to deal with than previously thought, reports the new york times. \" we need to think about other strategies to address these people who are drinking too much but who are not addicted to alcohol, \" the head of the cdc's alcohol program says. Some studies have found that higher alcohol prices lead to lower alcohol consumption, while zoning laws that lower the number of places serving alcohol can do the same. Roughly 88,000 deaths in the us every year are blamed on excessive drinking, costing the country $ 223.5 billion in 2006, but only 3,700 of those deaths ( less than 5 % ) are actually linked to alcohol dependence. ( last year the cdc found that 1 in 5 women binge drink. )",

In a post on, of course, facebook, zuckerberg explains that he has dropped his controversial plan to create non-voting shares in the company because his shares have become so valuable that he can sell enough to fund his philanthropy and \" retain voting control of facebook for 20 years or more, \" techcrunch reports. Facebook \" was not originally founded to be a company, but to accomplish a social mission, \" he says. The stock has soared to more than $ 170 a share, meaning zuckerberg's sell-off could raise up to $ 12.8 billion. Zuckerberg's earlier plan to create a new class of shares would have allowed him to sell off almost all his stock and still retain control of the company, but it was deeply unpopular with other shareholders, bloomberg reports. Zuckerberg and his wife, priscilla chan, have pledged to give away most of their fortune. Zuckerberg says the share sale will fund work at the chan zuckerberg initiative including efforts at \" curing all diseases in our children's lifetime and personalizing education for every student. \" the initiative is working with \" amazing scientists, educators, and doctors around the world who need support today, not decades from now, \" he says.

        "summary": "You may be naturally disposed toward being a morning person or a night owl — and scientists are now saying that may have a true biological basis that's hard to fight, the guardian reports. Per a study published tuesday in nature communications, researchers under the direction of 23andme lead scientist dr. David hinds checked out the genomes of nearly 90,000 subjects, then compared their findings to answers the subjects provided to a simple online survey that asked whether they felt more drawn to day or evening activity. Scientists found 15 regions of the human genome that were linked to those who claimed they were early birds, as well as the fact that self-described morning folk were less likely to suffer from insomnia, not as likely to be depressed, and more likely to have a lower bmi than their midnight-oil-burning counterparts. The study also showed that out of those 15 regions, seven were close to genes noted for their role in our circadian rhythms, the verge notes. It's been documented before that genes can influence the preference of fruit flies for day or night activity, but this study allowed that examination to be applied to a large group of humans. The study does have limitations — subjects taking the survey may have had different definitions for \" morning, \" for example, and the study didn't take into account geographic locations or season during which they responded, which could have an impact — but researchers are hoping more studies will add weight to their findings. \" we think of our preferences as things that we come up with — things that are kind of spontaneous parts of who we are — but they do have a basis in biology, \" hinds says.

According to the wall street journal, syria has denied using chemical weapons, and russia says the syrian airstrike hit chemical weapons used by rebels.

His choice of language in criticizing the syrian government set off an intense backlash, after he suggested that president bashar al-assad was worse than hitler — without acknowledging that hitler gassed his own people during the holocaust. At the kremlin on tuesday, mr. Putin spoke emphatically against the american accusations, saying he would request a formal examination by the united nations and the international community and trying to cast doubt on the trump administration's conclusions. Mr. Putin compared the white house's arguments to the erroneous intelligence findings on weapons of mass destruction that drew the united states into war with iraq in 2003. \"to my mind, this strongly resembles what happened in 2003 when representatives of the united states showed in the security council what was supposed to be chemical weapons found in iraq, \" mr.

Though he ' ll have the secret service at his disposal, trump will keep at least part of his private force of retired police officers and fbi agents, according to insiders. Politico notes the move will be \" unprecedented, \" as no president has ever maintained a private security force while in office. In fact, no president-elect has maintained such a force after election day. Trump, of course, is the exception to the latter, and continues to employ a security detail led by retired new york city cop keith schiller — seen escorting protesters from rallies — whom trump hired as a bodyguard in 1999. But insiders suggest that schiller's role goes beyond simple protection and also includes acting as an informal adviser and gatekeeper to trump, with a former campaign aide calling him \" the most important man no one has ever heard of. \" \" he knows all the players, all the properties. He has the confidence of trump and of the family. To describe him as a body guy would be very, very beneath the role that he actually plays, \" a transition official says.

            "Presidential transition trump private security force 'playing with fire'the president-elect continues to employ a battalion of retired cops and fbi agents to protect him and clamp down on protesters. Grand rapids, mich. — president-elect donald trump has continued employing a private security and intelligence team at his victory rallies, and he is expected to keep at least some members of the team after he becomes president, according to people familiar with the plans. The arrangement represents a major break from tradition. All modern presidents and presidents-elect have entrusted their personal security entirely to the secret service, and their event security mostly to local law enforcement, according to presidential security experts and secret service sources. Story continued below but trump — who puts a premium on loyalty and has demonstrated great interest in having forceful security at his events — has opted to maintain an aggressive and unprecedented private security force, led by keith schiller, a retired new york city cop and navy veteran who started working for trump in 1999 as a part-time bodyguard, eventually rising to become his head of security. Security officials warn that employing private security personnel heightens risks for the president-elect and his team, as well as for protesters, dozens of whom have alleged racial profiling, undue force or aggression at the hands of trump's security, with at least 10 joining a trio of lawsuits now pending against trump, his campaign or its security. \"it's playing with fire, \" said jonathan wackrow, a former secret service agent who worked on president barack obama's protective detail during his 2012 reelection campaign. Having a private security team working events with secret service \"increases the service's liability, it creates greater confusion and it creates greater risk, \" wackrow said. \"you never want to commingle a police function with a private security function, \" he said, adding, \"if you talk to the guys on the detail and the guys who are running the rallies, that's been a little bit difficult because it's so abnormal. \" wackrow, who left the secret service in 2014 and is now executive director of a security company called rane ( short for risk assistance network + exchange ), said if he were the lead agent at a trump rally, \"i wouldn't allow it. \" but he suggested it's a tricky situation for the secret service. \"what are they going to do, pick a fight with the president-elect and his advisers? that's"

Grand rapids, mich. — president-elect donald trump has continued employing a private security and intelligence team at his victory rallies, and he is expected to keep at least some members of the team after he becomes president, according to people familiar with the plans. The arrangement represents a major break from tradition. All modern presidents and presidents-elect have entrusted their personal security entirely to the secret service, and their event security mostly to local law enforcement, according to presidential security experts and secret service sources. Story continued below but trump — who puts a premium on loyalty and has demonstrated great interest in having forceful security at his events — has opted to maintain an aggressive and unprecedented private security force, led by keith schiller, a retired new york city cop and navy veteran who started working for trump in 1999 as a part-time bodyguard, eventually rising to become his head of security. Security officials warn that employing private security personnel heightens risks for the president-elect and his team, as well as for protesters, dozens of whom have alleged racial profiling, undue force or aggression at the hands of trump's security, with at least 10 joining a trio of lawsuits now pending against trump, his campaign or its security. \"it's playing with fire, \" said jonathan wackrow, a former secret service agent who worked on president barack obama's protective detail during his 2012 reelection campaign. Having a private security team working events with secret service \"increases the service's liability, it creates greater confusion and it creates greater risk, \" wackrow said. \"you never want to commingle a police function with a private security function, \" he said, adding, \"if you talk to the guys on the detail and the guys who are running the rallies, that's been a little bit difficult because it's so abnormal. \" wackrow, who left the secret service in 2014 and is now executive director of a security company called rane ( short for risk assistance network + exchange ), said if he were the lead agent at a trump rally, \"i wouldn't allow it. \" but he suggested it's a tricky situation for the secret service. \"what are they going to do, pick a fight with the president-elect and his advisers? that's"

The network — which usually dominates cable news ratings in all time slots — lost out to rivals msnbc and cnn in the primetime demo from monday to friday last week, according to nielsen. Fnc is still winning for the month of may, however. The five straight days of lackluster ratings gave fox its longest streak in third place since june 2000, 17 years ago. Since debuting in 1996, fox has grown into a conservative media behemoth, easily besting cnn and msnbc in the primetime ratings race thanks to star anchors like bill o'reilly. However, since o'reilly's ouster from the network amidst several sexual harassment allegations in april, and a major rearranging of the primetime lineup that put tucker carlson at 8 p.m. And panel show the five at 9 p.m., the network has lagged behind its rivals. That came into intense focus last week, as fox news downplayed a raft of breaking reports detailing white house scandals, while msnbc and cnn took advantage of the hyperactive news cycle, and were rewarded with strong ratings as a result.

            "Fox news ranked third in the cable news primetime ratings for five straight days last week in the coveted 25-54 demographic — the network's longest streak in third place in 17 years. The network — which usually dominates cable news ratings in all time slots — lost out to rivals msnbc and cnn in the primetime demo from monday to friday last week, according to nielsen. Fnc is still winning for the month of may, however. The five straight days of lackluster ratings gave fox its longest streak in third place since june 2000, 17 years ago. Since debuting in 1996, fox has grown into a conservative media behemoth, easily besting cnn and msnbc in the primetime ratings race thanks to star anchors like bill o'reilly. However, since o'reilly's ouster from the network amidst several sexual harassment allegations in april, and a major rearranging of the primetime lineup that put tucker carlson at 8 p.m. And panel show the five at 9 p.m., the network has lagged behind its rivals. That came into intense focus last week, as fox news downplayed a raft of breaking reports detailing white house scandals, while msnbc and cnn took advantage of the hyperactive news cycle, and were rewarded with strong ratings as a result. Msnbc took the top slot in the primetime demo, averaging 610,000 viewers over",

        "summary": "More details are filling in the story of an australian couple accused of leaving behind a surrogate baby in thailand who has down syndrome, though the additional details seem to be confusing the account instead of clarifying. The aussie couple is denying the allegations, but the surrogate mom in thailand thinks they're lying. It's also possible that the surrogate agency that functioned as a go-between wasn't relaying all the facts to both parties. This much is clear: the unidentified australians paid pattaramon chanbua about $ 11,000 via the agency to carry their child, reports reuters. She became pregnant with twins after the ivf procedure, and she says her doctors, the agency, and the aussie couple learned that one of the twins was disabled at four months, but didn't inform her until late in her seventh month of pregnancy. At that point, she says the parents asked her, via the agency, to abort the disabled twin, but she refused on religious grounds. The couple adopted the healthy baby girl, but not gammy, who also has lung and heart problems. The australian couple now tells abc of australia that they were never told about the boy, adding, \" we saw a few people at the hospital. We [ didn't ] know who the surrogate was — it was very confusing. There was a language barrier. \" ( it's not specified whether the husband or wife was speaking. ) but chanbua tells fairfax media that the couple knew about gammy and explained to her they were too old to care for twins, reports the sydney morning herald. They also paid her about $ 5,000 extra to keep gammy, she says. The twins were next to each other at the hospital, and the husband came \" to take care of the girl but never looked gammy in the face or carried him, \" chanbua recalls. \" if they don't know about the twin then they wouldn't be crying the day that they took the girl out from the hospital [ and home to australia ], \" she adds to abc. As the confusion gets sorted out, an online fundraising campaign for gammy has raised more than $ 200,000, notes the guardian. ( click to read about some us celebs who used surrogate mothers. )",

            "The military on friday identified the soldier accused of killing 16 afghan villagers earlier this week as staff sgt. Robert bales, a 38-year-old father of two who had been injured twice in combat over the course of four deployments and had, his lawyer said, an exemplary military record. The release of sergeant bales's name, first reported by fox news, ended an extraordinary six-day blackout of public information about him from the pentagon, which said it withheld his identity for so long because of concerns about his and his family's security. An official said on friday that sergeant bales had been transferred from kuwait to fort leavenworth, kan., where he had a cell to himself in the medium-security prison there. His wife and children were moved from their home in lake tapps, wash., east of tacoma, onto joint base lewis-mcchord, his home base, earlier this week. Military officials say sergeant bales, who has yet to be formally charged, left his small combat outpost in the volatile panjwai district of kandahar province early in the morning last sunday, walked into two nearby villages and there shot or stabbed 16 people, 9 of them children. Little more than the outlines of sergeant bales's life are publicly known. His family lived in lake tapps, a community about 20 miles northeast of his army post. Nbc news reported that he was from ohio, and he may have lived there until he joined the army at 27. Sergeant bales's seattle-based lawyer, john henry browne, said several members of the sergeant's family moved to washington after he was assigned to joint base lewis-mcchord. Mr. Browne said the sergeant joined the army right after the attacks of sept. 11, 2001, and then spent almost all of his career at joint base lewis-mcchord, where he was part of the third stryker brigade in the second infantry division, named after the armored stryker vehicles. The killings have severely undermined longstanding nato efforts to win support from villages in kandahar, the birthplace of the"

            "The military on friday identified the soldier accused of killing 16 afghan villagers earlier this week as staff sgt. Robert bales, a 38-year-old father of two who had been injured twice in combat over the course of four deployments and had, his lawyer said, an exemplary military record. The release of sergeant bales's name, first reported by fox news, ended an extraordinary six-day blackout of public information about him from the pentagon, which said it withheld his identity for so long because of concerns about his and his family's security. An official said on friday that sergeant bales had been transferred from kuwait to fort leavenworth, kan., where he had a cell to himself in the medium-security prison there. His wife and children were moved from their home in lake tapps, wash., east of tacoma, onto joint base lewis-mcchord, his home base, earlier this week. Military officials say sergeant bales, who has yet to be formally charged, left his small combat outpost in the volatile panjwai district of kandahar province early in the morning last sunday, walked into two nearby villages and there shot or stabbed 16 people, 9 of them children. Little more than the outlines of sergeant bales's life are publicly known. His family lived in lake tapps, a community about 20 miles northeast of his army post. Nbc news reported that he was from ohio, and he may have lived there until he joined the army at 27. Sergeant bales's seattle-based lawyer, john henry browne, said several members of the sergeant's family moved to washington after he was assigned to joint base lewis-mcchord. Mr. Browne said the sergeant joined the army right after the attacks of sept. 11, 2001, and then spent almost all of his career at joint base lewis-mcchord, where he was part of the third stryker brigade in the second infantry division, named after the armored stryker vehicles. The killings have severely undermined longstanding nato efforts to win support from villages in kandahar, the birthplace of the"

Crowther's body was found six months after the towers fell, in an area the commander of the port authority police department's rescue and recovery operation at ground zero says was where nearly a dozen firefighters \" were seconds away from being clear, \" reports the new york post. As more details emerged, crowther's parents were able to find some of the survivors he's credited with saving. \" to know that welles in that figurative sense took off the equity trader hat and put it on the table, picked up his helmet — firefighter's helmet and went to work.

        "summary": "The big news from the nfl this week isn't about anthems or playoff races: it's the benching of eli manning. The 36-year-old qb has started 210 straight games for the new york giants, but that streak dating back to 2004 ends on sunday, reports espn. The reason is the team's awful 2-9 record, but the decision by coach ben mcadoo is still a stunner. One high-profile reaction comes from actress kate mara, who tweeted \" eli \" and a broken heart, per the daily news. It's of note because mara just happens to be the niece of giants owner john mara, who was presumably clued in on the decision. New york post columnist kevin kernan complains that the giants'transition from being \" the classiest of franchises \" to the \" most clueless of franchises \" is complete with the move he sees as disloyal and pointless. Mcadoo offered manning the chance to start to retain his streak, but knowing that he'd be replaced by backup geno smith. Manning declined. \" my feeling is that if you are going to play the other guys, play them, \" he said. \" starting just to keep the streak going and knowing you won't finish the game and have a chance to win it is pointless to me, and it tarnishes the streak. \" for the pros and cons, see peter king of sports illustrated, who argues that the benching is a smart move for the team, or vincent frank at forbes, who writes that manning isn't to blame for the team's woes this season.

        "summary": "Driving service uber now operates in 60 cities and is worth $ 4 billion, the boston globe reports. But the company is under scrutiny for more reasons than one, including this big one: a driver hit a 6-year-old girl on new year's eve, killing her, and a lawsuit was filed yesterday. It names the driver as well as the company, and says the app-based service is breaking california laws against distracted driving. According to the filing, driver syed muzzafar, 57, was using the uberx app to find his next customer when he hit sofia liu; the girl's mother and brother were also hurt. Uber drivers \" must respond quickly to a user request for service by physically interfacing with the app, thereby leading to distraction, \" the suit says. State law requires hands-free devices, but an uber driver can't grab a fare without pressing the screen at least once. The family's lawyer also says that uber failed to provide insurance to cover the scenario: muzzafar had no fare in his car when he hit sofia; state rules call for insurance to cover drivers while on trips for uber, says an expert, but it's less clear about insurance for drivers between passengers, the san francisco chronicle reports. Uber says that since muzzafar didn't have a passenger, uber has no culpability in the matter; his lawyer maintains the opposite. \" he was waiting for a fare. He was working for uber. \" police arrested muzzafar on suspicion of manslaughter, but he hasn't been charged.",

Belgium already has a law that makes euthanasia legal for adults, and today's action removes any age restrictions. It's the first country to do so, though the netherlands allows euthanasia for kids as young as 12, notes reuters. The rules set out a number of restrictions: the request must come from a child with a terminal illness who is enduring \" constant and unbearable physical suffering, \" and parents, doctors, and psychologists must support the request. ( the ap lays out the specific steps here. ) supporters say it's the humane thing to do, while critics say kids aren't capable of making that kind of a decision. Two competing quotes from today: pro: \" this is not about lethal injections for children, \" says one of the backing lawmakers. \" this is about terminally ill children, whose death is imminent and who suffer greatly. There are clear checks and balances to prevent abuse. \" con: \" assassins! \" yelled a spectator from the gallery as the vote unfolded.",

That's because the deduction on state and local taxes, including property taxes, will be capped at $ 10,000 starting next year. In us states with a higher cost of living, that could mean a larger tax bill — and so homeowners are hurrying to prepay 2018's taxes before the new year so they can reap the full deduction and not get socked with a bigger tab in 2019. \" you can partially prepay or fully prepay and … postpone the pain for one year, \" says a statement from gov. Andrew cuomo, who signed an executive order allowing residents in new york to prepay, per abc news. Northjersey.com notes many municipal offices are therefore extending their hours during a week that's usually one of the slowest of the year, spurring long lines and phones \" ringing off the hook, \" per a tax collector in montclair, nj. According to congress'tax committee, the current uncapped deduction resulted in a $ 33 billion revenue loss for the feds in 2016, so lawmakers worked the $ 10,000 cap into the tax bill to recoup some of that revenue. One issue that has experts warning residents to consult with an accountant before breaking out the checkbook is that it's not yet clear whether the irs will let these prepayments fly for deduction purposes. Another problem with the plan: not everyone can afford to fork over that kind of money a year in advance. \" not everyone will be so lucky, \" the head of the new jersey society of cpas says in a release. \" it will depend on one's own financial situation. \"",

The las vegas nurse and mom of four died saturday.

At this point her daughter reportedly ran into the house, tammy meyers stepped out of the car as gunshots were fired, and her 23-year-old son ran out firing at the vehicle in response. The suspect is described as a white male, about 25 years of age, roughly 6 feet tall and 180 pounds. \" my word to them is i hope the cops find them first and it's not me, \" bob meyers tells nbc. \" i have four kids.

        "summary": "In an announcement with huge political repercussions, fbi chief james comey said tuesday that the fbi doesn't think hillary clinton's use of a private email server ( actually servers, plural ) warrants criminal charges. Some related coverage: cox media boils down comey's remarks to nine key takeaways. Barring a justice department surprise, clinton will dodge criminal charges — but comey still delivered a damning assessment, writes chris cillizza at the washington post. Noting that more than 100 emails had classified information when they were sent or received, he explains why the scandal may be worse than we thought here. From politico: still, \" the bottom line message from clinton-aligned democrats: with no indictment, this remains a political, not legal, headache. She can handle a political headache. \" \" if comey thinks that this multiple-server e-mail scheme doesn't rise to the level of prosecution, why is the doj prosecuting kristian saucier, a sailor who took a few cell-phone photos of his submarine for his own personal mementoes? \" wonders ed morrissey at the conservative hot air blog. But a post at the liberal thinkprogress explains why criminal charges were never a realistic possibility. Think the controversy is finally over? think again, says a post at mother jones. Need to catch up on what's known about the entire mess? the new york times has an info-graphic explainer. Read the full transcript of comey's remarks here.",

In logan, wolverine believes himself to be one of the world's last remaining mutants. Then he meets a mute girl with claws just like him. Here's what critics are saying: at the ap, sandy cohen explains this is not your typical superhero movie: it's r-rated, darker and grittier than most, and \" packs an emotional wallop. \" but cohen is not complaining. \" if this is indeed jackman's last wolverine film, he's going out in heartfelt, high-class style, \" and perhaps leaving his legacy in the capable hands of 11-year-old dafne keen, whose \" fight scenes are as thrilling and bloodletting as any of wolverine's. \" \" it's a marvel \" with \" the kind of topical frisson and intensity that the dark knight had nine years ago, and no superhero movie has enjoyed since, \" chris klimek writes at npr. Jackman is \" tremendous, \" while the film as a whole restores lost \" integrity and emotion \" to the series, he writes. \" subtle? no.

Director james mangold \" mostly lets logan stand as a showcase for jackman \" and he \" nails it … adding an impressive, complex weight \" to his character.

        "summary": "The health risks of deep-sea diving are one thing — but imagine living underwater for 31 days in a lab no bigger than your average bachelor apartment. That's what jacques cousteau's grandson, fabien cousteau, and five others are doing in aquarius, the world's last undersea research lab. They went down june 1st and plan to stay a day longer than papi cousteau did with his team 50 years ago, as they investigate ocean changes off the florida keys. So how does it affect the human body? per popular science: \" creeping crud \": this term describes all kinds of skin maladies, from rashes to acne to diaper rash. The latter is caused by peeing in one's wetsuit ( they all do it, apparently ). Inert gases: cousteau's team will gradually soak up the gases that could damage or kill your typical scuba diver when returning to the surface. After 31 days, they ' ll be slowly decompressed for about 18 hours before heading home, reports msn. Hunger and taste: many aquanauts lose some sense of taste down below — possibly because fewer airborne food odors float in the dense undersea air, one expert says. So what's on the menu? mostly rehydrated freeze-dried camping food. \" unfortunately for me as a french person, the food... Will be simulated, \" says cousteau, cbs news reports. Sleep: generally they're so exhausted, aquanauts sleep like babies. But one says silver fish known as tarpon reflected light near the porthole and made it hard to drift off. Speaking: their voices get higher-pitched when they first enter aquarius. Either their voices return to normal or everyone gets used to the higher sound. Thinking: some aquanauts report feeling giddy or even drunk after a while. That may be the nitrogen saturating their bodies after 24 hours; it's called nitrogen narcosis. Cousteau's team won't be the only one using aquarius this summer: nasa plans to send astronauts there to live under conditions similar to those at the international space station, space coast daily reports.

He can breathe down there, of course. There's an oxygen feed between the surface of the sea a few miles off the coast of the florida keys, where a support team hovers, and the underwater habitat aquarius some 60 feet below, where cousteau and five other people are living this month. \" we're six people crammed into a tube for 31 days, into something the size of a school bus. \" that's how cousteau — yes, grandson of jacques — described this experiment, dubbed \" mission 31, \" when we spoke a few months ago. The undersea lab is about 43 feet long and nine feet wide, which is minuscule compared with, for instance, a royal navy submarine. ( those are about 275 feet long and 30 feet wide, according to the bbc. U.s. Navy submarines have comparable dimensions. ) \" is it physiologically possible to live longer than 31 days underwater? absolutely, it's possible, technologically and physiologically, \" cousteau told me. \" now, psychologically, that's really up to the individual because of several factors — being separated from friends",

In the past, china has called for \" severe punishment \" for apple, says reuters. Still, the company shouldn't take it too personally. Other us-based tech companies have also incurred china's wrath — including google, microsoft, and ibm — but the country sends one more dig cupertino's way: it also thinks apple has poor customer service. Apple hasn't commented yet on the accusations.",

An \" armed and dangerous wanted parolee \" led police on a high-speed chase thursday and was ultimately shot and killed, butte county district attorney mike ramsey says, per the washington post. An officer responding to a report of a car parked for three days in a store lot in butte county's evacuation zone had called for backup after finding the vehicle registered to the 48-year-old felon asleep in the driver's seat. Described as a suspect in a 2014 double homicide, the man was sentenced in 2016 to seven years in prison after police found a pipe bomb on his property. Paroled this past may, he stopped reporting to his parole officer after two months. \" you guys should have left me alone. I ' m not going back, \" the man said after officers woke him, according to ramsey. He then sped off down highway 70 at 90mph before officers stopped his vehicle with spike strips. As a police dog was released, ramsey says the man pulled a metallic object from his pocket and pointed it at officers, six of whom opened fire. The subject — whose identity is being withheld pending notification of next of kin — died of gunshot wounds to the head and torso, per the san francisco chronicle. The redding record searchlight reports he was actually unarmed; it isn't clear what item was in his hand. The police k9 and a pit bull that had emerged from the subject's car to attack the dog were also killed. ( more than 600 people are unaccounted for in the region, where police have also been hit hard. )",

He then notes that cameras had begun going off in the back of the room, and a mixture of laughter, booing, and clapping can be heard. Listen and watch for yourself here. The exchange has led to coverage such as this in the guardian: \" this prompts some boos and hisses - something i've not heard before, \" wrote one of the newspaper's journalists blogging the event. Headlines such as \" trump booed at davos after trashing press, \" per mediaite, also were cropping up. One of those in attendance was washington post reporter ishaan tharoor, who tweeted about the source of the boos: \" foreign journos sitting next to me booed trump's attack on the press. \" prior to their q&a, schwab sounded a sympathetic note, saying in his introduction that trump's \" leadership is open to misconceptions and biased interpretations, \" per the hill, which says his line was also met with boos.",

Even though those additional job seekers haven't yet found employment, it may signal that americans are feeling more optimistic about their job prospects. Previous months were also revised higher: january actually saw 129,000 jobs created, not 113,000; december saw 84,000 new jobs, up from the initial 75,000 estimate. But the wall street journal calls those \" minor revisions, \" and notes that payrolls grew an average of 129,000 per month for the past three months — slower than last year's average of 189,000 per month. Overall, the journal bloggers don't seem too impressed with this report.

        "summary": "Its sources are just that — \" sources, \" with no more specific identifiers other than that they're in law enforcement — but tmz has an incredible story about an allegedly hush-hush investigation being conducted by the lapd in connection with a knife supposedly found on the perimeter of the former oj simpson estate. Per these insiders, a construction worker found what's said to be a folding buck knife years ago, possibly when the estate was razed in 1998. He immediately handed it off to an off-duty cop who, as the story goes, is said to have secretly taken it home. The officer not only allegedly kept it for years but tried to frame it, which is when the tmz story says the knife's existence came to light. Earlier this year, the now-retired officer reportedly asked a fellow cop to look up the official record number for the nicole brown simpson/ron goldman murder case so he could engrave it on the frame. Instead, the tmz story goes, the perturbed fellow officer told his higher-ups, and the knife-holding officer was forced to turn it over to the lapd. Hair, fingerprint, and dna testing is reportedly happening, as part of a probe that has been deemed \" top secret \" by tmz — the site says that as a security measure the new case has been logged into the police department's system separately from the murder case ( which is still technically open, since simpson was found not guilty ). Tmz notes that under double jeopardy rules, oj couldn't be found guilty even if the knife turns out to be a huge new piece of evidence. Per abc7, the lapd has confirmed it's testing a knife found on the property, though capt. Andrew neiman told nbc4 friday morning it's investigating the report itself.

Ratings for the opening ceremony, which usually draws lots of viewers, were down 8.6 % from sochi. And in 2016, ratings for the summer games in rio were down from the 2012 summer games. Nbc paid more than $ 12 billion over two deals, one in 2011 and one in 2014, for rights to the next four olympics. Cnn says that at the time the deals seemed like \" a sure thing, \" since live sports were predicted to always draw strong viewership, but lately sports including nfl games have suffered from declining ratings. Even so, the last three olympics have made money for nbc, and the network says it expects that to hold true for pyeongchang. Nbc points out that its rights deal includes platforms other than tv, and more than double the number of viewers live-streamed content from the 2018 games than the 2014 games. But even when taking those viewers into effect, total viewership is still down from four years ago.

We know we can win this. \" clinton campaign manager robby mook suggested the clinton campaign won't stop at just the needed 270 electoral votes.

Banksy has issued what's basically a \" vote against a tory, get a limited-edition print free \" offer to constituents in six bristol-area constituencies that turned over seats to conservatives in large measure in the last general election, the guardian reports. The offer popped up on the artist's website over the weekend, telling voters that if they snap a pic of their ballot with a banksy-approved vote ( i.e., not for a tory ), he ' ll mail them a print on \" archival quality paper. \" the independent notes that the print, which shows a child watching a balloon with the uk flag on it float away, is a revamping of a previous banksy rendering and will be issued june 9. A note at the end of banksy's post, meant to fend off bribery charges, says the print is just a \" souvenir piece of campaign material \" that \" is no way meant to influence the choices of the electorate. \" however, it isn't only the bribery issue that's a concern: there's also a uk law against ballot selfies, which could get some of his fans in trouble if they capture proof of their vote.

Here's a timeline, courtesy tmz: sunday night: bynes allegedly tried to get into the retirement home but was turned away because she appeared to be drunk. Management called her a cab, but she was kicked out of the taxi because she didn't have any money. She headed back toward the retirement home, and police were called. She apparently was not arrested, but may have been ticketed. Earlier yesterday: bynes was photographed, apparently pantsless and wearing a terrible wig, at a santa monica bloomingdales. Last night: the fire incident occurred. Bynes allegedly burned some of her clothing and was carrying a red gas tank. Because of the 5150's 72-hour limit, bynes could be walking the streets again by thursday.",

Chomsky believes he was denied entry because the government \" did not like that i was only talking at birzeit and not at an israeli university, too, \" he told the bbc. Israeli officials chalk the incident up to a misunderstanding between the military and civilian government, and say they are trying to reverse the decision. Chomsky, though, isn't buying it: \" there was no misunderstanding. I was invited to give a series of lectures, \" he told the guardian. \" it was straightforward, i do it all the time. \" and to haaretz, he added, \" i find it hard to think of a similar case, in which entry to a person is denied because he is not lecturing in tel aviv. Perhaps only in stalinist regimes. \" the linguist added that he would now not have time to visit birzeit, even if he was immediately cleared for entry.",

The first time around, the bill failed on the last day of a special legislative session; gov. Rick perry called for a second special session to start today, and republicans are vowing to get the job done faster this time. The process must start over entirely, the ap reports, but as long as supporters of the bill can hustle a bit, there likely won't be a repeat of davis ' feat because it will come to a final vote while there's still too much time left in the session for a filibuster. ( \" no human being can talk for two weeks, \" lt. Gov. David dewhurst said saturday, according to the dallas morning news. ) davis was also helped along by hundreds of protesters who cheered until the clock ran out, and opponents of the bill are planning to mobilize again. But this time around, there may be \" more presence by law enforcement \" to ensure that doesn't happen again, says one republican state senator. The state troopers wouldn't comment on specific plans, but a spokesperson acknowledged that \" when necessary, we will adjust our security measures as a situation merits. \" the legislation has already been resubmitted, the los angeles times reports. The session begins at 2pm, and the bill could come up in committee as soon as tomorrow. But it may not come up for a vote this week, if lawmakers break for the holiday. The session can last up to 30 days, but \" we should be out of here in 10 days to two weeks, \" predicted one republican state senator. Meanwhile, davis appeared on three talk shows yesterday, blasting republicans and warning them that \" the eyes of the country are watching. \"",

Bergeson, who was interviewed by jimmy kimmel this week about his run, says people often mentioned he should run for office when he was older, but \" what is the point in waiting to try to help your homeland, \" notes his campaign website. There you ' ll find his platform priorities of health care overhaul, raising the state's minimum wage, and the \" most important issue \": campaign finance and corruption, with his campaign stating it won't accept donations of more than $ 500 from an individual or entity; he has raised about $ 2,200 to date. \" we believe that with a governor truly elected by the people, not the corporate interests, kansas can get back on track, \" the site notes.

        "summary": "A florida state university professor thinks he's solved one of the \" greatest riddles \" about non-avian dinosaurs: did their eggs incubate slowly like those of lizards, or quickly like those of birds? the former, found gregory erickson and his team, and they came to their conclusion by studying embryonic teeth. The team looked at both ends of the size spectrum: fossilized embryos of the sheep-sized protoceratops, whose eggs weighed 6.8 ounces; and those of the massive duck-billed hypacrosaurus, whose volleyball-sized eggs weighed nearly 9 pounds. After running the jaws through a ct scanner and actually extracting some of the teeth, they were able to count lines — called lines of von ebner, reports npr, and likened to an annual tree ring, but in this case, formed daily — in the dentine of the teeth in order to determine age. For the protoceratops, it was about three months; for the hypacrosaurus, about six. That's outside the average range of bird eggs, which phys.org reports hatch in about a week and a half to just shy of three months. It's not just a neat-to-know fact, but one that could have contributed to their demise, per the study. As the verge reports, dinosaur parents could have been tethered to their eggs for six months, making it tougher to migrate and easier to fall susceptible to floods, droughts, and predators. And \" after the asteroid hit \" 65 million years ago, erickson tells npr, dinosaurs had the double whammy of a dearth of resources and lengthy incubation periods that left them ill-positioned to survive. He'd next like to track down specimens of carnivorous embryos — no easy feat, as fossilized embryos are rare — to see if the timing holds true for them, too. ( this dinosaur fossil is one of the \" saddest \" ever found. )",
