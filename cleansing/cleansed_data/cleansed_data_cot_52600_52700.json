Wells, 79, who played mary ann on the show, lost almost everything in the 2008 financial crisis, the friend tells tmz. This year, while already recovering from a major surgery and complications resulting from it, she broke her knee. She now needs to move to an assisted living facility, but it won't take her because she's nearly $ 200,000 in debt, the friend says. \" dawn needs $ 194,000 to alleviate penalties by the irs ( which are compounded daily ) and to pay her hospital costs, \" the gofundme campaign says, though it's seeking to raise just $ 180,000. In a campaign update, the friend quotes wells as saying, \" i just don't know what happened! i thought i would be just fine, but apparently i ' m not. I've found myself with no home, husband, or kids. I thank god every day that i have friends and fans who care or this whole thing would be too overwhelming. \" the campaign asks the public to help \" your favorite castaway, \" noting that she is \" a woman who gave so many people joy over the years. \" as of this writing, it has raised more than $ 46,000. People notes that the campaign is run by someone calling himself dugg kirkpatrick, and points to a twitter photo seeming to indicate he is a hairstylist who has worked with wells.",

Its author, harper lee, was a ticket agent for british overseas airways in 1956, and it was difficult for her to find time to write with a separate full-time job, ozy reports. She discussed this concern with her friends michael and joy brown, a couple her friend truman capote had introduced to her. Michael, who died this year, worked as a writer of industrial musicals — performances, often with big budgets, that us corporations would produce to inspire their workers, the new york times reports in his obituary. Michael brown's work included, for example, a \" love song to an electrolux \" and a dupont musical called wonderful world of chemistry. The work brought in plenty of money, and at christmas 1956, lee found an envelope for her in the browns ' christmas tree. \" i opened it and read: ' you have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry christmas, ' \" she wrote in the 1960s, as the new york daily news reported. Though she was reluctant to accept the gift — which she eventually repaid — the couple supported her during the period, allowing her to quit her job and write to kill a mockingbird. That gift's impact continues to reverberate, as the book still sells more than 750,000 copies per year, ozy notes. ( lee, now 87, has had her fair share of trouble in recent years: she recently sued her agent as well as a museum in her hometown. )",

The telegraph resurfaces the remarkable story of hessy taft ( born hessy levinsons ), a now 80-year-old who in 1935, at just six months, was taken by her mother to a berlin photographer to have her baby photo taken. Months later, pauline levinsons spied her daughter's photo on the cover of the nazi magazine sonne ins hause. Worried their jewish identity would surface as a result, she hurried back to hans ballin, who explained to her that he \" wanted to make the nazis ridiculous \" — and so the photographer intentionally entered the young hessy into a contest looking for the most beautiful aryan baby, one thought to be judged by joseph goebbels himself. The truth of the baby's identity never came to light, though hessy was kept out of public sight by her parents, who feared she'd be recognized. A short time later the family fled germany for latvia, then paris, cuba, and finally the united states. Haaretz points out that taft's story isn't an untold one: in fact, it's published on the us holocaust memorial museum website. But it's getting a fresh look after taft recently gave israel's yad vashem holocaust memorial a copy of the magazine cover. \" i feel a little revenge, \" the telegraph quotes her as saying. \" something like satisfaction. \" ( in other nazi news: was hitler a billionaire tax dodger? )",

Through their website birthornot.com, they are allowing the internet to vote on whether they should have the baby or abort. Don't believe me? check it out for yourself. They claim that this isn't a pro-life publicity stunt, though it's hard to believe otherwise. What is a fact here is that no matter what the reason they're doing this is, it's a pretty despicable thing to do. Some facts the arnolds have probably missed: pro-choice doesn't mean pro-abortion: one can support every woman's right to make her own choice while also finding abortion to be an unfortunate and painful choice.

Obama unveiled the budget in a speech at northern virginia community college, where he focused on a proposal to spend $ 8 billion boosting community colleges, bloomberg reports. Obama estimates that under his budget the deficit would rise to $ 1.3 trillion in 2012, before falling to $ 901 billion in 2013.

The aeroméxico flight went down shortly after taking off in durango, bound for mexico city. The bbc reports a gust of wind may have been a major contributing factor, causing the plane to plunge. The left wing scraped the ground and two engines tore off, with reuters reporting the plane came to rest about 1,000 feet from the runway. The plane then caught fire, but most were able to exit it before that occurred. A young girl who was burned is one of two seriously injured people, with the pilot being the other. Reports on how many were injured in total range from \" dozens \" to 97. Passengers describe the crash to the afp and cnn, which reports the crew was able to activate the evacuation slides. \" the second impact was a lot stronger. This is when i jumped and hit my head against the ceiling. After the second impact, i saw flames in the cabin ahead of me. \" \" when we were already aloft, up high, it felt like the plane was going to level out but just then it plunged to the ground. I think we fell back on the runway because it was a hard surface, then we skidded on the ground until it stopped. I undid my seatbelt and saw flames, and realized we had to jump. There was a hole right next to us where the plane had broken up. I told my girl, ' we have to jump over here ', and we jumped. \"",

        "summary": "Bryan singer, the director who faced allegations of sexual assault before the dawn of the #metoo movement, has been fired from queen biopic bohemian rhapsody. In announcing the dismissal monday, 20th century fox blamed the \" unexpected unavailability \" of singer, noting production had come to a halt on dec. 1. Sources tell the hollywood reporter that singer was absent from the london set several times prior to december, leading actor tom hollander to temporarily quit. There was also reportedly an altercation between singer and rami malek, who plays queen frontman freddie mercury, in which singer is said to have thrown an object. But sources say the dispute had been resolved and hollander had agreed to resume his role as queen manager jim beach when singer failed to return to set after the thanksgiving break. Singer says there was a very good reason he didn't return: he was caring for an ailing parent in the us. \" i asked fox for some time off... To deal with pressing health matters concerning one of my parents... Which ultimately took a serious toll on my own health, \" singer said in a statement. \" unfortunately, the studio was unwilling to accommodate me and terminated my services. \" he also confirms he had \" creative differences \" with malek but the pair \" put those differences behind us and continued to work on the film together until just prior to thanksgiving. \" with only two weeks left of filming, 20th century fox says it will name a new director to the film, which will keep its december 2018 release date, per the bbc.",

The last member of the crew still has not been found, and the navy and coast guard planned to search through the night.

In fairness to the company, it responded to the original tweet just 16 minutes after carpenter sent the request for help, telling her that \" bwi agents are aware of you, and are working to get you out. \" amtrak has now offered carpenter a free train ride over the mess, but that didn't stop twitter users from poking fun at what one guy calls \" the worst customer service response time ever. \" another used a gif of a skeleton holding a telephone.",

The idea is attracting plenty of buzz because of a slew of positives, the notable one being that the drink has 8 grams of protein per serving, the same amount as milk from cows and eight times the amount of almond milk. \" as many non-dairy beverages lack protein, this fact alone may draw consumers, \" observes a post at berkeleyside.com. It also has 50 % more calcium than dairy milk, and a much smaller carbon footprint than either dairy or almond milk. \" the primary challenge is one of flavor, \" says ripple co-founder adam lowry. \" if you just make pea milk the way that you make almond milk, with regular yellow peas, you can get a very high-protein beverage, but it frankly tastes terrible. \" the company says it has patented a system to keep the nutrients but ditch the pea flavor and color, a method that involves blending it with water, sunflower oil, and stabilizers. If this system proves legit, it could open up all kinds of plants to the process and \" disrupt an already disruptive plant-based dairy industry, \" notes a post at food dive.

The ap reports that he's likely to be remembered for his humanitarian work, for lowering the minimum age for missionaries to 18 for men and 19 for women — and for leading his church's support of california's same-sex marriage ban in 2008. The deseret news notes that monson also, as chairman of the missionary executive committee, assigned the first black mormon missionary. No successor has been named yet, but under church protocol, the next president will be 93-year-old russell nelson, who is now the longest-serving member of the quorum of the twelve apostles.",

Activists used a ladder to put a rope around the statue's neck before a group of people pulled it to the ground, the news &amp; observer reports. Protesters, who had gathered outside the old courthouse building in durham in response to the weekend violence in charlottesville, then kicked and spat on the statue. The bronze statue of a soldier holding a muzzleloading rifle was erected in 1924, with the words \" in memory of the boys who wore the gray \" engraved on the pillar, reports cnn. Police officers filmed the toppling of the statue. No arrests were made, though north carolina brought in a law in 2015 banning the removal of monuments to the confederacy from public property without permission from state officials, the ap reports. Police say they didn't arrest anybody because the toppling took place on county property. \" the racism and deadly violence in charlottesville is unacceptable, but there is a better way to remove these monuments, \" tweeted gov. Roy cooper. Protesters called for the removal of other monuments to the confederacy, including the \" silent sam \" statue on the university of north carolina's chapel hill campus.",

Organisers of the folkestone triennial on thursday afternoon revealed details of a project it has been desperately trying to keep under wraps. The german artist michael sailstorfer has buried gold bullion in the sand of the outer harbour beach and once the sea is out, people will be able to come and dig for it. \" i think we might well have a lot of people, \" said the triennial curator, lewis biggs, with understatement. \" it is a participatory artwork. It is about people coming to the beach and digging and possibly finding hidden treasure. Some people will get lucky, some people will not get lucky – and that's life. \" the bars are of different sizes and standard gold bullion marked made in london, although anyone expecting the kind of gold bars you see in heist films may be disappointed. Nevertheless, each bar could be worth several hundred pounds and if you find one – it's yours. Biggs said the work raised intriguing questions about what people would do with any gold they found. \" an interesting part of the artwork is considering whether it is going to be worth more as an artwork.

In his own speech, khamenei unleashed a torrent of criticism against trump. \" i don't want to waste our time to respond to the rants and whoppers of the foul-throated president of the united states, \" the guardian quotes him as saying.

And he seemed to be urging other parties, especially in europe, to stand up to the us. \" european states stressed their backing for the deal and condemned trump, \" he said, per the hill. \" we welcomed this, but it is not enough to ask trump not to rip up the agreement.

At salon, alex pareene takes issue with cohen's use of the word conventional: \" what kind of mind, and person, just automatically thinks of ' conventional \" people ' as reactionary, racist whites? neutral, normal people, for cohen, are always reactionary whites, \" and cohen himself is \" terrified of black people. \" two other writers — matthew yglesias at slate and ezra klein at cohen's own paper — point out recent gallup polls finding that the conventional view, actually, is very much in favor of interracial marriage. Nolan and yglesias both seem to think cohen should be fired, and twitter definitely wants to see him get the boot. \" obviously eliminating cohen-related expenditures would not, on its own, bring the [ struggling ] post to solvency, \" yglesias writes. \" but every little bit helps. \" indeed, cohen has a history of sparking outrage with his columns. See: the time he finally realized slavery was actually pretty awful, and wonkette responded gloriously. The time he sympathized with george zimmerman and noted that trayvon martin did, after all, appear to be \" wearing a uniform we all recognize. \" the time he linked miley cyrus'twerking to the steubenville rape case.",

            "This morning, a few new york city polling places opened late because ballots and poll books were misdelivered. Some voters waited as election officials looked for and retrieved the correct materials. Others voted by affidavit ballot instead, and some left. In new york city, poll workers are expected to be at their poll sites at 5 a.m. Election day morning to set up. This gives them one hour before poll sites open. But elsewhere, it's fairly common to set up before election day morning, according to tammy patrick, an election expert with the bipartisan policy center. \"i was an election administrator for over a decade in arizona and the majority of our sites were set up before election day, \" patrick said. Depending on the facility, they might set up the night before or over the weekend leading up to election day. Setting up early would give poll workers an opportunity to identify misdelivered materials, missing signs, pen shortages, and absent poll workers, and address these issues before voters arrive. New york city executive director michael ryan cited security as a reason to keep the voting material under lock and key before election day. \"we don't have control of the 1,205 poll sites so we need to secure the equipment before election day, wouldn't it be a much worse scenario if",

The team also tested participants ' cognitive and reasoning ability. The researchers found that those who are \" more receptive \" to bs have lower \" verbal and fluid intelligence \" and are more likely to believe in the paranormal, conspiracy theories, and alternative medicine. For actual examples of readily propagated bs, forbes reports phd candidate gordon pennycook and his team turned to the twitter feed of deepak chopra, highlighting tweets such as \" attention and intention are the mechanics of manifestation. \" the telegraph reports the researchers also used this website, which composes made-up pseudo-profound statements like this one: \" growth is the richness of life, and of us. \" the researchers found that participants assigned the website-generated bs and chopra's tweets similar profoundness ratings.

The international humanitarian fact-finding commission has been in existence since 1991. It requires a request by one of the 76 nations that have signed on to it for it to begin its work. Its job is to investigate whether international humanitarian law has been violated. \" governments up to now have been too polite or afraid to set a precedent, \" dr. Joanne liu,",

Bombing of the international medical charity's hospital that killed 22 people last weekend in kunduz, afghanistan. White house spokesman josh earnest said obama called the medical group's president, dr. Joanne liu, to \" apologize and express condolences. \" \" in this case, there was a mistake and it's one that the u.s. Owns up to, \" earnest said. He said obama \" is very eager to get to the bottom of what exactly occurred. \" in a statement issued wednesday afternoon, liu acknowledged receiving obama's call, but repeated her earlier demand for an independent panel to conduct an investigation under the geneva conventions, \" to establish what happened in kunduz, how it happened and why it happened. \" the geneva conventions are a set of international treaties and protocols regulating the conduct",

President barack obama on wednesday apologized to medecins sans frontieres for the deadly bombing of its hospital in kunduz, afghanistan, while the medical charity pressed its demand for an international commission to investigate what it calls a war crime.

Three investigations have already begun into saturday's air strike that killed 22 people, including 12 msf staff. Obama telephoned msf, or doctors without borders, international president joanne liu to apologize and express his condolences, white house spokesman josh earnest said.

Jeb bush accepted the resignation of pac cto ethan czahor after a series of offensive tweets by czahor were uncovered. Now he's under fire for revealing personal info — names, birth dates, and social security numbers — of at least 12,000 floridians, the ap reports. On tuesday, bush posted online between 275,000 ( the number bush's spokeswoman provided ) and 330,000 ( the number an independent audit found ) emails he received during the eight years he was governor in what he says was \" the spirit of transparency. \" \" some are funny; some are serious; some i wrote in frustration, \" he writes on the site. \" but they're all here so you can read them and make up your own mind. \" but a portion of those emails contained the unredacted personal info — as well as intensely personal anecdotes and even requests not to publish the correspondence. Gizmodo notes an email ( which contained the sender's full name and email ) that said, \" please do not make this email public to anybody. I do not want my privacy violated, especially by the media \"; another citizen whose email was posted tells the daily dot she was \" embarrassed \" about an email she had sent about \" illegal immigrants. \" here's where florida freedom-of-information laws get tricky: according to the verge, bush noted in his emails that \" florida has a very broad public records law \" and \" your email communications may therefore be subject to public disclosure. \" but a florida attorney tells the verge that ss numbers are \" both confidential and exempt \" from public disclosure. A spokeswoman for bush, meanwhile, said in a statement that \" this set of emails on our website is an exact replica of the public records on file with the florida department of state and are available at anyone's request under chapter 119 sunshine laws, \" as per the washington post; she also tells buzzfeed that they're filtering through the emails and redacting personal info.",

The film focuses on the best getaway driver in atlanta, who goes by baby, and happens to want to leave his life of crime behind. The problem is that the crime bosses he runs with aren't keen to let that happen. Some reviews: it isn't just a \" brilliant, pulse-quickening gem, \" but \" one of the most entertaining thrill rides of this year, this decade. This century, \" writes richard roeper at the chicago sun-times. It features \" perfectly timed \" action sequences, \" one of the most creative and exhilarating car chases you ' ll ever see, \" and \" spectacular \" acting from jamie foxx, kevin spacey, and ansel elgort. Plus it's \" crackling with originality, \" he raves. Moira macdonald agrees it's a \" zippy thrill ride of a movie \" and \" just what you want a summer movie to be. \" the highlight is \" the way the film marries sight and sound, \" she writes at the seattle times. It's \" uncannily choreographed, with gestures and movements timed precisely to the soundtrack's beat \" and \" dances \" in front of your eyes. Wright \" turns every one of his protagonist's actions into a signifier of mood, thought and character, \" writes justin chang at the los angeles times, referring to one scene in which elgort displays \" the woozy grace of an under-caffeinated gene kelly. \" eventually there's a \" dark turn \" that puts a damper on the fun, but it doesn't take away from the fact that \" this is movie craftsmanship and showmanship of a very high order, \" he says. \" baby driver has it all: thrills, laughs, sex, nonstop action, a killer soundtrack, \" and the list goes on, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. He was especially impressed with the performances. Jon hamm delivers one \" of bracing, nutty perversity, \" while elgort gives a \" star-making \" turn in a \" challenging beast of a role. \" still, it's wright who \" tops himself with this start-to-finish sensation, \" he writes.",

O ' rourke has hired a lawyer and has issued an oct. 14 ultimatum to comcast — a pwc consulting services client — that requests \" a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer, and $ 100,312.50. \" his lengthy timeline begins in 2012, when he says he moved to the golden state and signed up for internet and tv with comcast — and everything started going wrong almost immediately.

They never even got his name right on the bill, he adds. But the worst repercussion, according to o ' rourke, was getting fired from his job after he started calling comcast's controller's office.

The senior author of the study notes that products classified as supplements aren't considered drugs, and thus don't go through the fda approval process ( and may not be stored in childproof containers ). In the case of yohimbe, the fda doesn't recommend its use, as it's easy to overdose. Even the recommended dosage can lead to problems such as high blood pressure and rapid heartbeat, and overdose can lead to seizures and even death. The study found 1,818 cases of yohimbe exposure reported between 2002 and 2012, 78 % of them in children. Of all the cases, 512 were serious; 3.2 % of patients were admitted to a critical care unit, and one died. \" sometimes, parents don't think of keeping dietary supplements away from their kids, because they're not medicines prescribed by the doctor. People think of them as natural, \" another lead author tells cnn. \" but they need to be treated as if they were a medicine. Don't leave them out on the counter. Keep them out of reach. \" ( this herbal \" detox \" sent a woman to the er. )",

            "Regardless the type of dietary supplements — from vitamins, energy drinks, herbal medicines, homeopathic products, to some hormonal treatments — they usually come with big claims about boosting health and wellbeing. While those claims are questionable ( and often unfounded ), the products collectively do enhance one thing: the volume of calls to poison control centers. Between 2005 and 2012, the rate of supplement-related calls to poison centers increased 49.3 percent, researchers reported monday in the journal of medical toxicology. In the final year of data, the centers were getting calls at a rate of nearly 10 adverse exposures per 100,000 people. There didn't seem to be a big jump in use of dietary supplements during that time. Self-reported use among adults has held steady, around 49 to 54 percent, the authors note.

Pehlu khan died late tuesday of injuries sustained when he and 14 other men were brutally beaten three days earlier in rajasthan state, police said. The men had bought the dairy cows at a cattle fair and were taking them home in neighboring haryana state when the mob stopped the trucks, pulled out the men, and beat them, said the duty officer at the police control room in behror town, where saturday's attack took place. Indian television channels broadcast video of the men being beaten with sticks and iron rods, the ap reports. No arrests have been made. Since prime minister narendra modi, a hindu nationalist, took office in 2014, hard-line hindus have been demanding that india ban beef sales — a key industry for many within india's poor, minority muslim community. There has also been a sharp rise in the activities of self-styled hindu cow-protection groups that stop trucks on highways and attack anyone transporting bovine animals. Rumors of beef eating by muslims have sparked violence in several places in northern india. About two years ago, a man was beaten to death by a mob over rumors his family had eaten beef, and two others were killed for allegedly transporting cows for slaughter. In many indian states, the slaughtering of cows and selling of beef is either restricted or banned. The bbc reports that gujarat state recently enacted the nation's toughest laws on the matter — slaughtering cows there is now punishable by life in prison.",

The answer was what mark zuckerberg described as the \" third pillar \" of facebook: graph search. Basically, the idea is to allow people to search for people, places, and things to do through their networks, the official announcement explains. For example, if you were trying to set up a game of thrones viewing party, you might search for \" friends in [ your town ] who like game of thrones. \" going out? search \" movies my friends like. \" dating? search \" friends of friends in [ your town ] who are single. \" the system will be \" privacy aware, \" zuckerberg said, so \" you can only search for content that has been shared with you. \" it will also integrate bing results, broadening the kind of information it can find — though at one point zuckerberg added that he \" would love to work with google. \" the system is being rolled out as a limited beta release starting today.

        "summary": "Scientists monitoring ice loss in antarctica have chilling news: the melting rate has accelerated alarmingly and the ice sheet is now shedding more than 200 billion tons a year, according to a study involving 88 scientists published in the journal nature. The researchers say the rate of ice loss has tripled over the last decade and the melting ice sheets are now pushing up sea levels around the world by around a half-millimeter every year, reports the bbc. Antarctica was losing around 49 billion tons of ice a year in the mid-1990s, which went up to an average 219 billion tons a year between 2012 and 2017, the study found. The researchers, who used satellite data going back more than 25 years, say most of the melting ice comes from the west antarctic sheet, parts of which are in a \" state of collapse \" — and modest ice growth in the east antarctic is nowhere near enough to offset it. \" the increasing mass loss that they're finding is really worrying, particularly looking at the west antarctic, the area that's changing most rapidly, \" university of waterloo glaciologist christine dow tells the washington post. \" and it's the area that we're most worried about, because it's below sea level. \" antarctica has lost a total of around 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 and will be contributing more and more to sea level rise if the current trend continues, warn researchers, who say climate change is the only plausible explanation for the ice loss. \" i think we should be worried. That doesn't mean we should be desperate, \" says study co-author isabella velicogna of the university of california irvine, per the ap. \" things are happening.

        "summary": "Several top executives of a french telecom are slated to stand trial for employees who killed themselves in what prosecutors have called a culture of \" moral harassment, \" the bbc reports. France telecom's former ceo, didier lombard, and six managers are facing $ 35,000 fines and two years in prison if found culpable of workplace bullying. The alleged harassment occurred after france telecom was privatized and executives tried restructuring the company in 2006, partly by slashing 22,000 jobs and retraining thousands of others. \" i ' ll get them out one way or another, through the window or through the door, \" lombard told top managers in 2007. The apparent fallout was brutal, with at least 19 workers killing themselves ( union reps say it was 35 ) and one taking his life during a staff meeting, sky news reports. One employee fatally set himself on fire in an office parking lot in 2011, the bbc reported at the time, and a female worker attempted suicide after hearing she would be transferred for the third time. But french telecom, now called orange, plans to dispute the charges. \" i forcefully reject that plans that were essential to the survival of the company could have been the cause of the human tragedies cited by the complainants, \" lombard wrote when the harassment probe began in 2012, reports the financial times.",

John enochs took a plea deal and was sentenced thursday, pleading guilty to misdemeanor battery. According to the new york daily news, it's unclear why prosecutors decided to drop the rape charges — felonies punishable by up to 16 years in prison — against enochs. But that didn't stop the sentence from immediately being compared to the infamously lenient one issued against stanford swimmer brock turner earlier this month. A woman says she was at an april 2015 party at the delta tau delta fraternity when she went inside to use the restroom, wish reports. She says the next thing she remembers is being naked and alone with an unknown man having sex with her. She says she told him to stop multiple times, but he wouldn't. She suffered a laceration to her genitals in the attack. Authorities say security video showed enochs enter the room with the victim and leave 24 minutes later. Police found a similar case from 2013, and that victim agreed to work with authorities; dna evidence, eyewitness statements, and ids from the women led in september to the two rape charges against enochs. Indiana university has been criticized for how it handles sexual assaults on campus and currently has three title ix complaints against it.

The houston chronicle resurrects the fascinating historical tidbit by way of the science channel's moon machines documentary series, in which engineer donald rethke explained the very precise nature of early space diapers. The maximum absorbency garment system, donned by gemini and apollo astronauts, featured one very specific element: a sleeve likened to a condom with a hole at the tip that enabled the men to urinate into a pouch with a one-way valve in their suits. Three sleeve sizes were available, small, medium, and large. And astronauts couldn't fib, explains rethke. If they decided to order the next size up, the sheath wouldn't fit snugly, and liquid could potentially leak out, causing damage. To make the process a little less embarrassing, the sizes were later renamed: large, gigantic, and humongous. Motherboard notes that the urination issue was first brought to the fore by alan shepard, who spent hours in the freedom 7 capsule in advance of a quick 15-minute \" suborbital hop. \" denied permission to leave the capsule, he opted to pee in his suit — forcing mission control to turn off his biomedical sensors until the flow of oxygen in the suit dried the pee, allowing the sensors to be switched on. Today's astronauts enjoy actual restrooms, though mag systems are provided to astronauts who are operating outside space vehicles.

Australian police seem to be believers: they raided wright's home in sydney on wednesday, reports the new york times. Wired notes that wright — founder of supercomputing firm cloudcroft, per gizmodo — blogged about releasing a \" cryptocurrency paper \" a few months before the bitcoin white paper was revealed in november 2008, though that post was edited in 2013. He also used an encryption key linked to satoshin@vistomail.com. Nakamoto used satoshi@vistomail.com to introduce the white paper. Wright, who owns at least $ 60 million in bitcoin, also has access to 1.1 million bitcoins worth $ 605 million — the same amount attributed to nakamoto. \" i am not from the bloody usa! nor am i called dorien [ sic ], \" wright wrote in a leaked email sent the same day newsweek claimed american dorian nakamoto as bitcoin's inventor. Leaked transcripts from meetings with wright's attorneys in february 2014 also quote him as saying: \" i did my best to try and hide the fact that i've been running bitcoin since 2009 … by the end of this i think half the world is going to bloody know. \" then, in an odd interview at the bitcoin investor conference, a moderator asked wright how he first learned about bitcoin. \" um, i've been involved with all this for a long time, \" he said after a long pause. \" i — try and stay — i keep my head down. \" after sending an encrypted email to wright suggesting he was nakamoto, wired received this response: \" you seem to know a few things. More than you should. \" with a verified identity, nakamoto could be nominated for a 2016 nobel prize, per coinreport. ( click for more from wired. )",

How should men do the exercises? focus on \" the area you sit on when you're sitting on a horse, \" one doctor explains to the new york times, and tighten the muscles you would typically use to stop urinating mid-stream or keep yourself from passing gas. Contract for a few seconds, release, and repeat 10 to 15 times per \" workout. \" another doctor who wants to convince men to start doing the exercises has gone so far as to help create a pelvic floor exercise system, private gym, which includes an instructional dvd and a band with ultralight weights that goes around the penis, in case men want to add a \" resistance training \" aspect, as the times puts it. \" people do cardio exercises for their heart, and they do strength training and work on their six-pack, but the pelvic floor is neglected, \" the urologist explains. Though there's little evidence that male kegels can enhance erections, one doctor calls the exercises \" as good as viagra, \" and clinical trials have shown they can help prevent premature ejaculation and may help with erectile dysfunction.

        "summary": "A massive cleanup effort has been ordered on a quietly devastating oil spill that's been contaminating the gulf of mexico for 14 years. The washington post reports the us coast guard has mandated taylor energy \" institute a … system to capture, contain, or remove oil \" from the affected site off the louisiana coast, infused with up to 30,000 gallons ( about 700 barrels ) of oil a day since hurricane ivan destroyed a company oil platform in 2004, per doj estimates. Contractors commissioned by taylor energy had previously said the oil spill was minimal, at the most around 2,000 gallons a day. If the company doesn't comply with the coast guard's new decree, it could be hit with a fine of up to $ 40,000 per day. To put it in context, the bp deepwater horizon spill dumped 4 million barrels of oil into the gulf before it was capped after 87 days in july 2010; the taylor spill could be at 3.5 million barrels. The taylor spill remained hidden from the public by both the company and the coast guard for six years after the hurricane. It was discovered only when nonprofits and environmental groups investigating the bp spill came upon oil slicks that didn't appear to be related to that particular incident. Taylor energy — which contends the oil \" sheens \" on the surface of the water aren't from leaking wells, but from oil and gas floating up from the oil-heavy seafloor — says full containment of the leak could cost more than $ 1 billion, the times-picayune reports. Still, \" the time to clean this up was 14 years ago, \" a rep for the gulf restoration network says. \" taylor energy has shown nothing but negligence all this time. \" ( the largest tanker oil spill in three decades happened earlier this year. )",

Last week, the coast guard directed taylor energy to decide on a new containment plan and a contractor to do the work. The new method of containment \"must eliminate the surface sheen and avoid the deficiencies associated with prior containment systems, \" the coast guard wrote in an administrative order. The company will be fined up to $ 40,000 per day for failing to comply. Full containment of the leak could cost upwards of $ 1 billion, according to taylor energy.

        "summary": "An ex-money processing manager for brink's company in alabama who had access to bags and bags of quarters swapped out coins for beads and made off with nearly $ 200,000 in 2014, per the fbi. Stephen dennis, 49, has agreed to plead guilty and pay brink's back for the money he's accused of stealing from the federal reserve bank of atlanta while he was working in the armored transport service's birmingham branch ( brink's has already paid the bank back ), nbc news reports. Per a justice department press release, dennis allegedly entered brink's on a day he wasn't scheduled to work in february 2014, took four of the empty ballistic bags in which quarters are stored ( each bag holds $ 50,000 in quarters ), and filled them mostly with beads, as well as with just enough quarters so the coins could be seen in a see-through window on each bag. He's then said to have put the four bags in the coin room and, at some point, stolen 784,000 quarters — about 10,000 pounds ' worth, or the weight of a large hippo, per al.com — worth $ 196,000. An audit in april of that year found the bags only contained $ 1,000 each in real currency. \" what mr. Dennis may have thought was a nickel and dime theft was, in the end, the equivalent of a major bank heist, \" the fbi agent in charge of the case says in the release. \" now, he will be a convicted felon who must repay all the stolen money. \" the us attorney for the northern district of alabama piles it on with coined phrases, adding, \" this defendant may have thought he had quite a haul … but now he carries a heavier load. \" that load would normally include the maximum penalty for bank theft, which is 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine, though it's still unclear how dennis ' plea deal will affect his punishment. ( a new york parking cop swiped $ 89,000 in coins from parking meters. )",

        "summary": "The latest political skirmish over obamacare comes in the unlikeliest of places: the world of sports. As in, the nfl has found itself compelled to issue a statement saying it doesn't plan to help the white house promote the plan. How did it come to this? as talking points memo explains, it started when health chief kathleen sebelius suggested earlier this week that the obama administration would enlist the help of the nfl and its star athletes to spread the word about the coming changes. That prompted top senate republicans to write a letter to the nfl, major league baseball, the nhl, and other leagues strongly suggesting that they butt out because obamacare is characterized by such \" divisiveness and persistent unpopularity, \" reports the washington post. The nfl's response? \" we currently have no plans to engage in this area and have had no substantive contact with the administration \" about the new law, says a spokesman. The nhl and mlb also said they had no plans to help. The flap speaks to the coming pr war ahead of the law's 2014 rollout, notes the post.",

Commissioner rob manfred was reportedly set to tell pete rose on thursday he won't lift the permanent ban against rose that's been in place since 1989, but queries by the new york times appeared to expedite manfred's announcement, which he made monday instead. Mlb.com notes manfred informed rose, both verbally and in writing, of his decision. The \" stark language \" of the league's rules dictates \" that the penalty for a player or manager who bets on a game in which he has a duty to perform is mandatory, permanent ineligibility, \" manfred says in his announcement accompanying the mlb press release. He adds he had instructed staff to gather any new evidence that may have emerged since the 1989 dowd report that helped place rose on the league's ineligible list, based on evidence rose bet on baseball while managing the cincinnati reds — including bets on his own team. In addition to a polygraph test and a private meeting between rose and manfred in september, that new evidence included an incriminating notebook revealed in a june espn report that indicates rose also bet while still playing for the reds. Manfred notes that during that conversation, rose had inconsistent stories, made contradictory statements, and couldn't remember important facts from the dowd document. Another nugget came to light during manfred and rose's meeting that appears to have influenced the decision. \" significantly, [ rose ] told me that currently he bets recreationally and legally on horses and sports, including baseball, \" manfred notes. Interestingly, manfred says that while rose won't be reinstated, that's an entirely different issue than whether he should be eligible for the hall of fame, a debate he says \" must take place in a different forum. \"",

Shrem was no shadowy figure, operating in the dark. He was a known name and an early advocate in the bitcoin community. In 2011 he founded the bitcoin exchange bitinstant,",
