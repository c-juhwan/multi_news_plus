        "summary": "Scientists working in the gulf of mexico tell the new york times they're seeing a \" shocking amount of oil \" deep under the surface. They've located several huge plumes, the largest of which is 10 miles long and 3 miles wide, lending more weight to the speculation that the spill is much, much larger than official estimates. It's not clear why the plumes are forming underwater as they are, but one theory is that the chemical dispersants now being used are at the root of it. In any event, they're depleting oxygen in the water, which could eventually cause major problems for sea life. As the washington post explains, scientists dread the potential impact of the spill on the complex — and largely unexplored — ecosystem of the ocean floor.",

That blog post has been removed and cnn has suspended fareed zakaria while this matter is under review. \" though cnn has pulled the blog post, we found it thanks to google cache. It was posted on august 8th and included this passage which is similar to the lepore article he has apologized for.

He didn't start recording until about 10 minutes into the call, noting \" the representative had gotten so condescending and unhelpful i felt compelled to record the speakerphone conversation on my other phone. \" at gawker, andy cush calls it a \" kafkaesque nightmare \" that kicks off with the unidentified rep asking, \" why is it that you don't want the faster speed? help me understand why you don't want faster internet. \" eight \" mind-numbing, \" repetitive minutes follow in which the rep keeps demanding explanations. Says block at one point: \" i don't owe you an explanation... So please proceed to the next question. \" the rep doesn't.

        "summary": "Tomato juice: it's not something many people crave on land, but in the sky, it's hugely popular. Germany's lufthansa airline, for instance, has said it serves some 53,000 gallons of tomato juice per year — not so far off from its 59,000 gallons of beer in a beer-drinking country. So what makes the drink more appealing up high? well, there are a couple of factors, newsworks reports. First, the history: when commercial flights began, free alcohol was a big feature, but eventually, it got too expensive for airlines to offer consistently. The mixers, however, stuck around. And in fact, tomato juice, like most foods, actually tastes different high in the air. Low cabin pressure means less oxygen in our blood, and low humidity dries out our mouths and noses. This means we don't taste or smell things as strongly as we do normally. Loud background noise can also distract us from a taste experience, an expert told the kitchn this summer. In tests using a flight simulator, subjects said tomato juice tasted better in flight than on the ground. Down low, \" it tastes earthy, it tastes not overly fresh, \" says a lufthansa catering boss. \" however, as soon as you have it at 30,000 feet, tomato juice shows … its better side. It shows more acidity, it has some mineralic taste with it, and it's very refreshing. \"",

            "If you only drink tomato juice while at 30,000 feet, you're not alone. Turns out there's a scientific reason why tomato juice tastes better on a plane. According to charles spence, a researcher and professor of experimental psychology at oxford, your tastebuds can be distracted by loud background noise. That \" distraction \" makes both salty and sweet flavors taste less potent. It doesn't, however, affect umami flavors, which are prevalent in tomato juice. So next time you're in the air, go ahead and order some tomato juice, or better yet, a bloody mary.",
            "Ever get the urge to drink a glass of tomato juice on a flight? you aren't alone, and there's a scientific explanation why. Every day, about eight million people travel by plane. Up in the stratosphere, hurtling along in a metal tube, those people will do some pretty strange things. Like spend 10 bucks on a can of budweiser, watch back-to-back episodes of the golden girls, or buy something... Anything... From skymall. But few high-altitude behaviors are as strange as our sudden thirst for tomato juice. The thick savory drink isn't so popular at sea level, but for many airplane passengers, it's their first choice. Guillaume de syon is a professor at albright college and an aviation historian. He says tomato juice on planes is a long-standing tradition, and it all started in the early days of commercial air travel. Back then, flying could be pretty terrifying. \" the flights were very noisy, there was a lot of vibration, you could hear the engine much more than you do nowadays, so drinking actually was a nice way of calming the nerves, \" says de syon. \" once you got bored of course you would drink some more, and before in-flight entertainment, such as movies, this is what people did, to the extent that by the time they landed, say from a trans-atlantic flight, it was not uncommon to see passengers completely drunk, trying to get through customs. \" but as jets got bigger and passenger loads increased, airlines couldn't afford to serve free booze on every flight. Plus, charging for drinks was a great way to keep passengers from getting belligerent. When the industry was de-regulated in the late 70s, competition got stiff and airlines began charging for more of their services, including food and beverages. Free drinks started to fade away, but mixers — like tomato juice — stayed firmly on the menu. But that doesn't explain why people drink so much of it today."

Lois gibson, a forensic artist with the houston police department, says an undated tintype photo shared with her shows james seated next to ford, the partner in crime who ultimately killed james in 1882 in an attempt to collect reward money, reports the houston chronicle. Sandy mills reached out to gibson after collectors in washington state scoffed at the photo passed down from her grandmother, who told mills her family had concealed james in their missouri farmhouse in the 1870s. Her grandmother, who died in 2006, wanted mills to sell the photo and use the money to buy land. But for 13 years, \" nobody wanted to listen. We got no respect from anybody, \" mills says. \" then we found lois. \" the photo \" was taken when the two men trusted each other and the younger robert ford wanted a picture of himself with the man who had become a legend in his own time, \" gibson writes on facebook, per cnn. The chronicle points out that gibson's work identifying faces has earned her the guinness world record for \" most successful forensic artist. \" indeed, houstonia magazine reported in an august profile of gibson that at least 1,266 criminals have been positively ided because of her portraits, which she produces 120 of each year. In this instance, she compared a scanned copy of the image to other photos of james, focusing on the hairline, brow bone, eyes, cheeks, and the distance between the nose and the upper lip. She's \" positive \" the image is legit. \" this is it, just huge, like finding a t-rex leg bone, \" she says.

        "summary": "You're probably less likely to see an amish kid carrying around an inhaler, because they don't seem to get asthma as often as other kids — and researchers think it's due to the cows, live science reports. In a study published in the new england journal of medicine, university of chicago genetics professor carole ober and her team wanted to see why kids raised amish-style seem to benefit from extra immunity against the disease. They selected blood samples from 30 kids ages 7 to 14 from an indiana amish community, as well as from 30 kids of the same ages from a south dakota hutterite community — a group similar to the amish in terms of their genetic history, cultural values, and lifestyle, including a belief in big families, breastfeeding, and the shunning of modern electronic conveniences; even their diets are similar. The scientists also collected dust from 10 homes in each community. None of the amish kids in the study had asthma, but six of the hutterite kids did, matching closely with results from previous studies. The researchers also found amish blood samples had a better \" innate immune response \" ( i.e., higher levels of immune cells called neutrophils, per gizmodo ), and the dust from amish homes seemed to protect mice from asthma-like responses to allergens, while hutterite dust did not. The scientists theorize microbes from amish dairy farms, which kids are exposed to consistently starting at a young age, may provide protection. Hutterites tend to live in more industrialized, communal communities, where farms are further away from each household. While ober admits it's \" not very practical \" to put a cow in every household, she says if we can isolate which microbes are helpful, they could perhaps be sprayed in the air.

In a new study published in the new england journal of medicine, researchers from the university of chicago medical center and the university of arizona have shown that substances found in house dust in amish homes have a profound impact on the development of the body's innate immune system in ways that protect children from asthma.

        "summary": "Timothy piazza fell down a set of stairs at his penn state fraternity around 11pm thursday in the midst of a party. A call for help came 12 hours later. Paramedics found piazza, 19, unresponsive when they arrived at the beta theta pi fraternity friday morning. He was pronounced dead at a hospital on saturday and a coroner determined his death was accidental, citing numerous injuries suffered in the fall, reports fox 43. But an investigation has raised questions about whether piazza might still be alive if help had come sooner. Cbs news reports piazza, who was intoxicated, fell down basement stairs but was found on a couch on the main level of the home by paramedics. Party guests \" knew he fell at 11 \" but \" they didn't report it until 10: 49 the following morning, hence why we're investigating, \" a rep for the state college police department tells the washington post. \" alcohol was obviously a factor in this and we are also looking into why it took so long to call, \" he added, per northjersey.com. Piazza's father has said the accident happened during a \" fraternity pledge/hazing event, \" without elaborating. Beta theta pi has been temporarily suspended while the investigation continues. In a statement, the frat says it is \" fully cooperating with police and penn state administrators. \" the centre daily times reports the fraternity has also provided video footage, which police are now reviewing.",

Shybot spent the next six days, ending last weekend, avoiding any sign of humans while sending live video to an art gallery in san francisco, cnet reports. The rover was followed by aerial drones, which it also tried to avoid. You can follow shybot's journey, courtesy of a gps tracker, here. Motherboard states shybot is an interesting experiment in a time when most engineers are building robots to better socialize with humans.

        "summary": "That a man who worked as a trucker made a 1,300-mile drive is perhaps unremarkable. But john coster-mullen's destination, and motivation for heading there, were unusual. As npr reports, coster-mullen in 1993 decided he could capitalize on the looming 50th anniversary of the atomic bombs that fell on hiroshima and nagasaki by making small replicas to sell. But after realizing the currently available versions had what he identified as deviations from the true design, he decided to head to los alamos, nm, to view the replicas held in a museum there. He never ended up selling his models, but he did pen a 431-page book that npr describes as \" basically complete specs for america's first nuclear weapons \"; as david samuels explained in a 2008 new yorker profile, the us government has kept those specs under wraps. To arrive at his own, coster-mullen pored over declassified photos ( he insists none of the info he has come by was leaked ); interviewed machinists, scientists, and engineers; attended reunions of the servicemen who dropped the bombs; analyzed bolts and screws; and much more. Among the more: upon arriving in los alamos, he found the area of the museum he wanted to access closed for renovations; he ultimately gained access and spent hours with his son measuring bomb casings. The result is the book atom bombs: the top secret inside story of little boy and fat man, which samuels wrote has a \" mind-numbing \" but \" strangely seductive... Accumulation of detail.... I felt that i could practically assemble an atomic weapon myself. \" and that's the point. \" it is so easy, \" coster-mullen, now 71, tells npr. \" the hard part is creating the nuclear fuel. \" ( the original us nuclear tests actually messed up kodak film. )",

Ancona's kkk group is among the newest and most visible of the klan factions in the country, although it's not considered the largest. Founded around 2009, the traditionalist american knights have made headlines in recent years for such actions as distributing fliers during the ferguson, mo., protests warning that they were poised to use lethal force to protect themselves from demonstrators. The group also regularly leaflets neighborhoods in cities around the country in an effort to recruit more members. And three of its members were charged in florida in 2015 with plotting to kill a black man. Jacobsen said authorities learned on friday that ancona had disappeared and that his car, a 2015 black ford fusion, had been located by a u.s. Forest service employee on forest service property near potosi. He said deputies secured the area and on saturday he requested assistance from the missouri highway patrol. \"during the investigation, one subject was arrested on an unrelated warrant and two search warrants were executed in washington county, \" jacobsen said. \"subsequently, a body was discovered on the bank of the big river near belgrade, mo., in southern washington county...

Founded around 2009, the traditionalist american knights have made headlines in recent years for such actions as distributing fliers during the ferguson, mo., protests warning that they were poised to use lethal force to protect themselves from demonstrators. The group also regularly leaflets neighborhoods in cities around the country in an effort to recruit more members. And three of its members were charged in florida in 2015 with plotting to kill a black man. Jacobsen said authorities learned on friday that ancona had disappeared and that his car, a 2015 black ford fusion, had been located by a u.s. Forest service employee on forest service property near potosi. He said deputies secured the area and on saturday he requested assistance from the missouri highway patrol. \"during the investigation, one subject was arrested on an unrelated warrant and two search warrants were executed in washington county, \" jacobsen said. \"subsequently, a body was discovered on the bank of the big river near belgrade, mo., in southern washington county... The body was identified as mr. Ancona, and his family has been notified."

        "summary": "Scientists may not have figured out a cure for cancer, but the tasmanian devil just might have. According to a study published tuesday in nature communications, the marsupial is quickly evolving to fend off devil facial tumor disease, one of only three known infectious cancers. The disease was only discovered in 1996, but it's nearly 100 % fatal and has killed off 80 % of wild tasmanian devils since then, the bbc reports. According to the guardian, it's spread to 95 % of tasmania, the only home of the tasmanian devil. But despite scientific models predicting the extinction of the species, it's still here. Researchers decided to find out why. Looking at 10,000 tissue samples taken from tasmanian devils between 1999 and 2014, researchers found seven different genes in two parts of the genome that appear to be related to cancer and are changing unusually fast. In some places, the genes have evolved in just six generations, what study author dr. Andrew storfer tells the bbc is a \" very short period of evolutionary time. \" not only could these genes one day help fight cancer in humans, but they give hope for the dwindling tasmanian devil population. \" i think that's the only thing that can save the devils — that it ' ll save itself, \" researcher menna jones tells abc.

        "summary": "Publicly, the military has vowed to do everything it can to combat sexual assault. But privately, it's been in lobbying overdrive to ensure it doesn't have to do much at all, politico reports. While federal agencies regularly lean on legislators, this push by the pentagon has been unusually heavy, and included the unusual step of sending lawyers to capitol hill to negotiate alternatives, hill staffers say. Those lawyers gutted the senate armed services committee's bill, replacing real reform — most notably a provision allowing assault claims to bypass the chain of command — with mild measures the pentagon has largely already implemented. The military is well equipped for such campaigns. Unlike every other special interest group, it has an office in the house's office building, and pentagon-paid officers work as fellows for nearly every member of the armed services committees. \" imagine if we had bankers serving as fellows for the financial services committee, \" marvels one lawmaker who's long supported sexual assault reform.

He accused the majority of endorsing the outcome of a trial \" literally riddled with highly prejudicial attorney incompetence. \" skakel was convicted in 2002 in the bludgeoning death 27 years earlier of greenwich neighbor martha moxley, when she and skakel were both 15. The case has generated headlines for four decades because of skakel's kennedy connection — he is a nephew of robert f. Kennedy's widow, ethel — and the window the case provided into the privileged lives of greenwich's monied residents. Skakel, 56, received a sentence of 20 years to life. But his conviction was overturned in 2013 after a superior court judge declared that skakel's defense attorney had botched the case. \" the defense of a serious felony prosecution requires attention to detail, an energetic investigation and a coherent plan of defense capably executed, \" judge thomas bishop wrote in october 2013. \" trial counsel's failures in each of these areas of representation were significant and, ultimately, fatal to a constitutionally adequate defense. \" a month later, skakel was out on bail. And the state began an effort to put him back behind bars, ultimately filing a 249-page appeal rebutting bishop's conclusion that skakel's conviction was marred by ineffective assistance by sherman. They said bishop's conclusions amounted to second-guessing sherman's reasoned defense strategy. As an example, skakel's appellate attorney, hubert santos, had successfully argued that sherman made a tactical error in failing to suggest that the killing might have been carried out by skakel's brother, who was once a suspect in the case. Sherman did present evidence about another possible killer — a family tutor — and testified that he made a strategic decision to focus on only one alternate suspect.

Kennedy's widow, ethel — and the window the case provided into the privileged lives of greenwich's monied residents. Skakel, 56, received a sentence of 20 years to life. But his conviction was overturned in 2013 after a superior court judge declared that skakel's defense attorney had botched the case. \" the defense of a serious felony prosecution requires attention to detail, an energetic investigation and a coherent plan of defense capably executed, \" judge thomas bishop wrote in october 2013. \" trial counsel's failures in each of these areas of representation were significant and, ultimately, fatal to a constitutionally adequate defense. \" a month later, skakel was out on bail. And the state began an effort to put him back behind bars, ultimately filing a 249-page appeal rebutting bishop's conclusion that skakel's conviction was marred by ineffective assistance by sherman. They said bishop's conclusions amounted to second-guessing sherman's reasoned defense strategy. As an example, skakel's appellate attorney, hubert santos, had successfully argued that sherman made a tactical error in failing to suggest that the killing might have been carried out by skakel's brother, who was once a suspect in the case. Sherman did present evidence about another possible killer — a family tutor — and testified that he made a strategic decision to focus on only one alternate suspect. The state argued that while there may be differences of opinion on the best"

            "Scientists have discovered that limpet teeth may contain the strongest natural material known to man, and that their structure could be reproduced for use in high-performance engineering. The design of racing cars, boat hulls and aircraft are among the possible uses for a hard material known as goethite, which forms inside the limpet as it grows. Researchers at the university of portsmouth say the snail-like creature's teeth contain material stronger than spider's silk - the material previously considered to be nature's strongest. The properties of limpet teeth were discovered by pulling them apart all the way down to the level of the atom.

Limpets use a tongue bristling with tiny teeth to scrape food off rocks and into their mouths, often swallowing particles of rock in the process. The teeth are made of a mineral-protein composite, which the researchers tested in tiny fragments in the laboratory. They found it was stronger than spider silk, as well as all but the very strongest of man-made materials. The findings, published in the royal society's journal interface, suggest that the secret to the material's strength is the thinness of its tightly packed mineral fibres - a discovery that could help improve the man-made composites used to build aircraft, cars and boats",

Women currently need an ok from a husband, father, brother, son, or other male family member to do not only the previously listed activities, but also more routine things such as renting an apartment, getting a passport, accessing health care — sometimes even taking a class or getting a job. \" women should be treated as [ full citizens ], \" activist aziza al-yousef, who's been in the equal-rights fight for 10 years, tells the guardian. The movement to dump guardianship picked up steam in july after a human rights watch report came out on the system and the hashtag #iammyownguardian started proliferating on social media. Not all women are against guardianship, with a female columnist for the arab news saying that while reform to the system is needed, how well the system works depends on each family's dynamic, and that women who live under such systems aren't necessarily \" brainwashed. \" still, an hrw researcher calls the drive to nix guardianship \" incredible and unprecedented. \" \" [ the women have ] made undeniably clear they won't stand to be treated as second-class citizens any longer, \" she tells the bbc.

Sanctions and ignoring warnings from north korea's sole major ally, china, not to do so. \" from this time on, the north-south relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the north and the south will be handled accordingly, \" a statement carried by the north's official kcna news agency said. Kcna said the statement was issued jointly by the north's government, ruling party and other organizations. The seoul government said there was nothing in the north's latest statement to cause particular alarm. \" north korea's statement today... Is not a new threat"

Fields made the comment during a discussion of celebrities whose deaths were linked to substance abuse ( the new york daily news notes that the segment was called \" early train wrecks and tragedy about to happen \" ), and in their lawsuit, the lohans said it was \" totally irresponsible and malicious \" to suggest lilo could soon be a member of that group. The lawsuit was filed just before the one-year statute of limitations ran out, and a lawyer for the family notes that no one ever apologized or issued a retraction for the comment. \" people should be able to feel that if they hear something on tv or read something in the media, it should be truthful, \" he says. \" lindsay lohan is on the way toward restoring her career and getting back on track, and something like this can be very fragile and hurtful to her. \" however, tmz has letters from fox news to a lohan lawyer from a year ago informing the family that an apology was, in fact, made on air, and offering to send the lohans a dvd of said apology.",

Instead, they targeted a lesser-known al-qaeda cell known as the khorasan group — an organization that some us officials see as a \" more direct threat \" to the west than isis, the new york times reports. Khorasan appears to be focused on recruiting western jihadists in syria. The group is attracted by their passports, which could make it easier to sneak bombs onto planes, cbs news reports. Last night's airstrike's hit a khorasan training camp in syria that was \" nearing the execution phase \" of terror attacks against us or european targets, an army official says, successfully disrupting those plans, according to usa today. Pentagon press secretary john kirby says the attacks were to be \" major. \" khorasan's leader is 33-year-old muhsin al-fadhli, the independent reports. A quickly-rising star in al-qaeda, he has been linked to terrorist leaders like abu musab al-zarqawi, the head of al-qaeda in iraq, the washington post reports. Reports from the white house and un note his involvement in al-qaeda efforts in afghanistan, pakistan, and iran; he allegedly took a leading role in both fighting and fundraising for the group. Khorasan also has bomb technicians who learned from ibrahim al-asiri, the man behind failed underwear and print-cartridge bombs that made headlines, insiders tell cbs. The group is pursuing \" high-profile attacks against the west, \" says a counterterror official, noting its \" increasing awareness of western security procedures and its efforts to adapt to those procedures that we adopt. \"",

Todd courser resigned from his seat in the legislature, though it appears he had no intention of doing so when he entered the room 14 hours earlier. The move came after two failed votes to expel courser, 43, as well as a lengthy debate about his affair with rep. Cindy gamrat, 42, who was expelled shortly after courser gave his resignation, reports the detroit free press. The affair came to light after courser sent an anonymous, phony email to gop activists in may claiming he was a \" bi-sexual porn-addicted sex deviant \" who paid for sex with men, per the ap. The email was apparently intended to make courser's affair with gamrat seem less egregious or even unbelievable if it became known. Courser says he and his brother had received texts from someone who threatened to expose the affair. Both courser and gamrat admitted to misconduct and misuse of taxpayer resources but hoped they would only be censured. A special committee had voted 4-0 to expel the pair, but the first vote in the house failed 67-14 as many democrats chose not to vote; a second vote also failed. Only when an amendment calling for police and ag investigations into the controversy were added to gamrat's expulsion resolution did it pass 91-12 around 4am. \" i just felt like it was the appropriate moment to do it, \" courser says of his resignation. \" whether it was the third vote or the fourth vote or the fifth vote, they were going to eventually get me. \" a magistrate has issued a search warrant ordering at&t to give up information about the prepaid phone used in the apparent blackmail scheme.",

        "summary": "There are bad tenants, there are nightmare tenants, and then there are the people who rented a boston-area house and are suspected of leaving it wired to explode after they moved out. The chief of police in milton, mass., says an explosive device designed to cause \" significant destruction \" was hidden inside the home and would have gone off if a certain light switch had been flipped, nbc news reports. The chief says the bomb squad spent several hours disabling the device, which was spotted by an electrician conducting a pre-sale inspection yesterday. The tenants — who are also suspected of pouring concrete down the drains — moved out last weekend, and the homeowner tells cbs boston he believes they're responsible for the device. Whoever the culprits are, they put a lot of work into the device, which was found concealed behind a newly plastered section of closet wall: police say it was wired through several rooms, with a plastic jug of accelerant set to explode when the switch was flipped, the boston globe reports. \" the switch sets off a spark and the gas explodes. Whoever flipped the switch, once the power was back on, would have no idea they were doing it. It took a lot of planning, \" the police chief tells the patriot ledger, explaining that since the house was up for sale and hadn't passed inspection, the power was off when the device was spotted.

Cbs news reports that the suspect — who vowed to hurt more law enforcement officers, told negotiators \" the end is coming, \" and claimed there were bombs planted \" all over the place \" — died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a standoff in a parking garage that included exchanges of fire with police. Police say a sweep turned up no bombs. Another three suspects — including a woman arrested at the garage — were in custody following what police describe as an attack involving multiple snipers during a protest against recent police shootings.

The body of an adult female was found early tuesday in a farm field southeast of brooklyn, approximately two miles from where tibbetts was last seen jogging on july 18th. Authorities say shortly after tibbetts was reported missing, they obtained video footage from an area on the east side of brooklyn.

Apparently it all comes down to planet size and the conservation of energy, cnet reports. \" throughout the animal kingdom, species which are physically larger invariably possess a lower population density, possibly due to their enhanced energy demands, \" says fergus simpson of the university of barcelona. That's quite true on earth, where we have seven billion ( relatively big ) people, and, the bbc noted last year, up to 100 trillion ( tiny ) ants. Which brings us to outer space, where, simpson says, \" most inhabited planets are likely to be closer in size to mars than the earth. \" and \" since population density is widely observed to decline with increasing body mass, we conclude that most intelligent species are expected to exceed 300kg ( 660lbs ), \" he adds. A scientist in scotland says simpson's \" average size calculation is reasonable, \" but doesn't account for gravitational pull — and planets with stronger gravity would probably have smaller animals, newsweek reports. Seti institute researcher seth shostak says simpson's paper, published at arxiv.org, also leaves out evolutionary theory: with humans, for example, it's our ability to walk upright and use opposable thumbs that gave us the upper hand on earth. \" polar bears are large but do not write great literature and build radio towers, \" he says, \" and a lot of that is probably because they are walking around on all fours. \" ( see which moon is the top contender for life outside earth. )",

Researchers at brigham young university showed 232 people photos of food — half salty, and half sweet — and asked them to rate the pictures. The test subjects were then fed salted peanuts, and asked to rate their enjoyment. The study found that those who had looked at photos of salty foods found the peanuts less satisfying than those who looked at sweet photos — even though they weren't shown any photos of peanuts, reports techcrunch. \" in a way, you're becoming tired of that taste without even eating the food, \" says one of the researchers, per the salt lake tribune. \" it's sensory boredom — you've kind of moved on. You don't want that taste experience anymore. \" you do have to look at a large number of photos for the effect to take place, say the authors — the subjects in this study looked at 60.

Research suggests that seeing photos of certain foods, as opposed to eating them, still gives you a feeling of satiation, which makes those foods less appealing when it actually comes time to chow down. Here's how the test was conducted: byu professors ryan elder and jeff larson recruited 232 people to rate pictures of food. Half of the participants looked at ( and rated ) pictures of salty foods while the other half rated pictures of sweets. At the end of the rating period, all the participants were fed peanuts. People who observed salty food the whole time weren't so excited by the peanuts, even though peanuts never appeared in any of their salty food photos. Apparently, just seeing salty foods made those participants all salted out, satiated on the experience of saltiness without orally consuming any salt. Luckily for foodies on instagram, it takes more than a few pictures of a certain food to be satiated on it. \"you do have to look at a decent number of pictures to get these effects, \" elder said. \"it's not like if you look at something two or three times you ' ll get that satiated effect. \" so what do we do with this information? well, the way i see it, this is good news. If you think of humans in the context of all animals, with us simply residing at the top of the food chain, our relationship with food is pretty weird. Wild animals eat to survive, and if something tastes good, it's simply an indication that their body can safely digest that food. Meanwhile, we're putting all kinds of crazy chemicals into processed foods that have now made the united states an embarrassingly overweight country.

The new york times reports that trump gave the go-ahead during a dinner that included advisers steve bannon, son-in-law jared kushner, defense chief jim mattis, vp mike pence, and national security adviser michael flynn. The newspaper wonders whether the right questions were asked, while reuters, quoting anonymous military officials, reports that it was approved \" without sufficient intelligence, ground support, or adequate backup preparations. \" the raid, which was planned under president obama, seemed doomed from the start: somehow, militants got wind of it, perhaps reading low-flying drones as a clue. That led to a fierce firefight, in which women reportedly took up weapons with the militants, in the targeted village. At one point, a us mv-22 osprey made a hard landing that left it disabled, and the american commandos intentionally blew up the $ 70 million aircraft so it wouldn't be captured, reports the washington post.

Chuck schumer, sources tell the new york times. The gateway project is a $ 30 billion plan to build a new rail tunnel between new york and new jersey under the hudson river. A failure of the current rail tubes, which are over 100 years old and in desperate need of upgrades, could be catastrophic for the national economy, one republican senator tells the washington post. But despite the trump transition team listing the gateway project as the country's top infrastructure priority, the president is reportedly now urging republican lawmakers to deny all federal funding for it. Sources say trump believes the project is important to schumer and the president doesn't see why he should give the democratic leader something he wants when schumer continues to block his agenda. Rep. Paul ryan was reportedly shocked when trump brought up the issue with him this week. Under an obama administration agreement, funding for the gateway project was to be split between new york, new jersey, and the federal government. A top federal transit administration official now says that funding agreement is \" non-existent. \" trump's opposition to the project could make it harder for congress to pass a government spending bill later this month. Republican rep. Mario diaz-balart says the project is one of the top priorities to get funding in the bill.",

The president's decision to weigh in forcefully against the so-called gateway infrastructure project, which has been one of the united states'top transportation priorities for years, adds a significant obstacle to getting the project underway in the near future.

Capitol rotunda on feb. 28, 2018. During trump's visit to the capitol, he pressed ryan to oppose federal funding for a key infrastucture project favored by powerful lawmakers. ( aaron p. Bernstein/reuters ) president trump is pushing congressional republicans not to fund a crucial infrastructure project — a long-delayed plan to build a new rail tunnel between manhattan and new jersey — setting up a confrontation that could complicate passage of a massive government spending bill this month. Trump personally appealed to house speaker paul d. Ryan ( r-wis. ) this week to target federal funding for the $ 30 billion gateway project, which would construct a tunnel into new york's penn station to supplement two aging tubes that are at risk of failing in the coming years.

            "West palm beach, fla. — president trump is pressing congressional republicans to oppose funding for a new rail tunnel between new york and new jersey, using the power of his office to block a key priority for the region and his democratic rivals, according to several people with knowledge of his actions. Mr. Trump urged speaker paul d. Ryan this week not to support funding for the $ 30 billion project, two people familiar with the conversation said. The president's decision to weigh in forcefully against the so-called gateway infrastructure project, which has been one of the united states'top transportation priorities for years, adds a significant obstacle to getting the project underway in the near future. Mr. Trump's opposition to the project is in part the result of his belief that it is important to senator chuck schumer of new york, the democratic leader, according to one person with knowledge of the president's thinking on the issue.",

Bernstein/reuters ) president trump is pushing congressional republicans not to fund a crucial infrastructure project — a long-delayed plan to build a new rail tunnel between manhattan and new jersey — setting up a confrontation that could complicate passage of a massive government spending bill this month. Trump personally appealed to house speaker paul d. Ryan ( r-wis. ) this week to target federal funding for the $ 30 billion gateway project, which would construct a tunnel into new york's penn station to supplement two aging tubes that are at risk of failing in the coming years.

Quartz reports advertising company m&c saatchi was testing out what it calls \" the world's first-ever artificially intelligent poster campaign \" in london over the summer. Basically, the company created digital billboards with cameras attached to monitor the faces of passersby, according to citymetric. The billboards — for fake coffee company bahio — change images, slogans, and more based on whether viewers appear happy or sad. It can monitor up to 12 people at a time. \"it's the first time a poster has been let loose to entirely write itself based on what works, \" m&c saatchi executive dave cox tells the guardian. But human copywriters won't be out of a job just yet, the guardian reports. \"it's not writing the best ad in the world, \" says cox, whose creation was using the nonsense slogan \" bahio is the new steam \" for a while. \" there's a lot of weird copy. \" think artificially intelligent ads sound creepy? let cox reassure you. \" we're trying not to be creepy, \" he tells quartz. Citymetric agrees the new billboards — whose creators say won't store images — aren't an invasion of privacy, at least not nearly as much as current web ads based on browsing and social media histories. However, the publication says there will come a day soon when ads are using our heart rates, life histories, politics, breathing, and more to sell us stuff.

Osaka's mayor notes that detection of a missile launch may be delayed, meaning residents may not have 10 minutes to find shelter, but more like four or five. North korea, meanwhile, upped its saber rattling tuesday with long-range artillery drills along its east coast, the new york times reports. The event marked the founding of the nation's military 85 years ago, with the us and south korea also carrying out military maneuvers. A north korean state paper says the entire korean peninsula is being brought to the \" verge of explosion. \" ( a us guided-missile sub arrived in south korea. )",

        "summary": "Malcolm turnbull is either unable to come up with meaningful campaign slogans or is a closet julia louis-dreyfus fan. The australian prime minister has gone on a bender lately with the words \" continuity and change, \" hoping to convince aussies that he ' ll keep some policies of the country's liberal party in place while simultaneously putting some distance between himself and ex-pm ( and fellow lper ) tony abbott, whose own policies were not exactly well-received, quartz notes. But some who've heard turnbull enthusiastically put forth this slogan of late — he threw it out there several times on state tv on monday, as well as on an australian radio station, where he used it four times in under two minutes, per buzzfeed — may feel a twinge of recognition upon hearing it. That's because turnbull, who wrested the pm title from abbott in september, appropriated ( either coincidentally or on purpose ) what quartz deems an \" intentionally stupid campaign slogan \" from the hbo show veep, in which louis-dreyfus ' character, selina meyer, uses the slightly different term \" continuity with change \" during her reelection campaign in the show's fourth season. \" we needed it to be hollow and oxymoronic, to say absolutely nothing but seem to have depth and meaning, \" simon blackwell, the show's writer and executive producer, tells the guardian. \" it did make me laugh a lot when i saw that the australian pm's people had been on the same mental journey and come up with the same meaningless phrase. \" even louis-dreyfus got wind of the sort-of homage and replied with a three-word tweet: \" i am dumbstruck. \" ( the official house of cards twitter account got into it with turnbull a few days ago, per business insider australia. )",

The latest: politico reacts to that tweet by speaking with former gop and democratic campaign operations to find out just how typical it is to take such a meeting. The upshot: not very. Among those it quotes is gop strategist stuart stevens, who put it like so: \" when gore campaign was sent bush debate brief book, they called fbi. If foreign interests offer you info on former sos, you call the fbi. \" trump chief of staff reince priebus on sunday characterized the meeting as a \" big nothing burger, \" and kellyanne conway said much the same in an interview with cnn's chris cuomo monday. \" let's focus on what did not happen in that meeting....

        "summary": "\" coming from a small town in ohio, i had never really experienced celebrating or partying that involved alcohol, \" brock turner wrote to the judge ahead of his sentencing for raping an unconscious woman. He received a sentence widely criticized as lenient despite the fact that his claims about inexperience with alcohol were shown to be lies, the san jose mercury news reports. Prosecutors pointed out to the judge that the former stanford student's seized cellphone contained plenty of evidence that he was using alcohol and drugs regularly while still in high school. Numerous messages referred to drinking and using lsd and marijuana. Video from the phone included a clip described as \" depicting the defendant smoking from a bong and drinking out of a bottle of liquor immediately after taking a ' bong hit. ' \" judge aaron persky — who banned turner from drinking alcohol or visiting bars during the three years he ' ll be on probation — did not comment on the dishonesty. In other developments: gizmodo reports that this meme about turner being a rapist was removed from facebook, outraging users. Facebook says it was removed in error and it's sorry about the mistake. One of two swedish students who interrupted the attack and apprehended turner spoke to nbc's today show monday, describing how they were cycling across campus and noticed something was amiss when they saw turner on top of the woman next to a dumpster. Carl-fredrik arndt says turner started to run away after the two swedes discovered the woman was unconscious. What turner was doing to her \" was really horrible, \" he says. The new york times looks at the record of persky, a stanford alumnus who has been receiving threats since the case came to national attention.

Trump tweet: \" fbi director comey: fmr.

Comey agreed there was no evidence of collusion in a report prepared by the us intelligence community under clapper, but that's different than saying no such evidence has been discovered. The jan. 6 report does not take up the question of contacts between trump associates and russia. Instead it focuses on russia's actions, via cyber operations and propaganda, to try to help trump's election chances and hurt hillary clinton's. Clapper indeed said he had seen no evidence of collusion at the time he left government. But he updated that comment monday with a statement from spokesman shawn turner, saying clapper \" could not account for intelligence or evidence that may have been gathered since the inauguration on january 20th. \" comey, when asked if he was aware of collusion between trump associates and russia, beyond the findings of the report: \" it's not something i can comment on. \" click for more.",

It wasn't just a fluke year: liang zhao zhang, who cleans bart stations in the downtown core, has averaged $ 227,000 in pay over the last three years, reports the san jose mercury news. By sf gate's accounting, he worked 2,485 hours of overtime in 2015, which is an average of 6.8 hours every single day. Except he didn't work every day, notes the mercury news: he used five weeks of vacation time. \" there are so many examples like this, \" says sen. Steve glazer, who opposes a ballot measure that would authorize bart to raise $ 3.5 billion for a refurbishment by selling bonds. \" we can't reward bad behavior. \" but a bart rep says overtime is necessary, including during special events. \" station cleanliness is a priority for us \" and \" hiring more employees would cost more than paying overtime, \" she says, adding zhang is simply taking advantage of the hours available. \" if he doesn't take them, someone else will. \" twitter users are mostly applauding him. \" given how gross bart is, if dude is cleaning it almost every day a year, he deserves the money, \" reads one tweet.",

Gizmodo explains it's not technically a flamethrower — it's more like a \" very large torch \" that's able to shoot blue flames just a few feet — and the washington post says even if it is considered a flamethrower, it's probably legal, as most states allow them if used \" properly. \" musk backs that up, claiming the atf allows such devices that throw flames 10 feet or shorter; he adds he'd be \" way more scared of a steak knife, \" per cnbc. Cnnmoney, which notes the boring company has been selling merch to raise money for its tunnel-digging projects, says boring intends to end sales of the flamethrowers after 20,000 have been sold. As of early monday, musk indicated on twitter they'd sold 7,000 units, which would equal around $ 3.5 million.

The university says it will return the interviews of any members of the ira or of the pro-british paramilitary group who participated in the project from 2001 to 2006, reports the new york times. Nearly 50 people in all were interviewed, with the idea being that their recollections would be kept sealed in their lifetimes and preserved for posterity. But the project began unraveling when the justice department, acting on the request of the british government, forced boston college to hand over some of the recordings, explains the boston globe. It was that development that led to the recent questioning of sinn fein leader gerry adams in a decades-old murder. Adams insists that he's innocent, and that the two project coordinators were biased because they interviewed mostly opponents of sinn fein. A bc spokesperson now agrees that the research appears to be one-sided, while the interviewers in turn fault the school for not fighting hard enough to keep the tapes sealed.",

        "summary": "Florida's st. Augustine was founded decades before jamestown and plymouth, and now the remains of some of those very first american colonists have likely been found. Credit hurricane matthew, reports first coast news: after the hurricane descended on the city in october, david white decided to redo the resulting damaged floor of a commercial building he owned. A press release from the city explains that st. Augustine's archaeologist was doing excavations on an adjacent street, and so white suggested carl halbirt take a look at his floor, too. Halbirt and his team — \" who typically find pottery, not people, \" per the st. Augustine record — found an elbow. Further excavation revealed it was part of a complete skeleton; the remains of three other people have been found, and halbirt believes more graves are present, as evidenced by discolored soil. Catholic practice at the time was to bury the dead under a church floor, and the record reports that halbirt's finds have him thinking this is the site of what he says is \" the oldest parish church that has been documented \" in the us: nuestra señora de los remedios, which was established in 1572. It was destroyed three times, the first in 1586 at the hands of sir francis drake. Ceramic artifacts located near the bones suggest the burials occurred between the two aforementioned years. As st. Augustine itself was founded in 1565, \" this definitely could be some of the first europeans to settle in north america, \" says an architectural historian.

First, they found the right elbow of a human skeleton, and then they discovered it was an intact skeleton, complete with a skull and a very nice set of teeth.

        "summary": "Investigators haven't gone public with any new info about sherri papini's alleged kidnapping since nov. 30 — but the sacramento bee has done some digging. After filing several california public records act requests, it obtained a december 2003 police report that's just two sentences long. What it says: papini's mother called the shasta county sheriff's office claiming papini, then 21, was harming herself but blaming her mother for the injuries. The report doesn't specify if that was found to be true, and a rep for the department says papini's mother was given advice in a phone call at the time. The bee is careful to note that the official police line remains that there is no indication her abduction was a hoax, but the paper quotes a criminology professor as saying while the report is no smoking gun, \" it makes her story even more suspicious. \" it's not the only incident report connected to papini. Her father in 2003 told police that his daughter had withdrawn funds from his bank account. Three years earlier, he had said she also burglarized his home, while papini's sister suspected papini had kicked in her back door. Authorities say they followed up on each report and no charges were laid, per people. \" this really doesn't have any bearing on her case, \" says lt. Pat kropholler, noting the alleged withdrawals were the result of a simple misunderstanding. Though papini's husband has described her harrowing ordeal, authorities have revealed little about papini's disappearance on nov. 2, citing an ongoing investigation. The california mom was found on a roadside on thanksgiving, claiming she'd been taken at gunpoint by two hispanic women, who have not been found.",

Not only did the rapper make a reported $ 100 million from his investment in vitamin water when it sold to coca-cola, but the guardian reports he recently became a bitcoin millionaire — apparently without realizing it. Back in 2014, 50 cent released his fifth album, animal ambition. It didn't sell well and probably wouldn't be worth mentioning except that the rapper decided to accept bitcoin as payment to — as per the international business times — \" stay with the times. \" 50 cent earned 700 bitcoin in album sales, with each unit of the cryptocurrency worth around $ 662 at the time. As of earlier this week, the value of a single bitcoin stood at a much more impressive $ 10,850. Sources tell tmz that 50 cent left his digital stack of bitcoin sitting in his account in the years since animal ambition — despite being officially bankrupt between 2015 and 2017. Now, depending on who you ask, his bitcoin are worth between $ 7.5 million and $ 8 million. \" not bad for a kid from south side, i ' m so proud of me, \" npr quotes 50 cent as saying in an instagram post. \" lol. \" he added in a comment: \" i ' m a keep it real.

Those pedophiles paid as much as $ 11,500 each time they abused him, and prosecutors identified more than 50 overall acts of rape, abuse, humiliation, and bondage. Six men who paid to abuse the boy will serve between eight and 10 years; the mother, berrin t., will serve 12.5; her partner, christian l., will serve 12. They saw their sentences trimmed because they helped lead authorities to the other abusers. Police say the abuse lasted for two years and ended after an anonymous tip. The boy is in foster care and, per his lawyer, doing ok considering what he has been through. The case has been a flashpoint in the country, with deutsche welle detailing the failings that prevented the boy from being rescued earlier. Among them: in march 2017 the boy was removed from the home after it was found he was living with christian, who as a convicted pedophile could not have contact with children; the courts didn't speak with the boy but rather sided with his mother and returned him. As for berrin, the judge described her as initially participating in the scheme in order to maintain her relationship with christian but says she then became motivated by money; videos of the abuse were also sold on the darknet. As for that footage, investigators have said it brought them \" to their limits. \"",

Marcia fudge -- an ohio democrat who had been weighing a potential run for house speaker -- announced on tuesday that she will instead endorse democratic leader nancy pelosi for the job, effectively removing pelosi's most prominent potential challenger so far. \" i now join my colleagues in support of the leadership team of pelosi, hoyer and clyburn, \" fudge said in a statement, referring to reps. Steny hoyer and james clyburn, who are running to retain the respective positions of no. 2 and no. 3 highest-ranking democrats in the new congress.

Tens of thousands of academics wrote to the government in protest after it was discovered that baron karl-theodor zu guttenberg — now nicknamed \" baron cut and paste \" and \" zu googleberg \" — had plagiarized large chunks of his phd thesis, reports the independent. Academics determined that guttenberg had copied more than half of his 2006 thesis from other people's work without giving them credit. Resignation \" is the most painful step i've ever had to take, \" said the 39-year-old baron, who is now expected to retreat to his castle in bavaria to plan his next step, the guardian notes. Before the scandal, guttenberg was widely considered germany's most popular politician, and he is expected to eventually return to politics.",
