The kingsport times-news reports police arrived at a home in bristol three months ago and learned that douglas ferguson, 76, had allegedly tried to attack his son with a chainsaw as the man mowed the lawn — and the son used the machine to protect himself. Per the sullivan county sheriff's office, \" the son defended himself against the attack by running over the suspect with the lawn mower. \" the injuries ferguson suffered to his head and leg \" were as a result of the lawn mower striking and running over him, \" a news release continued, and ultimately led to the amputation.

        "summary": "A us appeals court has overturned the conviction of a former blackwater security guard — and called for the resentencing of three others — who killed 14 unarmed iraqi civilians in 2007, the washington post reports. Nicholas slatten, paul slough, dustin heard, and evan liberty were convicted in 2014 for opening fire on a group of iraqis that included women and children. Blackwater claimed the security guards were under attack, but dozens of witnesses traveled from iraq to testify the guards fired without provocation, according to cnn. Slatten was sentenced to life in prison for murder; he was found to have fired the first shots. The other three men were sentenced to 30 years each for manslaughter. On friday an appeals court ruled the trial court \" abused its discretion \" by not letting slatten have a separate trial from the others as the only guard accused of murder. His conviction has now been overturned, and it's unclear if he ' ll be retried, with the justice department stating it's \" reviewing the opinion. \" in a potential new trial, slatten could introduce evidence to disprove he fired the first shots, the bbc reports. The appeals court ruled the other three guards must be resentenced because 30 years is too long and constitutes \" cruel and unusual punishment. \" the long sentences were due to convictions for using military firearms to commit a felony. But that charge is usually used against gang members and has never before been used against people who were given military weapons by the government and who used them in a war zone.",

The fbi has just released 2,352 pages from its files on kennedy, and they're dominated by death threats, both from anonymous enemies and groups like the ku klux klan or the minutemen, msnbc reports. Many are written in the same hand, and postmarked from boston. \"they're going to shoot my ass off the way they shot off bobby's, \" kennedy once remarked. \"don't run for president or vice president or you will be shot dead too, \" read one succinct note. Letters to the same effect were also sent to bobby kennedy's widow, and to kennedy's father joseph. One tried to extort money from joseph, with the writer claiming to be a professional assassin who'd been offered $ 500,000 to kill ted. \"the only method of saving your son is by outbidding the proposed deal, \" he wrote, but the letter wasn't seen until after its supposed deadline.",

It's not clear whether he was tortured by his captors, but he is physically weakened and experts say that at a minimum, he would have faced the fear of death daily at the hands of a group known for its ruthlessness. For now, the 28-year-old is at a hospital in germany and military officials say he will need a lot of medical treatment and counseling before he can go home to idaho, the new york times reports. The guardian adds, by way of his father, that bergdahl is struggling to speak english after so many years in captivity. To wit, his father sent him a message — in pashtu. More: in a move certain to increase the anger of republicans who opposed the release of senior taliban commanders from guantanamo bay to qatar in exchange for the soldier, taliban chief mullah omar has made a rare public statement praising the deal, the bbc reports. \" i extend my heartfelt congratulations to the entire afghan muslim nation, \" he said. The white house has praised bergdahl's release, but some soldiers from his platoon want him to face trial for desertion, cnn finds. There are conflicting accounts of how he was captured in 2009, but platoon members say he walked away from his post while on guard duty — and at least six other soldiers were killed during searches for him. A senior military official, however, says it is unlikely bergdahl will face charges after his ordeal. \" five years is enough, \" he says. Another critic of the release: the afghan government. \" no government can transfer citizens of a country to a third country as prisoners, \" the country's foreign ministry complained in a statement. Senior afghan officials see the deal as another sign of a us wish to rapidly disengage from afghanistan, and fear the freed commanders will return to step up the insurgency as most foreign troops prepare to leave the country, reports reuters.",

She survived, but german cops at the scene to enforce the eviction made a \" shocking \" discovery: a 26-year-old woman held in \" inhumane conditions. \" \" we believe that this is the tenant's daughter, who was in a physically run-down state and who had lived in there for a long time, maybe even for years, \" police rep stefan sonntag told a local news site, via deutsche welle. When the cops came to execute the eviction, the older woman leaped into the stairwell shaft from the second floor, per sonntag. Police then entered her trash-filled, \" squalid \" apartment, per the ap, and noticed a locked door, which they busted open, the guardian reports. The woman behind that door wasn't terribly responsive and is believed to be autistic. \" communicating with her is very, very difficult, \" sonntag tells the dpa news agency. One neighbor tells deutsche welle that he had never seen the younger woman, despite having lived next to the family for more than a decade, while another neighbor says she thinks the daughter, who made plenty of noise at night ( including screaming and kicking walls ), had been a prisoner for about five years. \" one time, last year, she managed to get out of the apartment, \" that neighbor tells dpa. \" when we saw her we didn't think there was anything unusual going on. \" locals tell german media the younger woman's 15-year-old brother also lives there. The daughter was taken to a psychiatric hospital. The mother, meanwhile, who's in critical condition but expected to survive, may face unlawful imprisonment charges, cops say. ( a maryland couple was accused of locking away their autistic 22-year-old twins. )",

The idea being: if alexei steps out of line, brother oleg will pay the price in prison. It's downright \" medieval, \" declares the headline of a post at quartz by tim fernholz. He notes that this \" hostage-taking \" strategy was common among rulers in the middle ages, and leonid bershidsky at bloomberg also uses the word \" medieval \" to describe the move. Bershidsky rebuts the legal case against oleg and writes that the decision might backfire on putin. \" so far, his enemies are much weaker, but continuing economic problems may mean someday — although likely not soon — putin will meet his match, and the opposition, remembering all his dirty tricks, will take no pity on him. \" ( alexei navalny was detained briefly yesterday while attending a protest for his brother, but he later tweeted that police had driven him back to his apartment, reports ap. )",

            "For the second year in a row, russian president vladimir putin has left it until the end of the year to make a surprising decision concerning a major political opponent. In 2013, he suddenly let former oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky out of prison and allowed him to fly to germany -- because, putin explained, khodorkovsky's mother was dying in a berlin hospital and they needed time together. Today, a moscow court handed corruption-fighting lawyer alexei navalny a surprisingly lenient 3 1/2-year suspended sentence -- but sent his brother, oleg navalny, to prison for the same term. Putin presents himself as a war leader, and the hostage-taking of navalny's brother is an act of war in keeping with the rules outlined in the kremlin",

Wild kangaroos known to frequent the grounds of a psychiatric hospital near lake macquarie on australia's east coast have been attacking some of the 3,000 tourists who visit each week, drawing warnings from city officials, reports the bbc. \" while kangaroos are cute, they are also capable of inflicting injury, \" says local member of parliament greg piper, who describes kangaroos \" kicking out, clawing faces and grappling with people, causing lacerations or significant scratching, \" per the guardian. One man \" required 17 stitches in his face, \" while another suffered a nasty gash to his stomach, piper says, though he claims it's the tourists that are the problem. Descending on the morisset area for the free opportunity for a \" roo selfie, \" they bring snacks ranging from carrots to fast food, and the kangaroos are getting accustomed to those snacks — and aggressive about taking them, piper says. \" it's a spot where you're guaranteed to see kangaroos, so it's understandable that people come, \" he notes. But little gets in the way of a hungry kangaroo. \" i've seen kangaroos lash out thinking the kids [ are ] going to take their food when they're just coming to pat them, \" a tour bus operator tells the guardian. The animals may be suffering, too. Experts warn food other than grass could result in fatal diseases, sugar addiction, stomach ulcers, and other issues related to diet, as well as aggressive behavior, per the guardian and abc australia. Though signs warn that feeding the kangaroos is dangerous, piper is calling for better signage and education.",

That marketplace reported \" unusual activity, \" suggesting the problem could be due to \" a bug in the bitcoin software. \" mt. Gox said yesterday it would continue to prevent withdrawals, a move instituted friday, indefinitely; it saw bitcoin value drop 27 % from its closing price on friday, hitting a low of $ 500 before climbing back to $ 595.74 yesterday — still down some 14 % from friday, reuters reports. Forbes explains that the glitch can enable \" someone to use the bitcoin network to alter transaction details, making it appear that withdrawals to bitcoin wallets have not occurred and enabling the currency to be resent — potentially allowing someone to make a withdrawal twice for only one charge. \" the coindesk bitcoin price index yesterday removed mt. Gox over a \" persistent failure to meet the index's standards. \" according to that index, the currency's value dropped to a low of $ 540 yesterday. A grad student in virtual currency tells the new york times that yesterday \" just confirms what everyone in the bitcoin community has known for a while: don't use mt. Gox. \" for its part, mt. Gox said it wasn't the only exchange affected by the bug, the wall street journal notes. But the bitcoin foundation says the issue is on mt. Gox's end: \" it's really an unfortunate interaction between what is arguably a flaw in the protocol — i would call it a quirk, not a flaw — and mt.

Several men were convicted in the 2015 crime and sentenced to six to seven years in prison, per the new york times. But police said another suspect known as basil — believed to have let the thieves into hatton garden safe deposit through a door leading to a fire escape — remained at large. Though he wasn't identified as the mysterious basil, who's seen in security camera footage from the heist, scotland yard announced the arrest of a 57-year-old man linked to the break-in on tuesday. Police said the arrest on suspicion of non-residential burglary came after \" a number of items \" were seized in an early morning raid at the unidentified man's home in london, reports metro. The man remains in custody, per the bbc. The guardian points out police have never stopped hunting basil, who's also suspected of disabling an alarm before thieves broke into 73 safe deposit boxes, making off with cash, gems, gold, and platinum. Authorities had even offered a $ 28,000 reward for information leading to his arrest, per the times. Ringleaders have claimed they never knew basil's real name. One previously described basil as a former police officer employed in private security, but prosecutors say that might not be the truth.",

        "summary": "The us may have been eliminated yesterday, but instead of mourning, many fans are today toasting a heroic performance from tim howard, who set a world cup record with 16 saves — the previous record was 13. Howard's now-undisputed status as the greatest us goalkeeper ever is all the more remarkable, the washington post points out, because he has tourette's syndrome — something the uk tabloids and fans mocked him mercilessly for early in his career. \" united want american with brain disorder, \" read a typical headline when manchester united first signed him. Howard doesn't involuntarily swear — few tourette's patients do — but he does experience tics and twitches. Except, that is, when the ball is coming toward him. \" i have no idea how i do it, \" he once said. \" not even my doctors can explain it to me. \" in fact, howard has in the past said that the condition might make him a better keeper, and that's actually possible. As the bbc points out, studies have shown that tourette's patients can have a heightened ability to control their voluntary movements. Whatever his secret, americans are grateful, and if this his last world cup — he's 35 — he's at least going out amidst a torrent of love. Some of the stories being posted about howard today include: some fans created a white house petition after the game to rename the ronald reagan washington national airport after him, politico reports. Others briefly edited wikipedia to list howard as us secretary of defense. On twitter, fans created the hashtag #thingstimhowardcouldsave, photoshopping the goalie deflecting everything from the meteor that killed the dinosaurs to the sinking titanic. Even belgium's captain, vincent kompany, showed some love, in a tweet spotted by npr. \" two words.. Tim howard #respect, \" he wrote. Mashable points out an image from howard's senior yearbook floating around the internet that, if real, features a quote that \" could not have been more perfect. \" under his picture it reads, \" it will take a nation of millions to hold me back. \"",

It puts the count at 196 democrats, with 30 senators and 166 representatives listed as plaintiffs in a suit filed in federal court that accuses trump of violating the constitution. The \" emoluments clause \" is what's at play here, just as in the suit filed monday by the democratic attorneys general of maryland and washington, dc. The clause requires trump to obtain an ok from congress before accepting payments or gifts from outside governments, and those suing him argue that his businesses have taken in a multitude of payments from foreign governments since his inauguration — absent that approval. The washington post reports connecticut's sen. Richard blumenthal led the filing for the senate, and he invited republicans to join in ( none have done so ). His take: \" the president's failure to tell us about these emoluments... [ means ] that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we don't know. \" university of iowa law professor andy grewal tells the post their chances of success don't look great: \" because this is individual legislators who don't have any individual injuries, it will be hard for them to get standing. \" the latest \" emoluments \" suit against trump isn't the second such one against him — it's the third.

While studies suggest that students in coed dorms are more than twice as likely to report weekly binge drinking or to have several sexual partners in the course of a year, the verdict on mixed housing is hardly conclusive.

            "The president of catholic university has decided to use a \"slightly old-fashioned remedy \" in an effort to curtail the binge drinking and casual hookups of students: getting rid of the coed dorms. \"we just thought it was a more wholesome environment, \" said john h. Garvey, who became president of catholic last year. \"a little separation is a healthy thing. \" eleven of the university's 17 residence halls are coed, so a campuswide transition will take a few years. This fall, the university will place most freshmen in all-women or all-men halls. The next school year, sophomore halls will go single-sex. Then upperclassmen halls. The decision to return to single-sex dorms, after more than two decades, stunned many students and alumni, who have built friendships and memories in coed environments, although some people outside the university may have been surprised that it had coed dorms in the first place. \"it's easier to make more friends when its coed, \" said rachel l. Martin, 19, who will be a sophomore this fall. \"it's not just the same cliques of girls on the floors. \" even in its coed dorms, the university still assigned women and men to their own floors or wings — and strictly enforced \"visiting hours. \" some questioned just what sort of impact the new policy would have. \"college people are going to be drinking regardless of if there's a girl living above them or below them, \" said bill durdach, who graduated in may and once oversaw a floor of 52 male freshmen in a coed dorm. As for same-sex dorms: \"their behavior isn't any different. And sometimes it's worse, \" durdach said.

            "The president of catholic university has decided to use a \"slightly old-fashioned remedy \" in an effort to curtail the binge drinking and casual hookups of students: getting rid of the coed dorms. \"we just thought it was a more wholesome environment, \" said john h. Garvey, who became president of catholic last year. \"a little separation is a healthy thing. \" eleven of the university's 17 residence halls are coed, so a campuswide transition will take a few years. This fall, the university will place most freshmen in all-women or all-men halls. The next school year, sophomore halls will go single-sex. Then upperclassmen halls. The decision to return to single-sex dorms, after more than two decades, stunned many students and alumni, who have built friendships and memories in coed environments, although some people outside the university may have been surprised that it had coed dorms in the first place. \"it's easier to make more friends when its coed, \" said rachel l. Martin, 19, who will be a sophomore this fall. \"it's not just the same cliques of girls on the floors. \" even in its coed dorms, the university still assigned women and men to their own floors or wings — and strictly enforced \"visiting hours. \" some questioned just what sort of impact the new policy would have. \"college people are going to be drinking regardless of if there's a girl living above them or below them, \" said bill durdach, who graduated in may and once oversaw a floor of 52 male freshmen in a coed dorm. As for same-sex dorms: \"their behavior isn't any different. And sometimes it's worse, \" durdach said.

The 3-2 vote ( three democratic commissioners for, two republican commissioners against ) expands the 30-year-old lifeline program that provides subsidies for phone service. Commissioners voting for the proposal argue that internet access is necessary to compete in the modern economy and increasingly needed by students for homework assignments. \" there was a time when broadband access was a luxury, \" the hill quotes commissioner jessica rosenworcel. \" no more. \" the fcc estimates 95 % of households earning more than $ 150,000 per year have high-speed internet, while only half of households earning less than $ 25,000 per year have it. Under the program, low-income households will receive $ 9.25 per month to spend on phone, internet, or both. Families should be able to use their lifeline subsidies on internet starting in december. The program spent $ 1.5 billion to provide phone service for 13 million people in 2015. The proposal to add internet service to the program increased the budget to $ 2.25 billion, which the fcc believes should allow for another 7 million enrollees. Lifeline is funded by a monthly fee on phone bills. Republicans have argued the program is too expensive and growing too fast.

The president tweeted twice on friday about his attorney general, though his comments were far more tempered than those he made in a thursday interview with fox news. One sample from that interview: \" when everybody sees what's going on in the justice department — i always put ' justice ' now with quotes — it's a very, very sad day, \" trump said, per the hill. The comments prompted sessions to respond thursday that his justice department \" will not be improperly influenced by political considerations, \" and on friday, trump turned those words around on him, quoting that line then continuing, \" jeff, this is great, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the ' other side, ' \" he tweeted. Trump then ticked off several examples of what he meant, including \" comey lies &amp; leaks \" and \" russian collusion by dems. \" he encouraged sessions to \" open up the papers &amp; documents without redaction, \" adding, \" come on jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting! \" the \" documents \" comment is likely in reference to trump's desire that fisa surveillance warrants regarding former aide carter page be fully declassified, reports usa today. The public tension comes as multiple lawmakers are suggesting that trump seems intent on replacing sessions after the midterms, reports politico. Count republican sen. John thune in the opposition on that. \"do we really want to go through that kind of confirmation fight? \" he asked, adding that sessions has support on capitol hill. \" is there anybody we can confirm? \"",

The kansas highway patrol identified the young victim as cadence orcutt, of troy. According to the patrol's website, the crash occurred at 4: 48 p.m. Sunday at 175th and peck road, about 2 miles west of wathena. The patrol said cadence was driving a 2007 chevrolet cobalt west on 175th when she lost control of the car and overcorrected to the left.

        "summary": "The bacterium that wiped out millions in europe in the black death pandemic of the 1300s lives on, and officials say it's resurfaced in fleas in arizona. Navajo county public health officials warn on facebook that yersinia pestis, better known as the plague, can be transmitted to humans and other animals through bites by infected fleas or via direct contact with an infected animal. The officials ask locals near taylor, ariz., to leash dogs, regularly treat pets to protect against flea bites, stay away from rodent burrows, and use insect repellent. Infected people tend to experience weakness, headaches, chills, fever, muscle pain, and swollen lymph glands within two weeks of exposure, reports live science. The washington post reports that the bacterium poses a \" potentially grave threat \" to people and their pets, particularly cats. If treated early enough, antibiotics can cure the disease, per the county's health department. The disease is typically passed from fleas to prairie dogs and other rodents, so a sudden die-off of these animals can sometimes signal the presence of the bacterium. While a plague vaccine for prairie dogs reported in the journal ecohealth looks promising, the disease can be deadly in humans if not treated right away. Most cases are reported in the southwestern us, with about seven fatalities a year. ( santa fe saw three cases in june alone. )",

Police say darsh patel was hiking with four friends in the apshawa preserve when they encountered the black bear, the west milford messenger reports. The friends scattered when the bear started following them and they called police when they couldn't find patel after they regrouped. Police say they found the 300-pound bear \" lingering \" near his body and they killed it with two blasts from a rifle after the search-and-rescue team was unable to scare it away, reports the new york daily news. But while the student from edison, nj, is the first bear fatality in the state in more than 150 years, there have been 146 dangerous encounters with bears recorded in new jersey so far this year, up from 99 last year. A state department of environmental protection spokesman tells the new york times that the bear population is \" out of control \" in the north of the state. \" people confuse black bears with grizzly bears, and black bears are not generally as aggressive, \" the spokesman says. \" but they are still wild animals that need to be treated with respect and distance. \"",

        "summary": "After quincy green was arrested on a gun charge in april, he was supposed to be on house arrest while waiting for his trial. But a tech at the company that supplies and fits ankle bracelets on pre-trial detainees in washington, dc, put the bracelet on over green's sock — that's \" absolutely not \" protocol, per an exec at the company, who says regulations require the bracelets to be placed directly on skin — and apparently didn't realize that sock was covering a prosthetic leg. So, police say, green simply took off the leg, replaced it with another one he had, and was able to leave his house. That's how, they allege, he was able to go to an area that fox 5 dc reports he had specifically been ordered to stay away from and where he allegedly shot and killed dana hamilton around 2: 40am on may 19. \" that man was supposed to be in his house, \" hamilton's mother tells the washington post. Authorities haven't disclosed a possible motive. Hamilton, who lived with his mother, was on disability due to heart problems. He had told his mother he was going to distribute religious pamphlets, got into a van with some friends, and ended up at an apartment complex in dc where his family had lived decades ago and where his 22-year-old brother had been shot and killed. Surveillance video shows green, 44, with two men near that complex, drinking alcohol, on the morning of the shooting, police say, and it allegedly also shows him holding a gun and shooting a few times at a fleeing man. But, after a witness identified green as the suspect, police were told the gps readings from his ankle bracelet showed that he had been home, a mile away, at the time. After getting a search warrant, they found the bracelet on the prosthetic leg in a box. He has been charged with second-degree murder, the police department says. ( this woman got fired after uninstalling a gps tracking app. )",

        "summary": "Instead of being offered burn cream, mcdonald's workers who suffered severe burns on the job were asked if they wanted mustard or ketchup on that, according to recently filed safety complaints. In some of the 28 safety complaints filed in 19 states over the last couple of weeks with the help of the fight for $ 15 labor group, workers say mcdonald's restaurants were short of first-aid kits and other safety equipment, reports the guardian. The workers say conditions were made even more unsafe by pressure to work too fast and a lack of proper training on dealing with things like grease traps, the christian science monitor reports. The complaints say condiments like ketchup or mayonnaise — but apparently not special sauce — were suggested as treatment when workers suffered burns. \"my managers kept pushing me to work faster, and while trying to meet their demands i slipped on a wet floor, catching my arm on a hot grill, \" a mcdonald's worker in chicago tells the guardian. \" the managers told me to put mustard on it, but i ended up having to get rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. \" the organizing director of fight for $ 15 accuses mcdonald's of turning a blind eye to safety issues while closely monitoring everything else about franchisee operations. And it's not just mcdonald's: according to a hart research survey, a third of fast-food workers who suffered a burn injury on the job say managers suggested using condiments as treatment, the bbc reports. ( last month, a therapy kangaroo was kicked out of a mcdonald's in wisconsin. )",

House republicans have spent months putting together \" a policy agenda that offers a better way forward \" for the usa, ryan explains in his janesville gazette column. That agenda involves \" a better tax code, \" an obamacare replacement, national security and foreign policy changes, regulation reforms to give the economy a boost, proposals for decreasing poverty, and more, ryan says. \" to enact these ideas, we need a republican president willing to sign them into law. That's why, when he sealed the nomination, i could not offer my support for donald trump before discussing policies and basic principles, \" ryan writes. The two men have now had many such discussions, and now ryan says he feels confident trump would help the gop enact its policy agenda. \" it's no secret that he and i have our differences. I won't pretend otherwise. And when i feel the need to, i ' ll continue to speak my mind. But the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement. \" ryan, who doesn't actually use the word \" endorse \" in the column, says he ' ll be voting for trump. As the post notes, ryan is \" the last senior republican congressional leader to throw his weight behind trump's candidacy. \"",

It is understood the man had been dropped off by a boat to explore the area in his kayak with some water and food. Mr macleod says the tourist could not leave the island for a fortnight because he feared being eaten by the crocodile. He tried in vain to flag down passing boats with a small fire, which probably looked like a fisherman's campfire.

The good news is that guys who play video games \" chronically, \" which at least for the purpose of one new study is defined as more than an hour a day, are less likely to ejaculate prematurely than their non-chronic gaming counterparts. The bad news, researchers report in the journal of sexual medicine, is that they're also less likely to be interested in sex. Researchers can't fully explain what's happening — it might have something to do with increased stress levels from playing — but they suspect both findings are related, reports vice's broadly. \" i think that video games might be similar to physical exercise in these regards: occasional use might have beneficial effects, but when some threshold between ' occasional use ' and ' chronic abuse ' is crossed, ill effects might occur, \" says the lead author. In the study, researchers surveyed nearly 400 men between the ages of 18 and 50 in italy about their gaming habits and lifestyle in general. They found that as sex drive goes down, premature ejaculation becomes less likely, per medical daily. One theory is that gamers tend to experience an overstimulation of the pleasure hormone dopamine, which helps stimulate orgasm, so they build up a sort of tolerance to it that makes them less interested in having an orgasm and also less likely to do so prematurely.

But another camp is urging everyone to calm down because the fcc still has the potential to keep isps in check: yes, the court \" vacated the heart of the fcc's open internet rules, \" writes law professor john blevins in the washington post, but it did not curb \" the fcc's ability to act in the future. Specifically, it concluded that the fcc could regulate internet providers under a statute known as section 706, which authorizes the fcc to take various steps to promote broadband deployment. \" in fact, \" the court may have handed the fcc — and the public — a victory that goes well beyond network neutrality. \" much of the decision deals with how the fcc classifies isps, as \" information services \" rather than \" telecommunication services, \" writes jon terbush at the week. \" it's not that the fcc can't impose anti-discrimination regulations on isps; it's that they can't do so unless they classify isps as'telecommunications services, ' which would then subject them to common carrier regulations. \" the agency could change the classification, as many reformers have long suggested. But \" even failing a common-carriers declaration, net neutrality isn't buried, \" writes tim fernholz at quartz. \" both its opponents and proponents believe the court decision has unintended consequences that will empower the fcc to enforce the essentials of net neutrality without re-classifying isps.

A settlement between gm and the justice department could come as early as tomorrow, though the wall street journal — citing \" people familiar with the matter \" — warns any deal could still fall apart. Last year, the government accused gm of taking too long to disclose the ignition switch problem in violation of federal law, nbc reports. The government alleges gm knew about defect — which could shut off the car's engine without warning, disabling airbags and power steering and brakes — for more than a decade before finally reporting it. The journal reports the settlement will likely come with a charge of criminal wire fraud against gm for making misleading statements and hiding information about the problem. For example, a government report found gm avoided using the word \" stall \" when discussing the issue to avoid people thinking it was a safety problem. According to sources cited by the journal and nbc, gm will be fined somewhere between $ 500 million and $ 1 billion. The amount is expected to be less than the $ 1.2 billion toyota was fined in a similar case last year because gm cooperated with the government investigation, the journal reports. According to nbc, gm has already paid out at least $ 1 million to each victim or victim's family.",

A final eviction notice was delivered to her residence and the locks were changed on feb. 10 following a long and bitter legal battle with the landlords who bought her six-unit building in 2002 and sought to turn it into condos, the san francisco chronicle reports. They gave her a ' lifetime lease \" at $ 700 a month allowing her to stay until her death — but as her lifetime turned into a very long one, they sought to evict her, arguing that she had violated the terms of the lease by spending much of her time living with a niece in oakland as her health declined. Iris merriouns, canada's niece, says her aunt's health never returned to normal after the eviction. She says her aunt insisted until the end that she wanted to go back to her home at 670 page street, which a facebook post from the housing rights committee of san francisco suggests still held her possessions. \" in her last hours, she asked family members if they at least were able to recover some of her things, \" it reads. Merriouns recalls her aunt's \" dignity and pride, \" telling the guardian, \" she was not yelling and screaming. She was just simply saying, ' i want to remain in my home. ' \" her case became a focal point for housing rights campaigners in the city. \" something needs to be done to stop our seniors from being evicted, \" says tommi avicolli mecca, director of counseling programs with the hrc.

        "summary": "President vladimir putin's most visible critic was released from a russian jail on monday only to be immediately arrested again and thrown back in. Alexei navalny served a 30-day sentence on charges he staged an unsanctioned protest before being re-arrested on charges he staged a rally that caused bodily harm to police officers, per the ap. Navalny, who has long been the face of russian opposition to the putin regime, denied the allegations and argued he couldn't have organized the rally in question because he was in a moscow jail serving out the 30-day sentence when it happened. Per the bbc, the 42-year-old opposition leader and his allies have said they believe the arrest was politically motivated. It also comes at a time of political unrest in russia, sparked in part by an increase in the country's retirement age. Putin's own approval ratings have dropped amid the outrage and observers say the issue has become a noose around the necks of putin-alligned candidates running for regional offices. It's a wave of discontent that navalny and his allies have harnessed as they organize anti-government demonstrations in cities across the vast country. Navalny's prominence has frequently put him in the kremlin's crosshairs. Just this month, putin's chief of the national guard challenged navalny to a duel and threatened to \" make a good juicy beef steak \" of the opposition leader.",

        "summary": "A simple cheek swab can reveal a lot about your dna, and for 6 million americans who identify as white, mostly in the south, that swab has revealed african ancestry hidden in their genes, the washington post reports. One in 10 southerners have at least 1 % african origins, and the reason isn't hard to pinpoint: slavery. The study, conducted by 23andme, also found african americans today are more likely to have a european male ancestor ( 19 % ) than a female one ( 5 % ). \" that, of course, reflects what historians know about white slave owners raping enslaved women who descended from africa, \" writes jenée desmond-harris at vox. The study even reveals that this blending started in the early 1800s. The study examined the dna profiles of about 160,000 people; the data was compared to where they lived and which race they identified with. They found people with less than 15 % african genes didn't identify as black and the average african american's genes are at least 24 % european. \" descriptors like ' black ' and ' white ' mean a lot less from a biological standpoint than they do from a cultural one, \" writes the post's christopher ingraham. Some other interesting finds, according to discovery: 5 % of african americans have 2 % native american ancestry; the highest is 14 % in oklahoma, where native americans were displaced after the trail of tears. Iberian ancestry was common in latinos from florida and the southwest. Scandinavian ancestry is highly concentrated in minnesota and the dakotas. Native ancestry among latinos is concentrated in texas and california. ( stress also lingers in your dna. )",

            "Six million americans who describe themselves as white have some african ancestry, according to a new study. In percentage terms, that means that roughly 3.5 percent of self-described white americans have 1 percent or more african ancestry. To arrive at these numbers, researchers pored over the genetic records of 145,000 people who submitted a cheek swab for testing to 23andme, a private company that provides ancestry-related genetic reports. The researchers examined the genetic recordsof people of self-described european, african and latino descent to find the genetic traces left by relatives long-since deceased. In order to hit that one percent threshold above, for instance, you'd have to have an african relative no further back than seven generations -- in other words, a great-great-great-great-great grandparent. And as you might expect, there are some fascinating differences in our genetic admixture at the state level. Southern whites are considerably more likely to have african ancestry than whites from other regions: \" european americans with african ancestry comprise as much as 12 % of european americans from louisiana and south carolina and about 1 in 10 individuals in other parts of the south, \" the authors found.

( the ap talks to several democrats who confirm they will bow to their constituents ' wishes on the matter and vote against their party's own governor next month. ) even if the legislation becomes law, however, critics don't think it stands a chance in the courts. Backers say an important principle is at stake: \" it's probably one of the best states ' rights issues that the country's got going right now, \" says a state gop party official. The legislation not only declares federal gun laws to be null and void within the state's borders, it actually makes it illegal for federal agents to try to enforce them. In fact, state residents would be able to sue the arresting officer. The measure also makes it illegal for journalists to print the names of gun owners, calling to mind controversies like this one. A quote from a democratic lawmaker pretty much sums things up: \"we love our guns and we love hunting. It's not worth the fight for me to vote against it. \" but, he adds, \" the bill is completely unconstitutional, so the courts are going to have to throw it out. \"",

Two local amish men have filed a lawsuit against the city, its mayor, and its police chief, accusing them of violating their ability to exercise their religion. Back in 2014, the city passed an ordinance requiring that horses on city streets have a \" properly fitting collection device. \" the city says it's simply a health and safety issue, reports the democrat news leader, and not just about sanitation: the mayor says a child slipped in manure while walking to school. The law isn't targeting anyone \" based on his or her religious views, \" says an attorney for the defendants, a view that the lawsuit disputes. The men who brought the suit belong to the old order swartzentruber amish, an especially conservative branch that shuns modern contraptions. They carry shovels to clean up manure, and argue that this should be sufficient, while the city's lawyer says stopping to shovel poop poses dangers of its own. Regardless, the amish say they took a vote and decided to ignore the law, and they say that individual members would be \" shunned \" if they didn't comply with the vote, reports the daily beast. Another problem: these amish aren't allowed to pay fines, which is why one of the plaintiffs spent 10 days in jail in 2015. ( see why this amish teen was pulled over while driving his buggy. )",

Two years after then-president obama used his veto power to block construction of the transcanada conduit, the ap reports that a state department permit was issued friday to begin construction into the us. The decision, which transcanada is hailing as a \" significant milestone, \" came after the department analyzed a variety of factors, including costs and how the pipeline would affect the environment. The state department was in charge of ok ' ing the $ 8 billion project because the 1,700-mile-long pipeline stretched from one country to the next, though the ap notes an \" unusual twist \": state department employee tom shannon signed the presidential permit; rex tillerson had recused himself from dealing with the pipeline due to his exxon mobil ties. Transcanada first applied for a permit in 2008, but the project has dragged for nearly a decade due to pushback from environmental groups and native american tribes who say the pipeline would plow through sacred lands and endanger water supplies. Supporters, however, say construction would create thousands of jobs: transcanada says as many as 13,000, the state department a bit less, and president trump as many as 28,000, in what the washington post calls \" an inflated estimate. \" reuters notes monday was the end of the 60-day deadline on trump's executive order to get this pipeline going.

Acriflavine was used throughout both world wars as a shotgun approach to treat a wide range of ailments, including open wounds, bladder infections, gonorrhea, and the parasite that causes sleeping sickness, reports the age, but it wasn't well understood and largely fell out of favor as the antibiotic penicillin took over. Now molecular biologists, who say acriflavine could be useful against drug-resistant superbugs, say they've discovered precisely what made it so effective. Not only does acriflavine bind to the dna of a patient, thereby triggering an immune response that could prove a useful preventive measure against anything from influenza to the common cold, but it also binds to bacteria, which slows its spread and gives the host's immune system more time to spring to action. \" a lot of things are being dropped because they're not that efficient, but in fact going back to them might be a good idea because they're very well characterized, \" one researcher tells abc. The researcher says the drug is cheap and easy to transport as it is not sensitive to fluctuations in temperature or humidity. ( the cure for a deadly superbug could be hiding in our noses. )",

Journalist jarrett hill was the first to pick up on the similarities, as below: near the beginning of her speech, melania trump said: \" from a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise, that you treat people with respect. They taught and showed me values and morals in their daily life. \" in michelle obama's 2008 speech in denver, she said: \" and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values: like, you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, that you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them and even if you don't agree with them. \" two sentences later, melania said: \" we need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow. Because we want our children in this nation to know that the only limit to your achievements is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them. \" michelle, 2008: \" barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and to pass them onto the next generation, because we want our children — and all children in this nation — to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them. \" cnn notes that earlier on monday, melania told nbc that she wrote the speech with as \" little help as possible. \" early tuesday, a trump campaign spokesman did not directly address the accusation of plagiarism, but said: \" in writing her beautiful speech, melania's team of writers took notes on her life's inspirations and, in some instances, included fragments that reflected her own thinking, \" the guardian reports.",
