Romney \" disagrees with richard mourdock's comments, and they do not reflect his views, \" a spokesman said, but aides wouldn't say whether romney would drop his support for mourdock's senate bid. After the debate, the candidate tried to clarify his remarks, saying that he meant \" god creates life. \" any suggestion that he believes that \" god preordained rape \" is \" sick and twisted, \" mourdock told reporters.",

I don't really know what i ' m doing. \" this interview with a 24-year-old texas woman, part of a university of texas report on reproductive legislation released tuesday, underscores the measures women in the lone star state are taking as access to abortion facilities is restricted, the guardian reports. Findings of the texas policy evaluation project are startling: between 100,000 and 240,000 texan women ages 18 to 49 have taken matters into their own hands and tried to induce an abortion at home, with, as the guardian puts it, \" varying degrees of success and differing medical consequences. \" the report asked an online sample of 779 women if they or their best friends had ever tried to self-induce an abortion, with 1.7 % saying they had and 4.1 % saying their best friend had or they suspected she had, the atlantic reports. Extrapolating those figures to the nearly 6 million women of reproductive age in texas is how researchers came to the final numbers, mother jones notes. In terms of methods used to attempt an abortion, the drug misoprostol was the most commonly cited, with others including \" herbs or homeopathic remedies, \" alcohol, illegal drugs, hormonal pills, and \" getting hit or punched in the abdomen, \" per the atlantic. Texas restrictions on abortions are among the strictest in the us: the 2013 hb2 law has shut more than half the state's 41 abortion clinics. The ceo of a gynecology and abortion care organization tells the guardian that the result is \" tremendously disrespectful. Abortion is legal in this country, \" she says. \" and so every woman deserves to have access to whatever method for terminating her pregnancy safely she might choose in her local community. \" ( the supreme court will hear arguments over a provision that could leave just 10 or so abortion clinics open in texas. )",

The malware is spreading through a weakness in java and through an infected word document purporting to be a statement from the dalai lama, reports msnbc. Like others of its kind, sabpab enables hackers to steal personal information and send remote commands to computers. The spread of sabpab comes soon after warning about the \" flashback \" malware believed to have infected up to 600,000 macs. Experts say these kinds of attacks tend to come in waves, so there may be many more mac viruses on the way. \" although there's no reason to believe that this attack is widespread, it's clearly time for some people to wake up to the reality of mac malware, \" writes greg cluley at sophos. \" mac users — please get an anti-virus, for goodness sake. \"",

Mlive.com reports that all six were charged with misconduct in office, with willful neglect of duty and various conspiracy charges also being assigned. Schuette filed criminal charges in april against two other state employees and a city water utility official. In the department of health and human services, alleged transgressions include reliance on shoddy data and hiding or ignoring bloodstream test results that indicated the significant presence of lead. Within the department of environmental quality, accusations include workers manipulating water monitoring reports, purposely \" misinterpreting \" federal drinking-water standards, and trying to mislead the epa, as well as suggesting ways to keep an epa expert quiet about concerns. Shekter-smith, meanwhile, is said to have turned a blind eye as evidence of water contamination became clearer. Meanwhile, per the wall street journal, federal experts say filtered flint tap water is safe to drink, but mayor karen weaver noted wednesday at the democratic convention that the city's crisis is far from over. \" our infrastructure is broken, leaking, and rusting away, \" she said, per cnn.",

        "summary": "Even after overdose and addiction risks became known, opioid prescriptions continued on the belief that the drugs were more effective at relieving pain than other medications. New research suggests that may not be the case. In a study in jama, scientists say opioids appear to be no better at treating chronic pain than non-opioids like acetaminophen ( tylenol ), ibuprofen ( advil ), and lidocaine, which are much less addictive. In a trial of 240 patients — mostly middle-aged white males who'd endured at least six months of pain in their back, hips, or knees — non-opioid users actually experienced more pain relief than patients using morphine, oxycodone, or hydrocodone, though not in a way that was statistically significant, reports the los angeles times. \" there was no significant difference in pain-related function between the 2 groups over 12 months, \" say the researchers. Half of the trial patients at minneapolis va health care system were given opioids, while the other half were given acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ). Both groups reported an average pain score of 5.4 out of 10 at the start of the trial. But after a year, opioid users reported an average score of 4, compared to 3.5 for non-opioid users, reports reuters. Study author erin krebs blames opioid tolerance. \" your body gets used to that level of opioid, and you need more and more to get the same level of effect, \" she tells nbc news, adding this might explain why opioid users suffered more side effects like constipation, fatigue, and nausea. Since the added risks of opioids come with no advantage over other drugs, krebs says people with chronic pain just \" shouldn't start opioids. \" ( that goes for kids, too. )",

A man in china recently received a harsh reminder of that after a wild panda bit his leg after authorities pursued the critter onto his lawn, reports afp via yahoo. The creature had made its way into a northwestern village, which is near a sanctuary that's home to about 100 wild pandas. \" i saw a panda jump out in front of me, its body completely covered in mud, \" the man told local news. A struggle ensued, in which the bear wouldn't release the man's leg until a rescuer wrapped a coat around the animal's head. Finally, it fled — but not before causing injuries which, china daily reports, led to eight surgeries over the past year and may lead to amputation. The man sued three government departments and won an $ 83,000 payout that will cover his medical costs, his lawyer says.

And while it may not feel like it, it's cheaper, too, at least compared to the early ' 70s, when price fixing meant a flight from new york to la was not allowed to cost less than about $ 1,600 in today's dollars. The outline's full story works to bust some misconceptions, and business insider does something similar. It talks to 80 airline workers — the ones who staff the gates, the planes, the customer service lines — to share the secrets they wish they could share. Here are 5 standouts: know i ' m not being rude when i don't give you a free upgrade: one customer service agent explains \" the airline computer system tracks everything, and big brother can be watching us \" — and doling out a free upgrade improperly can be a fireable offense. Don't take off your shoes: it might be tempting to wiggle those toes under the seat, but this isn't your house, and that \" water \" you're stepping on in the bathroom isn't actually water. Don't let those hands wander: if you're tempted to tug at your flight attendant's clothes to get his or her attention as they walk by, just don't. Ever. Keep the number 50 in mind: that's how many passengers are generally served by a single flight attendant. We're not forgetting about you, explains one. We're just dealing with minimal staffing. Know i have to do what the faa says: that includes saying specific things. Not following the faa's rules and regulations could cause a flight attendant to be fined.

A un rep confirms that one of the team's vehicles was \" deliberately shot at multiple times \" by unidentified snipers in damascus; all are safe. The shooting reportedly occurred in the buffer zone between rebel- and government-controlled territory, and the team will head back to the area once it replaces its vehicle, reports the ap.

Noting the malaysia airlines brand has been blemished in some markets, mueller, hired last month by state investor khazanah, adds the airline will rebrand in september, but he remains vague on the details. The airline may also reduce the frequency of flights or the size of aircraft on long-haul routes to europe to focus more on regional flights, though a flagship route to london will be unaltered. The hope is that the airline can \" stop the bleeding \" in 2015, per today's announcement, and see growth by 2017. Sky news reports the yearlong restructuring plan will cost $ 1.7 billion.",

As it meshes \" a somber, artsy meditation on lost childhoods \" with a second half meant to engage kids, \" the end result may be discordant … but christopher robin still is worth ' oh, bother ' -ing to see, \" he writes. Tom russo at the boston globe calls it \" an appealing new spin \" on winnie the pooh's world. Appearing much like the vintage book illustrations by eh shepard, \" the cg-animated pooh and friends … steal the show, \" he writes, noting the script adds \" a contemporary flair that's funny without being obtrusive. \" \" younger kids might grow a bit fidgety \" as the film \" gets off to a somewhat slow start, \" writes brian lowry at cnn. Once it gets going, though, it offers \" a genuine sweetness \" and serves as \" a reminder of the simple pleasures of hanging out with family and a talking bear, which, in these frenetic times, is the kind of silliness that's worth savoring. \" but odie henderson could've done without \" another movie built on the pseudo-psychological cliché that adults need to reconnect with their childhoods in order to be better adults, \" especially one led by the hundred acre wood's \" least memorable character. \" \" it feels as if reality has invaded the hundred acre wood and sullied it, \" he writes at rogerebert.com, giving the film two stars.",

Congress banned inmates at the state and federal level from receiving pell grants in 1994, but education secretary arne duncan says he ' ll have an \" important announcement \" to make when he visits a maryland prison this week, reports politico. The administration will be able to temporarily lift the ban without going through congress by treating the restoration of grants as an experiment in reducing re-offending rates, reports the wall street journal, which notes that prisoners received $ 34 million in pell grants in 1993. Pell grants are worth up to $ 5,775 a year, which rep. Donna edwards, co-sponsor of a bill to permanently restore the grants to prisoners, notes is a lot less than the $ 40,000 or so it costs to keep an inmate behind bars for a year. \" we haven't really been able to get a handle on recidivism, \" the democrat tells the journal. \" we have to present some training and opportunities. These are programs that work. \" the prison population has doubled in the 20 years since the grants were removed, and the bill's co-sponsors say inmates who take part in education programs are 43 % less likely to end up back in prison, politico notes.

The satire touching on murder, fraud, and also racism in 1950s suburbia has just a 29 % rating from critics on rotten tomatoes. Here's what they're saying. \" there's no other way to say it — this movie stinks, \" writes katie walsh at tribune news service, throwing out a long list of adjectives: \" irritating, faux-edgy, tonally wack, strained, unfunny, \" along with \" shoddy, shameful. \" she complains in particular about a racism subplot that comes across as \" condescending \" and says the film fails by wanting us to do two things — feel upset about that subplot while finding hilarity in a \" satirical family murder insurance scam.... You can't mix nihilism and earnestness. \" lindsey bahr calls suburbicon \" a derivative and somewhat edgeless satire with some compelling performances nonetheless. \" gary basaraba and oscar isaac, specifically, are impressive, bahr writes at the ap. But damon and julianne moore aren't up to snuff. Nor is the story itself, which \" doesn't even go far enough to satirize the hypocritical social mores of the time. \" the result feels \" so much like something we've already seen before. \" chris klimek was impressed with damon, moore, as well as isaac and child actor noah jupe. Too bad they're in a \" tone-deaf \" film that's \" queasy to sit through, \" he writes at npr. In condemning racism \" in the most broad, perfunctory, awareness-ribbon-wearing way while barely allowing its black characters to speak … suburbicon might be the biggest embarrassment to pious hollywood liberalism since crash won best picture in 2006, \" he writes. Colin covert identifies the main problem as the reworking of joel and ethan coen's script by clooney and grant heslov, who should have made either a crime comedy or a piece of social commentary, but not both. Instead, clooney made a film that's \" strikingly bad, too somber to be a comedy and too dizzy to work as drama, \" covert writes at the minneapolis star tribune. He does applaud isaac, though. \" in a film running a brief 104 minutes, he supplies 90 % of the entertainment in 5 % of the time. \"",

The obama17 campaign bears a familiar slogan to go with its familiar face, \" oui on peut, \" which translates to \" yes we can, \" according to npr.

        "summary": "Critics are warning about the \" very real risk of a botched execution \" in what is to be the first us case of capital punishment using fentanyl. With manufacturers unwilling to sell any drugs to be used in executions, nevada's department of corrections quietly purchased small doses of fentanyl from cardinal health over several months and plans to use the prescription painkiller in combination with paralytic drug cisatracurium and sedative midazolam in the state's first execution in 12 years, scheduled for wednesday, per the guardian and vice. Critics, however, are putting up a fuss, and not only due to the secretive way officials went about acquiring the drug. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid well known for its role in the opioid epidemic, has \" never been used in an execution before. It's extremely experimental, \" as amy rose of the american civil liberties union puts it. Especially concerning is the fact that the fentanyl will be mixed with midazolam, which \" has been at the center of executions that have gone visibly wrong in every single state in which it has been used, \" says maya foa of anti-death penalty group reprieve. She tells the guardian execution strategies are normally reviewed by courts through inmate appeals. Not so in this case, as double murderer scott dozier — convicted of second-degree murder in 2005 and first-degree murder in 2007 — accepts his fate and says he wants to die. It's unclear if there's enough opposition to stave off the execution, though the aclu is looking into the legality of how nevada obtained the fentanyl. But if it goes ahead, gov. Brian sandoval \" is in danger of creating the very black market he is trying to eliminate, \" pharmaceutical expert donald downing argues at the reno gazette journal.",

            "\"they can put it out a week ahead of time because he's not gonna challenge it, \" said jen moreno, a staff attorney for the university of california berkeley's death penalty clinic who specializes in lethal injection challenges. \"they're getting away with things that they probably wouldn't get away with if he wasn't a volunteer. \" normally, such a protocol could trigger a years-long court battle. But since dozier has \"volunteered \" to give up his appeals and face the execution chamber, in death penalty parlance, the fight over dozier's future is almost at an end. Not only has fentanyl never been used in a u.s. Execution, but nevada also hasn't executed an inmate in a dozen years. On tuesday, just one week and a day before dozier's planned execution, nevada unveiled its new, three-drug execution regimen. That protocol will include doses of midazolam, a controversial sedative deployed in several botched executions, fentanyl, and the paralytic drug cisatracurium. Here's what is: the inmate, convicted murderer scott dozier, wants to die.

That protocol will include doses of midazolam, a controversial sedative deployed in several botched executions, fentanyl, and the paralytic drug cisatracurium.

Among those killed was a man who invited friends to the city grill as part of his wedding anniversary celebration. The shooting also wounded four others, one critically. The extraordinary move by law enforcement to change course after a murder arrest occurred after reviewing video and photos from the scene, and interviews with additional witnesses, sedita said. \" what basically has happened, \" sedita said, \" is in the last eight hours... We got additional video evidence. Investigators called me and said, frank, you better come down here.

Within hours of the arrest, relatives of one of the deceased, as well as one of the men wounded in the early morning shooting, disputed johnson's arrest. \" there was only one gunman, \" said shooting victim james robbs, who was released from the hospital saturday night. \" i didn't get a good look at him, but it wasn't keith. \" the sister of another of the victims said johnson is a family friend. \" he did not do this, \" said shaneesha white, sister of shawn-tia mcneil, who died in the gunfire"

Some hong kong politicians say the territory's history of working closely with the us makes it a poor choice for snowden — though others say they are \" flattered. \" a criminal investigation into the leak has begun and the us is expected to begin extradition proceedings soon; a long legal battle in hong kong could ensue before beijing decides on using its veto, the wall street journal reports.

But i also like my gay-married friends and don't like the guilt of indirectly supporting chick-fil-a's stance on gay rights. And i know there are lots of other people in the same boat. So i've started chickenoffset.com. Every time you buy a chicken-sandwich meal at chick-fil-a, you can buy an \" offset \" here. You can print out the receipt and demonstrate to your friends that the money you gave for lgbt youth more than compensates for the profits you put in chick-fil-a's coffers. $ 1 gets you 1 chicken-meal offset; $ 6 for ten offsets. We promise to send a minimum of 80 % of the proceeds after expenses to it gets better and the williams institute. Your offsets will provide far more money to non-profits that support gays than buying a sandwich at chick-fil-a ends up putting in the pockets of anti-gay-rights organizations."

A lieutenant with the department tells the sun-news the car, which apparently belonged to one of the teens ' parents, had been reported stolen and was sporting license plates from another car. Investigators say the women purposely switched plates before they started traveling the country. Before they ended up in the gem state, they had been caught on camera in beverly hills, calif., monday at an atm. All told, they covered a driving distance of at least 1,600 miles before they were located, the sun-news estimates. They hadn't been answering calls to their cellphones or contact on social media since they vanished after the concert. Ktsm reports it's still vague what the teens ' final destination was, or why they didn't tell anyone where they were going.

Rick snyder announced a new development wednesday in flint's water crisis that \" just adds to the disaster we are already facing \": specifically, a marked increase in cases of legionnaires'disease that could be linked to the area's tainted water, reports the detroit free press. From june 2014 to november 2015, there were 87 cases in genesee county, 10 of them fatal, per the michigan department of health and human services. In the previous four years, legionnaires ' cases ran from six per year to 13, cnn notes. And while the mdhhs isn't able to definitively tie the spike to flint's water, it's taking the news seriously, and a drinking water expert who's been studying flint's water tells the free press there's a \" very strong likelihood \" that it played a role. Mdhhs officials first observed the rise in legionnaires ' cases in the fall of 2014, per the free press, and researchers found the bacteria to blame was proliferating in larger buildings, many with older plumbing. \" our hypothesis is that something about the flint river and lack of corrosion control, plus big buildings, is creating these problems, \" marc edwards, head of an independent virginia team looking into the crisis, tells the free press. Speaking wednesday, snyder said he learned of the issue just \" a few days ago \" and appeared to place some blame on the state's department of environmental quality, the paper notes. \" we're taking every action within reason, and going beyond reason to address this, \" he said. State health officials say it's ok for residents to shower and bathe, though they still can't drink the water. Edwards'team agrees, though he laments how it's all been handled. \" it's a crisis of conscience in government, \" he tells cnn. \" there are just so many places where you wish people had done things differently. \"",

The legislation applies to cellphones, tablets, video games, digital cameras, pagers, and laptops, according to hawaii news now. Pedestrians caught checking facebook or sending a tweet while in the street would be subject to a fine of between $ 15 and $ 99. Fines could increase to up to $ 500 for multiple citations. Brandon elefante says he got the idea for the legislation from high school students. \" these high school groups were concerned for their peers being distracted while crossing the streets and looking at their phones instead of looking both ways, \" the councilman tells cnn. While the honolulu police department supports the legislation, councilman ernie martin, who voted against it, says a public awareness campaign would be a better solution. The legislation now heads to mayor kirk caldwell for approval. A spokesperson for the mayor's office tells kitv that caldwell is still deciding whether he ' ll approve the legislation. *ed.

God's little people cat rescue, which started with one stray mama cat and her two kittens, expanded to more than 60 cats roaming the bowells ' property as they continued to take in strays. They posted a facebook ad for a modestly paid job managing the sanctuary — and 40,000 people responded. The ad went viral, spawning headlines about the \" dream job \" or \" purrrfect job, \" leading the bowells to explain to would-be caretakers that it would, in fact, often be a difficult job — not only would poop have to be scooped and the like, but \" heartbreaking decisions \" would need to be made about sick cats. Months later, as the washington post reports, the sanctuary's caretaker has been chosen. Jeffyne telson's husband sent her the ad soon after it was posted in august, the 62-year-old recalls. Telson runs her own cat rescue in santa barbara, calif., only taking in strays; she's adopted out 3,000 cats and kittens over the past 21 years and has kept those who can't be placed at her own small sanctuary. Her application stood out, and the bowells traveled to california to visit the couple in september. Joan and jeffyne clicked immediately, and the bowells offered telson the job. She ' ll run the syros sanctuary for some months, while volunteers run her santa barbara rescue, and other finalists for the syros job will likely then take their own turns managing god's little people. Meanwhile, the bowells are looking into expanding the sanctuary, possibly even using it as an international training center for similarly-minded volunteers.",

In the first such heist reported since the 1959 cuban revolution, paintings worth a total of around $ 1.5 million were apparently cut from their frames while in storage at the cuban capital's national museum of fine arts, reports cnn. The theft was uncovered after miami art dealer ramon cernuda bought a suspicious painting and alerted both the museum and the fbi late last month; the museum then reviewed its archives and confirmed the theft. Cernuda says art theft in cuba is extremely rare, and it is rarer still for stolen cuban art to be found in the us. \" the theft is so much more complicated than the smuggling out of cuba, \" he says. \" to just get the art out of the museum is very complicated. \" soon after the museum acknowledged the theft, cuba's minister of culture was fired without explanation, the havana times notes.

Over the past week, lists have been appearing in bathrooms across the school's campus, with titles like \" rapists on campus \" and \" sexual assault violators on campus, \" according to student media reports. The first list, reported by the lion, appeared to featured the handwriting of multiple people, though subsequent lists — featuring the same four names — appeared to be the work of one person. Yesterday the campaign reached a new level, when two more graffiti lists were found and flyers describing the alleged wrongdoers were found in multiple stalls, according to bwog. The school has quickly scrubbed the graffiti each time it has been found — yesterday it reportedly began closing down bathrooms until it could be sure it had removed the lists. Media outlets have so far blacked out all the names when posting photos of the list — bwog said that senior administrators had warned that publishing it would violate title ix — but jezebel reports that the list includes a musician, a varsity athlete, and a \" prominent writer for a campus publication. \" that publication may have been bwog; the site posted a statement from its editors yesterday saying that a member of its staff had indeed been accused of violating the school's gender based misconduct policy, and had agreed to resign.",

The document, titled \"2083: a european declaration of independence \" and posted to the internet hours before the attacks, blasts \" multiculturalism \" and \" marxism \" and provides a detailed daily diary of breivik's preparations in the months leading up to the attacks. Both his lawyer and police say he has confessed to the attacks, the ap reports. The manifesto claims that a small group of like-minded militants would \"seize political and military control of western european countries and implement a cultural conservative political agenda, \" and talks of a london meeting in 2002 to re-form the \" knights templar \" crusading order. \"the time for dialogue is over. We gave peace a chance. The time for armed resistance has come, \" wrote breivik, predicting a war that would kill or hurt more than 1 million people. Some analysts say the manifesto bears a striking resemblance to the writings of osama bin laden and other al-qaeda leaders. \"it seems to be an attempt to mirror al-qaeda, \" but from a christian rather than muslim viewpoint, says a norwegian terrorism expert.",

When the gavel came down tuesday, a mail clerk and 15 letter carriers had been sentenced to between three and nine years in prison. The scheme first came to light in 2015 during an investigation into a drug trafficking group, which apparently thought postal workers would have a better chance of making the deliveries uncaught, according to the us attorney's office. Federal agents then watched as a confidential source posing as a drug trafficker sought usps employees willing to deliver drugs to specific addresses for bribes, nabbing 16 \" corrupt \" workers ranging in age from 26 to 64, per cnn and the atlanta journal constitution. In a statement, prosecutors note defendants negotiated the amount of money they would charge and took additional bribes for packages delivered by other employees they recruited. Though usps workers are \" typically valuable members of the community, entrusted to deliver the mail every day to our homes, \" these 16 individuals \" chose to abuse \" the public trust and \" used their positions to bring what they thought were large amounts of dangerous drugs into those same communities for a quick payoff, \" says us attorney byung j.

In addition to prison time, the workers were ordered to pay restitution. ( this postal worker stole 6,000 greeting cards. )",

In an unusual twist, a 6-year-old girl reached the lawn sunday night by going not over the fence but through it. After slipping between the black metal pickets, she was escorted out to her parents by the secret service, authorities said.",
            "Washington ( cnn ) -- a man who jumped the white house fence on tuesday was apprehended by uniformed secret service officers who approached him with guns drawn. The incident was broadcast live on cnn's \" john king usa \" program, which was produced from the north lawn of the white house on tuesday night. After the man jumped the fence, armed officers ordered him to lie down and then handcuffed him before taking him into custody. A backpack thrown over the fence and lying on the ground nearby was being checked by security officers, who locked down the area as a precaution. The incident ended shortly after 9 p.m. Et when authorities issued an all-clear directive at the white house. There was no immediate information on whether the intruder had represented a security threat. According to the secret service, the detained man is james dirk crudup, 41, who is homeless. He will be charged with unlawful entry and contempt of court because he previously had been ordered to stay away from the white house due to past incidents, the agency said."

        "summary": "Jurgen klinsmann is out as coach of the us men's soccer team, the ap reports, ending a contentious five-year love-hate relationship on the job. Us soccer federation president sunil gulati announced monday that klinsmann has been \" relieved of his duties \" as coach and technical director for us soccer. The move isn't exactly surprising, notes the new york times, following a pair of embarrassing losses that damaged the americans ' efforts to qualify for the 2018 world cup. The final straw came less than a week ago, as the times puts it: \" then came the 4-0 thrashing against the ticos in which klinsmann's team looked alternately disorganized, dispirited and — perhaps most damningly — disinterested. \" \" while we remain confident that we have quality players to help us advance to russia 2018, the form and growth of the team up to this point left us convinced that we need to go in a different direction, \" said gulati in a statement. Klinsmann replaced bob bradley in july 2011 and led the team to the 2013 concacaf gold cup title and the second round of the 2014 world cup, where the americans lost to belgium in extra time. But the us was knocked out in last year's gold cup semifinals, lost to mexico in a playoff for a confederations cup berth and started 0-2 this month in the final round of world cup qualifying.",

On friday, klinsmann returned to his home in california and was bemused by the criticism he was receiving in the news media for two recent losses by his team, which had damaged — but not erased — its chances of qualifying for the 2018 world cup.

On monday, klinsmann was fired. The announcement, which was made by u.s.
