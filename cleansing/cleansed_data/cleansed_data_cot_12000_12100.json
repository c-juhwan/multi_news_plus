Read the shocking court papers kennedy, who insists she was 60-year-old williams ' \"spousal equivalent \" from 2006 through 2013, is demanding the former child star cough up a monthly child support payment of $ 3,423, which she claims is peanuts because williams ' estate is worth at least $ 13 million. She also blames williams for \"physically and emotionally abandoning their daughter \" and wants to only grant him supervised access since he has a \"history of alcohol abuse. \" kennedy, 36, states in legal documents that williams \"is often too preoccupied with other distractions to be able to give \" samantha \"the appropriate attention and care she needs. \"",

A quarter of the way into his challenge to eat a potato-only diet for one year, the 36-year-old melbourne man says he's lost 70 pounds and is experiencing fewer episodes of clinical depression, per 9 news. \" i feel amazing, \" he tells vice. \" i've got a lot of energy. I ' m sleeping better. \" he's also lowered his blood cholesterol and is \" doing better \" than other patients on \" cholesterol-lowering drugs, \" his doctor says in a video, per upi. \" the uric acid level is slightly elevated \" but \" that's commonly observed in people who are rapidly losing weight, \" the doctor adds. \" generally speaking there's nothing i'd be concerned about. \" but one health expert isn't so confident in taylor's plan. Dr. Joanna mcmillan says he could be losing calcium in his bones or suffering from an iron deficiency. \" it takes a long time for something like an iron deficiency to show up but that certainly will happen eventually, \" she says, adding blood tests alone \" won't give us a window into what's happening in his body. \" but taylor, who is exercising six days a week and taking a b-12 supplement, questions whether mcmillan has really done her research like he has. He adds he's not trying to push his diet on anyone else but believes the diet meets his body's nutritional requirements and helps him battle his food addiction. Mcmillan fears it doesn't do either.

The numbers coming in just two weeks after the local mayor set up temporary speed cameras are somewhat mind-blowing: more than 58,000 speeding violations in the town of 120, reports npr, which averages out to nearly 500 violations in that period per person ( if the residents are the ones doing the extra accelerating ). A local newspaper reports that it appears about half of the cars zipping along the route through acquetico were over the limit, per the bbc — the local says it was more like a third — with many of the prime culprits doing so right in the middle of the day. The ansa news agency reports the highest speed clocked in the 31mph zone was 84mph. \" it's really madness, \" mayor alessandro alessandri says of the breakneck traffic detected by the speed experiment, which sky news notes took place over a two-week period in september. He adds that the town's residents, especially older ones, have become fearful of crossing the street, per the local. The appeal of racing through acquetico may lie in the pristine condition of its roads: of the three thoroughfares connecting the piedmont region to the farther reaches of northern italy, the highway through acquetico offers \" ideal asphalt \" and fewer speed bumps, tolls, and ( until now ) cameras, alessandri notes. Even though the speed cameras were just supposed to be a trial, the mayor is now mulling keeping them up for good, considering drivers ' penchant for putting the pedal to the metal.

        "summary": "Here's something you might not have known: you have voting rights on facebook. Well, more like \" had. \" the social network announced yesterday that it plans to do away with its current voting system, which gives users the power to ax policy changes they're not keen on. The system had worked something like this: facebook would put policy changes to a vote, and if got 7,000 comments and 30 % of facebook users cast a \" nay \" ballot, the change would be struck down. Going forward, facebook will instead rely on a week-long comment period, and a new forum where users can get their questions answered by the company's chief privacy officer, reports the wall street journal. And while the move has some crying foul — facebook \" officially became an oligarchy \" yesterday, declares chris taylor for mashable — it's fairly clear that the old system wasn't ideal. Taylor himself explains that the last such vote happened in june, when users were asked to vote in favor of one of two statements of rights and responsibilities; 342,632 users did so, which amounts to a piddling 0.038 % of facebook's population at the time.

        "summary": "For the past 20 years, people in connecticut have needed a permit to buy a handgun — and that's reduced gun violence in the state by up to 40 %, according to a new study. Published in the american journal of health, the study looks at 1995 state legislation that requires gun buyers to apply for a permit in person with police before purchasing a handgun from a private seller or licensed dealer, the huffington post reports. The law also requires mandatory safety training and raised the minimum gun-buying age from 18 to 21. \" permit-to-purchase laws... Appear to reduce the availability of handguns to criminals and other people who are not legally permitted to buy guns, \" says study author daniel webster in a statement. The study compares connecticut's homicide rate to that of other states that lack such legislation but otherwise have similar gun regulations, like maryland, california, and rhode island. Homicide rates also fell in control states during the mid-1990s, but tumbled further and faster in connecticut, saving an extra 296 lives, the independent reports. What's more, the law had no influence on homicides by other means, perhaps supporting the study's findings. The president of the connecticut citizens defense league isn't buying it, saying that criminals often buy guns by illegal means. But webster's earlier research shows that firearm homicide rates rose in missouri after the state repealed its handgun license law in 2007.",

Now, a report released monday by the london-based environmental investigation agency has identified the culprit: cheap insulation made in china. The eia found that lots of chinese manufacturers are adding the chemical cfc-11 to foam insulation — the stuff that gets blown into houses — even though it was banned in 2010. Investigators found that no fewer than 18 companies were adding cfc-11, known scientifically as trichlorofluoromethane, to their product, reports the guardian. If the practice goes unchecked, scientists say it could delay the recovery of the ozone hole by a decade. The discovery did not take in-depth chemical sleuthing: the investigators simply asked, and the openness of the responses disturbed them. \" we were absolutely gobsmacked to find that companies very openly confirmed using cfc-11 while acknowledging it was illegal, \" the eia's avipsa mahapatra tells the bbc. \" the fact that they were so blasé about it, the fact that they told us very openly how pervasive it is in the market. \" so now what? the report has been sent to the chinese government as proof that beijing is in violation of the landmark montreal protocol set up to protect the ozone. China could theoretically be subject to sanctions, but the more realistic outcome is that beijing will be urged by the un to crack down on the factories using cfc-11. The report's release coincides with a meeting of mp delegates in vienna. \"this week will be a critical moment for dialogue, resolve and action, \" says a un environmental official.

        "summary": "The details from sunday's mass shooting at a gaming tournament in jacksonville, fla., have begun to settle: police say a gunman killed two people and himself during the video game competition within a riverfront entertainment venue called the jacksonville landing, reports the new york times. At least nine others were shot, but all are expected to survive. Two others were injured in the ensuing chaos. Authorities have identified the gunman as 24-year-old david katz from baltimore; he had traveled to jacksonville to compete in the \" madden nfl 19 \" tournament, reports the ap. Ea sports, which makes the game, lists a david katz as a 2017 champion. Police have not speculated about a motive. One chilling detail: a live-stream of the competition showed a red laser dot appear on the chest of a competitor just before the shooting broke out. \" i heard the first pop and was pretty sure it was a gunshot, \" competitor stephen javaruski tells the tampa bay times. \" then the second shortly after, and i scrambled frantically to the bathroom with like 20 other guys. \" the content is jarring, but this tweet captures the audio at the moment the gunfire begins. Viewers were able to watch the tournament online, and one who was doing so tells the ap she did not see the shooter's face. \" but we did see him with two hands on a gun walking back just popping rounds. \" gamer drini gjoka tweeted, \" i am literally so lucky. The bullet hit my thumb. \" the shooting inside the glhf game bar comes roughly six months after the mass shooting at a high school in parkland, fla., that left 17 people dead, and just two days ahead of the state primary in which gun control has been a big issue in the governor's race.",

Now that he, his wife, caitlan coleman, and their three children are safe, he's beginning to realize the impact five years in captivity had on his family. \" we're pretty broken and we didn't expect this, \" boyle told cnn's paula newton on sunday. Boyle and coleman were kidnapped in afghanistan by terrorists from the taliban-affiliated haqqani network in 2012. Coleman was pregnant at the time of their kidnapping, and all their children were born in captivity. They were freed thursday in a mission that pakistani forces carried out based on intelligence from us authorities. Boyle said there was a firefight between his terrorist captors and pakistani rescuers. While the bullets were flying, boyle realized his middle child had never seen daylight",
            "Pakistani officials have said that the family was freed in northwestern tribal areas of the country after their forces acted on intelligence provided to them by the united states. At a news conference, maj. Gen. Asif ghafoor, the spokesman for the pakistani military, said its forces had managed to trace the vehicle carrying the hostages within five hours of a tip from the united states, and had rescued the hostages after blowing out the vehicle's tires. The captors \"fled on foot, \" he said. Mr. Boyle, in a video message posted by the pakistani military soon after their freedom, effusively thanked the pakistani military for a \"tremendously professional operation, \" and said the military and intelligence forces \"got between the car and the criminals to make sure the prisoners were safe and that my family was safe. \" american officials have expressed gratitude to pakistan for the release, and president trump called",

Simpson will regain his celebrity status when he gets out of prison, after his 2008 conviction for armed robbery and kidnapping. Regardless of whether or not they think simpson was guilty of murder in 1995, most americans think he will be ignored. Cbs news poll looking back, most americans today think that o.j. Simpson is guilty of the 1994 murders of nicole brown simpson and ron goldman. 71 percent think so, a slight increase from the 67 percent who thought so in october 1995, when the jury came back with a not guilty verdict. Cbs news poll a large majority of white americans thought then, and still think today, that o.j. Simpson is guilty of the murders. There has been a shift in the perspective of black americans however. While 69 percent of blacks said that o.j. Simpson was innocent in 1995, today black americans are evenly divided. Cbs news poll americans are divided over the whether the 1995 trial was mostly decided on the merits of the case, or mostly decided by factors of race. Both whites and blacks are divided on this. Cbs news poll many americans followed the trial of o.j. Simpson very closely 22 years ago, but younger americans largely missed the well-publicized trial."

        "summary": "How do assassins kill strangers without a second thought or an ounce of guilt? a successful one convinces himself or herself that the victim is a target rather than a human, and that the killing is just another day's work, criminologists say in a new study. After reviewing cases of novice hired killers — including 15-year-old santre sanchez gayle, who killed a target for $ 310 — a team at birmingham city university found a killer could avoid negative feelings about a murder if he believed the task was all business, redorbit reports. Whereas gayle killed her victim as she opened a door, then slipped away in a taxi, another would-be killer, orville wright, broke into a target's apartment and began conversing with the woman he intended to kill. Afterward, he couldn't go through with the crime, researchers say. \" when contract killers aren't as successful in switching off their emotions, their jobs tend not to go to plan, \" researcher mohammed rahman says in a press release. That wasn't a problem for jimmy moody, a gang henchman operating in the uk in the 1960s. Known for torturing his victims before shooting them once behind the ear, moody eventually became the irish republican army's \" perfect secret weapon \" because he \" reframed his victims as targets, seeing getting the job done as a normal business activity, \" rahman says. He and other successful killers \" are akin to ' criminal undertakers, ' who have given themselves'special liberty'to get things done in the name of business. \" so what's the secret to seeing the target over the person? the answer is usually money, researchers say. The best hitmen \" want to minimize risk and effort in the pursuit of maximizing profit. \" ( a nascar driver claims his ex is a hired gun. )",

Bad choices have bad consequences and this was a bad decision in every way on my part. \" the offending image claimed that 5 % to 10 % of muslims are extremists and compared that to 7 % of germans who were nazis. Slate points out that would mean there are between 80 million and 160 million \" extremist \" muslims, which \" seems like an arbitrary, hard-to-prove claim. \" plus, many more people supported and participated in nazism by serving in the army or electing nazi leaders than were officially nazis. Schilling and controversy often find each other. The daily news reports he claimed his conservative views were keeping him out of the hall of fame earlier this year. ( a few years ago, he was sued by rhode island after his video company failed. )",

        "summary": "Generally speaking, sociologists find that people in relationships tend to be happier and more satisfied than single people. But a new study makes clear that for some, being single is the way to be. It all depends on how individuals deal with conflict in relationships — those who hate it and try to avoid it at all costs report being just as happy when they're single as people in committed relationships, the new zealand researchers write at eurekaalert. In researcher-speak, such people have high \" avoidance social goals, \" and when they're in relationships, they often end up being miserable. \"it's a well-documented finding that single people tend to be less happy compared to those in a relationship, but that may not be true for everyone, \" says lead researcher yuthika girme of the university of auckland. Her survey involved more than 4,000 people age 18 to 94. The results show that \" you can never say one size fits all, \" a george mason professor not involved with the study tells healthday. But before singles start exulting in i-told-you-sos, he adds that people who can't deal with conflict tend to be a little neurotic and might benefit from counseling. Such studies are important as the number of single people rises, notes discovery, which says 51 % of adult americans fall in the bucket. It cites previous research showing that people who have a strong fear of being alone often end up in lousy relationships, too. \" taken together, these studies suggest that not everyone is cut out for relationships, \" writes talal al-khatib. \" the single life isn't so bad after all. \" ( another study finds that for those with depression, having happy friends helps. )",

Instead, residents will have to be content with calling 311, and the city will deal with complaints on a case-by-case basis. \"to make all bbq places put this in would crush the industry and put a lot of people out of work, \" the president of the austin restaurant association tells kxan, referring to pricey air-purifying gear.

        "summary": "Israel's prison service released footage on sunday that it says shows the leader of a mass palestinian hunger strike breaking his fast, a claim dismissed by the palestinians as an attempt to undermine the open-ended strike, now in its 21st day. Assaf librati, a spokesman for the prison service, said strike organizer and palestinian uprising leader marwan barghouti ate a candy bar on may 5 and cookies on april 27. He said surveillance was increased and barghouti was caught on film eating. Footage aired by israeli media shows a prisoner sitting down fully clothed on a toilet unwrapping something and putting it in his mouth. Other footage shows a prisoner eating something near a sink. Qadoura fares, who heads an advocacy group for palestinian prisoners, cast doubt on the footage, saying barghouti is being held in solitary confinement and has no access to food, the ap reports. Israeli officials say barghouti retrieved the food from a hiding place and then hid the wrappers when he was done, haaretz reports. Barghouti, a leader of the second palestinian uprising, is serving five life terms after being convicted by an israeli court of directing two shooting attacks and a bombing that killed five people. Barghouti, who disputed the court's jurisdiction and did not mount a defense, has been in prison since 2002. Polls suggest that the 58-year-old is the most popular choice among palestinians to succeed 82-year-old palestinian president mahmoud abbas. Israel holds about 6,500 palestinians on charges related to the israeli-palestinian conflict and says 890 prisoners are participating in the hunger strike. Palestinians say the strike is an attempt to improve conditions inside the jails and gain more family visits. Israeli officials have dismissed the strike as a bid by barghouti to burnish his credentials in an internal palestinian power struggle. A palestinian activist leader says the strike will continue, per the new york times.",

His parents owned the golden dragon, a sprawling chinese eatery in portland, ore., that offered egg rolls and grilled-cheese sandwiches on its official menu and bitter melon with black-bean sauce and birds ' nest soup on its unofficial one. He tells stories of after-school hours spent peeling water chestnuts and washing dishes with his brothers and sisters while the flare of hot woks and the rhythm of cleavers filled the busy kitchen. On new year's eve, the kids stayed up all night, serving sweet-and-sour pork and cocktails to mobs of hungry revelers.

By the time my sisters and i appeared on the scene, dad generally stayed out of the kitchen. His culinary responsibilities were limited to standard dad stuff -- grilling burgers and steaks in the backyard -- and a single indoors task: folding wontons.

But plans for the 1985 bears to come to washington were scrapped when the space shuttle challenger exploded just days after their victory in january 1986. \" it basically just rolled off our backs, and now, 25 years later to say, lets put the band back together. no, im not in,  hampton said. Hampton played all 12 years of his professional career with bears. © content copyright 2011 wls radio 890am and wlsam.com. This material may not be",
            "It sounds like politics is intruding on president obama's plan to reunite the 1985 chicago bears. Defense tackle dan hampton told wls radio in chi-town that he doesn't plan to attend the oct. 7 ceremony, saying wives and children weren't invited -- though that's not his only reason. \" secondly, i ' m not a fan of the guy in the white house, \" hampton said. \" and, third, it was 25 years ago. Let it go. \" as we noted last week, obama wants to honor the super bowl-winning ' 85 bears -- one of the great teams in pro football history -- because their white house ceremony at the time got canceled because of the challenger space shuttle explosion. \" it basically just rolled off our backs, and now, 25 years later to say, ' let's put the band back together, ' \" said hampton, a member of pro football's hall of fame. \" no, i ' m not in. \" \" it's my personal choice, \" he said. \" i don't choose to go. \""

            "Currently, 20 cities in the united states and canada — narrowed down from an original list of 238 — are waiting for amazon ceo jeff bezos to announce the location of his company's new headquarters. Anticipation of the announcement is well warranted. The facility is expected to bring 50,000 new jobs to the chosen home city. A healthy job market is the backbone of any thriving city. Across a population, a strong labor market can create a virtuous economic cycle, reducing financial hardship, fueling consumer spending, and attracting new residents. The united states is in the midst of unprecedented employment growth. The u.s. Economy added 134,000 new jobs in september 2018, marking the 96th consecutive month of job growth. In the last five years alone, the number of americans with a job climbed by 11.2 million, or 7.8 %. While steady employment gains are breaking records on a national level, there are parts of the country where employment is growing even more rapidly — in some cases double the u.s. Job growth rate. 24/7 wall st. Reviewed five-year changes in employment — the number of people employed — at the metro area level to identify the cities adding the most jobs. Over the past half decade, overall employment rose anywhere from 15.0 % to 28.3 % in the 31 cities on this list. These cities are almost",
            "The unemployment rate remained at 3.7 %, a 49-year low. Hispanic unemployment reached its lowest rate ever, at 4.4 %. Wages grew 3.1 %, relatively robust growth after years of stagnant paychecks. The numbers give president donald trump and congressional republicans a positive talking point as they head into the midterm elections next tuesday, even amidst turmoil on the major stock exchanges over the past few weeks. During a brief appearance before heading to a rally in west virginia, trump said the 250,000 figure was \" shocking for a lot of people. \" \" that was a tremendous number by any standards, \" trump said. \" and that's despite the hurricanes. I ' m sure these hurricanes, they were massive. They had a big impact. \" the bureau of labor statistics said last month that hurricane florence may have depressed job growth, but that hurricane michael in the florida panhandle had \" no discernible effect. \" trump, also cheered the report on twitter friday morning. Wow! the u.s. Added 250,000 jobs in october - and this was despite the hurricanes. Unemployment at 3.7 %. Wages up! these are incredible numbers. Keep it going, vote republican! — donald j.

        "summary": "Think cte only affects people who've suffered brain injuries? so did scientists — until one man turned their research upside down. For the first time, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disorder previously found only in people who suffered head injuries, has been found in a patient with no such history, say researchers at the canadian concussion centre. The upshot of their study: cte may affect \" a wider range of people \" than previously believed. They say an autopsy showed the presence of cte in the man's brain, though \" there was no history of participation in contact sports or of head injury of any severity per the patient and his wife, \" according to the study. The 45-year-old also showed no cognitive impairment before death. He had, however, suffered from motor neuron disease and als, which affects the brain's nerve cells, for 7 years. \" since we've seen cases of brains that experienced multiple concussions but don't have cte, and now a brain with cte but absence of any head trauma... The cause of cte might be more complex than we assume, \" researcher lili-naz hazrati explains in a release. More specifically, brain trauma may not be the only cause. This might've been missed before because cte studies typically focus on the donated brains of individuals with a history of brain injury who exhibited cte symptoms during their lifetime, researchers say. And while they acknowledge there are now \" more questions than answers \" about cte, they say this study brings them one step closer to figuring out \" how to treat it and perhaps eventually prevent it. \" ( take a deep dive into how sports destroyed this young man's brain. )",

That pressure, mr. Bratton said, was applied during the administration of former police commissioner raymond kelly and led to an uptick in the number of times officers conducted controversial practice. Mr. Bratton — along with mayor bill de blasio — made the statements during a news conference to announce that the city is moving forward to drop its appeal of a court ruling that found the nypd's use of stop, question and frisk to be unconstitutional. The issue of quotas was crucial to arguments made by lawyers for plaintiffs that nypd commanders were pushing police officers to make thousands of stops — resulting in a sharp increase in the practice under former mayor michael bloomberg and mr. Kelly. \"i don't think we, you can use the term quotas, \" mr. Bratton said. \"but were they being pushed hard to do more? oh, i think that's clearly understood. \" under mr.

The charges are laid out in an indictment from a federal grand jury in virginia. According to abc news, there are 16 counts related to false individual income tax returns, seven counts for failure to report foreign bank and financial accounts, five counts for bank fraud conspiracy, and four counts for bank fraud. The charges are similar to those filed against manafort in october in a federal court in washington dc, the new york times reports. Manafort is a former trump campaign chairman, and gates was his campaign deputy. In the new indictment, gates is charged with helping manafort avoid taxes on his income. They're both accused of getting over $ 20 million in loans by \" falsely inflating \" manafort's income. Manafort is charged with giving false information to banks when he applied for mortgages. Gates and manafort had already faced charges out of washington dc for failing to file tax and lobbying reports, and manafort was accused of laundering millions of dollars and secretly lobbying for the pro-russia government in ukraine. While the charges are unrelated to president trump, the times state they \" paint an unflattering portrait of the man who ran the trump campaign. \" mueller said he was prepared to bring all charges in washington dc, but either manafort or gates chose to keep the new charges in virginia, nbc news reports.",

Police say bruce fanning, 59, found 31-year-old nathaniel rosa early saturday morning in a home on his property that he uses for a business, the new york daily news reports. After noticing the door was kicked in, fanning found rosa in the shower and yelled at him to get off his property. \" the individual pops his head out of the shower, and the owner said it seemed like he was drunk, \" chief deputy ryan spurling says. He says fanning went back to the main residence, retrieved his smith &amp; wesson handgun, and returned to shoot rosa four times through the shower curtain. Fanning called 911 after the shooting and couldn't explain why he hadn't called earlier, according to court documents. Spurling says that under washington law there is no \" duty to retreat \" for property owners — but he notes that fanning did retreat, then \" reintroduced himself to the situation. \" he says based on what fanning has told police, the facts of the case don't appear to support a claim of necessary or reasonable self-defense.

For over a decade, i helped lead that effort as the head of google maps. Today i lead uber's mapping efforts to ensure we can provide a safe, reliable ride — no matter where you are. To do that, uber uses a mix of mapping technologies ( including our own ) to provide the underlying infrastructure for our apps. Existing maps are a good starting point, but some information isn't that relevant to uber, like ocean topography. There are other things we need to know a lot more about, like traffic patterns and precise pickup and dropoff locations. Moreover, we need to be able to provide a seamless experience in parts of the world where there aren't detailed maps — or street signs. The ongoing need for maps tailored to the uber experience is why we're doubling down on our investment in mapping. Last year we put mapping cars on the road in the united states. This summer they hit the road in mexico. Our efforts are similar to what other companies including apple and tomtom are already doing around the world. The street imagery captured by our mapping cars will help us improve core elements of the uber experience, like ideal pick-up and drop-off points and the best routes for riders and drivers. Although our imagery collection efforts are focused now in mexico, we plan to expand these efforts to other countries soon. Over the past decade mapping innovation has disrupted industries and changed daily life in ways i couldn't have imagined when i started.

According to wisc, they're $ 170 more expensive than they were just six months ago — figure about $ 600 for a two-pack. \"they cost too damn much, \" a doctor with the national association of state ems officials tells stat. The higher costs aren't just affecting families. Some states require schools and fire departments to stock epipens, which are eating up more and more of their budgets. One allergist blames a lack of competition, pointing out that at this point \" epipen is like kleenex. \" one competitor was recently taken off the market, and the fda refused to approve a generic epipen earlier this year. More than three-quarters of the 4 million prescriptions written last year for epipen-like devices were for the epipen brand, money reports. The rising price of epipens could have dangerous repercussions besides just potentially dying from an allergic reaction. One mother whose son is deathly allergic to milk was going to be charged $ 1,200 for epipens, so she declined to fill the prescription and instead bought a supply of epinephrine and syringes at a pharmacy for $ 20. \"anyone using this approach would require extensive medical training to do it effectively and safely, without contamination or accidental intravenous injection, \" says one doctor, who, granted, works for an organization sponsored mylan, the epipen's manufacturer. Mylan says the price of epipens is increasing because of \"multiple, important product features and the value the product provides. \" however, this seems only be a problem in the us.

Police had been seeking the 34-year-old in new york city, but he returned to the washington area yesterday afternoon and was arrested last night after police followed his vehicle from maryland into northeast dc, sources tell nbc washington. A police official tells the washington post that wint was in a chevrolet cruze with two women, following a box truck with two men inside. All five were taken into custody and at least $ 10,000 in cash was found in the truck, the official says. A federal source tells myfoxdc that one of the men in the truck was wint's brother. Wint — who was identified from dna on a pizza crust — has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of the savopoulos family and a housekeeper. He used to work as a welder for the family's company, american iron works, and has a long record of alleged assaults and threats, according to court records seen by the post. At least one of those threats involved his own family: court records show that in 2005, wint's father applied for a protection order, saying that his son had threatened to shoot him and his wife, wint's stepmother, the new york daily news reports. In 2010, wint was arrested carrying a machete and a bb pistol outside the headquarters of american iron works, but the weapons charges were later dropped, the ap reports.",

The unnamed girl was asked to calculate her body mass index and give the definition for bmi, which is found by multiplying one's weight by 703 and dividing by squared height in inches. But instead of providing the number, she countered with a two-page essay. A \" proud \" family friend posted photographs of her work on facebook on march 30. The self-described \" bigger girl \" opens up about her own body image struggles, which recently involved trying \" to wrap ace bandages around my stomach so i'd look skinnier. \" her concerned parents took her to her doctor, \" a man who went to college for eight years studying children's health [ and ] told me my height and weight are right on track. \" she concludes by writing that her bmi is not only \" none of your concern \" but is also \" beautiful, \" as is her body. She also argues that bmi is an outdated index that has \" absolutely no way of discriminating [ between ] fat and muscle. \" indeed, a study published in nature in march finds that almost half of people considered \" overweight \" through this measure actually have a healthy cardiometabolic profile calculated using such factors as blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar, while about a third of the \" normal \" bmi people had unhealthy profiles. But a cdc study to be presented friday argues in favor of the measure's usefulness; it found that an infant's bmi at 6 to 18 months can predict those who are prone to obesity in early childhood.

A study in science says lightning frequency in the continental us could spike by more than 12 % for every degree celsius of global warming, mother jones reports. That could lead to a 50 % increase over the next 100 years or so, national geographic reports — or, as mother jones estimates it, three strikes for every two strikes now. The general reason, among more specific ones: as the air warms, it's able to retain more moisture — and moisture is conducive to lighting. The chance of getting struck by lightning isn't that high to begin with: the national weather service says the odds of a person being struck in a given year is 1 in 1,900,000. But more worrisome is the potential increase in wildfires, researchers say. Lightning sets off about half of the wildfires in the continental us, says david romps, the study's lead author — in august, lightning strikes were responsible for 34 california wildfires over just one weekend, the los angeles times reported at the time. There would be some benefit to more strikes, however: although more lightning makes more ozone, it also makes nitrogen oxide compounds, which effectively reduce methane in our atmosphere, romps notes.

Looking at whether age, gender, bmi, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and magnesium supplementation have a direct influence on pancreatic cancer rates, they found that for every 100mg-a-day decrease in magnesium intake ( ostensibly as compared to those who met the rda ), there's a 24 % increase in the incidence of pancreatic cancer. \" pancreatic cancer is really unique and different from other cancers, \" study co-author ka he says in a news release. \" the five-year survival rate is really low. \" magnesium, which health newsline reports is dubbed the \" master mineral, \" is involved in more than 300 enzyme systems that regulate things as varied as nerve function and blood glucose control in our bodies, according to the national institutes of health.

            "San jose -- a notorious 62-year-old stowaway who was arrested six times trying to sneak onto flights at sfo managed to fly from mineta san jose international airport to los angeles without a ticket monday, marking the second significant security breach at the airport in the past four months. Marilyn jean hartman was arrested late monday at lax after she sneaked past security at the san jose airport and onto a southwest airlines flight to los angeles. Hartman had made it onto a plane at least once in her attempts at san francisco international airport but was caught and arrested before the plane took off. Marilyn jean hartman somehow made it past security at mineta san jose international airport on monday night, aug. 4, 2014, and was arrested after arriving at los angeles international airport. She once made it onto a hawaii-bound airplane before being noticed, and was ordered to stay away from san francisco international airport after several stowaway attempts. ( san mateo county sheriff's office ) ( courtesy san mateo county sherif ) in april, a 15-year-old boy climbed a security fence onto the tarmac at the airport, stowed away in the wheel well of a maui-bound airplane and miraculously survived the high altitude and near-freezing temperatures during the 5½-hour flight.

The chain poked fun at kale in an ad earlier this year, declaring it would never replace lettuce in a burger, nor would trendy ingredients like \" soy or quinoa \" replace the meat's juiciness. But that ad \" was all about the big, juicy, iconic big mac, and this breakfast bowl test is completely unrelated, \" a mcdonald's spokeswoman tells fortune. The $ 3.99 bowl will also include turkey sausage, egg whites, spinach, and bruschetta, the ap reports. A market analyst says three salads that include kale will also be coming to mcdonald's menus in canada. Despite mcdonald's earlier mocking of the so-called \" superfood, \" an analyst predicted in march that kale would be coming to the chain's menu as part of ceo steve easterbrook's plans to make it a \" modern, progressive burger company. \" that \" progressive \" approach seems to have been applied to the new hamburglar, who's a lot slimmer than the character who was last seen as a pudgy cartoon character in 2002 but appears to be a suburban dad in a new ad, cnn reports. He has had \" some time to grow up a bit and has been busy raising a family in the suburbs and his look has evolved over time, \" a mcdonald's exec explains to mashable.

According to usa today, republican sen. Orrin hatch confirmed the house and senate have struck a deal, rectifying the hundreds of differences between the tax bills passed separately by the senate and house. Sen. Bob corker, the lone republican senator to vote against the tax bill, says its passage is \" not stoppable \" at this point. While hatch didn't give any details of the agreement, sources tells the los angeles times it would drop the corporate tax rate to 21 % and the tax rate for the wealthiest americans to 37 %. That slightly increases the 20 % corporate tax rate in both the house and senate bills, partially in order to pay for the tax rate for wealthy americans, which is lower than in either previous bill. Sources say the final bill will also include a repeal of the obamacare mandate that people buy health insurance that was included in the senate bill. A final tax bill is expected to be revealed by the end of the week with votes next week. Democrats are calling on republicans to delay a vote on the bill until doug jones is sworn in following his victory in alabama, but that's very unlikely to happen.",

        "summary": "Talk about an unfortunate case of mistaken identity: pennsylvania's james tully says police seem to think he resembles accused cop killer eric frein, and it's causing quite the headache. Tully tells abc news he's been stopped by inquiring officers more times than he can count while walking the five miles to his job at a metal manufacturing factory in monroe county's mountainhome. His walk takes him through the area where police are hunting for the fugitive survivalist, who is on the fbi's most wanted list. One day tully was stopped seven times; while walking on route 447 on friday, an officer forced him to the ground at gunpoint, pinning him there by thrusting a knee in tully's back, the pocono record reports. Worse still, \" once you get closer, you can see there is no resemblance, \" tully says. \" what i don't understand is how can you confuse someone five-foot-eight-and-a-half for someone six-foot-one, \" tully tells nbc news. For now, he's taken to wearing a reflective vest and an employer id card on his route. Frein is \" going to try and blend in, \" tully says. \" i want to stand out so i can let them know; look, i ' m not the one they're looking for. Just let me go on my way. \" he adds his only other route to work is through the woods, which he believes is a worse option. Some 1,000 officers are now searching for frein, who is accused of killing a trooper and critically wounding another during a sept. 12 attack. Pocono mountain schools were closed tuesday due to a reported sighting of frein but have since reopened.",

        "summary": "As egypt continues to melt down, with the death toll from days of unrest nearing 1,000, the longtime strongman overthrown in the nation's bloody 2011 revolt is on the verge of becoming a free man. Hosni mubarak will be released from jail this week, his lawyer tells reuters, after egypt's judiciary nullified a corruption charge against the frail 85-year-old. Pending the dismissal of another corruption charge, mubarak is free to roam the streets. \" he should be freed by the end of the week, \" says the lawyer; a judicial source says that figure is more like two weeks. Though mubarak faces a retrial for the killing of protesters in 2011, the ap reports he cannot continue to be held in custody because of a two-year limit pending a final verdict. Elsewhere on the ground: some 25 police officers have been massacred as islamic militants in the sinai peninsula — where attacks on security forces have soared since mohamed morsi was removed from office last month — ambushed a pair of minibuses carrying the officers and killed them execution-style in broad daylight, the ap reports. The egyptian government says 36 detainees captured in recent days died after clashes with police, reuters reports. Officials say the detainees, part of a convoy headed to a prison, rioted and captured a police officer. When tear gas was fired into a police van in an attempt to free the officer, the men suffocated. The muslim brotherhood says the incident was murder and the death toll was higher than the government admits. As european union leaders met to discuss the crisis — and consider halting aid to egypt — britain's foreign minister gave a bleak assessment. It will take \" years, maybe decades \" for the trouble to \" play itself out, \" and there is only a limited amount western powers can do, william hague says. \" we have to do our best to support democratic institutions \" without picking sides, he tells the bbc.",

Never mind that we're in the cab of an 18-wheeler cruising through colorado at 55 mph and martin was, until a moment ago, the guy at the wheel. Maybe he was feeling cocky. After all the truck, outfitted with $ 30,000 worth of hardware and software from san francisco startup otto, had just hours before made the world's first autonomous truck delivery. You'd think so momentous an occasion would have involved something more glamorous than 50,000 cans of budweiser, but there it is. The drive was as mundane as the beer in the trailer. At 12: 30 am, after leaving the brewery in fort collins and merging onto interstate 25, an otto driver punched a switch labeled \" engage, \" and, once sure autonomous mode had, in fact, engaged, climbed out of his seat. He buckled the safety belt behind him, to keep the warning chime from driving him crazy as the truck trundled 120 miles south to colorado springs. Don't worry. Otto, which uber bought last summer for roughly $ 680 million, doesn't want to put martin or anyone else out of work. Its technology works only on the highway, where it doesn't have to deal with tricky variables like jaywalking pedestrians, four-way stops, or kids on bicycles.

They investigated the effect of the drug on mice, and noted that within two hours of being injected with the drug, brain changes were visible, the bbc reports. After two hours, scans showed that mice on the drug developed more dendritic spines — key to forming memories — than did mice injected with water. \" our images provide clear evidence that cocaine induces rapid gains in new spines, and the more spines the mice gain, the more they show they learned about the drug, \" says a researcher. At the beginning of the experiment, the mice were placed in a \" conditioning box \" comprised of two very different rooms linked by a door. After their room preference became clear, they were injected in the opposite room. Afterward, mice tended to hang out on the side where they'd been injected, suggesting \" they were looking for more cocaine, \" says the researcher, per the uc berkeley news center. As for us humans, the brain changes could show how \" drug-related cues come to dominate decision-making...

The international business times reports the crocodile isn't the only zoo resident to have been victimized by visitors in recent days. A hippo at a zoo in el salvador succumbed to its injuries sunday after being attacked by zoo guests who entered its cage. The hippo, named gustavito, had been at the san salvador zoo for 12 years. It refused to eat following the attack and eventually died from its injuries.",

The film stars nicolas cage as a lumberjack living peacefully in a cabin the woods with his girlfriend, mandy ( andrea riseborough ), until a cult leader steals her away. Here's what critics are saying: \" it's not afraid to let the camera linger on gore or draw out dialogue in creepy tones with ice-cold stares. And that's where this movie wins, \" writes samantha incorvaia at the arizona republic. Sure, it's an \" acquired taste, \" but \" it has the potential to be the next cult classic \" with its \" technicolor lsd-like shots \" and creativity to spare. Cage, incorvaia adds, is perfectly cast in \" his craziest role yet. \" \" nothing he's done to date can really prepare you for the raw, unbridled insanity of his performance \" in this \" blood-soaked revenge flick … on angel dust, \" is how chris nashawaty puts it at entertainment weekly. \" there's an element of how-weird-can-we-go-with-this-thing daredevilry to mandy, \" but \" anyone who still hasn't walked out of the theater after the first hour or so will be grooving, \" he adds. \" for those who think nothing of staying up past midnight to devour the strange and fantastic, it hits the sweetest of spots \" as \" cosmatos displays a fervent love for all things extreme, culminating in a chainsaw battle for the ages, \" writes barry hertz at the globe and mail. He refers to mandy as \" the most bewildering film-going experience of the year. \" at rolling stone, david fear heaps plenty of praise on cage. Unleashed, he ' ll \" remind you what a compelling presence he is, \" particularly when shrieking in a two-minute bathroom scene. Fear also commends riseborough on \" lending a lysergic nervousness to her heroine \" and late composer jóhann jóhannsson on delivering a \" truly gorgeous \" final score.",

A trump loss would also give the media two weeks to discuss his loss of momentum before the next gop primary, which is new york's on april 19.

Meet 1i/2017 u1, or ' oumuamua ( hawaiian for \" messenger \" or \" scout \" ), which scientists say is an asteroid from another solar system — a cosmic first for observers on earth. Cnn notes the \" oddball \" ' oumuamua first caught hawaiian astronomers ' attention as it was hurtling through our solar system last month, and using telescopes, they've determined it's probably not so different than our native asteroids and comets. And because asteroids start to take shape around a particular planet as it forms, that hints there may be other planets not too different from our own in other solar systems. \" for decades we've theorized that such interstellar objects are out there, and now — for the first time — we have direct evidence they exist, \" a nasa rep says in a statement. A study published in nature notes the dark-red coloring of the 1,300-foot-long, cigar-shaped space rock, which suggests it may be made up of organic molecules, the \" building blocks \" of life. Per a release, data on the asteroid was gathered from telescopes worldwide, which helped cull tons of data on ' oumuamua's \" unusual nature. \" two teams are behind this expanded ' oumuamua description, and one out of ucla estimates there could be another 10,000 or so of what the guardian deems \" interstellar interlopers \" taking a road trip through our solar system, still waiting to be found. Based on their calculations, scientists think about 1,000 of these bodies enter our solar system each year, while 1,000 depart. Astronomers believe that as telescope and data processing technology improves, they ' ll start spotting more of them. ( we can thank one asteroid's good aim for our existence. )",
