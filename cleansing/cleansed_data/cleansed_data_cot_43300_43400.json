        "summary": "It's a big day in the tech world as we await the 1pm edt iphone announcement from apple hq. What do we think we know? it will be faster, slimmer, and have a larger screen: pretty much everyone agrees on these points. It will run on both gsm and cdma networks: the washington post says this is almost certain. It will have beefier voice navigation: again, most sources agree on this point. Mashable goes further and explains the feature, called assistant, artificial intelligence software that can help you find a restaurant, search on google, call a taxi, and more — all while learning from your actions. It will include apple's new operating system: ios 5 and icloud will offer both free and paid storage in the cloud for photos, movies, music, and apps, the post notes. Reuters adds that the new iphone is expected to be loaded with the updated software. It will be cheaper: reuters notes that some expect a cheaper model that would appeal to the asian market, in order to boost apple's growth there, but the wall street journal reports that the price is expected to remain around $ 199 to $ 299. Techcrunch, however, believes we will definitely see a cheaper phone — perhaps even less than $ 100. It will mark tim cook's debut: cook, the new ceo, will have his first chance to prove himself as the main speaker today. Still unknown is whether steve jobs will make an appearance. Other questions that remain: will apple announce two phones ( say, an iphone 5 and an iphone 4s ) or just one? what about a partnership with facebook? any news about the ipod? will the new iphone run on 4g networks? the juiciest rumor: boy genius report, citing an \" incredibly solid \" industry contact, says that sprint, yes, sprint, will get the iphone 5 exclusive, while at&t and verizon will get the iphone 4s.

What stands out is that one of the cops wore a patch promoting the #qanon conspiracy theory, the miami new times reports. For the uninitiated, #qanon argues that president trump and robert mueller are secret allies pursuing a ring of pedophiles including hillary clinton and barack obama. It originated on the online forum 4chan, where it's supported by someone dubbed \" q, \" who claims to be a top-ranking us military officer. But nbc news reports that \" q \" is really two 4chan moderators and \" a small-time youtube video creator \" who plucked the theory from message-board obscurity and turned it into a thing. That thing spread to reddit and then youtube, where tracy diaz — one of the 4chan moderators — posts videos that attract tens of thousands of subscribers, millions of hits, and at least some income. \" because i cover q, i got an audience, \" admits diaz. Note that 4chan is also the originator of pizzagate, and that reddit banned several qanon-associated threads in september after violent threats were found in subreddits including threats to assassinate hillary clinton. All things considered, it's no surprise that pence has deleted a tweeted image of him with the swat members in florida, per cnn. \" the patch is not authorized by bso, \" says a broward sheriff's office rep. \" this matter will be addressed immediately. \" ( meanwhile, sandy hook parents are ready for their legal battle with conspiracy peddler alex jones. )",

They argued the theater should have had armed security guards, silent alarms on exit doors, and security cameras behind the building. They also said there should have been perimeter patrols around the theater, the denver channel reports. \"if the theater hadn't failed … this tragedy would have been prevented, \" says marc bern, an attorney for the plaintiffs. But the jury in the civil trial ruled unanimously that cinemark had no reason to expect a mass shooting was imminent. Holmes ' attack was the first mass shooting at a movie theater in the us. \" if cinemark is liable under these circumstances, every single business in the world will be held liable for what happens on their property, regardless of how foreseeable it is, \" the post quotes an attorney for cinemark as saying. Bern calls it an \" unjust verdict. \" the victims argued that mass shootings are so common now that it's the responsibility of all businesses to be prepared for them.

It was first displayed at burning man in 2015. Cochrane says he created the statue as a statement against violence against women, inspired by a childhood friend who was sexually abused. \"we need to show women just being in their bodies, just being humans, as an antidote of the constant sexualization of the women's body, the constant dehumanization, \" cochrane tells the post. \" r-evolution \" depicts dancer and singer deja solis in a yoga mountain pose. Solis posed for two other statues for cochrane that were also displayed at burning man. Catharsis on the mall runs nov. 10 through nov. 12.

Not so the exasperated dispatcher who perceived, by phone, that a life-saving opportunity was passing and pleaded with the nurse to resuscitate the woman, or to get someone else to do it. But resuscitation was delayed until the ambulance arrived, and a short time later, at the hospital, the woman was declared dead. Still, my outrage is missing. Oh, here it is. I found it in the story that wasn't covered – but which played out countless times on countless senior citizens that same day",
            "Photo by justin sullivan/getty images this week, an emergency dispatcher in bakersfield, calif., frantically urged a caller to administer cpr to an 87-year-old female nursing home resident who wasn't breathing. The caller, who identified herself as a nurse at the home, refused, citing the facility's protocol against staff administering cpr. By the time emergency responders arrived, the resident had no pulse, and she died at a nearby hospital. The incident has prompted california law enforcement and the media to examine the legal and ethical implications of the nursing home's policies. It also raises the question: can you get in trouble for performing life-saving acts? and are you in hot water if you don't help? it depends on the state and country you are in. There is no one federal law governing the issue. Under the 2000 federal cardiac arrest survival act"

        "summary": "Over the past two years, wildlife rehabilitators in florida have found 10 struggling bald eagles — some of whom have died — at a landfill near an animal shelter. And they tell the ocala post they can explain the phenomenon: the eagles, a rep for the animis foundation suggests, have been eating euthanized animals left in the landfill, and the chemicals used in euthanasia have been transferred to the birds. Their allegations come after a dying eagle tested two years ago was found to have pentobarbital in its system; pentobarbital is often used to euthanize animals. Marion county, which runs the shelter, has defended itself against the allegations and says its solid waste team buries euthanized animals in accordance with state law, offering a fact sheet explaining its processes. Addressing the discovery of two eagles on february 2, county officials say as soon as they were made aware of the issue, they contacted a state-licensed wildlife rehabilitator ( animis is not licensed by the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission, but is on the fwc's list of approved rehabilitators ). The officials note that \" the cause of the eagles'distress is not known or confirmed by any official tests at this time, \" but tests are being done and animis claims the eagles showed \" symptoms of pentobarbital poisoning, \" news 13 reports. One of those eagles died, while the other is still being treated, the post notes. The us fish and wildlife service says that such situations arise every year, with both wildlife and pets affected by eating \" exposed euthanized carcasses. \" \" exposure of these carcasses is almost always the result of improper disposal at landfills, \" fws adds.

        "summary": "Colin kaepernick's collusion case against the nfl is expected to reach all the way to the white house as the quarterback and his lawyers prepare to seek federal subpoenas to compel the testimony of president trump, vice president mike pence, and others, according to yahoo sports. Kaepernick filed a grievance in october against the nfl asserting that teams are colluding against him to deny him a signing opportunity, reports cnn. Once a top-tier quarterback, in 2016 kaepernick set off a national debate when he began protesting racial injustice in the us by kneeling during the national anthem. He became a free agent last year but wasn't signed by any team. The subpoenas would be used to examine team owners'ties to trump, and whether the president exerted undue influence over them. It was recently revealed trump spoke directly to some owners about the anthem issue. The president has been very vocal in calling out players who take a knee or sit during the anthem and has stated publicly that owners should fire players who don't stand during the anthem. Most recently, he canceled a white house visit by the super bowl champion philadelphia eagles, citing the anthem controversy in a tweet. Kaepernick's effort to subpoena the president faces a number of complicated legal hurdles, and even if a federal judge finds in favor of kaepernick, there is still the question of whether the president can be forced to sit for a deposition. It is doubtful he would do it willingly since doing so would expose him to legal risk if he was found responsible for getting kaepernick blackballed from the league. Nfl commissioner roger goodell and several owners have already been deposed in the case, per cnn. ( kneeling during the anthem was recently banned by the nfl. )",

While the number of big-leaguers that use the stuff is dropping, about 1 in 3 are still in the habit, reports usa today, citing stats from the pro baseball athletic trainers society. The league has taken steps to curb its use — for example, players can't have a wad in their mouth during tv interviews, and the days of free tins in the clubhouse are long gone — but this is no longer enough, writes ernie palladino at cbs sports. For major league baseball, \" it's time to ban chewing tobacco, \" he writes. Sure, defenders will talk about the culture of the game and worry about \" sissifying \" it, but that's just outdated thinking.

Except, of course, there's a flurry of activity already under way. On that front: syria is getting ready: even in the face of the delay, the assad regime is prepping for an attack, telling damascus residents to flee areas near military bases the us may have in its crosshairs. In what appears to be a first, it's also reportedly moving soldiers into abandoned apartments in the capital's residential neighborhoods, one of which is now studded with antiaircraft gun-topped trucks. A syrian official yesterday told the wall street journal that both syria and hezbollah are prepared to retaliate, and would first target the five us destroyers and amphibious ship in the mediterranean. Missiles in the mediterranean: things weren't exactly quiet in the mediterranean this morning, with reuters reporting that russia \" raised the alarm \" after its radar picked up the launch of two ballistic \" objects \" there. But syria state sources quickly confirmed it was not hit, and israel confirmed that it had tested a missile around that time in a joint test with the us. ( reuters explains the missile was \" used as a target in a us-funded anti-missile system. \" ) reuters notes the cruise missiles aboard the us ships in the area are not ballistic. Senate committee gets things rolling: abc news reports that john kerry, chuck hagel, and chairman of the joint chiefs martin dempsey will testify in support of military force before the senate foreign relations committee today. Gloomy milestone: the number of syrian refugees since march 2011 passed the 2 million mark today, reports the un. The un reported yesterday that a total of one in three syrians — or 7 million — have been displaced. Putin to be confronted: the g20 host may find himself a bit mistreated by his guests this week. The guardian reports by way of british sources that putin \" will face a concerted challenge \" on thursday and friday as attendees push him to support the chemical-attack evidence ( which russia previously deemed \" absolutely unconvincing \" ) and the notion that assad needs to step aside. Where iran fits in: the new york times today takes a look at the catch-22 the obama administration finds itself in vis a vis iran.

But radar does appear to be correct on another count: while demi still follows her husband, his twitter account now shows up near the top of her list — which, because of the way twitter lists work, indicates that she stopped following him at some point and then started following him again recently. A seemingly incriminating photo of kutcher has also cropped up showing him in a car with a woman who looks like sara leal, whom he's accused of cheating with over the weekend. This picture, however, is from back in june. The sun also notes that the last time kutcher and moore were spotted together was two months ago, and gawker cites reports claiming that the couple actually stopped living together following last year's cheating rumors.

            "Rumors are flying fast and furious about the state of ashton kutcher and demi moore's marriage. Star magazine alleges that the couple has been living apart for months — kutcher filming \"two and a half men \" in los angeles while moore is in new york making \"magic mike\" — and that they are really over. A source told the magazine, \"[ they're ] just putting on a show until they officially split. \" the mag predicts a bitter divorce over the couple's $ 290 million in assets. I ' m still hoping all this is totally false — i've always loved aston and demi together. But i guess we ' ll have to wait and see. Meanwhile, a 23-year-old blonde alleges that she hooked up with kutcher a week ago, which happened to be ashton and demi's six year anniversary. So who is this girl ashton",
            "By amber goodhand radar reporter sometimes actions speak louder than words. Demi moore is no longer one of the 671 people ashton kutcher follows on twitter, radaronline.com is exclusively reporting. And it appears demi stopped following ashton as well for a period of time, and only recently began to \"follow \" him again. Photos: celebrity cheaters here's how twitter works: when you subscribe to and \"follow \" someone's profile, they show up on your profile under your list of \"following \" in the exact order that you began following them, with the most recent near the top. In 2009 ashton became the first person on twitter to reach one million followers, a feat that he reached with a \"follow \" and support from his wife, demi. So why does ashton's twitter handle appear as one of the 20 most recent people demi's started following?",

Booker recently made headlines for his opposition to the president's pick for the supreme court, brett kavanaugh, and clapper, who has served presidents of both parties, once questioned trump's fitness for office.

The times-picayune reports the obituary, quickly going viral, was the work of ziegler's four children and calls it one of the all-time great obituaries. Ziegler served in vietnam — the obituary notes he \" only stuck it out for one war \" — before working as a firefighter in new orleans for 25 years. The obituary goes on to note ziegler's fondness for his \" alcoholic dog, \" the \" morons and mental patients \" he worked with, and \" potted meats, \" the huffington post reports. According to the new york daily news, there won't be a service, so ziegler's children ask people to \" write a note of farewell on a schaefer light beer can and drink it in his honor. \" ziegler's daughter, sharah currier, tells the times-picayune that her dad would always pass along strange obituaries. \" he would have loved this, \" she says. \" he probably would have forwarded this obituary to us. \" ziegler's obituary does end on a serious note: \" he will be greatly missed. \"",

Utility workers struggled to restore power to about 370,000 customers in the city and other areas darkened by the first, and broken traffic lights and downed trees snarled traffic across affected communities.in heavily hit pasadena, it was a question of where to begin. Sixty people, many of them elderly and disabled, were bused to a red cross shelter from an apartment building on hudson avenue that flooded after a tree crashed through the roof and broke a water pipe.roof shingles were peeled off and garage doors knocked askew. Thousands were without power and 200 buildings were damaged, more than three dozen residences so badly that they were \" red-tagged \" — deemed unsafe",

Nobody, \" said jon kirk mukri, general manager of the los angeles department of recreation and parks, talking of scores of city parks so littered with broken branches and teetering trees that they were considered a threat to public safety.officials took the rare step of temporarily closing griffith park because of the windstorm, fearing that downed wires might spark fires in piles of dry, shattered trees. Utility workers struggled to restore power to about 370,000 customers in the city and other areas darkened by the first, and broken traffic lights and downed trees snarled traffic across affected communities.in heavily hit pasadena, it was a question of where to begin. Sixty people, many of them elderly and disabled, were bused to a red cross shelter from an apartment building on hudson avenue that flooded after a tree crashed through the roof and broke a water pipe.roof shingles were peeled off and garage doors knocked askew. Thousands were without power and 200 buildings were damaged, more than three dozen residences so badly that they were \" red-tagged \" — deemed unsafe",
            "The winds reached 97 mph at one mountain peak. More than 380,000 homes lost power. Thousands of trees snapped, blocking roads and damaging property. Scores of schools were closed, as was griffith park. And motorists battled gridlock caused by broken traffic signals and blowing debris.the storm, which produced some of the strongest wind gusts in more than a decade, was caused by a highly unusual weather system that even had experts marveling at its power.while santa ana winds are common this time of year, this storm was anything but.the winds were produced by two separate weather systems that channeled cold air from the north into the los angeles area.a clockwise high-pressure system was parked over northern california and the great basin as a counter-clockwise low-pressure system hovered over arizona.like two massive gears spinning in opposite directions, the systems funneled the winds. \" in some places we've seen gusts over hurricane force, which for the southwest part of the country is not something that usually happens, \" said brian edwards, a meteorologist for accuweather.com. \" this is a one-every-10-years kind of thing. \" indeed, the blustery conditions extended across the southwest, including utah, nevada, wyoming, arizona and new mexico. In some places, including utah, wind gusts topped 100 mph.experts said one reason for the extensive damage was that the winds were remarkably choppy and unpredictable.in"

        "summary": "Her murderous web won't protect japan's \" black widow, \" who's been sentenced to hang after a months-long trial. Judge ayako nakagawa of kyoto district court ruled tuesday that chisako kakehi, 70, will hang for the murders of two common-law boyfriends and a husband, as well as the attempted murder of a fourth man, between 2007 and 2013. \" i have no choice but to impose the ultimate penalty, \" nakagawa said, noting the \" cunning and malicious \" cyanide poisonings were \" well prepared in advance \" and \" driven by greed \" as kakehi reaped $ 8.8 million in insurance and inheritance money, per the bbc and japan times. During the trial, prosecutors described how the murders occurred after kakehi joined a matchmaking service asking to meet rich men without children. Once named the beneficiary of life insurance policies and wills, kakehi killed masanori honda, 71, and minoru hioki, 75, and tried to kill toshiaki suehiro, 79, prosecutors said. That failed attempt clearly didn't deter kakehi, who would go on to kill 75-year-old isao kakehi a month after they were married in 2013 — something kakehi acknowledged during the trial but later denied, per the bbc. Defense lawyers argued kakehi shouldn't be liable for the crimes because of a dementia diagnosis. But nakagawa stressed kakehi was only diagnosed with mild dementia in 2016. The judge also noted kakehi — who once said she \" would die smiling \" if executed — showed no remorse and \" made light of human lives. \" kakehi's lawyers plan to appeal the decision, reports the guardian.

        "summary": "A new stanford university study solves part of the mystery surrounding typhoid mary, the new york times reports. Scientists have long wondered how mary mallon could have infected so many people as a carrier of typhoid fever in the early 1900s, yet appear perfectly healthy for decades. The study offers clues as to how the bacteria that cause the illness, salmonella typhi, hide out: they invade macrophages, cells in the immune system that typically attack invading bacteria, and then manipulate the metabolism of those macrophages. Stanford's scope blog says the bacteria \" mess with our immune systems \"; the huffington post describes the bacteria as ' hacking \" the macrophages; phys.org goes with an analogy, comparing the bacteria to renters who remodel a home. Basically, the bacteria are tough enough that they can survive the first few days of an inflammatory response from the immune system, after which the macrophages go into a \" kinder, gentler \" anti-inflammatory mode because the body can't handle too much inflammation, and then the bacteria are safe. It's not yet known how the bacteria are able to successfully \" flip the switch \" on the macrophages, but they also manage to get the macrophages to produce glucose, which the bacteria then feed on — and they can then survive in their new hiding place for decades. The times notes another mystery: while mallon's samples were often rife with salmonella typhi bacteria, at other times they were perfectly clean.

Feds today arrested john booker, a 20-year-old from topeka, kansas, and accused of him plotting a suicide bombing at fort riley in kansas, reports the topeka capitol-journal. He'd been under surveillance for a while, however, and the fbi says the explosives he was working with were actually harmless, unbeknownst to booker, aka mohammed abdullah hassan. One twist: feds say he actually enlisted in the army as part of his plot, and abc news says he was due to report for basic training on tuesday. He also allegedly had made his martyr videos already. Booker drew the attention of authorities about a year ago with posts on social media, including one that read, \"getting ready to be killed in jihad is a huge adrenaline rush!! \" reports the kansas city star.

The ap reports that the planes ended the day having had no luck; they combed an 8,800-square-mile area but were hampered by low visibility caused by clouds and rain. The search will resume tomorrow, but australian authorities warn against jumping to conclusions. Satellite images \" do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up, \" says john young, the australian maritime safety authority's emergency response chief. Aircraft from the us and new zealand are also on their way to the debris site, along with a merchant ship and an australian naval vessel, the bbc reports. Malaysian authorities have been informed of the find and will hold a press conference later today. \" every lead is a hope. We have been consistent with our process and we want to verify properly, \" a government spokesman says. Crew members from a us navy poseidon p-8 told abc they received radar hits of \" significant size \" in the area, but their commander later said the readings were typical and not connected to the missing plane. If the debris does turn out to be from the missing boeing 777, the mystery will still be a long way from solved, the new york times finds. The clues investigators really need will probably have sunk beneath the waves, and ocean currents could have carried floating debris hundreds of miles away from the crash site. The fbi, meanwhile, says it is working with malaysian authorities to analyze data deleted from a flight simulator found at the pilot's home. It's not clear whether the deleted files will prove relevant to the investigation and authorities stress that the pilot is being considered innocent.",

        "summary": "Southern comfort bills itself as \" the spirit of new orleans, \" but the generic grain-neutral spirit base it contains ( an ingredient not far removed from vodka ) doesn't exactly scream \" deep south character. \" the sazerac company, owner of the college-staple brand, wants to change that perception — and hopefully sales — by reintroducing whiskey into the mix in redesigned bottles set to hit shelves in july, the new york times reports. Sazerac, which vinepair notes also owns the buffalo trace bourbon and bowman brothers whiskey brands, wants to dump the \" liqueur \" association it believes consumers often attribute to southern comfort, bringing it back to its original roots by adding undisclosed types of north american whiskey in its own stash. The southern comfort website explains the famous libation was first whipped up in 1874 by a bartender ( identified by the times as martin w. Heron ) who tried to tamp down the \" harsh whiskeys of the time \" by throwing in various fruits and spices. But the times notes that by the time brown-forman took over the brand's barrels in 1979, the whiskey had been completely nixed from the mix — and once sazerac bought southern comfort from brown-forman in 2016, the idea of adding whiskey back started gaining momentum. The company plans on phasing out flavored soco versions while retaining the 70-proof and 100-proof original recipes. It also wants to add in an 80-proof version with a black label on the bottle like those of competitors jack daniel's and jim beam.

The arrest was made after the iraqi government issued a complaint to british police following an auction in derby, where the two-foot hunk of metal failed to fetch the minimum price of $ 375,000 set for the sale. Under a 2003 british law, all cultural property seized in iraq must be handed over to police, reports the bbc. The bronze butt was offered for sale by trebletap, a company that specializes in turning war memorabilia into art. Company director jim thorpe was busted and has been released on bail. The firm's founder, nigel ely, is a former sas soldier who was working for british tv on the scene when the statue was pulled down. He used a sledgehammer and chisel to remove the statue's \" bum, \" he told the bbc. He claims that when he asked a us marine if he could take the souvenir, he was told: \" no problem, buddy.

        "summary": "\" like spotify, but you have to pay for it \" hasn't turned out to be a great business model for tidal, the music service jay z and other superstar co-owners relaunched last month. After a month, the service has already dropped out of the iphone top 700 download chart, and the company's ceo has been replaced in what it describes as a \" streamlining \" move, the guardian reports. Rivals pandora and spotify, meanwhile, have surged ahead and are now both in the top four of the us iphone revenue chart, which tero kuittinen at bgr believes is partly because tidal's fierce criticism of other music services raised public awareness of them. Many commentators blame the flop on the mixed message tidal sent in having a-listers launch a music service that promised to give artists more money. Next time artists like jay z \" pitch something for the good of starving artists, \" los angeles times music critic randall roberts writes, \" they probably shouldn't do it while in a mansion holding champagne flutes and toasting their gold-leafed good fortune. \" tidal backer kanye west mysteriously deleted his tweets on the service last night, reports entertainment tonight, but in a paper magazine cover story, he defends it in his own way. Tidal is not an illuminati front, he insists. \" i ' m tired of people pinpointing musicians as the illuminati, \" he writes. \" that's ridiculous.

        "summary": "Police are searching for a soccer player who gave a referee a traumatic brain injury on sunday morning in san francisco. During an adult-league game, the 33-year-old referee gave a player a yellow card for a violation, which the player apparently argued, police tell the san francisco chronicle. The referee gave the player a second violation, then a red card, kicking him out of the game. That's when the player allegedly punched the referee from behind, knocking him unconscious, breaking his jaw, and causing a brain injury, police say. The referee is expected to survive. \" if you're a fanatic in the sport, that's one thing, but to assault a referee; to take your aggression because of a call he made, that's a problem, \" an officer tells cbs san francisco. The player — described as over 6 feet tall, 20 to 25 years old with black or brown hair — reportedly knew the referee and fled in a white pick-up truck. \" it's just a matter of time before we identify who he is, and hold him accountable, \" the officer says. Last week in argentina, a soccer referee was shot and killed by a player he kicked out of a match, reports the guardian. ( a ref also died from a punch in 2014. )",

        "summary": "James franco's high from his best actor win at the golden globes has likely worn off with the possible oscar contender now facing a barrage of sexual misconduct claims. In the los angeles times, five women — including two who previously spoke out on twitter — accuse franco of inappropriate conduct, particularly involving nude scenes. Sarah tither-kaplan, a former acting student of franco, says he exploited students who agreed to appear nude on camera, in one case removing clear plastic covers protecting their genitalia while simulating oral sex. Other students describe him promising students acting roles that turned out to involve nudity, becoming irate when no actresses volunteered to appear topless, and punishing those who balked. Actress violet paley also says franco pressured her into performing oral sex before beginning a romantic relationship. The claims — which franco's lawyer denies — follow those made on twitter during sunday's golden globes. Paley, for example, also accused franco of inviting her 17-year-old friend to his hotel room, in an apparent echo of a 2014 encounter. Ally sheedy, whom franco directed in a 2014 play, also targeted the actor in a series of since-deleted tweets, one of which read, \" james franco just won. Please never ever ask me why i left the film/tv business. \" like stephen colbert a day before, seth meyers asked franco about the allegations on late night wednesday. \" the [ tweets ] i read were not accurate \" and \" i have my own side of this story, \" but \" this is a conversation that needs to be had, \" franco said, per the hollywood reporter. \" i believe in these people that have been underrepresented getting their stories out enough that i will hold back things that i could say. \"",

            "Universal studios hopes to rake in millions of dollars this weekend with the release of its new action film battleship, and sales of the classic board game are expected to get a nice boost, too. As readers may recall, the game play is simple: each player arranges five ships — an aircraft carrier, battleship, cruiser, submarine, and destroyer — on a ten-by-ten grid of squares and attempts to \"sink \" his opponent's ships by calling out the squares where he believes his enemy's ships are hiding."

But it wasn't just that brian holloway was upset by the $ 20,000 in damage; his main concern was that he wasn't invited. His 19-year-old son spotted tweets about the party and told holloway, who watched it unfold — by way of tweets and twitter photos — from his florida home; one photo showed people standing on a table that the former patriots offensive lineman bought with his super bowl xx bonus. And the kids weren't exactly secretive: the new york daily news reports that some spray-painted their names on walls; others tweeted invites to the aug. 31 party a full five days before it happened. Perhaps unsurprisingly, \" it's not hard to identify who they were, \" says holloway. \" we've got 170 tweets. We have 200 to 220 names already confirmed today. And that data is all going to the sheriffs. \" that's not the only place the data is going: he has also been posting it to a website dubbed helpmesave300, in an effort to get the teens to come forward, take responsibility, and adjust their behavior.

Why? nate silver of the new york times contemplates that question today, posing two exaggerated hypothetical scenarios: either a ) it was personal. Perry prayed on the decision, and ignored his strategists, or b ) it was rational. Perry's strategists convinced him to stay in, after getting calls from elected officials, donors, and activists eager for him to supplant rick santorum as their conservative anti-romney. Early reporting indicates it was at least partially the latter. Some donors did urge perry to stay in, and conservative leaders are actively seeking a standard-bearer. Polling data in south carolina is woefully out of date, but silver suspects perry could peel away some former gingrich supporters and contend. \" i would not assign high odds to mr. Perry making a comeback — much less actually winning the nomination, \" he writes, but it's too soon \" to conclude that mr. Perry has been winnowed out. \"",

As the nsa whistleblower, who is believed to still be in moscow, remains out of sight, angry words are flying between moscow, beijing, quito, and washington, the new york times reports. White house spokesman jay carney said the incident has \" unquestionably \" damaged the us-china relationship, and repeated a demand for russia to hand snowden over to us authorities.

Snowden chose china and russia as assistants in his flight from justice because they're such powerful bastions of internet freedom, \" john kerry scoffed.

You don't just let him pass through the business lounge, on the way to cuba. \" but here's russia's official word on the matter, according to cnn: \" we have nothing to do with mr.

He has not crossed the russian border, \" said foreign minister sergey lavrov at a press conference, calling the us \" accusations \" \" absolutely groundless and unacceptable. \" cnn notes that snowden could be \" somewhere on the transit side of the airport's immigration process \" in moscow; a passenger says she saw him on the flight from hong kong to that city. China has fired back at us accusations that beijing made the decision to allow snowden to depart hong kong, the guardian reports. An editorial in the top state-run newspaper demanded an \" explanation and apology \" from the us, and praised snowden for \" tearing off washington's sanctimonious mask. \" if snowden does manage to make it to ecuador to seek asylum, president rafael correa says that the decision on the case will be made with \" absolute sovereignty, \" reports the washington post.

To preserve van gogh's masterpieces and other works from the same era, he says, conservationists will need to keep the paintings cool in summer — and away from sunlight. \" this type of cutting-edge research is crucial to advance our understanding of how paintings age and should be conserved for future generations, \" an official at amsterdam's van gogh museum tells livescience.",

In fact, robin rinaldi's book about her experience is called the wild oats project. \" sometimes things call to you that aren't in the blueprint, that make your friends raise their eyebrows, but that in your soul, you know, ' i gotta do this, ' \" she tells the toronto star. When her husband thwarted her desire for children by getting a vasectomy, rinaldi made a deal with him: each could sleep around for 12 months, providing it wasn't with friends, was with condoms, and never got serious. So at age 44, the woman who'd been monogamous for 18 years placed an ad for men who wanted to help explore her sexuality. She started with paul, someone she already knew; then came a silicon valley lawyer, an astrologer, a phd student in spirituality, a 23-year-old in a vegas hotel — the list goes on. Some she met while living at a sex-ed, urban commune, where residents got together at 6am for a quarter hour of clitoral stimulation: \" then i'd get dressed and go to work, \" says rinaldi. \" i felt very energized, like i'd had a brisk jog. \" ultimately, it didn't save her marriage, but she developed a finer awareness of her sexuality ( \" your body has wisdom, that is very powerful \" ) and learned more about being married ( \" expecting your spouse to provide passion and security and purpose, it's a lot \" ). She also has a tip about sleeping around: \" sow your wild oats before you settle down — that's a no-brainer, \" she says. See an excerpt at the new york post.

            "After months of posturing and reports of feuds between google and apple, google maps launched on the app store earlier today. The app is already the number one most downloaded app on apple's marketplace, seven hours after it became available. The app has been very well received, receiving a 4.5/5 rating on the uk app store from 1,026 ratings ( or 8,975 on the us store ). It has ousted apple's own ' 12 days of christmas ' app, as iphone and ipod touch owners download google's new maps title to complement or even replace apple's own. The app itself includes turn-by-turn navigation, public transit directions and google street view. It also allows users to enjoy voice-based, turn-by-turn driving instructions and live traffic information from across the world. Google includes train, bus, subway and walking directions — bringing it up to speed with the android and desktop versions. If you haven't had a chance to play with the app yet, why not read our full review. Google also launched an sdk that gives developers a chance to integrate it into their ios apps, bypassing apple's own mapping hooks and allowing google maps to power their apps, while also linking them to the google maps ios app should they wish.

' he was very clear. \" in cook's first 16 months on the job, apple has released next-generation iphones and ipads and seen its stock price rise 43 percent. Though it hasn't yet expanded into new product categories ( still no apple tv set ), the company has changed in significant ways, largely because of cook's calm and steady influence. In his most wide-ranging interview as ceo, cook explains how apple works now, talks about the perception that he's \"robotic, \" and announces the return of apple manufacturing to the u.s. Bloomberg businessweek: how has apple changed since oct. 5, 2011? the first thing to realize is that all the things that have made apple ( aapl ) so special are the same as they have always been.

The remarks came less than a day after giuliani's bombshell interview with fox host sean hannity, in which giuliani said president trump reimbursed his personal lawyer, michael cohen, for \"hush money \" paid to porn star stormy daniels. Giuliani's statement follows four months of negotiations between the mueller and trump teams that have included talk of a subpoena if trump refuses to testify in the special counsel probe into russian interference with the 2016 us election. Giuliani also said that any interview with trump should be limited in time. \"they should be able to do this, if they have a case, in two or three hours, \" giuliani said during a series of media interviews thursday, as reported in the washington post. But giuliani also said, per fox, that attorney general jeff sessions should shut the probe down entirely as it has uncovered no evidence of collusion with the russians. Trump has said in the past that he would be willing to be interviewed by mueller, but he lately appears to be walking back some of those statements. Per the post, some of trump's advisers worry that open-ended questions from mueller could result in \" meandering \" answers from trump that lead to accusations of perjury. In the hannity interview wednesday night, giuliani said \" the odds are [ trump ] wouldn't be interviewed \" by mueller, but he added, \" i don't close my mind to it. \"",

Bobby jindal in particular went after christie again and again, declaring that his own record as governor of louisiana is far more of a conservative model than christie's in new jersey. \"i ' ll give you a ribbon for participation and a juice box, but in the real world it's about results, \" jindal said during one of their exchanges. But as politico points out, christie wanted no part of this fight. \"he's done a nice job in louisiana, and i don't have any problem with the job he's done, \" christie said. \" people out there don't care about any of that. They care about who's going to beat hillary clinton, who's going to keep their eye on the ball. \" the washington post sums up jindal's tactics: \" jindal, who rose in politics as a mild-mannered wonk, seems to believe his path to the nomination is to run as a conservative hard-liner, and a bit of a jerk, \" noting another of his quotes: \"i want to fire everybody in dc. \" the debate as a whole was a relatively tame affair, with rick santorum ( \" this campaign has been about two words for me: working families \" ) and mike huckabee ( \" we get rid of the irs.

        "summary": "A paris magazine has caused a stir by reviving a sensational allegation about adolf hitler: he supposedly fathered a son with a french teen while he was a soldier in world war i. The telegraph has the details: the son's name is jean-marie loret, and he died in 1985 having never met his father. In fact, he fought against nazi forces in world war ii. His biological mother, charlotte lobjoie, was 16 when she said she struck up a relationship with the young hitler, who was on leave. Loret has told his story publicly before; he even wrote a book called your father's name was hitler, which is now being republished. According to the story, hitler never acknowledged his son, though he kept in touch with lobjoie over the years. The paris magazine lepoint presents lots of circumstantial evidence: the men have the same blood type, the german army gave envelopes of money to lobjoie in wwii, paintings seemingly signed by hitler were found in her attic upon her death, etc. The magazine's report is here, and though it's in french, you can at least see photos of hitler and loret side-by-side. The telegraph sees an \" astonishing resemblance, \" which is debatable. ( but the mustaches definitely look alike. )",

His extraordinary story has now been backed up by a range of compelling evidence, both in france and in germany, which is published in the latest edition of paris's le point magazine. Hitler is said to have had an affair with mr loret's mother, charlotte lobjoie, 16, as he took a break from the trenches in june 1917. Although he was fighting the french near seboncourt, in the northern picardy region, hitler made his way to fournes-in-weppe, a small town west of lille, for regular leave. There he met miss lobjoie, who later told their son: \" one day i was cutting hay with other women, when we saw a german soldier on the other side of the street. \" he had a sketch pad and seemed to be drawing.

        "summary": "As the search for three escaped inmates stretches on, orange county jail officials are facing pressure to explain why the men weren't held in individual cells. Authorities at the men's central jail in santa ana say hossein nayeri, 37, jonathan tieu, 20, and bac duong, 43 — charged with violent crimes including torture, kidnapping, murder, and attempted murder — fled through a hole in a wall hidden behind bunk beds in a 68-man dorm. However, the sheriff's department in neighboring los angeles county says it keeps inmates accused of similar crimes in one-person cells, reports the los angeles times. At the state level, the california department of corrections adds that inmates convicted of violent crimes are typically only held in a dormitory after 20 years of good behavior. \" these guys have nothing to lose, \" a former corrections head says. \" why are they, looking at life or worse, not being held in closed cells? who made that judgment? \" los angeles county requires at least three physical checks per day, while a minimum of four are performed at the state level; orange county performs just two. The escapees were last spotted during a 5am check on friday, but were missing during the next check 16 hours later; it was delayed by an hour due to a \" jailhouse brawl \" that could have been a cover-up, the times notes. A further cause of concern is that authorities might have had reason to suspect that one of the inmates was a flight risk. Nayeri fled to iran after allegedly cutting off a marijuana dispensary owner's penis, per the times. He was eventually arrested in the czech republic. A former jail official says the inmates likely had help getting the tools to cut through four layers of steel and rebar. \" such cutting creates a lot of noise, and it would have to be covered up, \" he says. \" once we get the inmates back into custody, we ' ll focus on how they were able to get out, \" an officer tells the orange county register.",

        "summary": "A man already serving a life sentence in sweden for a shooting spree in which he targeted immigrants and foreign students was sentenced to a second life sentence wednesday in germany for killing a holocaust survivor over 25 years ago, the telegraph reports. According to reuters, 68-year-old blanka zmigrod was shot in broad daylight outside her home in frankfurt in 1992. Swedish white supremacist john ausonius — known as \" laser man \" for the rifle scope he used in a string of shootings in 1991 and 1992 — has now been found guilty of killing the holocaust survivor. Witnesses say ausonius argued with zmigrod, accusing her of stealing an electronic notebook from his coat, at the restaurant where she worked as a cloakroom attendant the day before her death. She was killed with the same ammunition ausonius used in his earlier shootings, deutsche welle reports. At the time of zmigrod's death, ausonius was on the run after killing an iranian man and seriously wounding 10 others in a string of racially motivated shootings in sweden. The now-64-year-old was sentenced to life in prison in 1995 for those shootings. The case into zmigrod's killing had been closed in 1996 but was reopened in 2014. Ausonius admits to the shootings — though he says they were meant to distract from his bank robberies and not racially motivated — but denies killing zmigrod. It's possible ausonius will be released before his death due to how life sentences work in germany and sweden, though that is unlikely. Ausonius is said to have inspired anders breivik, who killed 77 people in norway in 2011, as well as neo-nazi group the national socialist underground, which killed 10 people last decade.",

            "Beijing – a court heard opening arguments tuesday in a case calling for textbooks published by china's ministry of education to alter or remove sections calling homosexuality a disease that can be cured. Qiu bai ( center ) speaks to the media with her lawyer wang zhenyu ( left ) outside a court in beijing on tuesday. Greg baker / afp - getty images a student who goes by the pseudonym qiu bai discovered the issue two years ago when as a curious freshman she looked through medical textbooks seeking answers about her own sexual orientation. The 20-year-old showed nbc news one of the textbooks — \" university students mental health \" — which states that gay people can change their sexual orientation through therapy. \"i thought textbooks should be trustworthy but when i saw these lines, i felt horrible. I was so worried about other people being afraid of gay people, like me, \" the student at sun yat-sen university in the southern chinese city of guangzhou said. \"this is discrimination against homosexuality. \" the chinese psychiatric association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 2001. But a 2014 survey conducted by china's tong cheng gay and lesbian campus association found that 40 percent of textbooks published in the country after 2001 still classified homosexuality as a psychological disorder. Qiu bai earlier this year wrote an open letter to the ministry of education",
            "Gay rights activists outside a beijing courthouse on tuesday. ( afp/getty images ) qiu bai was looking for information on human sexuality. What she found was homophobia disguised as fact. Chinese textbooks called homosexuality a \" disorder. \" some suggested shock therapy as a \"cure. \" one book even dismissed the very possibility of same-sex love. Outraged, the college student decided to challenge china's ministry of education in court. It's a case she hopes will call attention to anti-gay bias and persuade chinese officials to ban this type of language in state-published books. \" i have been fighting to make our voices heard for such a long time, and i finally have the opportunity, \" said qiu, who uses a pseudonym, greeting supporters outside a beijing courthouse on tuesday.

            "Beijing – a court heard opening arguments tuesday in a case calling for textbooks published by china's ministry of education to alter or remove sections calling homosexuality a disease that can be cured. Qiu bai ( center ) speaks to the media with her lawyer wang zhenyu ( left ) outside a court in beijing on tuesday. Greg baker / afp - getty images a student who goes by the pseudonym qiu bai discovered the issue two years ago when as a curious freshman she looked through medical textbooks seeking answers about her own sexual orientation. The 20-year-old showed nbc news one of the textbooks — \" university students mental health \" — which states that gay people can change their sexual orientation through therapy. \"i thought textbooks should be trustworthy but when i saw these lines, i felt horrible. I was so worried about other people being afraid of gay people, like me, \" the student at sun yat-sen university in the southern chinese city of guangzhou said. \"this is discrimination against homosexuality. \" the chinese psychiatric association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 2001. But a 2014 survey conducted by china's tong cheng gay and lesbian campus association found that 40 percent of textbooks published in the country after 2001 still classified homosexuality as a psychological disorder. Qiu bai earlier this year wrote an open letter to the ministry of education",

What she found was homophobia disguised as fact. Chinese textbooks called homosexuality a \" disorder. \" some suggested shock therapy as a \"cure. \" one book even dismissed the very possibility of same-sex love. Outraged, the college student decided to challenge china's ministry of education in court. It's a case she hopes will call attention to anti-gay bias and persuade chinese officials to ban this type of language in state-published books. \" i have been fighting to make our voices heard for such a long time, and i finally have the opportunity, \" said qiu, who uses a pseudonym, greeting supporters outside a beijing courthouse on tuesday.

The judge also ordered 23-year-old norris greenhouse jr. And 32-year-old derrick stafford — charged with the murder of jeremy mardis and attempted murder of his father, chris few — to hand over their badges and guns. The avoyelles parish da also made headlines, filing a motion to be recused because greenhouse's father is an assistant da under him. Meanwhile, a law enforcement source tells cbs that body-camera footage appears to show few with his hands in the air before the cops started shooting. \" this was not a threatening situation for the police, \" few's attorney says, per the ap. Cbs notes investigators are looking into whether there was a grudge against few, speculation backed by few's fiancee, who tells the advocate that he had a previous confrontation with greenhouse. Other details are slowly emerging about the two marksville marshals. Stafford was indicted on aggravated rape charges in 2011 for alleged attacks on two separate victims, alexandria's local paper reports; the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning stafford could still face those charges. He's also named as a defendant in at least five pending civil complaints, including two suits in which he's accused of unnecessarily using stun guns on suspects and one in which he allegedly broke a teen girl's arm while removing her from a school bus, the advocate reports. Greenhouse also shows up as a defendant in an excessive-force lawsuit, per cnn.

Witness two prior articles at new york ( \" is prostitution just another job? \" ) and the new york times magazine ( \" should prostitution be a crime? \" ). Now a piece at vanity fair suggests that, like it or not, this is no longer a fringe industry. \" as the debate over whether the united states should decriminalize sex work intensifies, prostitution has quietly gone mainstream among many young people, seen as a viable option in an impossible economy and legitimized by a wave of feminism that interprets sexualization as empowering, \" writes nancy jo sales. Typically, this involves a young woman striking up a financial arrangement with a rich man, married or not, through one of the slew of sites now catering to them. That's a huge factor in the phenomenon: instead of a pimp, you need only a computer. Some see the trend as a natural extension of the casual hookup culture on dating apps, or \" disposable \" sex, as one man quoted in the story puts it. One popular site, seekingarrangement, connects \" sugar babies \" with \" sugar daddies, \" and sales interviews those who indulge. \" i reject it when people say i ' m oppressed by the patriarchy, \" says one, miranda, who has encounters with a lawyer, an architect, and a tech guy in austin. \" people who make seven dollars an hour are oppressed by the patriarchy. \" the author also attends a party hosted by the site, noting two broad categories of men: the john mccain type, along with \" jumbo-size danny devitos. \" but the best-looking one in the room, who works in tech, explains his rationale: \" i work all the time, and i don't have time for a girlfriend. \" click for the full piece, which also explores the dangers of the work and concerns about human trafficking.",

Sarah mckinley, 18, reportedly was home alone with her infant son just a week after her husband died of lung cancer, when two men tried to break into her house. Mckinley managed to push the couch to the front door to create a barricade, but that didn't stop the intruders. \" he was from door to door trying to bust in, \" mckinley told cbs affiliate kwtv. \" i don't know what he had in his hand besides the knife.

        "summary": "Several avid northern lights watchers who call themselves alberta aurora chasers on facebook were sharing photographs at a talk when a professor at the university of calgary noticed something strange. The citizen scientists were referring to a purple streak of light as a \" proton arc, \" but no proton auroras are actually visible. Intrigued, prof. Eric donovan looked into the matter and, looping in other scientists, realized they were observing a previously undescribed night light, reports the bbc. The group of amateurs took to calling the light \" steve, \" with one joking that it's more than just a nice name but possibly also an acronym for sudden thermal emission from velocity enhancement. Meanwhile, the european space agency lined up its swarm satellite with another steve sighting to collect data. While the light remains largely a mystery — outside of it not stemming from solar particles interacting with the earth's magnetic field, as is the case with aurora borealis — swarm revealed that the temperature of the arc was 5,400 degrees hotter inside the ribbon of gas than outside, and that the ribbon was moving 600 times faster than the air around it. Steve is \" actually remarkably common, but we hadn't noticed it before, \" one esa scientist says. \" it is amazing how a beautiful natural phenomenon, seen by observant citizens, can trigger scientists ' curiosity. This is a nice example of society for science. \" ( tourists in iceland were caught driving under the influence of the aurora. )",
