While cleaning sludge out of a cannon recovered from blackbeard's flagship, scientists discovered bits of paper and were able to figure out the name of a book kept on board. The 16 fragments, each no bigger than a quarter, were lumped together inside the chamber of one of 27 known cannons aboard the queen anne's revenge, which ran aground off north carolina in 1718 and was discovered by divers in 1996, per a release. A few printed words on seven of the fragments helped with the sleuthing, reports national geographic. After months studying the pieces — one of which reads \" three or \" and \" hilo, to \" — researchers at north carolina's queen anne's revenge conservation lab identified the book from which the paper came. Deciding hilo likely referred to the spanish settlement of ilo in peru, researchers scoured early accounts of voyages mentioning the place until they came across the right one. It was a first edition of edward cooke's a voyage to the south sea, and round the world, which describes a british naval officer's seafaring adventures from 1708 to 1711. Published in 1712, the book would act as inspiration for daniel defoe's 1719 novel robinson crusoe. According to gizmodo, such \" voyage narratives \" also inspired real-life expeditions and might've given blackbeard \" fresh ideas about new places to plunder. \" whatever its purpose, the book was apparently considered dispensable when pages 177, 178, and 183-188 were applied to the cannon, possibly as a seal for its wooden plug.

The discovery was announced thursday during a presentation by conservators from the queen anne's revenge ( qar ) conservation lab at the annual meeting of the society of historical archaeology held in new orleans.

            "Old-timey pirates are typically portrayed as stupid, unrefined thugs whose only interests involved plundering captured ships and forcing enemies to walk the plank. The recent discovery of legible text on paper pulled from the cannon of blackbeard's flagship paints a strikingly different picture of these misunderstood sailors. Work by conservationists from north carolina's department of natural and cultural resources shows that blackbeard and his crew got a kick out of reading \"voyage narratives \" — a popular form of literature in the late 17th and early 18th century that chronicled the true accounts of maritime expeditions. Specifically, blackbeard kept a copy of edward cooke's a voyage to the south sea, and round the world, perform'd in the years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711, detailing the british naval officer's participation in a global expedition aboard the ships duke and dutchess.

Archaeological conservators with the n.c. Department of natural and cultural resources ' qar lab have discovered and conserved a type of artifact that very rarely survives on shipwreck sites – paper.

            "Buccaneers aboard the flagship of notorious 18th-century pirate blackbeard apparently enjoyed a rollicking read, according to an unlikely discovery in a cannon chamber. A handful of paper scraps recovered from the wreck of queen anne's revenge have been identified as fragments of the 1712 book a voyage to the south sea, and round the world, perform'd in the years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711, by captain edward cooke. The discovery was announced thursday during a presentation by conservators from the queen anne's revenge ( qar ) conservation lab at the annual meeting of the society of historical archaeology held in new orleans. Queen anne's revenge went aground outside of what is now beaufort, north carolina, in 1718, and blackbeard was killed while battling british naval forces in the pamlico sound a few months later. The wreck of the pirate's flagship was found by",
            "Old-timey pirates are typically portrayed as stupid, unrefined thugs whose only interests involved plundering captured ships and forcing enemies to walk the plank. The recent discovery of legible text on paper pulled from the cannon of blackbeard's flagship paints a strikingly different picture of these misunderstood sailors. Work by conservationists from north carolina's department of natural and cultural resources shows that blackbeard and his crew got a kick out of reading \"voyage narratives \" — a popular form of literature in the late 17th and early 18th century that chronicled the true accounts of maritime expeditions. Specifically, blackbeard kept a copy of edward cooke's a voyage to the south sea, and round the world, perform'd in the years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711, detailing the british naval officer's participation in a global expedition aboard the ships duke and dutchess. Advertisement the conservators made the discovery",
            "Were 18th-century pirates literate? what sort of books did they keep on board ship? a fascinating new discovery at the queen anne's revenge conservation lab in greenville helps answer those questions. Archaeological conservators with the n.c. Department of natural and cultural resources ' qar lab have discovered and conserved a type of artifact that very rarely survives on shipwreck sites – paper. During conservation work on artifacts recovered from the wreckage of queen anne's revenge, flagship of the pirate blackbeard, 16 tiny fragments of paper were discovered in a mass of wet sludge removed from the chamber for a breech-loading cannon.

Two armed security guards who were transporting the gold from miami to massachusetts say that after they pulled over at mile 114 when the truck had mechanical problems, they were approached by three armed men in a van who tied their hands behind their backs and ordered them to walk into the woods, wral reports. While the transvalue guards were in the woods, the bandits made off with 275 pounds of gold bars, according to the wilson times. Interstate 95 is a busy road, but the heist took place along a lonely, isolated stretch of it surrounded by woods and farms, reports the ap, which notes that it isn't clear how the robbers were able to get the truck open. Transvalue, which is based in miami, says its guards were not injured in the heist and is offering a $ 50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the robbers. The fbi is investigating to determine whether a federal crime occurred, wral reports.

            "Today show jessica barba was suspended after creating a facebook page and video about a fictional 12-year-old, hoping to raise awareness about bullying. A long island high school teen hoped her anti-bullying video would make an impact, and it did — she was suspended. Now school officials say they're lifting the punishment. Jessica barba, 15, wrote, filmed and acted in the video for an assignment on persuasive speech at longwood high school in middle island. The video tells the story of a fictitious character, 12-year-old 'hailey bennett, ' played by jessica, who becomes depressed after she's repeatedly bullied at school and online. It ends with a caption saying the girl committed suicide. There is a disclaimer at the beginning and end of the video explaining the events are not real. The suspension sparked controversey at the school and made national headlines after jessica and her parents claimed it was unfair. School officials said thursday they will wipe the suspension from jessica's record and let her return to school, nbc news reported. A spokeswoman told nbc news the school district cannot comment. Jessica posted the video on youtube may 15. The next day, it was the talk of longwood high. Some students were disturbed by the video and even moved to tears, wnbc/ch. 4 new york reported. She was called into the principal's office expecting to be praised for doing a great job on the project, but instead was suspended for five days. \"i was baffled. I couldn't even describe how i was feeling, \" she told the station. 'i started hysterically crying. I couldn't believe i was getting in trouble for something i had worked so hard on. And the only intent of it was good. \" jessica barba jessica also created a facebook page for the bullied girl, which she said was labeled as fiction. The page is full of hateful messages meant to depict cyber-bullying in the video. On the page the character, 'hailey, ' posted alarming comments like \"i hate myself \" and \"i wanna be dead, \" wnbc/ch. 4 reported. A concerned parent saw the facebook page and not realizing it was fake, called police, jessica's parents told the \"today \" show during an appearance wednesday. The page was taken down by the school. The superintendent of longwood school district released a statement saying"

        "summary": "Thomas van linge has become one of the most respected cartographers around when it comes to tracking global conflicts, including the advances of isis, boko haram, and separatists in ukraine. His highly detailed, color-coded maps have been picked up by cnn, the new york times, and the huffington post, among other media — and the 19-year-old creates them all from his childhood bedroom in amsterdam, reports der spiegel. Yes, 19. And the young activist has never even been to any of the war-torn regions he documents and taught himself arabic on youtube. \" i want to inform people mostly and show people the rebel dynamics in the country, \" he told newsweek in june. \" i also want to inform journalists who want to go to the region which regions are definitely no-go zones, which regions are the most dangerous, and also to show strategic developments through time. \" how did a dutch teen get to become one of the foremost armchair cartographers in the world? he tells newsweek his interest was sparked while watching 2011's arab spring uprising, which spurred him to start following what was going on in syria. He released a map in 2014 of that region on his twitter account, which now boasts more than 15,000 followers who retweet his creations. Each map, which he colors in using microsoft paint, takes van linge a few weeks to finish, using social media, youtube, and any of his 1,000-plus sources on the front lines to gather and corroborate information, he tells the magazine. What's next for van linge? he's contemplating heading to one of the far-off lands he's been mapping out to help the people suffering there in person, spiegel notes.

An italian team analyzed dna from the relic some believe is the burial cloth of jesus but failed to find conclusive proof of its origins, the independent reports. The testing revealed traces of people and pollen from many parts of the world, meaning it that could be a medieval forgery — or that its journey to europe could indeed have begun in jerusalem around 30 or 33ad. The results show that over the centuries, the shroud came in contact with many \" different types of natural and anthropological environments, \" according to the researchers, whose study is published in the journal nature. One find that will surprise skeptics: one of the most common snippets of mitochondrial dna was from the middle east. The type is \" rare in western europe, and it is typical of the druze community, an ethnic group that has some origin in egypt and that lives mainly in restricted areas between syria, jordan, lebanon, israel, and palestine, \" lead researcher gianni barcaccia tells livescience, which notes that other experts consider some of the methods used unreliable. Another find: barcaccia says some of the oldest dna on the cloth was from india, meaning the shroud may have been made there.

        "summary": "Google's fleet of 23 self-driving lexuses has been involved in 11 accidents over the past six years of testing in california — but the company says not one of those incidents was the fault of a google car, the ap reports. Chris urmson, director of google's self-driving initiative, writes in a medium blog post that its vehicles — which have logged 1.7 million miles — had accidents that involved \" light damage, no injuries \"; seven of the cars were rear-ended ( usually at traffic lights ) and most of the accidents took place on city streets, not highways, reuters notes. Urmson also lists other reasons why cars may get into accidents other than not having a driver: tricky intersections and turns, people not paying attention ( he even cites one driver spotted playing the trumpet ). The accidents are being labeled as minor and somewhat typical — urmson notes \" if you spend enough time on the road, accidents will happen whether you're in a car or a self-driving car \" — and advocates for driverless cars say they actually improve safety because the cars are constantly scanning the environment for accident-causing factors and may react more quickly, the washington post notes. A nonprofit watchdog is trying to get both google and the california dmv to release full reports for these accidents and any future incidents, but that doesn't seem to be happening: the dmv is citing confidentiality laws and won't give access, while google ( for now ) is declining comment, per the wall street journal.

The ap reports that clinton now has 1,682 pledged delegates to 1,361 for sanders — but when superdelegates are counted, she has 2,202 delegates on her side, just 181 away from the 2,383 needed to win. Sanders told supporters that he plans to make his case to superdelegates in states that he won, and \" what is most important is that we do not allow someone like a donald trump to become president of the united states. \" ( john kasich's campaign says he is now the best hope of stopping trump. )",

Trump overcame a spirited last stand by cruz — and a patchwork movement of republicans working desperately to derail him in fear that his polarizing politics could doom the party — to gallop to the nomination. Indiana's results positioned him to easily accumulate the 1,237 delegates required to avert a contested convention. Republican national chairman reince priebus declared trump the \"presumptive nominee \" and urged all republicans to unite behind him.

The bodies of a 15-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy were exhumed from a grave site in karachi, and a postmortem examination was conducted wednesday, according to dawn. Authorities say marks on the victims ' arms, chests, and legs indicate they were killed by electrocution. Four people — the fathers and uncles of the victims — have been arrested in connection with the murders. Authorities say the four have confessed to killing the teens and claim they were pressured by tribal elders to do so in order to protect the honor of the tribe. Authorities say the couple, who sought to marry, ran away from home aug. 14 but were informed on by a relative. The news reports the two families tried to settle the matter themselves, with the girl's family agreeing to an offer of two girls for marriage and a cow from the boy's family in exchange for the victims ' marriage. But one tribal elder reportedly quashed the deal, telling the families they must kill their children to prevent such behavior in the future. Police are currently looking for the tribal elder. Authorities say the girl was electrocuted aug. 15 and the boy aug. 16. The bodies were buried in the middle of the night. The family members were arrested aug. 21. Advocacy groups say honor killings are increasing in pakistan with women being the most frequent victims. ( five teens in pakistan were allegedly killed for the crime of clapping and dancing. )",

            "The federal communications commission slapped at&t with a $ 100 million fine wednesday, accusing the country's second-largest cellular carrier of drastically slowing down internet speeds for customers who signed up for \"unlimited \" data plans. The decision marks the fcc's most aggressive step to date to regulate internet providers as chairman tom wheeler follows through with his pledge to ensure that consumers have uninterrupted access to the web. Although the enforcement action targets at&t's cellular business, other broadband providers fear it is a preview of the greater scrutiny the industry will face under a more assertive fcc. At&t's practice affected millions of customers who saw their internet service slow to the equivalent of dial-up speeds for up to 12 days a month, the fcc said. Thousands of at&t customers complained as they struggled to browse the web or watch movies on their smartphones, according to the agency. The fine"

        "summary": "Obamacare's technical difficulties are well-documented — the house is dragging four contractors in to talk about them today — but it has one problem no web developer can solve: it's pretty lousy in rural areas. The theory behind the affordable care act's health insurance marketplace is that forcing insurers to compete will keep prices low. But in many rural areas, that competition simply isn't materializing, the new york times reports. In 21 % of the 2,500 counties serviced by the federal exchanges, consumers have only one carrier to choose from. Among the reasons why new insurers aren't stepping in: \" dominant \" insurers hold tightly to their territory, and \" powerful \" hospital systems fiercely oppose any moves that would trim their rates. Most under-served areas are poor, and many are in the south; there's only one option in almost all of mississippi and alabama. That lack of competition can have a huge effect on prices. A 50-year-old in rural georgia, for instance, would pay twice as much for a silver-level plan as one in atlanta. The cheapest silver plan in wyoming, which has two insurers, costs as much as the most expensive in montana, which has three ( including one new co-op ). \" the affordable care act was designed for … big cities, \" wyoming's insurance commissioner says. \" you've got to have some bargaining chips, and we don't have that much. \"",

While competition is intense in many populous regions, rural areas and small towns have far fewer carriers offering plans in the law's online exchanges. Those places, many of them poor, are being asked to choose from some of the highest-priced plans in the 34 states where the federal government is running the health insurance marketplaces, a review by the new york times has found. Of the roughly 2,500 counties served by the federal exchanges, more than half, or 58 percent, have plans offered by just one or two insurance carriers, according to an analysis by the times of county-level data provided by the department of health and human services. In about 530 counties, only a single insurer is participating. The analysis suggests that the ambitions of the affordable care act to increase competition have unfolded unevenly, at least in the early going, and have not addressed many of the factors that contribute to high prices. Insurance companies are reluctant to enter challenging new markets, experts say, because medical costs are high, dominant insurers are difficult to unseat, and powerful hospital systems resist efforts to lower rates. \"there's nothing in the structure of the affordable care act which really deals with that problem, \" said john holahan, a fellow at the urban institute, who noted that many factors determine costs in a given market. \"i think that all else being equal, premiums will clearly be higher when there's not that competition. \" the obama administration has said 95 percent of americans live in areas where there are at least two insurers in the exchanges. But many experts say two might not be enough to create competition that would help lower prices.

Officials there say in a press release that jan casmir sieski of murrysville, pa., joined a hunt in april near hwange national park, where an american dentist recently coaxed out and killed a famous lion. The new york times finds no jan casmir sieski on record, but spotted a jan casimir seski running a gynecological oncologist practice in pittsburgh. The ap knocked on his door in a wooded area near pittsburgh, and called his practice, but hasn't heard back. Meanwhile, pictures on social media ( now removed ) show the 68-year-old posing with wildlife he apparently killed in africa, including antelope and elephants. The ap says he's specifically accused of illegal lion-hunting. Seski's neighbors describe him as mostly a loner. One says he's \" quirky \" and carries a low-slung handgun \" like a gunslinger, \" but adds that \" i've never seen him done anything illegal or unsportsmanlike at all. \" turns out seski pleaded guilty to allowing $ 973,795 in unapproved, foreign oncology drugs into the us between 2008 and 2011, the daily news reports. According to an official document, he was ordered to pay a $ 100,000 fine. He's also seen as a trailblazer in bloodless surgery. Now zimbabwe officials have arrested the farm owner who allegedly conducted the april hunt, and stopped all hunting of elephants, leopards, and lions outside hwange national park.",

Schlafly — who worked at a munitions factory in world war ii — earned a master's degree in political science and a law degree, unsuccessfully ran for congress three times and founded the eagle forum conservative group while raising six children and presenting herself as a traditional housewife, the new york times reports. When she spoke at gatherings nationwide, schlafly loved to mock what she called \" women's libbers \" by saying: \" i'd like to thank my husband, fred, for letting me be here today. \" historians say the era might have passed if it wasn't for schlafly, who mobilized anti-feminist volunteers across the country and warned that the amendment could lead to gay marriage, women in combat, and unisex restrooms, the los angeles times notes. She remained active in her later years and endorsed donald trump in march this year, saying: \" we've been following the losers for so long, \" but \" now we've got a guy who will lead us to victory. \" after her death, trump issued a statement calling schlafly \" a patriot, a champion for women, and a symbol of strength. \" ( in 2012, she warned men not to date feminists. )",

Wilson, barbara broccoli, and daniel craig today announced that due to creative differences, danny boyle has decided to no longer direct bond 25. \" wilson and broccoli are the film's producers. Variety reports mgm had long wanted boyle to helm a bond flick; he was selected to fill the shoes emptied by sam mendes, who directed 2012's skyfall and spectre, which was out three years later. Variety's sources say eon productions and boyle had been in the process of casting the bond girl and villain for the film, which has been referred to as bond 25. Production was to start in december with an oct. 25, 2019, release date in the uk; wider release was to follow two weeks later. No word on whether those dates will shift. The hollywood reporter's take: \" boyle was seen as a natural choice thanks to his oscar pedigree as the filmmaker behind slumdog millionaire and 127 hours. It was also viewed as a surprise that the filmmaker, who had avoided franchises in the past, would board the bond machine. \"",

A petco store in johnson city, new york was evacuated then beset by flood waters. When employees returned to the store for the first time on friday, they found not only wet floors, but 100 dead animals. From hamsters to birds, little pets perished by either drowning or starving -- the cause of death has yet to be confirmed. The saddest part is that these deaths could have been prevented. Had the manager or store officials been a little extra-cautious, perhaps they would have evacuated the whole store, not just the employees and a \" majority \" of the pets. The ones who weren't cleared out suffered a cruel and unusual fate. Petco's ceo says that the fact that store was new, and had never been through a flood before, was the reason they misjudged the risk of their location.

The country's justice minister and interior minister, abdulhamit gul and suleyman soylu, have been sanctioned over what white house press secretary sarah sanders describes as the \" unfair and unjust detention \" of the north carolina pastor and longtime turkey resident, who was jailed for around two years before being shifted to house arrest last month, the bbc reports. Brunson was charged with espionage and aiding terrorist groups in the 2016 crackdown that followed a failed coup and faces up to 35 years if convicted on all counts. Sanders said that the sanctions on the nato ally came after trump discussed the matter with turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan \" many times. \" turkish officials vowed that the sanctions, which ban american companies and individuals from doing business with the men, would not go unanswered, npr reports. Turkey's ministry of foreign affairs said the move \" disrespectfully intervenes with our judicial system, stands in contrast to the essence of our relations, and will seriously damage the constructive efforts made in order to resolve problems between the two countries. \" the ministry said turkey would deliver \" an equivalent response \" if the us didn't walk back its \" wrong decision. \"",

While there, kalala ordered gang members to have her killed. They abducted her and told her what they had been hired to do; rukundo even heard her husband's voice on speakerphone telling them to kill her, the australian broadcasting company reports. The gang members decided not to murder her because they knew her brother and they didn't believe in killing women, but they kept kalala's money and told him the job was done. She was able to get back home, where, on feb. 22, 2015, she walked up to kalala after her own funeral; he'd told everyone she died while in burundi. \" is it a ghost? \" the scared man, who has since been sentenced to nine years for incitement to murder, per the abc, asked. Rukundo tells the bbc her husband touched her shoulder to make sure she was real, then began screaming. He apologized, but she called police — and, though kalala first denied he'd had anything to do with rukundo's ordeal, she ultimately got him to confess while police secretly recorded one of their phone calls, the age reports. His explanation to her? he thought she was going to leave him for someone else. \" sometimes devil can come into someone, to do something, but after they do it they start thinking, 'why i did that thing?

A 25-car pileup in iowa killed two people, and nearly 100 accidents were reported in the state by late last night. Kansas, wisconsin, and nebraska also suffered deaths, the ap reports. Weather warnings are in effect in 17 states spanning the lower 48, from washington to maine. But the national weather service says the midwest storm should \" finally begin to wind down \" today; it's headed over the great lakes and into canada. Meanwhile, some 1,000 flights have been canceled — actually a lower number than in previous storms, usa today notes. About 600 of those were at chicago's two airports, which could affect travelers elsewhere. Some 20,000 people have lost power in iowa, particularly around des moines, cnn reports. The storm did bring some good news for students at the university of wisconsin at madison, which saw 19 inches of snow: yesterday's final exams were cancelled.",

Dr. John stover does a lot of procedures, everything from cosmetic to plastic surgery in addition to the oral surgery. His medical and dental licenses are in good standing. However we discovered dr. Stover has had four previous complaints with the state since 2010. Two complaints for \" failure to comply with laws governing professional conduct \" were resolved without enough evidence. Two other complaints from 2012 and 2013 are still ongoing. He has also been sued for medical malpractice, however that case was dismissed. Sources say dr. Stover requested the use of full anesthesia for his dental practice in 2005, however that was denied. In 2007 he was granted the permit to use \" intravenous-conscious or moderate-conscious sedation. \" on his medical license he is allowed to use full anesthesia. Since oral surgery, including wisdom teeth extraction, is considered a medical procedure he would be allowed to use full anesthesia if necessary. The section regarding anesthesia on his website says it is in development. Today we spoke with the 17 year old girl who had her wisdom teeth removed by dr. Stover right before kristen tavares. \" i just saw them stick something in my arm and i don't remember what happened after that, \" said the",

In 2014, activist loujain al-hathloul was arrested for purposefully violating saudi arabia's law against women driving, the washington post reports. This weekend, saudis will be able to cast a vote for her. Al-hathloul received international fame when she live-streamed herself behind the wheel. After her arrest, she was forced to wait in her car overnight before being sentenced in a saudi terrorism court, according to the independent. She spent 73 days in jail. Saturday marks the first time women will be able to vote and run for office in saudi arabia, the post reports. Al-hathloul threw her hat into the ring for municipal council, but saudi officials banned her from running. No explanation was given. Those same officials reversed that decision wednesday — again no explanation was given — and al-hathloul will appear on the ballot, the independent reports. According to the post, al-hathloul credits her constant interviews and lobbying for the government's turnaround. \" basically, i annoyed them, \" she says. \" i guess it worked. \" al-hathloul says she was originally running just to boost the number of female candidates — more than 900 of the nearly 7,000 candidates on saturday's ballot are women — but then the government tried to stop her. \" the goal has changed, \" she says. \" i want to make a point. It's a personal thing now. \" while not under the purview of a municipal council member, al-hathloul is still dedicated to repealing saudi arabia's ban on female drivers, the independent reports.",

        "summary": "Wondering what's behind recent outbreaks of measles and whooping cough in the us? perhaps not surprisingly, a new study published in jama finds that people who don't vaccinate — for non-medical reasons — contribute to the problem, reuters reports. Since measles was declared eliminated in the us in 2000, there have been 1,416 cases of the disease reported, and the study finds that more than half of those cases were in people who hadn't been vaccinated for measles. Detailed vaccination data was available for 970 of the measles cases, and 405 of them involved people who skipped vaccinations without a medical reason to do so. Researchers also looked at more than 10,000 cases of whooping cough in patients with known vaccination status and found similar, though somewhat less dramatic, results. In the pertussis cases, when looking at the five biggest statewide epidemics since 1977, 24 % to 45 % of the people affected were completely or partially unvaccinated. And in looking at the pertussis cases for which detailed vaccine data was available, 59 % to 93 % of cases were in people who were intentionally unvaccinated ( as opposed to unvaccinated for medical reasons. ) \"if there are a high number of susceptible or unvaccinated individuals in the community the risk of getting infected — even for vaccinated children — goes up, \" says the study's senior author, because most vaccines are not 100 % effective. Up to 2 % of people who are fully vaccinated for pertussis and 3 % of people who are fully vaccinated for measles are still at risk of getting the disease. Non-medical vaccine exemptions don't fully explain the resurgence of measles and whooping cough ( researchers also found evidence of waning immunity against pertussis, for example ), but another researcher says the study finds that \" individuals who refuse vaccines not only put themselves at risk for disease, \" but others too.",

Mursi invited his allies and rivals to talks at 6 p.m. ( 1600 gmt ) on monday to try to resolve a political crisis and end violence on the streets that erupted during anti-government protests. Five days of unrest has led to 50 deaths. The national salvation front, which rejected a similar call for dialogue last year during another spasm of unrest, saw the islamist leader's call as \" cosmetic",

Here's a roundup of the latest developments: egypt • president mohamed morsi has announced a state of emergency in three cities along egypt's suez canal, following four days of civil unrest that have left at least 40 dead and over 500 injured. Port said, suez, and ismailiya – the cities most affected by the violence – will be subject to a 30-day curfew lasting from 9pm to 6am every night, morsi said in a surprise televised speech. Speaking to the guardian, a spokesman for the opposition expressed frustration at the announcement, blaming the president's policies and inaction for the violence, and",
            "Port said, egypt — the police fired indiscriminately into the streets outside their besieged station, a group of protesters arrived with a crate of gasoline bombs, and others cheered a masked man on a motorcycle who arrived with a kalashnikov. The growing chaos along the vital canal zone showed little sign of abating on monday as president mohamed morsi called out the army to try to regain control of three cities along the suez canal whose growing lawlessness is testing the integrity of the egyptian state. In port said, street battles reached a bloody new peak with a death toll over three days of at least 45, with at least five more protesters killed by bullet wounds,",
            "Police have fired tear-gas at protesters in downtown cairo, just hours after president mohamed morsi declared a state of emegency and a curfew in three suez canal cities. Monday was the fifth consecutive day of street violence in egypt. There were reports that one person was killed; he was not taking part in the protests, but was hit by a stray gunshot. Protests began last week to mark the second anniversary of the revolution that toppled longtime president hosni mubarak; nearly 50 people have been killed so far. The cabinet, meanwhile, approved a draft law which would allow morsi to deploy the army on the streets to \" participate with the police in preserving security"

Scientists got down on their hands and knees and combed 50 houses in the suburbs of raleigh, nc, picking up any bugs they found, to determine the diversity of arthropods indoors. They \" found far more diversity than most people would expect, \" study leader matt bertone tells national geographic. More specifically, they gathered 10,000 bugs from 579 species. If that doesn't freak you out, this probably will: each home housed 100 species on average, per new scientist, though one revealed 211 species. And less than 1 % of rooms were bug-free. \" that old wives'tale that you're never more than 10 feet away from a spider? if you're in your home, that might be true, \" bertone says. Every home contained ants, carpet beetles, cobweb spiders, and gall midges, which \" rely on things we produce or have in our homes, \" says bertone. About 98 % held book lice, which eat mold and mildew, reports wired. There were even some bugs scientists suspect might be new species. Since scientists searched carpets, floorboards, and shelves, but not behind walls, under heavy furniture, or in cabinets, they say more bugs are probably hiding nearby. On the plus side, most were harmless. \" the residents were really surprised and often horrified that we found so much, \" says bertone. But except for the occasional cockroaches, termites, and fleas, the bugs are \" not dangerous and you won't see them unless you really look for them. \" just think of them as \" quiet roommates, \" adds a co-author.

        "summary": "The fda advised back in 2005 that non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or nsaids, could up the risk of heart attack and stroke. But the agency is now boosting that warning, noting that drugs like ibuprofen ( often sold under the motrin ib brand ), naproxen ( aleve ), and celecoxib ( celebrex ) may pose a risk even in small amounts and that these drugs should be used sparingly and for short periods, the new york times reports. ( aspirin, although an nsaid, doesn't pose the same risk, the fda notes. ) although an fda review found that higher doses increased the risk of heart attack or stroke — and the risk may increase with length of use — \" there is no period of use shown to be without risk, \" an fda deputy director says. And while people with cardiovascular disease are more at risk for being adversely affected by nsaids, \" everyone may be at risk — even people without an underlying risk for cardiovascular disease, \" the fda rep says. Nsaids decrease production of prostaglandins, chemicals spewed out after an injury that trigger inflammation, wncn reports. Per the fda review, over-the-counter nsaids could up the risk of heart attack and stroke by about 10 %, low-dose prescription meds by 20 %, and higher-dose prescription nsaids by 50 %, with \" significant variability \" in each estimate, an emory university medical professor tells the times.

        "summary": "Los angeles will have to pay up to $ 30 million to provide gang members with job training, tattoo removal, and more after settling a class-action lawsuit this week, the los angeles times reports. The city was sued in 2011 for enforcing curfews — part of the city's widespread gang injunctions — despite them being declared illegal by a california appeals court in 2007. There are nearly 50 gang injunctions around los angeles prohibiting suspected gang members from carrying weapons, wearing certain clothes, or socializing with certain groups; 21 of those injunctions require suspected gang members to be inside by 10pm. Critics say the curfews are too broadly defined and unfairly labeled young people as gang members without proof or a trial, according to the ap. If the settlement agreement is approved by the court, the city will pay between $ 4.5 million and $ 30 million into a nonprofit it created to help those victimized by curfews. The amount depends on how many of the approximately 5,700 people covered by the curfews come forward. The los angeles city attorney says the nonprofit will allow gang members \" to gain the job skills they need to turn their lives around. \" as part of the agreement, the city will stop enforcing the curfews. \"gang injunctions are a form of psychological abuse on a whole generation of young people of color, \" the ap quotes one man arrested for violating curfew. \"because i was wrongly labeled as a gang member, i couldn't even be outside helping my mom with the groceries at night. \"",

            "Los angeles ( ap ) - the city agreed wednesday to spend up to $ 30 million to settle a lawsuit that challenged widespread injunctions that restrict the movements of thousands of suspected gang members. The city council voted to fund nonprofit organizations to provide job training, counseling, tattoo removal and other services that aim to help people leave the gang life. The city would pay at least $ 4.5 million but no more than $ 30 million over four years. The proposal \"creates an innovative pathway for individuals served with gang injunctions to gain the job skills they need to turn their lives around, \" city attorney mike feuer said in a statement. If a court approves the settlement, the city also will stop enforcing curfew restrictions that a federal court ruled were unconstitutional and provide an expedited way for people named in injunctions to be removed from the list. \"unconstitutional gang injunction curfews forced several thousand black and brown residents of los angeles indoors on a nightly basis, \" olu k.

Since being pioneered in los angeles in the 1980s, the use of the injunctions has proliferated across the nation and even overseas. Vast swaths of southern california have been subject to such injunctions.

The agreement resolved what the pay level should be for low-skilled immigrants — often employed at hotels and restaurants or on construction projects — who could be brought in during labor shortages. Labor groups wanted to ensure that guest workers would not be paid less than the median wage in their respective industries, and the two sides compromised by agreeing that guest workers would be paid the higher of the prevailing industry wage as determined by the labor department or the actual employer wage. Photo under the deal, guest workers would be allowed to pursue a path to citizenship and to change jobs after they arrived in the united states. Another sticking point, involving the specific type of jobs that would be included in the guest worker program, was also resolved"

In an effort to reseed 74,000 acres of the amazon — 20 % of which has been destroyed in the last 40 years — conservation international, the world bank, brazil's environmental ministry, and several other groups are working together to spread seeds in the amazonas, acre, pará, rondonia, and xingu areas of brazil, reports fast company. Reforestation normally involves saplings, which must be grown and planted. But conservation international ceo m. Sanjayan hopes dropping seeds from 200 native species per square meter of land, in what is known as the muvuca strategy, will \" drive the costs down dramatically \" and produce a greater diversity and density of plants. \" if you're really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of [ the ] atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most, \" says sanjayan, noting the move will help brazil reach its paris accord target of reforesting an area the size of pennsylvania by 2030, per smithsonian. A release notes it's the \" largest tropical forest restoration in the world. \" up to 2,000 locals will work together to seed each hectare, with families receiving $ 700 per hectare. Additional seeds will also be distributed in existing forested areas. Some 90 % of seeds are expected to germinate, though only the strongest will survive. A leader of the program predicts there will be 2,500 trees per hectare after six years and up to 5,000 after 10 years. ( deforestation has revealed millennia-old \" geoglyphs \" in brazil. )",

But now there's a new problem in the mix: a possible famine, created by what ertharin cousin, the executive director of the un's world food programme, calls a \" perfect storm \" of \" lack of staple food, access to clean water, and a diminished fuel supply. \" in a press release, wfp estimates there are nearly 13 million of what it calls \" food insecure \" people in the war-torn country, with almost half in especially dire straits. That includes 1.2 million kids who suffer from \" moderate \" malnourishment and half a million who are severely affected. \" the damage to yemen's next generation may become irreversible if we don't reach children quickly with the right food at the right time, \" cousin says. \" we must act now before it is too late. \" cousin saw the crisis firsthand during a recent three-day trip around the country, where she met with displaced families, moms and malnourished kids in hospitals, and people gathered at food-distribution centers. The un's humanitarian chief also recently returned from yemen and told the un security council yesterday that \" the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible, \" per the bbc. Semantics means the wfp can't call the situation a full-fledged famine just yet: per the un, a food crisis is only considered as such if one-fifth of households have limited ability to deal with \" extreme \" food shortages; acute malnutrition rates surpass 30 %; and the daily death rate is more than two per every 10,000 people. Continued conflict in yemeni ports has exacerbated the problem, the bbc notes, with a wfp ship hammered by airstrikes tuesday night in hodeida.

The white house yesterday announced that it would push for legislation giving the usps a three-month reprieve on the $ 5.5 billion it's supposed to pay on sept. 30 for future retiree health benefits, saving it at least temporarily from a humiliating default. Even that won't save the service for long, however — the postmaster general recently testified that, even with the reprieve, they'd run out of money by next july or august. So obama will also unveil a longer-term plan to save the post office as part of his deficit reduction plan, the hill reports. He has not yet, however, supported the service's call to be refunded $ 50 billion it says it has overpaid into a federal pension plan. The administration says it's still reviewing that proposal.",

        "summary": "If you dye your hair and plan on committing a crime, be warned: a new procedure allows scientists to determine if a single microscopic hair has been dyed, if that dye was permanent or temporary, and even what brand of dye was used. Scientists used surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy, or sers, to gauge how light reflects off a hair. Essentially, molecules on the hair's surface begin to vibrate and \" change the energy of the reflected photons, \" science reports. In other words, the light reads differently depending on the dye on a sample. Not only does the technique register hair dye, scientists say it also finds small amounts of body fluids like blood, drugs, explosives, and gunshot residue, according to a study in analytical chemistry. Why all the fuss if scientists can perform dna testing? for one thing, an intact bulb or root must be present in the hair sample in order for it to be analyzed for dna, a press release notes. For another, dna testing can be a lengthy process and the cases quickly pile up. In many cases, scientists resort to comparing a sample hair with that of a suspect under a microscope, a method that can prove both impractical and inconclusive. The sers method is quick, easy, doesn't damage the sample, \" and can be performed directly at the crime scene \" using a portable raman spectrometer, the study authors write. Another bonus: sers ' gentle approach means a key piece of hair can still be examined for dna afterward. ( pubic hairs could help identify criminals, too. )",

Usually, hairs left behind at a crime scene are associated with dna testing, but such a procedure requires whole, intact hairs and is often time-consuming. Because of these constraints, forensic analyses sometimes simply compare the appearance of the hair under the microscope, but these comparisons are subjective in nature and frequently inconclusive. However, new research, published online in analytical chemistry, might eventually provide police with a dna-free method for objectively linking a hair to a crime. The technique uses surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers ) to precisely measure how light from a laser bounces off a hair. Vibrations within the molecules on the hair's surface change the energy of the reflected photons and are caught by a detector. If the sample has a dye on it ( or blood, drugs, ink, explosives, etc. ) the laser will reflect differently, and each dye creates a unique pattern. The technique is so precise that scientists are able to identify distinct brands of dye and determine whether the dye was temporary or permanent — even when sampling a microscopic piece of hair",

According to the information and intercept, google has presented to chinese officials two mobile apps — one for internet searches, one focusing on news aggregation — that would block content blacklisted by the government. It's a savvy business move in a lucrative market of over 750 million users, dominated by search engine baidu. Yet it recalls google's 2010 exit from china over the same government censorship its latest efforts would reportedly support. Co-founder sergey brin specifically cited totalitarian governments when pulling the chinese service, though the company had said in 2006 that \" removing search results \" was better than \" providing no information, \" per cnn. Google, which already has translation and file management apps available in china, had notified chinese users that their search results were being censored. It's unclear if the apps now in development would do the same, as google refused to comment \" on speculation about future plans. \" ( the state-owned china securities daily denies the report, per the guardian. ) but \" in putting profits before human rights, google would be setting a chilling precedent \" with what amnesty international sees as \" a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom, \" reports the guardian. \" we don't need a second baidu, \" a chinese data researcher adds, per the new york times, which adds that google's own employees have quit or refused to work on the apps, which they apparently think flouts the company's own motto: \" do the right thing. \"",

If that seems harsh, consider that bobby gene martin, 64, racked up 10 dwi charges between 1981 and 2014, reports the montgomery county police reporter. In the latest incident, martin crashed his mom's pickup truck on aug. 2, then reportedly asked a wrecker driver for a ride home so he wouldn't get \" another dwi. \" the driver refused, and responding officers found martin in water up to his waist in a nearby drainage ditch, the courier reports. His blood alcohol level was 0.217. Martin then threatened to \" kill not only the deputy that arrested him, but also his wife, his children, his mom, \" montgomery county assistant district attorney kyle crowl said. Once at the local jail, martin kept up the death threats, hurling them, along with racial slurs, at the jailer, per crowl. The jury took one hour to convict martin and spent three hours deliberating his sentence after learning of his earlier crimes. As a habitual offender, he faced 25 years to life. After notching his eighth drunk-driving conviction in 1999, martin was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the houston chronicle reports. After being released, he was jailed once again for a year after a 2009 dwi arrest. \" it is amazing he hasn't killed anyone yet, \" said crowl, who painted this metaphor for the jury: the latest charges were the \" icing on a cake that [ martin ] had been baking his whole life. \" martin's life sentences will be served concurrently; he ' ll be eligible for parole at age 80.

Defense secretary that the taliban were killing afghan civilians \" in service to america. \" the remarks, in a televised speech hours before mr. Karzai's meeting with u.s. Defense secretary chuck hagel, capped a series of confrontations between the afghan president and the u.s. Over his demands to assert afghan sovereignty and curtail american military operations. Mr. Karzai met mr. Hagel a day after suspected taliban suicide bombers killed at least 18 people at the ministry of defense in kabul and in the eastern province of khost. In his address, mr. Karzai said the u.s. Doesn't want to leave the country after the nato coalition's mandate expires at the end of 2014 because it covets afghan resources and is talking with taliban leaders behind his back. \" taliban are every day in talks with america, but in kabul and khost they set off bombs to show strength to america, \" mr. Karzai said. \" the bombs that went off in kabul and khost yesterday were not a show of power to america, but were in service to america … it was in the service of foreigners not withdrawing from afghanistan. \" u.s.

Taiwan's ministry of defense said friday it is \" sincerely grateful \" for the deal, \" which will boost our combat capabilities in air and sea. \" but china is far less pleased. More: it's about protection: a us official tells cnn the deal shows \" our support for taiwan's ability to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability \" — something the us is required to do under the taiwan relations act signed in 1979. It's not unusual: the south china morning post notes every us president since jimmy carter has oked arms sales to taiwan. Former president obama approved a $ 1.8 billion sale in 2015. Timing: this deal, however, comes at a \" delicate time \" in us-china relations, with tensions already high over north korea, reports the ap. One china: a state department rep says the us remains committed to its \" one-china \" policy, meaning it will not carry on an official relationship with taiwan and does not consider it to be its own country. China views taiwan as part of its territory. But china is peeved: the chinese embassy in washington calls the deal a \" wrong move \" that \" grossly interferes \" in china's domestic affairs, per the morning post, adding china \" reserves every right to take further action. \" what about mar-a-lago? china's ambassador to washington adds the deal has \" damaged the basis and mutual trust between the two countries \" and \" contradicts the spirit and consensus \" of trump's meeting with chinese president xi jinping at mar-a-lago in april, reports cnn. There's more: a rep for china's foreign ministry says the country is also \" strongly concerned about and firmly opposed to \" a new bill allowing us naval vessels to make routine stops at ports in taiwan.

Jaxa launched its kounotori 6 spacecraft on friday with tons of supplies bound for the international space station, where it's expected to arrive on wednesday, reports npr. Also on board is a 2,300-feet electrodynamic tether, or edt, made of aluminum and steel, in the works for more than a decade. Jaxa says it will use an electric current and earth's magnetic field to slow down debris and shove it out of orbit and toward earth's atmosphere, where it will burn up. The edt and the kounotori, which will also carry waste from the iss, will then meet the same fate. It's unclear how many pieces of space junk might be destroyed using the edt, but this is mostly a test. If all goes well, jaxa plans to create a second tether up to six miles in length, reports bloomberg. The bbc notes this is one of a few efforts underway to tackle space junk, which poses hazards for astronauts and their equipment. In may, for example, a tiny piece of space junk — possibly a speck of paint — chipped a window in the iss ' cupola observatory, reports christian science monitor. As the iss wouldn't stand a chance against some debris as large as a bus, it has to be moved to avoid an impact, says project chief koichi inoue.

        "summary": "Looks like donald trump did not sleep well friday night: he spent saturday morning firing off a series of tweets claiming that the election is rigged, which the ap calls an \" unprecedented assertion in a country with a history of peaceful democratic transition. \" \" hillary clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail, \" he said in one tweet. \" instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election. \" in another, he slammed the media for \" poisoning the minds \" of american voters with what he calls \" 100 % fabricated and made-up charges \" of sexual misconduct. A round-up of coverage: the washington post reports that trump physically dismantled one teleprompter and knocked another one down after they stopped working during a speech in charlotte, nc friday night. He told the audience he preferred it without teleprompters and went on to hopscotch through dozens of topics in front of an enthusiastic crowd. At an earlier rally in greensboro, he denounced two of the women who have accused him of sexual misbehavior, saying one of them \" would not be my first choice. \" mashable reports that trump has threatened to sue the new york times over its story on two of the accusers, and such a suit could be a bonanza for the nyt. Trump would be the subject of a deposition and the paper's lawyers would be allowed to probe the histories of family members and other trump associates, opening what \" columbia school of journalism professor stuart karle calls a \" rich vein of yuck about donald trump. \" clinton's campaign has also hit out the media, accusing it of failing to treat leaked campaign emails as a national security issue, the hill reports. On friday, the campaign also slammed wikileaks, the russian government, and trump, who they accuse of encouraging the hackers. Reuters reports that trump rallies have become more emotional than ever, with the crowds \" more protective of their hero. \" at the greensboro rally, a man in a \" gays for trump \" shirt punched a protester who was holding an american flag upside down. The burlington free press speaks to ski maker cyrus schenck, who has introduced limited edition skis with trump on the right and clinton is on the left.

        "summary": "Keeping your drunkenness a secret from your uber driver might be impossible in a future world, no matter how much silence emanates from the backseat. A patent application shows that uber may be interested in trying to figure out whether potential passengers are drunk by analyzing everything from typos in the ride request to whether the phone was swaying, reports the guardian. While it's only theoretical at this point, the idea is that certain behavior would trigger a reaction from uber if it differs from behavior during past ride requests, reports the washington post. For example, a specially trained driver might arrive to transport a drunk passenger and make sure the person is dropped off in a safe spot. The app might also keep a drunk passenger from pooling with other riders. All this \" sounds helpful, \" but \" poses questions about the potential for data like this to be abused, \" writes arwa mahdawi in the guardian. Would drunk passengers have to pay more than others? and given that many of the abuse allegations lodged against uber drivers have come from passengers who were drunk at the time, the system could theoretically put people at risk. Experts also fear the technology could single out people with disabilities or keep users from hailing a ride when drunk or high, per the post. But though the patent was filed in december 2016, there's no plan to put the idea into practice yet. \" we are always exploring ways that our technology can help improve the uber experience \" and \" file patent applications on many ideas, but not all of them actually become products or features, \" uber says, per the bbc.",

The university, which had granted brochu a $ 20,000-a-year scholarship, says her behavior was \" reprehensible \" and she will not be returning. Brochu told police she lashed out because of a \" hostile environment \" caused by rowe's \" rude behavior. \" in a video posted on facebook monday, rowe said she requested a room change after being ignored and ostracized by brochu. Rowe, who blamed health problems early in the school year on the contamination of her belongings, said brochu made the instagram post as she was moving out on oct. 17.

            "The ' berlin patient ' is an hiv-positive man who developed acute myeloid leukaemia, received successful treatment and subsequently experienced a relapse in 2007 that required a transplant of stem cells. Doctors chose stem cells from an individual who had an unusual genetic profile: a mutation inherited from both parents that resulted in cd4 cells that lacked the ccr5 receptor. This mutation, called ccr5 delta 32 homozygosity, is present in less than 1 % of caucasians in northern and western europe, and is associated with a reduced risk of becoming infected with hiv. This is because all new infecting viruses need to use the ccr5 receptor on cd4 cells when infecting an immune system cell of the cd4 type. Later in the course of hiv infection another type of virus emerges that can use the cxcr4 receptor instead. Before the stem cell transplant the patient received chemotherapy treatment that destroyed most immune cells and total body irradiation, and also received immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection of the stem cells. Antiretroviral therapy was halted on the day of the transplant, and the patient had to receive a second stem cell transplant 13 days after the first one, due to a further relapse of leukaemia. The patient continued to receive immunosuppressive treatment to prevent rejection for 38 months, and at 5, 24 and 29 months post-transplant colon biopsies were taken to investigate possible graft-versus-host disease in the intestine. At each investigation additional samples were taken to check for signs of hiv infection in the abundant immune cells of the gut wall",
            "On the heels of world aids day comes a stunning medical breakthrough: doctors believe an hiv-positive man who underwent a stem cell transplant has been cured as a result of the procedure. Timothy ray brown, also known as the \" berlin patient, \" received the transplant in 2007 as part of a lengthy treatment course for leukemia.

Recent studies show that healthy individuals who take antiretrovirals, medicine commonly prescribed for treating hiv, can reduce their risk of contracting the disease by up to 73 percent. While these developments by no means prove a cure for the virus has been found, they can certainly provide hope for the more than 33 million people living with hiv worldwide. Alongside such findings, global efforts to combat the epidemic have accelerated as of late, with new initiatives emerging in the philippines and south africa this week."

        "summary": "Former harrisburg mayor steve reed was a man with a bold vision: building one of the country's finest wild west museums in pennsylvania. But while the democrat spent years searching the west for artifacts and brought about 10,000 of them back, the museum never got built and he now faces trial on more than 100 counts relating to what prosecutors say was his obsession, the ap reports. Reed, who was mayor for 28 years before losing a primary election in 2009, has been charged with 112 counts of receiving stolen property, as well as one count of evidence tampering and one count of dealing in the proceeds of unlawful activities. Hundreds of other charges, including theft, were thrown out last year because of the statute of limitations. Prosecutors say reed, who successfully created the city's civil war museum, used millions of dollars from the financially strapped city's bond issues to pay for artifacts like stagecoach equipment, doc holliday's dental chair, antique newspapers and guns, as well as a lot of forgeries, reuters reports. He was known among dealers in the west for always paying top dollar and for sending an armed city cop to collect his many purchases, pennlive reported after he was charged in 2015. The city recovered about $ 4.4 million from selling thousands of the relics reed bought, but some 1,800 other old west artifacts were seized from his home and a warehouse he owns. The 67-year-old reed's lawyers say he can prove he is the rightful owner of the seized items — and he wants them back.",

Yesterday, some of that guilt was alleviated when a texas judge removed the criminally negligent homicide conviction from her record after determining her saturn ion was one of millions of gm vehicles recalled earlier this year for an ignition switch issue, the ap reports. \" the crash involving ms. Anderson is one in which the recall condition may have caused or contributed to the air bag nondeployment in the accident, \" a gm lawyer wrote in a letter released yesterday in van zandt county court. Anderson's lawyer blasted the company: \" gm knew this defect caused this death, yet, instead of telling the truth, watched silently as candice was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, \" he tells the detroit news. \" this has not been an easy road, \" anderson says in a statement cited by the news. Her parents had to empty retirement accounts to pay for her attorney, and she was forced to pony up at least $ 10,000 more in fines and restitution — she avoided jail time through a plea deal and served five years ' probation, the new york times reports. She was \" denied positions at numerous jobs \" due to her record, she tells the news. And she sustained serious injuries herself, though she says most of the toll has been from the guilt she's felt since that day: until the gm problems were revealed, she anguished over what part she played in her fiance's death, the times notes. She tells the paper that the ruling will finally enable her to tell her two young daughters, \" this is what happened, this horrible thing. And it wasn't mommy's fault. \" ( recently uncovered gm emails don't help the company's case. )",

An estimated 3 million jewish people living in poland are believed to have been murdered by the nazis prior to world war ii. The markings were reportedly written in marker on both the gate and a bulletin board and included both swastikas and anti-polish profanities. Police released photos of the vandalism and said they will be investigating the incident. Meanwhile, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu swiftly condemned morawiecki's remarks after the polish leader made them in response to an israeli reporter's question regarding a new law in poland that seeks to punish with jail time anyone who says the country was \" responsible or complicit in the nazi crimes committed by the third german reich. \" \"the polish prime minister's remarks here in munich are outrageous, \" said netanyahu after morawiecki referenced \" jewish perpetrators \" in his statement in the german city on saturday, the times of israel reports. It is morawiecki's stance that poland was a victim of nazi occupation and that most polish people attempted to help their friends and neighbors as millions of jews from across europe were sent to death camps.

He and two other lg executives have been indicted over the incident, an lg spokesperson tells the wall street journal. Before a trade show in germany last september, samsung said lg execs had broken the doors of four of its washing machines at berlin shopping centers. Lg said jo, the head of its home appliance division, and other execs were indeed surveying the competition, but insisted any broken samsung doors were caused only by subpar hinges. Even so, lg paid for the damaged appliances, but samsung filed a lawsuit anyway. Lg countersued for defamation and evidence tampering, and then south korean prosecutors got involved. In december, prosecutors raided lg offices and temporarily banned jo from traveling outside the country. Mediation attempts were unsuccessful, and jo has now been charged with not just the allegedly deliberate damage but with defamation and obstruction of business, the lg rep says. In response to the indictment, lg has released footage of jo performing what it calls \" standard product tests \" on the samsung machines as samsung promoters were in the room, cnet reports; the footage also shows other consumers handling the doors in a less than gentle fashion. But samsung says the footage has been \" arbitrarily edited. \" says jo's lawyer: \" it is questionable whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that the president of a global company deliberately destroyed the machines where employees of the competing company were present. The truth will be revealed in the courts. \"",
