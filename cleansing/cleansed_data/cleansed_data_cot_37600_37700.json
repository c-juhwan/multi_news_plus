Hence why star athlete harumafuji of mongolia, one of only four active wrestlers to have achieved sumo's highest rank of grand champion, has thrown the sport into disarray after allegedly assaulting a fellow wrestler at a party late last month, reports the telegraph. The 33-year-old had been drinking with fellow wrestlers in tottori, japan, when he reportedly began criticizing 27-year-old takanoiwa's \" poor attitude \" and hit him over the head with a beer bottle \" as punishment, \" kyoto news reports, per the guardian. The assault allegedly didn't end there. Apparently angered that his former opponent had tried to take a phone call during harumafuji's criticism, the 300-pound wrestler is said to have unleashed 20 to 30 punches on takanoiwa, who was hospitalized with a skull fracture, concussion, and spinal damage. Harumafuji — whose trainer admitted to harumafuji's involvement, per the japan times — has apologized as a police investigation is underway. He also withdrew from a major tournament, but many believe his career is over. The scandal is just the latest to expose violence behind the scenes of sumo. In one of the more extreme cases, a trainer was jailed following the beating death of a wrestler in 2007.",

In an event organized down the street from where 18-year-old brown was shot dead by ferguson police officer darren wilson, lezley mcspadden told a crowd friday she's running to become a member of the ferguson, mo. City council. \" almost four years ago to this day, i ran down this very street, and my son was covered in a sheet, \" mcspadden said, per nbc news. \" i learned to walk again, and this is one of my first steps. \" as ksdk notes, mcspadden's announcement comes at a conspicuous time in the history of a case that helped spark widespread demonstrations against the deaths of black americans at the hands of police. Just days earlier, the prosecutor who decided not to file charges against wilson, sparking outrage, lost his re-election bid after 27 years in office. Bob mcculloch was beaten by criminal justice reform advocate and former judge wesley bell. It was mcculloch's first election since brown's death. Bell is running unopposed in november and some are already calling on him to reopen the case against wilson. As mcspadden did at friday's announcement, bell said following his major win that he hopes positive change can come from the community's anger. \"out of tragedy, comes opportunity, \" he told the st. Louis post-dispatch.",

By daniel arkin the mother of michael brown, the unarmed teenager who was fatally shot by a police officer in ferguson, missouri, four years ago, said friday that she is running for city council in the st. Louis suburb. Lezley mcspadden announced her candidacy along canfield drive, near the exact spot where her son, who was black, was shot and killed on aug. 9, 2014, by a white police officer. \" almost four years ago to this day, i ran down this very street, and my son was covered in a sheet, \" mcspadden said, fighting back tears. \" i learned to walk again, and this is one of my first steps. \" mcspadden said she plans to focus on three issues: community policing, economic equality and access to health care for ferguson's young children. She said she anticipated that some people might ask why she was qualified to seek elected office. In response, she said: \" if a mother had to watch her son lay on the street for four hours, and watch our community be completely disrespected by the people we elected, what would you do? \" you would stand up and you would fight, too. \" she was joined on friday by friends and family, as well as benjamin crump, the prominent civil rights attorney who represents the brown family. He led chants of \" run, lezley, run! \" crump said mcspadden's political bid was a way to \" transform the pain to power. \" mcspadden is also calling on missouri gov. Mike parson to reopen the investigation into brown's killing. More than 15,000 people have signed an online petition as of this writing. The announcement comes just three days after bob mcculloch, the seven-term prosecuting attorney in st. Louis county who handled the brown investigation, lost a primary challenge to a black ferguson councilman. Wesley bell, an attorney and former municipal judge and prosecutor, defeated mcculloch in the democratic primary. Bell is all but certain to win in november as no republicans were on the ballot. Brown's death sparked protests and clashes with police in ferguson. It also intensified a national debate on race and policing."

The maori base their case on a treaty in which the government gave them the rights to \" taonga \" — loosely defined as treasure.

The bad news: you ' ll feel more pain in the meantime, according to a new study published in evolutionary behavioral sciences. Researchers asked 5,705 people in 96 countries to rate the emotional and physical pain of a breakup on a scale of one ( what pain? ) to 10 ( agonizing pain ) via an online survey. Women reported greater pain emotionally — a 6.84 compared to 6.58 in men — and physically — a 4.21 versus 3.75 in men. The differences may seem small, but they're statistically significant, reports fusion. And there's an evolutionary explanation: \" women are evolved to invest far more in a relationship than a man \" since it could result in pregnancy, says lead author craig morris in a press release. They're \" choosier about selecting a high-quality mate \" so a loss hurts more. Men may feel the breakup less at first, but morris says \" the man will likely feel the loss deeply, \" perhaps for months or years, \" as it'sinks in'that he must'start competing ' all over again to replace what he has lost — or worse still, come to the realization that the loss is irreplaceable. \" here, women have the advantage. When they realize it's time to move on, they \" recover faster and more fully, \" morris says, per the courier mail. And recover we all must, according to morris, a professor at binghamton university in new york: he says the average person goes through three breakups before he or she hits 30, at least one of which is painful enough that it lowers his or her quality of life for weeks or months. The study authors note that lack of communication \" was the most prevalent breakup cause \" and that women were more likely to initiate the breakup. ( it turns out you can die of a broken heart. )",

So when whole foods displayed a french cheese map with glaring inaccuracies, an online melee ensued, reports eater. It all started when french expat mikaël, who lives in dc, on monday posted a picture on twitter of the map at a whole foods store he shopped at while in detroit, with the global refrain, \" omg!!! \" he says he first thought it was simply a local snafu, but when he returned home to dc, the same poster was on display. It was so off people replied in droves, and a certain philippe-arnaud tweeted a picture of plastic-wrapped slices of american cheese overlaid on a us map, captioned, \" how we see the map of american ' cheeses '. \" to the dismay of many who weighed in, camembert was identified as hailing from montpellier in the south instead of normandy in the north; the sheep's milk cheese ossau-iraty from the central pays de la loire instead of basque country in the southwest; and fourme d ' ambert terre des volcans, a storied blue cheese, from the southeast instead of central auvergne, reports the telegraph. But while these and other inaccuracies caused a stink, the french foreign ministry attempted to restore order with its own tweet: \" the geography may be a bit off, but it's great to see that @wholefoods carries ( and enjoys! ) french cheeses! \" the chain has since apologized and removed the posters.

More: while \" the movie ultimately gets a little big for its breeches, in a mayhem-and-effects-soaked climax that suffers from many of the excesses of other marvel movies, \" most of spider-man: homecoming maintains \" a jokey, self-aware tone that is nicely evocative of the original comics, \" michael o'sullivan writes at the washington post. It's an \" authentic, refreshingly nerdy and high-spirited reboot \" — \" it's diary of a wimpy kid meets the dark knight. \" it's certainly more of a high school comedy than your typical superhero movie, but that's a-ok with peter travers at rolling stone. \" there's a spontaneous charge to the film, a euphoric innocence, that makes it a much-needed antidote to stale franchise formula, \" he writes. Plus \" tom holland is the best movie spider-man ever, \" making \" you finally feel that your friendly neighborhood web-slinger deserves to be a part of the marvel cinematic universe. \" \" tobey maguire was pretty good, andrew garfield was so-so, \" and holland easily bests both, writes soren andersen at the seattle times.

News of the obama-woods golf round was first reported by golf world's tim rosaforte, who tweeted about the game from the pro shop of the floridian, the exclusive palm city golf resort where the president spent the holiday weekend.

Trade representative ron kirk and houston astros owner jim crane. White house reporters, who have been denied access to the president during his trip to florida, revolted after learning of woods'surprise appearance, and demanded that they be taken to the floridian to scoop out the game. Per the white house pool report: we got confirmation at 1: 45 pm that potus had been hitting the links with tiger woods inside the \"floridian \" golf compound, 20 minutes away from the pool hotel. Your pool has been aware since this morning that a reporter, tim rosaforte, had been tweeting and talking on the golf channel about the potus/woods game from inside the compound. Still officially under a lid, we decided to assemble and at 2: 10 pm we logged a request to the white house for access to the president's game for a photo-op, like this administration and previous ones have granted in the past.

A new petition prompted the apology. Election time: \" i know the things i said a few days ago hurt some of israel's citizens and hurt israel's arabs. I had no intention to do that. I apologize for it. \" — benjamin netanyahu, for an election-eve warning that arabs were voting \" in droves. \" frat chant: \" let me start by saying that i am sorry, deeply sorry. I am so sorry for the pain i have caused, and i want all of you to know that directly from me.... There are no excuses for my behavior. \" — levi pettit, one of two oklahoma students expelled over a racist chant. On further review: \" a mother's job is not easy and neither is a police officer's. Sometimes as humans we overreact without gathering all of the facts. As a mother in this case i overreacted and for that i apologize. Thank you to that officer for being kind to my son. \" — empire actress taraji p. Henson, after initially accusing police who stopped her son's car of racial profiling.

That was a mistake, and i apologize for that. I apologize for past actions and am going to fix it going forward. \" — brad r.

Pierangelo massetti, the monk who led the manuscripts'restoration, tells the times. The restoration was an arduous task, with at least five others joining massetti in using a soft paint brush to clean the manuscripts one page at a time challenges included reconstructing missing parts like the spines, figuring out how to revitalize the faded ink, and fixing the original covers ( at least one was made of wood covered in goat leather ).pope francis chose his name from the patron saint of the poor, and while restorers admit the saint's signature is nowhere to be found in the ancient documents ( they believe he dictated most of his writings ), they contend his spirit is infused throughout them. While other institutions as far away as russia and argentina are eagerly vying to be the next to host the manuscripts, italian friars at the sacred convent of st.

Far from being excited or apologetic because he'd been gone, pietro was furious because she'd had his new son baptized giovanni after john the baptist. The last thing pietro wanted in his son was a man of god -- he wanted a man of business, a cloth merchant like he was, and he especially wanted a son who would reflect his infatuation with france. So he renamed his son francesco -- which is the equivalent of calling him frenchman. Francis enjoyed a very rich easy life growing up because of his father's wealth and the permissiveness of the times. From the beginning everyone -- and i mean everyone -- loved francis. He was constantly happy, charming, and a born leader. If he was picky, people excused him. If he was ill, people took care of him. If he was so much of a dreamer he did poorly in school, no one minded. In many ways he was too easy to like for his own good. No one tried to control him or teach him.

        "summary": "Hoping to avoid brain shrinkage, cognitive impairment, and dementia? gobble up lots of fish, veggies, and nuts. A new study shows those who follow the increasingly well-regarded mediterranean diet have less brain atrophy than those who don't. Researchers scanned the brains of 674 manhattan residents over 80 who showed no signs of dementia, and analyzed their diets based on a questionnaire, reports the guardian. The patients who kept to a mediterranean diet had a brain volume that was 13.11 milliliters larger than others, their gray matter volume was 5 milliliters larger, and their white brain matter was 6.41 milliliters larger. Since people's brains shrink with age, researchers say the difference in brain volume is equal to about five years of aging. This doesn't mean the mediterranean diet slows brain aging, but it does show an association. And with greater brain volume comes more brain cells. \" the more brain cells you have available, the more likely you are to be protected against illnesses of the brain related to aging, like alzheimer's, \" a doctor tells cbs news, adding omega-3 fatty acids found in fish may benefit nerve cells, while b vitamins in fruits and veggies may prevent the buildup of plaque in the brain. \" these results are exciting, as they raise the possibility that people may potentially prevent brain shrinking and the effects of aging on the brain simply by following a healthy diet, \" lead author yian gu says. One aspect of the diet stood out, though. \" eating at least three to five ounces of fish weekly or eating no more than 3.5 ounces of meat daily may provide considerable protection against loss of brain cells equal to about three to four years of aging, \" gu adds.

People were incensed, and in the new york times, david carr examines why that is. The picture of han desperately trying to get out of the path of an oncoming subway train symbolizes many deep-seated feelings: our inherent suspicion of the media; our fear that no one will come to our aid when the worst happens; our terror over the idea that public spaces have increasingly become fraught with danger; our fear of death itself. Carr thinks the post \" milked the death of someone for maximum commercial effect. \" but in the new republic, tom mcgeveran writes that, sure, the cover was tasteless — but that's exactly the point. The post is a tabloid, and it knows what will sell papers. \" it's fine to hate the conversations the post chooses to foster and insert itself into, but it's a tougher thing to tell it, or any newspaper, that it ought to be better than the people who read it, \" mcgeveran writes.

A new reuters/ipsos tracking poll today has president obama leading by 1 point — essentially a statistical tie — while investors business daily's poll has obama up by 2.3 points. But in gallup's daily poll, romney gained ground, extending his lead from 3 points to 4. All of which mainly squares up with yesterday's numbers, which saw obama rise in three polls, and romney rise in three others, fivethirtyeight guru nate silver observes. But the election is actually determined by the electoral college, and obama has the edge there, leading in nine battleground state polls released yesterday. The only bright spots for romney were two polls showing him up by 2 in virginia — but another had obama up 5 there. Ohio remains the most important state, and silver gives obama a 75 % chance of winning it — which \" is, not coincidentally, close to mr.

Moore and kathleen glynn, his wife of 23 years, have tens of millions in assets to divvy up, including a luxury mansion and eight other properties in new york and michigan. Moore even wants glynn — a quilter with a quilting facebook page — to list all of her quilts ( with photographs ) and say whether she ever had him followed by a private investigator, the new york post reports. The smoking gun goes over the 300 items on moore's trial exhibit, including six news articles about the michigan mansion that he claims glynn turned into a money pit ( one story dubbed it \" moore's $ 2m hypocrite house \" ). Moore claims she mishandled spending ( \" which caused us some serious financial losses \" ), forcing him to sign the checks from then on. Glynn, 56, has produced some of the 60-year-old filmmaker's documentaries, and they jointly own the dog eat dog production company behind movies like bowling for columbine and roger &amp; me — so there's a lot to divvy up. Neat factoid: glynn notes in one filing that moore was offered funding to make an anti-gun film after the sandy hook massacre, but court documents don't show how he responded.",

            "President trump boards marine one at the white house with his grandchildren joseph and arabella kushner before departing to joint base andrews for a trip to florida on march 3. ( ricky carioti/the washington post ) president trump's 2018 budget proposal is unabashed in its goal: slashing or eradicating a number of social and research programs to offset new spending on defense and homeland security. That emphasis quickly met with broad criticism, including from some who pointed out an apparent contradiction. Trump places a heavy emphasis on cutting waste and targets for elimination programs that, in some cases, cost the government only a few million dollars a year. That is a lot of money in the context of the amount of money you or i spend in a year, but in the context of the government, spending a million dollars is like someone with a $ 50,000-a-year salary spending one penny. What really jumped out at some people, though, was that trump was proposing cuts to some relatively low-cost programs shortly before he prepared to fly to his mar-a-lago resort in florida. According to an analysis from politico, that's a trip that costs about $ 3 million each time — and it's a trip that he's made four times this year. If that $ 3 million estimate is true, he could have funded the u.s."

Her husband, kim jong un, has made 100 reported public appearances in 2016, but ri was only seen with him three times and recently missed out on visits to soap and souvenir factories and an eye hospital. Ri's three public appearances in 2016 are a sharp decline from the 15 she made in 2014, 22 in 2013, and 18 in 2012. ( she's vanished from the public eye before, including for four months in 2012 and for another few months in 2015; she only made seven public appearances last year. ) ri officially became north korea's first lady in 2012, the independent reports. According to the international business times, she and kim have at least one child together, though that child is apparently a bit of a secret. Some say ri has been missing from the public eye because she is pregnant with another child. Others claim there is \" disharmony \" between her and kim's family. Specifically, ri may be clashing with kim's younger sister, kim yo jong, who was recently put in charge of the propaganda and agitation department and is said to be the \" power behind the throne, \" according to the telegraph. There are also reports ri was close to kim's uncle, who kim had executed in 2013 for treason. A professor who is an expert on north korea's leadership tells the telegraph \" it is possible that ri has not appeared in public because she is being closely guarded \" due to reports of several failed attacks on kim's life. ( maybe ri will reappear to check out a north korean zoo's smoking chimp. )",

Bayer on monday said its offer of $ 122 a share is a 37 % premium over monsanto's closing price on may 9; bayer's unsolicited proposal came the next day. Four things to know: a successful merger would create the world's largest agribusiness, trumping the would-be dowdupont; the two have a combined market value of $ 132 billion. Bayer called the move a \" compelling opportunity to create a global agriculture leader. \" but one major shareholder condemned the move, calling it \" arrogant empire-building. \" bayer's share price has fallen 14 % since word of the bid trickled out last week, reports reuters, with a 3.6 % drop occurring early monday. That brings bayer's share price to a 30-month low. Why the drop? for one, bayer is a two-headed company: it makes herbicides and pesticides, but it's thought of as a pharma company, one that invented aspirin and sells alka-seltzer. Deutsche welle cites deutsche bank's assertion that a merger would mean about 55 % of the combined company's \" core earnings \" would come from agriculture. As the bbc puts it, that mix is \" likely to displease investors who had bought shares in bayer for its pharmaceutical offering. \" second, there's the matter of how bayer would finance such a deal: with debt and equity. \" we will increase our debt level on our balance sheet substantially, \" explained bayer's cfo, with the expectation that \" strong cash flows \" would allow for quick debt reduction. One analyst puts the expected debt level at about $ 45 billion, per the wall street journal, which reports bayer's net debt was about $ 20 billion last year.",

A third project, a biopic called rodham, is quietly gaining traction in hollywood, the new york times reports. The feature film would focus on the former first lady in her 20s — including her budding romance with bill — and is slated to be directed by james ponsoldt, whose recent indie teen romance the spectacular now had a good showing at the box office. Of course, the film still needs a financier, and the filmmakers could run into the same alleged issues as the cnn production: the would-be director says the plug was pulled after democrats stonewalled interviews and research. However, a source close to the clintons counters that there has already been a small library of unauthorized book and film projects featuring hillary, and for the most part, \" we don't care, don't really even notice. \" it probably won't hurt that the script has reportedly been toned down. A description of the original by the daily beast earlier this year included a steamy sex scene in which the clintons \" devour each other \" and f-bombs aplenty.",

Among those to die was 30-year-old luis de carvajal the younger, born in spain to a family of jewish \" conversos \" — forced to convert to catholicism but carrying out jewish rituals in secret. Under torture, de carvajal betrayed more than 120 clandestine jews, reports the times of israel. It is de carvajal's diary, written in minuscule script on paper measuring 4 inches by 3 inches and later found hidden in his clothing, that has long captivated historians as perhaps the earliest surviving artifact to offer insights into the arrival of jews in the new world. Now, more than 80 years since it went missing, a collector has found it, and paid generously to return it to mexico, reports the new york times. In december 2015, a london auction house listed the manuscript, without any connection to de carvajal, as having been in a michigan family's possession. It was then listed for sale, this time as a transcript of de carvajal's original, last year at swann auction galleries in new york. Leonard milberg, 85, decided to buy the copy from swann, only to be told by the experts he consulted that it was indeed the 180-page booklet missing since the 1930s from mexico's national archives. Milberg has since paid tens of thousands of dollars to ensure that it be returned to mexico, but asked that it first be displayed at the new york historical society, where it will be through march 12. He says the artifact, which highlights how integral jews were to the development of the new world, is his way of \" getting back at anti-semitism. \" ( a jewish \" lost tribe \" has been found. )",

            "New york — in the closing years of the 16th century, as the holy inquisition reached across the ocean to spanish and portuguese territories, luis de carvajal the younger was put on trial by the mexican inquisition, suspected of being a jew. The spanish-born de carvajal ( 1567 – 1596 ) was from a family of \"converso \" jews who had converted to catholicism. He was living in mexico, where his uncle served as the governor of leon. Under torture, de carvajal betrayed more than 120 people who continued to practice their faith in secret. He and many of his family were burned at the stake. Long a familiar name to scholars, de carvajal kept a meticulously written diary, penned under the pseudonym joseph lumbroso. While there were some transcriptions, the original diary disappeared in 1939 from the national archives of mexico. Earlier this year, though, a keen-eyed collector spotted the de carvajal diary at auction and helped orchestrate its return. Now, for the first time in more than 75 years, the newly recovered memoir — measuring only four inches by three inches — along with other de carvajal religious manuscripts, are on view as part of \"the first jewish americans",

Almost nothing was heard about the document for more than 80 years — until it showed up 13 months ago at a london auction house. The manuscript was on sale for $ 1,500, because the house had little sense of its value.

Astronauts used the station's big robot arm to grab the dragon capsule out of orbit sunday morning. It's the second visit for the supply ship, which made a delivery for nasa back in 2015 as well. Spacex launched the dragon from cape canaveral, florida, on friday, using a previously flown falcon rocket. It was the first time spacex had flown a recycled rocket with a recycled capsule on top. Spacex is looking to drive down launch costs through reusability. The dragon holds nearly 5,000 pounds of goods, including mice and barley seeds, the latter a budweiser experiment. As for christmas presents, nasa isn't saying, in true santa style."

        "summary": "Greece is set to return to the international bond market today after four years of financial struggle, but not everyone is happy about it — especially not the suspected domestic terrorists who set off a large car bomb in front of the country's central bank hours before the bond issue. The huge blast early in central athens this morning shattered windows at the bank and at buildings up to 700 feet away but didn't cause any injuries, reports the ap. Two warning calls were made 45 minutes before the explosion, which comes a day before german chancellor angela merkel, who imposed tough conditions on the greek bailout, is due to visit the country. After six years of recession, public anger at austerity measures in greece runs deep, with unemployment at 28 % and incomes down around a third over the last four years, reuters notes. Authorities, who believe a leftist or anarchist group is behind the bombing, say the bond issue issue is a sign that greece is finally emerging from its debt crisis. \" it is clear that the attackers are trying to set the agenda, \" a government spokesman says. \" we will not allow the terrorists to succeed. \"",

A study in denmark, meanwhile, suggests terrible management, not workload, is the chief culprit in workplace discontent, sciencenordic reported. The good news is that researchers may have found a handy way to deal with a boss who's a jerk: give it right back, subtly. \" if your boss is hostile, there [ appear ] to be benefits to reciprocating, \" an ohio state researcher says at eureka alert. \" employees felt better about themselves because they didn't just sit back and take the abuse. \" except instead of yelling, they did things like ignoring their bosses, pretending not to get it, or putting forth a mediocre effort. \" these are things that bosses don't like and that fit the definition of hostility, but in a passive-aggressive form, \" says researcher bennett tepper. In one study, 169 subjects reported how abusive their bosses were and how they responded at work; seven months later, they reported how they were feeling about their jobs. Respondents who didn't retaliate against mean bosses were more likely to be unhappy with and less committed to their jobs than those who fired back. Another survey found that employees in the latter camp were less likely to see themselves as victims and have psychological distress. Still, researchers aren't necessarily recommending the seemingly risky strategy, saying more investigation is needed.

The american institute of stress reports that 80 % of workers feel stress at work, and four out of 10 workers say their jobs are either very stressful or extremely stressful. This stress in the workplace originates from job security, workload, work-life balance, and, of course, people issues. In virtually every business environment, interaction is key to successful day-to-day operations. We interact with clients, co-workers, and our superiors. When we have an exceptional boss or manager, it makes life at work a bit easier — guards are down for the most part, and everyone is able to be on the same page. On the other hand, having a bad manager or boss can result in higher levels of work-related stress and lower levels of employee satisfaction. Data published by inc.

Clinton had 56 % of the vote in california with 91 % of returns in; she took more than 60 % of the vote in new jersey, and sanders had 64 % in north dakota, with victories in other states more finely balanced. Clinton addressed her supporters in celebratory fashion tuesday night, while sanders, speaking before the california results, promised to continue fighting to the convention. He plans to visit washington, dc, which votes next week, on thursday. Sanders ' campaign disputes the idea of counting any superdelegates in clinton's total — which is how the ap put her over the magic number — because they don't vote until the convention. Sanders himself tells nbc news that he was \" disappointed \" in the decision by ap to go with its \" clinton clinches \" story monday night. \" they got on the phone as i understand it, and started hounding superdelegates to tell them in an anonymous way who they were voting for, \" he says, per the ap. \" the night before the largest primary, biggest primary in the whole process, they make this announcement. So i was really disappointed in what the ap did. \"",

Since Document 2 does not provide information related to the investigation of the bloodied cricket bat and the theories surrounding it, it is irrelevant to the summary.

In fact, they found two pairs, and the clothing items are not only functional but relatively stylish. The wool pants were found with the remains of two men, each about 40, who lived as many as 3,300 years ago and likely rode horses long distances, based on the riding gear that was placed in the tomb. These particular pants look to be custom-made, suggesting that people had been practicing the art of pants-making for a while, notes phys.org. \" rather than the modern method of cutting down large pieces of fabric, the early pants were woven on a loom in precisely-sized segments to form the final garment, like nomad couture, \" explains time. They even feature decorative cross-stitching. The find bolsters the theory that pants first came into being not too long after horse-riding did — an estimated 4,000 years ago.

        "summary": "For years, retirement planners have typically advised people to save 15 % of their incomes. Adherents of the fire movement would scoff at such a paltry goal. Fire, as the wall street journal explains, stands for financial independence, retire early. And while the concept of living frugally isn't exactly a new one, a growing number of millennials and younger gen x-ers are embracing the concept aggressively. As in, they try to save as much as three-quarters of their after-tax income and go to extremes to spend as little as possible. One single woman interviewed, a 38-year-old lawyer in seattle, details how she spends $ 75 a month on groceries, uses her friends ' netflix passwords, and walks to work to save on gas. It's all part of her goal to retire at 40 with $ 2 million — instead of working for another quarter-century. As her example suggests, many of the adherents of fire work salaried jobs and make decent money, and they are supported by a cottage industry of podcasts, blogs, and conferences. A blog called mr. Money mustache, for example, racked up 2.5 million views in the last month. The story also points out the risks involved with the fire strategy. For example, index funds are big among adherents, and market downturns could wreak havoc on well-laid plans; then there's the inherent difficulty of trying to forecast living costs decades down the road. But fire advocates aren't cowed. \" we live in uncertain times and financial empowerment provides a path out, \" says grant sabatier, 33, who writes the millennial money blog. ( click to read the full story, which takes note of an irony: some of the biggest names of fire have become rich by preaching the merits of frugality. )",

Everybody survived, but turner ended up with a fractured pelvis, fractured vertebra, and a broken sternum — though it apparently could have been much worse: \" the doctors told me that if i hadn't worn such a tight dress which held in place my bones as the car impacted, i would have most definitely punctured vital organs as my bones went out of place. \" the story is going gangbusters in the british media, complete with photos of turner decked out in her christmas dress before the party and, later, in her hospital bed. See the daily mail, the mirror, the sun, itv news, etc. Multiple stories use the same explanation of how the \" bodycon \" dress \" acted like an old-fashioned corset \" and kept things in their proper place at crunch time. Alas, none actually talk to any of turner's doctors directly. But even so, \" go ahead and order that leopard-print bandage dress that ' ll fit you like a vacuum-sealed packet of astronaut food, \" suggests kelly faircloth at jezebel. \" it could save your life! \" ( in utah, a mom and two kids survived a crazy wreck with a fuel tanker. )",

But when he began to eat he quickly realized he'd gotten the salmon tartare instead. \" with the dim lighting, it's not easy to tell the difference between two dishes, especially if they use mayonnaise.

Canuel alleges that the waiter didn't take notes or tell the cooks about his allergy; was talking, laughing, and drinking with other customers; and that the restaurant made no attempt to contact him after the event. In july he filed a formal complaint with police, who interviewed witnesses and arrested the 22-year-old server after searching his home, reports the montreal gazette. It is now up to quebec's director of criminal and penal prosecutions to determine whether charges such as criminal negligence will be brought. One crime attorney tells the cbc that this could be the first such charge made against a server in canada — something so \" excessively rare \" that it is \" practically unheard of, \" adds a police spokesperson.

        "summary": "With winter gloom soon to be upon us, more people may turn to vitamin d pills to stay strong. But they should think twice, according to the new england journal of medicine. Contrary to reports claiming up to 50 % of people are vitamin d deficient, per medical news today, researchers say less than 6 % of americans under 70 are vitamin d deficient ( excluding infants ) and only 13 % are at risk of getting too little. That means some of the 19 % of americans taking vitamin d pills as of 2012 probably don't need them, per the ap. Not only that, but too much vitamin d — which your body makes naturally with sun exposure and helps build strong bones — can cause health problems like nausea, constipation, kidney stones, and an abnormal heart rhythm because of high levels of calcium in the blood. Researchers at the institute of medicine, which sets the recommended dietary allowance, acknowledge they're partly to blame for the confusion. Most people under 70 need 400 international units of vitamin d per day, while those over 70 need 600. But to make sure the rda covered everyone, researchers set it at 600 to 800 units. Now, some doctors mistakenly believe patients are vitamin d deficient if their levels don't fall within that range. The result: blood tests for vitamin d levels have seen \" an 83-fold increase from 2000 to 2010, to 8.7 million tests last year, at $ 40 apiece, \" per the ap. In fact, the blood test is now medicare's fifth most common. Researchers ' advice: stick to the rda and avoid a blood test unless you have special risk factors for a vitamin d deficiency. ( a lack of vitamin d might've killed wolfgang mozart. )",

            "Vitamin d, also known as the sunshine vitamin, is produced by the body as a response to sun exposure; it can also be consumed in food or supplements. Having enough vitamin d is important for a number of reasons, including maintaining healthy bones and teeth; it may also protect against a range of conditions such as cancer, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. Vitamin d has multiple roles in the body, helping to: maintain the health of bones and teeth. Support the health of the immune system, brain, and nervous system. Regulate insulin levels and aid diabetes management. Support lung function and cardiovascular health. Influence the expression of genes involved in cancer development. What is vitamin d? vitamin d is actually not a vitamin. Vitamin d is actually not a vitamin. Despite the name, vitamin d is considered a pro-hormone and not actually a vitamin. Vitamins are nutrients that cannot be created by the body and therefore must be taken in through our diet. However, vitamin d can be synthesized by our body when sunlight hits our skin. It is estimated that sensible sun exposure on bare skin for 5-10 minutes 2-3 times per week allows most people to produce sufficient vitamin d, but vitamin d breaks down quite quickly, meaning that stores can run low, especially in winter.

A record-breaking number of catalans cast their vote in sunday's election, billed as a de facto referendum on independence. With more than 98 % of the votes counted, the nationalist coalition junts pel sí ( together for yes ) were projected to win 62 seats, while far-left pro-independence popular unity candidacy, known in spain as cup, were set to gain 10 seats, meaning an alliance of the two parties could give secessionists an absolute majority in the region's 135-seat parliament.

A new study has found that in most cultures, if you reach out to give a helping hand, you won't get much thanks in response. But what might seem rude, particularly in the us, where we say \" thank you \" with much greater regularity than other countries, is actually a positive. An international team of researchers recorded and analyzed 1,057 casual conversations in eight languages in homes and public places on five continents among people who knew each other well. Across all language groups, which included italian, russian, polish, and english, cooperation was the norm and people helped out 88 % of the time. But they only got a \" thank you \" back, on average, one in 20 times. So, are we all just thoughtless louts at heart? not at all, the researchers tell the new york times. Cooperation is simply a basic expectation in most cultures. \" our basic stance is one of reciprocity, \" said linguist and lead investigator nick enfield. \" when we ask people to help us, the default is that they will. \" in other words, when we ask for something, we expect to hear \" yes. \" the researchers did find some interesting differences across cultures.

Cops tell the detroit free press that the 20-year-old tried to grab the notebook at the same time. That's when a ruckus broke out. The two farmington hills women allegedly started pulling the 20-year-old's hair, and the younger woman's mother apparently felt her protective instincts kick in. Novi police detective scott baetens says the mom pulled out a gun, pointed it at the other women, and told them to lay off her daughter. As customers started fleeing the scene, the police were called and the situation apparently died down. Cops say the gun was loaded, though no round was in the chamber, and that the mother did have an up-to-date concealed pistol license. Baetens says after reviewing video footage of the incident, the case has been placed in the hands of the oakland county prosecutor's office to see if they can determine who started the fight and if the gun holder acted in self-defense; all four women could face charges. \" it was a senseless act of violence all the way around, \" he adds.

Instead of just ignoring it or telling her she had the wrong number, though, the man who received the text sent back a picture of five of his kids smiling and giving thumbs-up signs, msn reports. \" i believe this message was intended for someone else, \" he wrote. \" my wife isn't home, so i couldn't get her opinion, but the kids and i think you look stunning in your dress! you should definitely go with that one! \" the text exchange went viral after a friend of syd's posted it to twitter. After it was revealed that tony wood of missouri was the father who had sent the kind response, it was discovered that his wife wasn't home because she was with the couple's sixth child, kaizler, at the hospital. The 6-year-old is battling leukemia, and after the text story went viral, people started donating to the family's gofundme campaign. As of this writing, it had raised nearly quadruple its $ 10,000 goal, and an update on the page thanks everyone for their support: \" god continues to show us he is there for us and it is awesome to see his love move!... Our needs to get back on our feet have been met! we can't thank you enough, but any further donations are unnecessary! \" tony wood also tweeted a picture of kaizler giving syd his own thumbs-up. ( check out another heartwarming wrong-number story. )",

God has blessed us immensely through this and we are humbled by the love and compassion shown through this situation. It's time to pay this remarkable experience forward! with that in mind, we have a new goal now. There is an adorable little boy that lives in our city named finn shafran. ( side note: the $ 25,000 goal shown is an old goal. Finn has encountered an entirely new set of circumstances that have made the family's financial needs greater than imagined! please do not let that goal being hit deter you from giving! the need is still there! ) he is an avocado-loving, energetic, and intelligent little three-year-old who loves playing with friends, reading books, and watching curious george. Finn's parents recently received the difficult explanation that the only way to give finn a chance at long-term survivability is for a combination of radiation and surgery. He is facing a complicated surgery that will forever change his life. Even then, that's only going to give him a fighting chance. For that surgery to even be an option they have to deal with finn's tumor which may jeopardize everything. Not to mention that he is facing accelerated growth which gives them a narrow window of opportunity. They are currently at the mayo clinic receiving further eductation on the situation and will be required to make hard decisions fast. This is a family that still has need. By blessing this family, you will be blessing us! please, help us help them. God has blessed us with this undeserved attention, what better way to receive his blessing than to help another family in need? please follow this link to finn's funding page, and show finn and his family the same love and support you've shown to us. Their need is great, and they could really use a heavy dose of god's love and light in their life right now! thank you so much and god bless!"

        "summary": "Bet you didn't know there was a tropical forest in the arctic. That's what scientists say they've uncovered in svalbard, norway, though the remnants of the forest are actually 380 million years old and fossilized. Back when the early trees — a type dubbed protolepidodendropsis pulchra — were alive and thriving, the tectonic plate on which norway sits actually rested near the equator, reports popular science. That helps explain why these ancient trees likely resembled today's palm trees. Though scientists found only fossilized stumps, they say the trees, related to club moss, probably had fern-like leaves, grew less than a foot apart, and stretched about 13 feet high, report discovery news and the bbc. The trees — which also had \" small ribbon-like roots \" and grew in wet soils, per geology — likely played a role in \" one of the most dramatic shifts in the earth's climate in the past 400 million years, \" according to a cardiff release. During this era, known as the devonian period, scientists say the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere plunged about 15-fold. \" the evolution of tree-sized vegetation is the most likely cause of this dramatic drop in carbon dioxide, \" says one of the researchers, \" because the plants were absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis to build their tissues and also through the process of forming soils. \" ( earth could use a few more live trees. )",

        "summary": "Twin sisters, known for their debilitating symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, have been found dead in colorado in what police say was a possible suicide pact. Sara and amanda eldritch, 33, were found dead of gunshot wounds friday in a vehicle near canon city's royal gorge bridge, some 130 miles from their home in the denver suburb of broomfield, reports the canon city daily record. They were the first people in the state to receive deep brain stimulation to treat their ocd compulsions, which included taking 10-hour showers and using up to five bottles of rubbing alcohol daily to disinfect their skin, per 9 news. Both had contemplated suicide since age 13 and, prior to their 2015 surgeries, described feeling \" at war with their own existence, \" according to the hospital that treated them. The hope was that careful stimulation of electrode wires placed on their brains, connected to battery packs in their chests, would stifle overactivity in the brain to reduce anxiety, reports the gazette. And it appeared to work. \" i feel like i can identify my anxiety. I can actually see where it's coming from. And i feel like i can deal with it, \" sara eldritch told the hospital in 2016. But the pair — who appeared on cbs'the doctors in 2017 — told 9 news that not all of their compulsions had been stifled: if forced to leave their shared home, the sisters stopped eating and drinking to the point of dehydration so they wouldn't have to use public bathrooms. Still, \" we're trying to feel like useful members of society, \" sara said. The fremont county sheriff's office said the twins died in a suspected suicide pact, but offered no other details.",

The 13-branch community bank based in ogden serves as trustee for investors with a financial stake in the aircraft. Beyond that fairly broad background, little is known, including why it was in a country that americans are barred from doing business with. An exec for the bank tells the times, \" we have no idea why that plane was at that airport. \" as the times explains, the trust makes it difficult to get much beyond the bank from a paperwork perspective, as the bank is the only owner listed in the faa's database for that plane — along, the times discovered, with 1,168 other planes, a number that exceeds that of nearly all other banks. As for the faa, it wasn't able to shine a light on who was at the controls or in the plane. Iranian officials with the un are staying mum, and the treasury department office tasked with making sure sanctions are upheld — the office that would be the one that could grant an ok for the plane to land there — had no comment. One breadcrumb: the plane was spotted in zurich around the time of the world economic forum in davos, leading the wire to suggest \" that probably narrows the list down to 2,633 powerful people. \"",

Lee jeong hwa, who got out in 2010 from her home in kilju county, tells nbc news that residents started talking of a \" ghost disease \" after people started perishing, and they're tying it all back to the regime's nuke tests. \" we thought we were dying because we were poor and we ate badly, \" she says. \" now we know it was the radiation. \" a world health organization fact sheet explains the havoc, based on exposure levels, that radiation can wreak on the body, causing such maladies as burns, hair loss, and skin conditions, with cancer also a possibility years after exposure. A korea institute of nuclear safety rep tells nbc it's \" assumed \" that locals are being heavily exposed to radiation — but tests on lee, one of 30 defectors being examined, have turned up no evidence of radiation contamination, and a seoul national university professor says that even though he believes there's likely merit to the defectors ' claims, scientists have a \" total lack of data \" to back them up. Another expert adds that \" sniff \" sensors in the region haven't picked up signs of radioactive matter after past tests — and some residents'tales of sickened flora and fauna go back decades, long before north korea started testing nukes in 2006. Meanwhile, gizmodo points out a chinese nuclear expert told the telegraph earlier this year a radiation leak at the test site is \" inevitable, \" even if it hasn't yet happened, and that groundwater contamination may be the biggest concern.",

People are exposed to natural sources of ionizing radiation, such as in soil, water, and vegetation, as well as in human-made sources, such as x-rays and medical devices. Ionizing radiation has many beneficial applications, including uses in medicine, industry, agriculture and research. As the use of ionizing radiation increases, so does the potential for health hazards if not properly used or contained. Acute health effects such as skin burns or acute radiation syndrome can occur when doses of radiation exceed certain levels. Low",
