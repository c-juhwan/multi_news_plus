The main motives cited aren't all that surprising: merchandising, jersey sales, and drawing the interest of more young fans and high school recruits. \"there's the potential to alienate some boosters and alums who write the checks, sure, \" paul lukas, editor of uni-watch.com tells the post.

A cruz rep says it's \" another garbage story in a tabloid full of garbage \" ( the enquirer has endorsed trump ) and \" that is not rafael in the picture. \" still, trump's criticisms don't stop there. He also slams cruz's father for urging evangelicals to vote for his son. \" i exhort every member of the body of christ to vote according to the word of god and vote for the candidate that stands on the word of god … and i am convinced that man is my son, \" rafael cruz says in a facebook video, per the washington examiner. \" it's disgraceful that his father can go out and do that, \" trump tells fox news.

Dannel malloy said on wednesday that the situation concerned him. \"as a nation, we have had to adjust to this new reality, we recognize that people almost always wonder if someone meant to do us harm, but we must exercise caution without jumping to conclusions before discovering all the facts, \" malloy said. Police said there were two sets of controls aboard the plane that crashed around 3: 30 p.m. Tuesday and left the flight instructor with serious burns and the student on board dead. Two people in a minivan were also taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The instructor pilot remains hospitalized with serious burns.

They're now celebrating the arrests of millison's mother, sister, and brother-in-law, though getting to this point wasn't easy. According to police, deborah sue rudibaugh, 68, initially claimed her son disappeared of his own accord in may 2015, leading her to craft a will that left the family's 700-acre ranch in parlin to her daughter, stephanie jackson, 33. That story changed when authorities found millison's body among sheep heads in a pit at the $ 3 million ranch in july 2017, per the washington post. Rudibaugh then admitted to shooting her son while he slept on may 16, 2015. Rudibaugh told police she'd actually removed millison from a will in april, leading him to become physically and verbally abusive, per the post. She said she killed her son in fear for her own life before moving millison's 170-pound body to a manure pile and then to the pit. But police doubted a 70-pound woman recovering from gallbladder surgery could have managed this feat alone and discovered that jackson deleted a text shortly after 3am on may 16, that read, \" it's time to play! \" jackson and her husband allegedly eventually admitted they helped plan millison's murder and moved his body, reports the denver post. David jackson, 34, faces charges including accessory to murder and tampering with a body, per the ap. His wife and rudibaugh are charged with first-degree murder.",

The pitch perfect star had initially offered to settle the case for $ 200,000, but later sought about $ 5.6 million.

The allegation came as woodward argued attar and his wife, who is accused of helping to calm and restrain the girls during the procedure, should not be released on bail in advance of the october trial. A judge disagreed; they ' ll be on house arrest going forward, and barred from using the internet. The prosecution argues the three, members of an indian-muslim sect called the dawoodi bohra, illegally cut the girls ' genitals as part of a religious rite. The defense counters they simply underwent what the news terms a \" benign \" procedure that involved scraping the mucous membrane of the girls ' genitalia; lawyers say what was removed was then deposited on gauze pads and returned to their mothers for burial. ( the first person in america to be convicted of female genital mutilation was kicked out of the country in march. )",

The bbc points out the us has banned waterboarding, which is \" widely considered \" to be torture.

A former cia director last week said the military would refuse to obey orders to torture terrorists or kill their families. Trump addressed that possibility during the debate, saying \" they're not going to refuse me \" and \" if i say do it, they're going to do it. \" a former secretary of defense said the plan to kill terrorists ' families, especially, goes against \" everything the united states stands for in this world. \"",

        "summary": "Not so fast, amazon. The tech giant's $ 13.7 billion acquisition of whole foods made headlines last week, but the los angeles times reports it may not be as done a deal as previously believed. Amazon agreed to pay $ 42 per share for the grocery chain, but those shares closed at more than $ 43 monday. That means investors expect a higher bid to come in, with one expert calling it \" highly likely. \" potential bidders include kroger, albertsons, and walmart. And while it's unlikely anyone could outbid amazon, its competitors have an obvious interest in making amazon's takeover of whole foods as financially painful for it as possible. Here's what else you need to know: vox reports an amazon-operated whole foods could be a nightmare for other grocery chains. That's because while grocery stores have tiny profit margins, amazon intentionally has essentially no profit margins at all: money that comes in is reinvested in new endeavors. Amazon could immediately cut prices at the notoriously expensive whole foods, undercutting competitors without worry for its own bottom line. Whole foods ceo john mackey says the amazon takeover started with a \" blind date \" six weeks ago. \"we just fell in love, \" the wall street journal quotes mackey as saying. \"it was truly love at first sight. \" one economist expects amazon's acquisition of whole foods to start \" a supermarket war of historic proportions, \" and cnbc reports that would lead to plummeting prices that could kill the expected rise in inflation the fed was hoping for. Bloomberg argues it's not grocery stores that should be most worried, but the companies that make the packaged goods that line their shelves. Amazon is already making its own diapers and batteries and could decimate the profit margins of consumer-goods companies by expanding that program through whole foods. Amazon could hurt packaged food companies like kellogg and campbell soup in another way, cnbc reports. Customers were already turning toward fresher food options, and the acquisition of whole foods could accelerate that process. Finally, the acquisition of whole foods would increase the net worth of amazon ceo jeff bezos by approximately $ 1.8 billion, according to upi. That would increase his wealth to $ 84.6 billion, bringing him within $ 5 billion of bill gates, the world's richest man.",

        "summary": "When jason canfield got a speeding ticket in may 2016, he didn't pull out his checkbook to pay the $ 234 fine: he started gathering records of national and state traffic codes to contest the charge of driving too fast in a seattle school zone. And his efforts paid off, with a king county superior judge tossing the camera-generated citation in may, per the seattle times. Canfield's winning argument centered on what he says were overly verbose road signs. He says he was driving in a 35mph zone on the day of the infraction when, just after 9am, he cruised past a k-8 school, which suddenly placed him in a 20mph zone. A speed camera caught him driving 28mph. He argued the too-wordy signage calling for a slowdown to 20mph \" when children are present \" ( canfield says they weren't ) or \" when flashing \" ( referring to the warning lights ) was confusing enough to slow down drivers'reaction times. Further, national standards specify only one of the two signs appear. The speed cameras are part of seattle's participation in the national vision zero campaign, designed to eliminate traffic deaths. A city report shows drivers may be heeding the warnings, with a significant reduction in collisions near seattle schools with the speed cameras installed. Canfield, who spent about $ 800 to fight the ticket, isn't against the initiative in principle: he has an 8-year-old daughter and says, \" i ' m not in favor of speeding in school zones. \" he just wants clearer signs. An sdot rep tells kiro 7, \" i can't imagine... We will reduce efforts to keep students safe anytime soon. \"",

But while family and friends mourn her death in this \" terrible act of violence, \" buzzfeed notes a glimmer of hope amid the tragedy. Tisdale's job at santa fe high school was just one of two she held down to help her family get by, as her husband, william recie tisdale, is homebound with an incurable lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In december, william tisdale was given just 12 to 18 months to live and was denied a lung transplant, so his family set up a gofundme page in march to help raise funds for a stem cell treatment, with an original goal of $ 30,000. Funds slowly trickled in — but cynthia tisdale's death changed the pace. After the story of her death and her husband's plight started to circulate, money started pouring in; the page has since raised more than $ 100,000, which the family says will be used for funeral costs, the stem cell treatment, and even maybe a lung transplant from a different doctor, an option the family is now able to consider. Cnn notes william tisdale is \" devastated \" at his wife's murder, but the kindness of strangers and their financial support have raised his spirits. \" we are still in such disbelief that anything good can come out of such a horrific event, \" one of cynthia tisdale's children writes on the gofundme page. \" my mom always made good come out of bad situations though and this is no different for her. \" cynthia tisdale's brother wrote on facebook, via buzzfeed: \" i am sure cynthia is rejoicing in heaven knowing her death may save her husband of 47 years. \"",

The ohio couple had had plans over the years to get married that never came to fruition — until yesterday, when they had a christmas wedding in the hospital room where their 4-year-old son, billy, is being treated for neuroblastoma, typically a children's cancer, the ap reports. A lighted arch was erected and rose petals were scattered in billy's room at akron children's hospital by employees, who've become like family to the cramers since billy was diagnosed in 2013, the akron beacon journal reports. Billy's younger siblings, 2-year-old mason and 1-year-old delaney, jingled bells as sarah's uncle, a pastor, officiated. \" i think the hospital has become our second home, \" sarah tells fox 8 cleveland. \" everyone here treats us like family and treats him like family, and that's really important to us. \" by all accounts, it hasn't been an easy year for the cramers: billy has endured intense chemo, surgery, a bone marrow transplant, and now, a clinical immunotherapy trial, the journal notes. William, who works for a toy company, has stayed home with the two younger kids while sarah has taken a hiatus from nursing school to stay by billy's side — she estimates the two of them have been in the hospital for at least six months out of the past 12. But even though the cancer had spread to billy's bones, his oncologist says the boy is \" doing great \" and that \" from what we can tell, there is no [ longer ] evidence of the disease, \" according to the journal. \" my son is my hero, \" william tells fox 8, while sarah notes in the journal that the in-room ceremony \" shows we're going to be together for the long haul. \" ( an experimental leukemia treatment has had a tremendous success rate so far. )",

The finding comes from a study of contagious yawning among 328 subjects who were shown a three-minute clip of others yawning. Each time a participant yawned, he or she had to click a button, the bbc reports. Some 68 % of subjects yawned, but the rate varied among different age groups: 82 % of under-25s yawned, while 60 % of 25- to 49-year-olds did. Just 41 % of those older than 50 yawned. Yawning contagiousness wasn't strongly linked to empathy or intelligence, the independent reports — a finding that appears to run counter to earlier research, the bbc points out. Still, age accounted for just 8 % of the variation in the phenomenon, per the head of the study, and \" the vast majority of variation in the contagious yawning response was just not explained, \" she says. Researchers note that those with autism and schizophrenia are thought to be less likely to \" catch \" a yawn; genetic research on yawning could help in finding treatments for the conditions.

It was confirmation that they had discovered the resting place of the ss connaught, a 370-foot-long steamer that sank april 21, 1860, about 100 miles from boston. Now, endurance is formulating a plan to retrieve the connaught's suspected bounty: millions of dollars in gold coins. In a lengthy bbc piece, chris baraniuk tells the story of endurance ceo micah eldred's mission to create a profitable shipwreck salvage business, why he chose the connaught, and the challenges endurance faces as it undertakes \" a subsea engineering job that we're trying to make respectable. \" four years ago, endurance began researching shipwrecks that both contained valuables worth salvaging and for which salvage was technically feasible. Starting with 1,500 wrecks, they whittled the number to 20. Of those, connaught was their best bet. Using sonar to scan more than 700 square miles of ocean bottom, the team discovered the connaught in 2013, as io9 reported. The next year, an rov confirmed the find. In 2015, they recovered artifacts, and they also became aware of an unanticipated problem: thick fishing nets snagged on the wreckage rose hundreds of feet off the connaught. As the team figures out a solution — perhaps in the form of a giant log-gripping claw adapted for maritime use — eldred tells baraniuk that he's not motivated by the gold involved. \" the excitement, he says, \" comes from building a business that's really complicated. \" ( these repo men of the high seas face challenges of their own. )",

Usa today has cellphone video of the incident at maywood academy high school, where 64-year-old marston riley can be seen calmly absorbing the remarks of the belligerent student; students tell ktla the teen had been asked to leave the class due to a dress code violation. For about a minute and a half, riley quietly keeps asking the student to leave, per the los angeles times, as the student berates him, calls him the n-word, and finally throws a basketball at him. Then, suddenly, riley punches the student in the face, and they scuffle for about 30 seconds as students scream, until a woman in a vest runs in and breaks it up. Ktla spoke with some students and notes most are defending riley, with one even suggesting it was a setup. A gofundme started in riley's name by a colleague, meanwhile, had raised more than $ 75,000 as of tuesday morning; riley himself put up a short video confirming the fundraiser was legit and to thank everyone who supported him. \" we all may have mixed feelings about what happened, \" the page host notes. \" but please do know that this is not the first time that mr. Riley is [ sic ] attacked; physically or verbally. He is a great person and a great teacher. \" as for the school district, it said in a statement: \" we take this matter very seriously and do not condone violence or intolerance of any kind. \" the boy was treated for \" moderate \" injuries at the hospital, per the local sheriff.

But in a youtube video published tuesday — \" obviously designed to create a viral video moment, \" observes chris o ' brien at venturebeat — amazon tells the non-profit's executive director, marty hartman, that six floors of an amazon building will be set aside as a permanent rent-free home for the shelter, allowing it to house more than 200 people. Amazon's head of real estate, john schoettler, says amazon ceo jeff bezos loved the idea when schoettler first suggested it in january. He adds amazon will cover the \" tens of millions of dollars \" in construction costs, plus all future utility bills \" until homelessness is solved. \" hartman says it's a \" huge gift, \" though the new york times reports it comes at a time when amazon, seattle's largest private employer, is shouldering some of the blame for the city's rising housing costs, which gave the area the third-largest homeless population in the country in 2016. Mary's place, which hosts women and families until they can find permanent housing, will be located in another former hotel owned by amazon until its new home is completed in early 2020.

        "summary": "Teachers and other public employees are now eyeing the supreme court after it announced thursday it will take on a case next summer that may have big repercussions for unions. The los angeles times reports the high court will look at overruling the requirement that all public employees, not just union members, pay fees that support collective bargaining. The case, being brought on behalf of illinois child support specialist mark janus, could affect unions in 22 states where those \" fair share \" fees are now mandated for all public employees; labor experts think many would stop paying if they weren't forced to. With conservative neil gorsuch now on the gavel, it's expected the ruling won't favor the unions. The country's four largest public-sector unions are blasting the complaint as \" a blatantly political and well-funded plot... To further rig the economic rules against everyday working people. \" the case stretches back to 2015, when illinois gov. Bruce rauner filed a complaint saying the mandated fees were unconstitutional, per the chicago tribune. Three state employees, including janus, joined the suit, which was eventually thrown out by a federal judge and an appeals court. The ruling used as precedence was the 1977 supreme court case of abood vs. Detroit board of education, in which it was decided all public employees, even those not in unions, must pay a portion of union dues that go toward collective bargaining efforts, as those efforts benefit all employees. Early last year, janus penned an op-ed for the tribune explaining why he didn't feel he should be required to pay the fees, writing: \" i am not anti-union. Unions have their place. … but unions aren't a fit for everyone. And i shouldn't be forced to pay money to a union if i don't think it does a good job representing my interests. \"",

In one of his first acts in office in february 2015, the republican governor attempted to halt the passing along of the union fees in order to invite a legal challenge. On thursday, the supreme court agreed to consider the lawsuit that resulted, and rauner said a victory would be \" transformative for the state of illinois, transformative for america. \" losing the required fees worries labor leaders because it could lead to more workers leaving unions to avoid the cost, starving unions of money and members. The american federation of state, county and municipal employees union at the center of the lawsuit called it \" yet another example of corporate interests using their power and influence to launch a political attack on working people and rig the rules of the economy in their own favor. \" a similar case out of california was already in the legal pipeline when",

To keep my job at the state, i have to pay monthly fees to the american federation of state, county and municipal employees, or afscme, a public employee union that claims to \" represent \" me.

Chen's family says he was in the area to capture pokemon. Prosecutors say cromwell shot at chen more than six times, striking him four times in the chest, according to wavy. Cromwell claims he was acting in self-defense. Nbc news reports an attorney for citywide protection services says chen drove his van at cromwell. But prosecutors say cromwell fired at chen as he was driving away, with his first shots entering the driver's side window. They say he moved around to the front of the van and fired more shots. When police arrived at the scene, cromwell allegedly asked a detective about the accuracy of his shooting. Cromwell was charged with second-degree murder in february. That charge was upgraded to first-degree murder wednesday. He's also charged with the use of a firearm in commission of a felony. Cromwell's father accuses prosecutors of \" trying to make an example \" of his son for \" political \" reasons. He says \" there's no ground for \" the new charge.",

Cnn reports the oil company originally estimated that only about 187 gallons had spilled. On thursday, it updated that estimate to about 16,800 gallons after excavating more than 100 feet of pipe, news 10 abc reports. While transcanada has yet to find the source of the leak, it says it's been \" controlled \" by shutting off a section of the pipeline.

The affected section of the keystone pipeline will remain closed until early next week while workers search for the leak. While less oil will be entering the us market from canada for the time being, analysts say consumers won't be affected as there is currently more than enough oil available. Last november, president obama vetoed an extension of the keystone pipeline known as keystone xl at least partly due to environmental concerns. Transcanada is currently challenging that veto in federal court.

Harold camping's deadline of doomsday/rapture has arrived on the east coast without a peep, just as it did in the world's earlier time zones. \" so far it hasn't interrupted my fish &amp; chips, \" read a typical tweet from australia, one of a few of the early ones rounded up by the guardian. No word yet from camping, who predicted that end times would arrive at 6pm today in each time zone. And the flop hasn't stopped endoftheworldconfessions from surging on twitter. The christian post takes note of the mockery and wonders if any good might come of camping's misfire. \"maybe at least people have thought about the second coming of christ, \" says dr. Barry levanthal, provost at southern evangelical seminary. Another theologian isn't as generous. \"i don't see any good coming from distorting scripture, \" says a professor at talbot and biola university. \" it's tragic to me. Sadly, christians should be the ones with the most settled confidence in the face of potential problems, but we can be the biggest alarmists and conspiracy theorists. \"",

Beyond that, not much is known about the mystery man — except that he has helped scientists rewrite the book on mummification. Chemical analysis reveals that whoever buried him also embalmed him, and that pushes back the start of the mummification practice about 1,500 years, reports live science. What's more, the \" recipe \" used to preserve the man is similar to the one that was in use about 2,500 years later, when the likes of king tut and other pharaohs were laid to rest, reports national geographic. The basic recipe, per the bbc: a plant oil such as sesame oil; a balsam-type plant or root extract; a plant-based gum, or sugar; and tree resin, which helped ward off bacteria. \" until now, we've not had a prehistoric mummy that has actually demonstrated — so perfectly through the chemistry — the origins of what would become the iconic mummification that we know all about, \" says archaeologist stephen buckley of the university of york. The mummy was discovered about a century ago and has been in the egyptian museum of turin. It proved to be a perfect specimen to test because, crucially, no conservation efforts were ever used on it over the years. Live science notes one interesting aspect of the dates involved: the man's death predated writing, meaning the formula for embalming had likely been passed down verbally from generation to generation.

That is when lawyers will discuss matters including how information about the package holmes mailed to his psychiatrist was released to the media. Citing concerns that divulging holmes ' \" medical or psychiatric information \" would waive the right to keep other personal details out of the courtroom, public defender tamara brady declined to state his ailment. \" in the middle of the day yesterday, we received information for the situation ( that ) involved a trip to the hospital, \" she said.",
            "Aurora, colo. - citing unspecified recent events that caused accused aurora theater shooter james holmes to be hospitalized, his lawyers asked for a scheduled court appearance to be delayed. Sources familiar with the hearing say holmes would not appear thursday because in the past several days he purposely hit his head on the wall and floor of his cell. He did not suffer obvious physical injuries. The concern is not about his physical health, the sources said, but about his demeanor. The sources also said it was not a suicide attempt. An emergency hearing was convened at 4: 15 p.m. Wednesday to discuss the development. During that hearing, the defense said they were informed of holmes ' condition around midday tuesday. Attorneys said he was taken to a hospital, but were careful not to reveal any details of his condition. \" it's not as simple as a migraine and"

The cameraman, nelson rand, working for a french tv station, was \" gravely wounded \" when he was struck by three bullets, afp reports. Today's unrest began when protesters captured and vandalized two military water cannon trucks at a key intersection in the business district, just outside the red shirt encampment. They ripped the cannon from its moorings and used its plastic barrel to shoot firecrackers from behind a sandbag bunker they had commandeered from soldiers, the ap reports. Soldiers used a loudspeaker to send a message to the red shirts: \" we are the people's army. We are just doing our duty for the nation. Brothers and sisters, let's talk together. \" but a group of aggressive young protesters approached them on motorcycles and on foot, shouting obscenities and taunting them by taking off their clothes.",

Artist michael israel, a \" speed painter \" who the post says whipped up the 6-foot-tall depiction in \" five or six frenzied minutes \" during a 2007 charity gala at trump's mar-a-lago estate in florida, released the public pics of the painting for the first time tuesday. Melania trump initially bid $ 10,000 during the event's auction, then was cajoled into doubling that; half the proceeds went to israel, half to the children's charity the event was being held for. And those well versed in tax law say if that now-elusive painting is hanging in either one of trump's homes or businesses, he could be breaking \" self-dealing \" laws. The only hint as to where the painting may be: israel's former manager, who revealed in september that he was told by melania to send the painting to a trump golf club in westchester, ny, where she planned to display it in \" the boardroom or the conference room. \" the hill notes that trump paid $ 10,000 funneled from the trump foundation for another portrait of himself in 2004, with an eyewitness saying that painting is on display in trump's national doral miami resort.

Modern readers want to know the story of individual writers, but \" homer has no biography, \" nicolson says. He also argues that the works may have emerged some 1,200 years before many historians say homer lived; he dates the epic poems to around 2000 bc. He supports his theory by noting that parts of homeric stories \" are shared among the indo-european world as a whole, all the way from north india through greece to germanic and icelandic stories. \" what's more, greece, in the iliad, is full of \" barbarians, \" and that description \" doesn't make sense any later than about 1800 to 1700 bc. \" the works combine the \" hero-based culture of the eurasian steppes \" with the \" sophisticated, authoritarian, and literate cities and palaces of the eastern mediterranean, \" nicolson writes, as guardian reviewer charlotte higgins notes. Meanwhile, the washington post observes that questions over homer's existence, or lack thereof, aren't new; no \" reliable historical information \" exists about the poet, terrence mccoy writes. ( shakespeare, of course, is another writer whose identity has been questioned; some have said he wasn't alone in his work. )",

The washington post writer said a democratic presidency would be better than the alternative offered by donald trump -- who once called will a \" major loser. \" \"make sure he loses, \" will said of the presumptive gop nominee. \" grit their teeth for four years and win the white house. \" his voter registration in maryland has now changed from republican to \" unaffiliated, \" pj media reported. The final straw was house speaker paul ryan's ( r-wis ) endorsement of trump, he said. In the meantime, trump continues to fumble over himself. Just this week, he fired his campaign manager corey lewandowski before setting off to scotland to promote his golf resorts. \"he had one good day because he didn't vomit all over himself and gave a decent speech, \" gop consultant matt mackowiak said of trump."

Doctors are telling of a remarkable medical case in which they had to a remove a 6-foot-long tapeworm from a man's gut by pulling it through his mouth. Live science explains that the 48-year-old patient from india had been having stomach pains for two months before he decided to visit pvs memorial hospital in kerala. During a colonoscopy, doctors discovered a segment of a pork tapeworm, a common sign that a larger tapeworm is hiding elsewhere in the body. Doctors then maneuvered a camera into the man's upper intestine, where they found what dr. Cyriac philips describes as the longest tapeworm he's ever seen. The worm was curled up, but as doctors began slowly pulling it out through the patient's mouth in what must have felt like an endless scarf gag, its size became clear. In the end, it measured a little over 6 feet long, doctors write in the new england journal of medicine. The patient — who was kindly sedated during the 1.5-hour procedure — likely became infected after eating raw or undercooked pork, per the cdc. Those who have tapeworms often don't know it because they're typically symptom-free. ( a 20-foot-long tapeworm caused a man to lose 22 pounds in three days. )",

De brum urged other ministers at the talks to \" commit to commit \" to carbon-emission curbs, though they still need to decide whether developed countries will bear the brunt of the changes. As for the marshall islands, they're facing a sea-level rise of 3 to 6 feet this century, and are only 6 feet above water as it stands, so the risk is real, the telegraph reports. \" the island is not only getting narrower — it is getting shorter, \" president christopher loeak said earlier this year. \"that is our worry — the disappearing of the land. \" experts point out that commercial development and poorly built sea walls play a major role in damaging the islands, but one says that doesn't diminish the risk of rising waters — which \" will accelerate, and on the ground the response will not be pretty. \"",

A family spokesperson says wheeler was hired by a \" third party. \" fox news states an unnamed federal investigator has backed up wheeler's claims, adding he's read the emails between rich and wikileaks and rich forwarded more than 44,000 dnc emails to wikileaks. The family spokesperson says there's \" no facts \" and \" no evidence \" to support these \" unsubstantiated \" claims. The family says any reports to the contrary are baseless conspiracy theories.

            "Donald sterling's lawyer announced on wednesday, june 4, 2014, that sterling has agreed to sell the los angeles clippers for $ 2 billion to steve ballmer. Donald sterling officially announced wednesday that he, the nba and his estranged wife shelly have agreed to sell the los angeles clippers to steve ballmer for $ 2 billion and various additional benefits, sterling's lawyer told nbc news. All disputes and outstanding issues have been resolved, and the $ 1 billion lawsuit against the nba sterling filed last week has been dropped, sterling's lawyer bobby samini told nbc news. Sterling told nbc4 in an exclusive interview on tuesday he was ready to \" move on \" from the team. \" i feel fabulous, i feel very good. Everything is just the way it should be, really. It may have worked out differently, but it's good. It's all good, \" sterling said. A vote by the nba board of governors will be needed to finalize the sale. Last week, the league announced that it had canceled a hearing to oust sterling, instead moving forward to vote on the deal negotiated by his wife to sell the team. The move came on the same day sterling's attorneys filed suit in a los angeles federal court against the nba and silver,",

        "summary": "And the hits just keep on coming for the secret service: the washington examiner today reports on yet another serious lapse in security involving president obama. The latest incident occurred just two weeks ago when the president traveled to atlanta to visit the cdc — and ended up in an elevator with an armed man who has no fewer than three convictions for assault and battery. That's a lapse on two fronts, explains the washington post: anyone in such close proximity to the president is supposed to be screened for weapons and criminal history. Unbeknownst to secret service agents traveling with obama, this person had both. He was reportedly a contractor from a private security firm who was operating the elevator during the presidential visit. The man drew the attention of secret service agents when he refused to comply with orders to stop filming the president in the elevator with his smartphone. When agents questioned him afterward and then learned he had a criminal history, they called in his supervisor. The man got fired immediately and had to turn over his weapon to his boss — which is the first time the agents learned that he was armed. \"you have a convicted felon within arm's reach of the president and they never did a background check, \" says rep. Jason chaffetz, a utah republican. \"words aren't strong enough for the outrage i feel for the safety of the president and his family. \" ( the agency's director was grilled on capitol hill today and promised reform. )",

The 26-year-old woman was bar-hopping in west hollywood sunday night, and police say that at her last stop, the greystone manor nightclub, a valet asked driver frederick dencer, 32, to drive her home. Police point out that it wasn't an \" official uber assignment \" and the woman didn't use the uber app. She was also apparently too drunk to give him her address; police say dencer \" took advantage of the situation \" and allegedly drove her to a motel, the los angeles times reports. The woman woke up at 6am monday next to a shirtless dencer, who put his hand on her and wanted to have sex, police say. La weekly adds that the woman says he \" fondled her over her clothes. \" but he let her leave, and she called police from a nearby 7-eleven. She told them she did not remember how she had gotten to the motel. Surveillance footage showed she had been practically unable to walk and that dencer carried her into the room. In its official response, uber says it's \" certainly unclear that this is an uber-related incident, \" but that passenger safety is its top priority and dencer has been suspended. He faces a charge of kidnapping for the purpose of sexual assault, and his bail was set at $ 1 million. ( earlier this year, an uber driver was sued for hitting and killing a 6-year-old. )",

For one thing, the cdc says the nation has reached the epidemic stage, and while that designation usually arrives every year, it's earlier than normal. The verge notes that we didn't hit epidemic level until mid-january in the last two flu seasons. Also not helping: the number of people getting flu shots is lower than normal, and the vaccine itself is a worse match than usual for this year's strain. The mismatch means that the shot is about one-third less effective than normal, reports cbs news. \"we're already above the peak that we saw last year, and we're increasing, \" says a flu expert at the cdc, who predicts that this season's peak probably won't arrive for weeks. The agency says 22 states are now reporting high levels of the flu, up from 13 last week. Google flu trends reports much the same. One last piece of the puzzle: this year's most prevalent strain is h3n2, and h3 viruses in general tend to be the most dangerous, reports the weather channel.",

The photograph was meant to celebrate the first time the signatures of mnuchin and treasurer jovita carranza appear on the bills, which are to enter circulation next month, reports cnn money.

Both speculated that the accounts tweeting cheery reports of working for amazon were bot accounts — they all had the same \" amazon smile \" as their background image, they all had \" amazon fc ambassador \" in their account name, and their bios were all structured identically, not to mention the fact that they were all tweeting things like \" did you know that amazon pays warehouse workers 30 % more than other retailers? \" but amazon assures business insider the accounts are all run by real employees; bi pegs them as one- to two-year veterans of the company's warehouses who are now paid the same amount as other warehouse workers but whose full-time job is finding negative tweets about amazon warehouse work and countering them. \" the most important thing is that they've been here long enough to honestly share the facts based on personal experience, \" an amazon spokesperson says. \" it's important that we do a good job of educating people about the actual environment inside our fulfillment centers, and the fc ambassador program is a big part of that along with the fulfilment center tours we provide. \" there are apparently 14 such ambassadors, and in addition to tweeting about compensation, they also tackle such topics as the temperature inside the warehouses and bathroom breaks — spawning the hashtag #igowhenineedto.",

The irresponsibility, in this day and age, to exploit religious differences where none exist, is at the very least negligent and more appropriately dangerous.... The idea that someone would inflame any part of [ the ] world for the sole reason of selling papers should be criminal. \" the mail, he notes, has never seemed to care whether its stories are actually true. But \" when they put my family and my friends in harm's way, they cross far beyond just a laughable tabloid and into the arena of inciting violence. \" the mail has now apologized, the huffington post reports, and it says a \" full investigation \" has been launched.",

But now researchers have discovered that the mighty t. Rex not only sported serrated teeth, but also secret folds hidden toward the bottom of those teeth that both increased the size and strength of the serration and allowed the beast to shred the flesh of its prey, reports the washington post. \" this means that teeth could last longer in the jaw, preventing gaps from occurring in the tooth row while a new tooth is developing, allowing for a more efficient bite when piercing through the flesh of its meal, \" says the lead author of the study, which appears this week in the journal scientific reports. Her team investigated the teeth of theropods, a group of primarily carnivorous and bipedal dinosaurs like t. Rex and velociraptor, to sort out why they were cracked at the bottom. It turns out the mysterious structures were deep folds that helped the mighty beasts tear apart their prey. ( previous theories suggested these structures were signs of wear and tear. ) \" the structure is actually in all theropods, and it's not actually a crack, \" the lead researcher tells livescience. \" it's really cool that such a small, little change in the tooth structure, a small arrangement of the dental tissues, could completely change the ways these animals are living. \" ( as if the teeth weren't enough, the t. Rex's bite was likely the equivalent of this huge animal sitting on you. )",
