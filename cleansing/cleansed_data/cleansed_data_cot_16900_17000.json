( wally skalij / los angeles times ) in recent years, edc las vegas made some small but meaningful moves to put women on the main stage of its flagship event. In 2016, anna lunoe was the first female solo act to play to its biggest crowds ( alison wonderland and krewella also have appeared there solo and as part of mixed ensembles ). But this year, after debates about gender equality and inequities roiled the entertainment business, it looks likely to be another dude-heavy round on the kineticfield. Edc las vegas announced the complete lineup thursday morning for its may 18-20 flagship, with many long-familiar faces from past events: diplo, tiesto, kygo, zedd and kaskade among them ( the official stages and set-time lists have yet to be unveiled ).",

According to the store's website, the shopping experience at amazon go begins with an app customers scan on their phones to enter the store. \" then just browse and shop like you would at any other store, \" the site says. \" once you're done shopping, you're on your way! no lines, no checkout. \" rachel metz of mit technology review writes that amazon go \" might take some getting used to \" for customers. The 1,800-square-foot store uses \" computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning \" that amazon says is akin to tech found in new driverless cars. It all makes for a very hands-off experience on the part of store employees. It \" feels a little weird, \" writes metz, adding that the experience was \" seamless and quick, \" if \" unnerving \" with so little human interaction. In addition to questions about user experience, some have wondered about what sort of impact amazon go might have on the workforce. Cnbc notes that some 900,000 cashier jobs in the us are in grocery stores, all jobs that could become unnecessary should amazon's concept catch on. For now, amazon said it has no plans to implement the technology in its recently acquired whole foods stores.",

So starts seth macfarlane's ted 2, in which ted and his faithful buddy john recruit a pot-smoking lawyer to plead his case while cracking jokes about black penises. What do critics have to say? will everyone love it? definitely not, writes joe williams at the st. Louis post dispatch. But \" because one man's mirth is another man's poison, this critic can only consult his belly as the barometer. On a gut level, ted 2 is a funny film. \" one hilarious scene that sees the characters \" blaze a trail through a law library is a stoner spoof of footloose, \" he notes. Viewers might also be surprised to find some sweet moments, williams says. \" macfarlane — you know, we'd just about forgiven you for the oscars. Just. And this is how you repay us? \" asks stephen whitty at the star-ledger. In between calling him a \" shallow fratboy \" and \" terminally clueless, \" whitty pans the film as \" unbearable, \" mainly because it's absent of a decent plot and interesting characters. \" sure, macfarlane can write simple jokes as long as the ' f ' key on his laptop holds out, \" he notes. But \" most trod the same well-worn territory. \" manohla dargis is on the same page. Prepare for a \" comedy dead zone, \" she warns. \" ted 2 is insultingly lazy hack work that is worth discussing primarily because of how ( macfarlane ) tries and fails to turn race, and specifically black men, into comedy fodder, \" dargis writes at the new york times. One joke in particular in which ted compares himself to a brutalized black slave proves \" absurd, weird, and unfunny. \" yes, \" ted 2 is absurd and occasionally disgusting, \" but \" it is also wickedly funny \" and \" surprisingly earnest, \" writes rebecca keegan at the los angeles times. She admits \" the overstuffed story takes one too many detours … and the ubiquitous hasbro product placement is distracting, \" but the comedy is there.

Critics are lukewarm on it; many enjoyed neeson's performance, but many also complained about the plot, and the ending in particular. Here's what people are saying: non-stop's premise — \" a locked-room mystery at 30,000 feet \" — is great, but eventually it \" tailspins from whodunit to whydidtheybother? \" writes colin covert at the minneapolis star tribune. \" implausibilities pile up like luggage on a baggage claim carousel. … logic is the first casualty in contrived thrillers, and this script, by an undistinguished committee of writers, murders it with a thousand wounds. \" \" havoc is wreaked, guns are fired, fights break out, turbulence erupts, heads are banged, \" writes a bored moira macdonald at the seattle times. \" you wish samuel l. Jackson and some snakes might show up. \" instead, you just get a \" generic action thriller \" that \" goes exactly where you think it's going. \" manohla dargis at the new york times was fascinated by neeson's character; \" he's an excitable, volcanic wreck, which makes the state of his mental health into something of a parallel, secondary mystery. \" neeson brings to the screen a \" beauty etched by time and a still-imposing body \" that moves with \" grandeur. \" yeah, the movie makes no sense, \" but that's expected, uninteresting, and incidental. \" ty burr at the boston globe was also riveted as he tried to figure out who among the stellar cast was the bad guy. \" at a certain point, though, they have to address the question of why the bad guy, and that's where non-stop falls apart. \" the villain's motives will leave you \" scratching your head \" and the last 10 minutes are \" ridiculous enough to almost neutralize the enjoyable stupidity of everything that has gone before. \"",

        "summary": "Odds are old saint nick was happy to flee the north pole to make his annual rounds this christmas. A dirty haze has settled over this part of northern alaska, hovering over streets named santa claus lane. The new york times pins the blame on what it calls an \" only-in-alaska \" pollution problem: people use old, inefficient wood-burning stoves, and when the smoke goes out their chimneys, frigid temperatures force it back down to ground level. That results in the highest readings in the nation of a pollution measure called pm 2.5, which refers to fine-particulate matter. In fact, the area suffered a record stretch of six consecutive days earlier this month with air deemed unhealthy, reports the fairbanks news-miner. This ground-level pollution is seen as particularly dangerous because it can get directly into lungs. The dirty woodstove problem is particularly pronounced in the fairbanks-north pole area, about the size of new jersey. With cleaner natural gas in short supply and heating oil expensive, wood is the fuel of choice as temperatures hover around minus 20 below. Upgrading to a more efficient wood stove is expensive, even with local government assistance, and many independent alaskans balk at the cost — and being told what to do. ( an education campaign is trying to spread the word that upgrading is actually a wise investment, notes the frontiersman. ) failing to comply could result in residents being fined, and the borough losing federal transportation funds if the epa declares the area in violation of the clean air act. \" both sides are digging in their heels, \" mayor karl kassel tells the times.

            "And forces are now converging to heighten the tension in this seemingly unlikely pollution story. Civil fines by fairbanks north star borough — which includes the cities of fairbanks and north pole, with a total population of about 100,000 — could be assessed in coming days against residential polluters. The e.p.a. Could declare the entire area to be in \"serious \" noncompliance of the clean air act early next year, with potentially huge economic implications, including a cutoff of federal transportation funds. Some residents said they feared that an overreaching government, locally and in washington, was out to take away their stoves. Others, like dr. Olson, who works with racing sled dogs in her veterinary practice and volunteers with citizens for clean air, a local group that has sued the e.p.a. To force a decision on fairbanks pollution, said the exact opposite. The government, dr. Olson said, has been endangering public health by dragging its feet. For six consecutive days in mid-december, the air here was declared \"unhealthy, \" for high particulate content — the longest streak since the current monitoring system began in late 2015, according to the borough's air quality division. Photo \"both sides are digging in their heels, \" said the borough's mayor, karl kassel, who has been calling residents to chat about their heating systems and to urge them to upgrade, with financial help from the borough, to more efficient wood stoves. \"we have been settieng ourselves up for a crescendo. \" certainly, no one from the e.p.a. Or in local government is saying this part of alaska is universally polluted. The problem, they say, is often block by block or street by street, because in the deep cold inversions, particulate pollution settles to the lowest areas in a basin surrounded by hills. Fairbanks north star borough is about the size of new jersey, most of it wooded, wild and dazzlingly beautiful in winter. \"we have a weather problem, we have inversions here that trap air, and it's something that can't be solved, \" said lance roberts, a member of the borough assembly. Residents are also trapped, he said, by economics. Natural gas, a much cleaner fuel source, is not widely available in this part of alaska, and heating oil can be very expensive. Oil also produces particulate pollution, though less than wood. A study for the borough last year said residents here spent, on average, almost four times the national average in annual heating costs. Advertisement continue reading"

To force a decision on fairbanks pollution, said the exact opposite. The government, dr. Olson said, has been endangering public health by dragging its feet. For six consecutive days in mid-december, the air here was declared \"unhealthy, \" for high particulate content — the longest streak since the current monitoring system began in late 2015, according to the borough's air quality division. Photo \"both sides are digging in their heels, \" said the borough's mayor, karl kassel, who has been calling residents to chat about their heating systems and to urge them to upgrade, with financial help from the borough, to more efficient wood stoves. \"we have been settieng ourselves up for a crescendo. \" certainly, no one from the e.p.a. Or in local government is saying this part of alaska is universally polluted. The problem, they say, is often block by block or street by street, because in the deep cold inversions, particulate pollution settles to the lowest areas in a basin surrounded by hills. Fairbanks north star borough is about the size of new jersey, most of it wooded, wild and dazzlingly beautiful in winter. \"we have a weather problem, we have inversions here that trap air, and it's something that can't be solved, \" said lance roberts, a member of the borough assembly. Residents are also trapped, he said, by economics. Natural gas, a much cleaner fuel source, is not widely available in this part of alaska, and heating oil can be very expensive. Oil also produces particulate pollution, though less than wood. A study for the borough last year said residents here spent, on average, almost four times the national average in annual heating costs. Advertisement continue reading",

Matt hickey had offered $ 3,500 to buy ajax, but marietta officials rejected that deal, saying they would have to follow the law and sell the dog at auction because ajax was city property and could still work. They said they never intended to separate hickey from his former canine partner, and mayor joe matthews said the city council would meet thursday night to authorize a resolution that would allow hickey to keep the dog if he joined the auxiliary police. Hickey said he can't join the marietta auxiliary police because he retired in january out of health concerns and hasn't worked since july because of neck and shoulder injuries. Ohio law allows officers to purchase their k-9 partners for $ 1 when the dogs are retired. But it also says an officer who leaves a law enforcement agency while a canine or equine partner is still fit for duty forfeits the right to buy the animal. State sen. Lou gentile, a democrat from steubenville, has said he plans to introduce legislation to change",

        "summary": "Religious leaders may not like it, but the obama administration is going ahead with its plan to require religiously-affiliated nonprofits like schools and hospitals to provide employees with insurance coverage for birth control, the new york times reports. The washington post breaks down the final, slightly convoluted regulations on how it will work: the objecting organization lets its insurance provider know it won't be covering contraception; the insurer notifies employees; the insurer then covers contraceptive costs without using any premium dollars from the employer; at the end of the year, the insurer tells the government how much it spent on the contraceptives; the government pays it back plus some additional administrative costs; the government also gives the insurer a discount on obamacare exchange fees. But for-profit companies don't have the option of this exemption, and will still be required to provide coverage for contraception regardless of religious beliefs. This could prove problematic. On thursday, a federal appeals court granted hobby lobby, an arts and crafts chain with religious owners who don't want to give their employees coverage for some forms of birth control, a hearing for an injunction against the mandate, and ruled that it will not have to pay fines for failing to provide the coverage while it awaits the court date next month, the ap reports. The judge warned that companies like hobby lobby are likely to win — comparing the case to a kosher butcher not willing to employ non-kosher practices — and urged he government to come up with a solution before more companies take the fight to court.",

According to a new study, people drastically boost their alcohol consumption at that age — big surprise there — and cut their pot use at the same time. University of illinois researchers analyzed five years of data from the national survey on drug use and health, along with responses from survey participants aged 18 to 24 who estimated the number of times they'd consumed alcohol or used marijuana over the previous 30 days. Researchers found marijuana use was basically stable among people 20 years and 11 months old. But almost overnight, when people turned 21 and gained easy access to alcohol, the likelihood that they had consumed alcohol within 30 days jumped by 16 %, while pot use fell by 10 %, reports the washington post. \" nothing should change about people's preference because people don't overnight lose their preference for marijuana, \" says researcher ben crost. \" alcohol appears to be a substitute for marijuana. \" though men had higher rates of alcohol and pot use, cases of pot smoking fell 7.5 % among men and 15 % among women around age 21.

        "summary": "Ohio pot advocate don wirtshafter has been an enthusiastic smoker for nearly 50 years. But as his state heads to the polls tuesday to vote on issue 3, a constitutional amendment to legalize marijuana for both medical and recreational use, he says he won't vote for it, the new york times reports. That's because he says it's being hijacked by a group of wealthy investors — including nba legend oscar robertson, pop singer nick lachey, and a couple of president taft's descendants, per the washington post — who would create a monopoly in which only they could grow commercial cannabis in ohio. And they would certainly rake in the green, with the post citing a marijuana policies of ohio taskforce study that predicts the farms would sell $ 1.1 billion worth of pot each year. Also on tuesday's ballot: issue 2, the \" antimonopoly amendment \" that would cause a bit of a mess if it passed along with issue 3, the times notes. The ohio stump to legalize medical marijuana was already in the works under wirtshafter and the ohio rights group when political consultant ian james decided to take it a step further, the times notes. In 2014, james pulled together responsibleohio, made up of 10 investment groups who'd, by the post's figures, put up around $ 14 million each to underwrite the issue 3 campaign and set up their farms. In exchange, they'd retain all rights to grow pot in ohio. James ' \" strange bedfellows coalition \" of opponents, as the times calls it, comprises the ohioans against marijuana monopolies group, which includes lawmakers, critics who say the campaign's mascot markets pot to kids, health experts, and law enforcement. Critics also note james ' group itself is raking in more than $ 5 million, which james shrugs off. \" we have clearly taken this from the tie-dye to the suit-and-tie approach, \" he tells the times. \" right, wrong, or indifferent, this is the way legalization is moving in this country now. \" ( see what lachey has to say in his responsibleohio video. )",

The attacks highlighted the fragility of a deal agreed last week in munich for a \"cessation of hostilities \" and the impact on civilians of an unforgiving air war led by the kremlin that has helped consolidate assad's position and exacerbated the misery of the five-year conflict, driving tens of thousands out of their homes towards the turkish border.

The carnage occurred as russian-backed syrian troops intensified their push toward the rebel stronghold of aleppo. Fourteen people were killed in the town of azaz near the turkish border when missiles slammed into a school sheltering families fleeing the offensive and a children's hospital, two residents and a medic said.

Two men have since confessed to executing 17 students and depositing them in one of the graves found on saturday. Police are now attempting to identify the victims with dna samples from students'relatives. Mexican officials have yet to provide a motive for the killings, but as the students attended a teacher's college known for its left-wing activism, some say it may have been a political attack. Others say the murders were carried out by the guerreros unidos gang, which wanted extortion money. Yet another theory: that there's a connection between the vanishings and a speech the wife of iguala's mayor was to give to local dignitaries; the two occurred on the same day, the bbc reports. Officials have now begun searching for fugitive mayor jose luis abarca, his wife maria de los angeles pineda villa — whose late relatives were part of the beltrán leyva drug cartel, which formed guerreros unidos — and the local head of security.

        "summary": "A closer look at cave paintings in indonesia may redraw the map of prehistoric art and show us that the world's first artists were in africa, national geographic reports. An article in nature says that cave paintings on the indonesian island of sulawesi, once considered up to 12,000 years old, actually go back at least 39,900 years — roughly the age of the world's oldest-known cave paintings, in spain. That means early cave paintings weren't exclusive to europe, and may date to the people who first traveled from africa to southern arabia, indonesia, and australia over the past 50,000 years. \" until now, we've always believed that cave painting was part of a suite of complex symbolic behavior that humans invented in europe, \" an archaeologist tells npr. The new view: cave art developed simultaneously among different ancient peoples, or possibly started with early painters in africa. As for the indonesian art — of hand stencils and a babirusa or \" pig-deer \" — it was painted with ochre, a mineral pigment, ground into powder and blended with liquids, the guardian reports. First discovered in the 1950s, the art was dated incorrectly on the assumption that it couldn't have endured too long in tropical climes. Researchers revised that view by dating thin mineral layers that cover the cave images ( figuring the art must predate the crust, the new york times notes ). \" we've been shown here that our views have been too ' euro-centric ' about the origins of cave painting, \" says an archaeologist. \" absolutely this changes our views. \" ( seems neanderthals may have created art, too. )",

        "summary": "Prior to today, the official scientific answer to the question, \" how many scents can the human nose detect? \" was a measly 10,000. But now, thanks to a new study in science, the answer is 1 trillion, give or take. Researchers had long assumed that the first number, based on relatively rudimentary tests in the 1920s, was way off the mark, and the new study is the first significant one to apply modern methods to revise it, reports nature. The 1 trillion figure is seen as an average, with some people able to detect as \" few \" as 80 million odors and others able to pick up on a mind-boggling \" thousand trillion \" of them, according to the scientists ' extrapolations. \"ten thousand is kind of pathetic — it's a pretty low number, \" says molecular neurobiologist leslie voshall of the rockefeller university, a co-author of the study. \"it led to the idea that humans have a comparatively low sense of smell. \" for their experiment, the scientists used \" a procedure similar to a hearing exam, in which listeners must try to distinguish between two tones, \" explains the washington post. Researchers combined 128 different odor molecules to create composite scents of varying complexity, then ran them by 26 test subjects.

            "A new study suggests climate change could pose trouble for picturesque walden pond and one way to stave it off could be asking swimmers to resist the urge to urinate, which provides nutrients to microorganisms that can choke the pond. It will be \"prudent to further reduce the flow of anthropogenic nutrients to walden pond under the warmer, wetter conditions that most climate models project for new england during the 21st century, \" said the study, which was published in the journal plos one. The study suggested that swimmers be asked to refrain from urinating in the pond and that perhaps a swimming pool could be constructed as an alternative swimming spot.

            "Recent shifts in the ecological condition of walden pond, ma, are of potentially wide interest due to the lake's importance as a cultural, historical, and recreational resource in addition to its scientific value as an indicator of local and global environmental change. Algal microfossils in six sediment cores document changes in hydroclimate and trophic status of the lake during the last 1800 years and extend two previous sediment core records of shorter length. Low percentages of planktonic diatoms in the longest cores ( wal-3, wal-15 ) indicate shallowing and/or greater water clarity associated with a relatively arid interval during the medieval climate anomaly, ca. A.d. 1150 – 1300, cultural eutrophication of the lake since the a.d. 1920s caused diatoms in the genera asterionella and synedra to increase in relative abundance at the expense of cyclotella, discostella, and the chrysophyte alga mallomonas allorgei. Percentages of asterionella and synedra have remained fairly stable",

Kato is not the first to make this kind of observation. Former health minister hakuo yanagisawa in 2007 suggested that women were \"birth-giving machines \" who have a responsibility to have children, according to the guardian. Kato's comments touched a nerve in japan where birthrates have been declining for decades. Currently, only 12.3 % of the population is under age 15, down 170,000 from last year. \" this is exactly sexual harassment, \" said one female lawmaker. Amid similar criticism, kato retracted the statement and said he did not intend to disrespect women, reports the japan times. Among 32 countries with a population of 40 million or more, japan came in dead last for the percentage of children in the overall population, a un study found. There may be several things playing into the low birth rate. Although women have been criticized for choosing careers over children, some say that japan's birth rate may be caused by a lack of good jobs for young men, who are postponing marriage until they can afford a family. In japan, men are traditionally expected to be the breadwinner. Others say the problem is simpler. The independent reports that nearly a third of young adults in japan enter their 30s without any sexual experience.",

Speaking with nbc news, 25-year-old myriam aitboulahcen — who last spoke with her sister at the beginning of november — says police \" gave me no information \" on hasna's alleged role in the terror attacks, but she adds hasna, 26, \" did not grow up in a stable home. She was not happy in her life. She was sad. \" hasna was raised largely in foster care, afp reports, and friends say the moroccan immigrant's daughter was a party girl who drank and used drugs. \" she was unstable, she created her own bubble, \" her brother says. \" she wasn't looking to study religion, i have never even seen her open a koran. \" then, about six months ago, she became radicalized, he says. \" she started by wearing a jilbab ( which covers the whole body except the face ) and then she moved on to the niqab ( full-face veil ), \" he told afp. \" she spent all her time on her smartphone, on facebook and whatsapp. \" on social media in june, hasna posted a photo of herself in full muslim garb. \" soon i will go to syria, god willing, \" she wrote, per the new york times. She never made the trip. Initially identified as western europe's first female suicide bomber after the raid in saint-denis, authorities now say hasna was killed when a man detonated an explosive vest nearby. Authorities say she first yelled, \" help me! \" in a failed attempt to trap officers, then opened fire with a kalashnikov.",

The article details trump's own records purges, which included \" systematically [ destroying ] or [ hiding ] thousands of emails, digital records, and paper documents... Often in defiance of court orders. \" eichenwald's research points to deception on trump's part going back to at least 1973, when eichenwald says trump, his father, and their real estate company used a \" deny, impede, and delay \" strategy — which included destroying court-requested documents — during a case in which they were accused of discriminating against african americans in their rental units. Eichenwald notes trump's \" nonsensical \" attempts to delay that case, including at least one affidavit that was proven to be a \" lie. \" but one fact eichenwald dubs \" shocking \" emerged in a deposition by trump himself: not only did the trumps not have a system to retain company records — they'd been actively destroying records for the past six months, via shredder and the trash can, to \" save space. \" the case was closed in 1982 after a \" slow death \" due to lack of evidence and because the desegregation consent decree signed by trump had expired, per the new york times. Similar subterfuge took place in another court case that began in 2005, when a trump company sued two native american casinos. False documents were filed by trump's camp, and his lawyers revealed \" the company wiped clear the data from everyone's computers every year, \" leading the judge in the case to react with \" near disbelief. \" trump ended up eventually dropping the case.

In each instance, trump and entities he controlled also erected numerous hurdles that made lawsuits drag on for years, forcing courtroom opponents to spend huge sums of money in legal fees as they struggled — sometimes in vain — to obtain records. This behavior is of particular import given trump's frequent condemnations of hillary clinton, his democratic opponent, for having deleted more than 30,000 emails from a server she used during her time as secretary of state. While clinton and her lawyers have said all of those emails were personal, trump has suggested repeatedly on the campaign trail that they were government documents clinton was trying to hide and that destroying them constituted a crime.

But an investigation by the new york times — drawing on decades-old files from the new york city commission on human rights, internal justice department records, court documents and interviews with tenants, civil rights activists and prosecutors — uncovered a long history of racial bias at his family's properties, in new york and beyond. That history has taken on fresh relevance with mr. Trump arguing that black voters should support him over hillary clinton, whom he has called a bigot. While there is no evidence that mr. Trump personally set the rental policies at his father's properties, he was on hand while they were in place, working out of a cubicle in trump management's brooklyn offices as early as the summer of 1968. Then and now, mr. Trump has steadfastly denied any awareness of any discrimination at trump properties. While mr. Trump declined to be interviewed for this article, his general counsel, alan garten, said in a statement that there was \"no merit to the allegations. \" and there has been no suggestion of racial bias toward prospective residents in the luxury housing that mr.

Dr. Edward ratush bills himself an \"addiction psychiatrist \" who deals with \"opiate dependence and treatment-resistant depression. \" the rutgers university-trained psychiatrist isn't shy about alternative therapies: he offers trans-cranial magnetic stimulation — magnetic fields that stimulate nerve cells in the brain — and is \"interested \" in \"spiritual interventions \" for addicts, according to his linkedin profile. The profile also says ratush \"looks forward to his involvement in research using psychedelic drugs to treat addiction. \" love, who has a recurring role in fox's hit show, \"empire, \" could not be reached for comment.",

Edward ratush filed suit against the hole frontwoman at manhattan supreme court earlier this month, claiming she owes $ 48,250 for her sessions with him, according according to the new york post. The lawsuit is the second time ratush has taken legal action against love in a bid to recoup the cash he claims she owes - he previously filed suit last year accusing love of breach of contract and unjust enrichment for failing to pay up."

        "summary": "Hoo-boy. The new york post ran a story wednesday titled \" why i won't date hot women anymore \" featuring an interview with a 40-year-old private equity executive who boasts he \" could have [ anyone ] i wanted. \" dan rochkind says he used to go on multiple dates a week with \" 20-something blond models, \" but he eventually realized these hot women were all \" flighty, selfish, and vapid. \" they were \" full of themselves \" and \" couldn't carry a conversation, \" he adds. And that's why he's now engaged to a 30-year-old woman, despite the fact that she's a \" softer beauty \" who's far too short to be a runway model. Understandably, people had some strong feelings on the article. Here are some of them: new york says the article is the post's \" greatest troll yet, \" ably accomplishing the paper's usual goal of angering the internet for a day or two. A hot woman responds on jezebel while \" crying hot tears from my hot hot eyes \" because she can no longer date the \" average-looking, uninteresting man \" from the article. It only gets more brutal from there. A reporter for the wisconsin state journal sums up the story on twitter: \" pretty women are terrible and stupid and all men are great and smart. \" the huffington post, which sarcastically refers to rochkind as a hero, rounds up some of the other great twitter reactions to the piece. Rochkind's fiancee, carly spindel, doesn't appear too pleased with the article, accusing the post on instagram of \" making me look beyond unattractive. \" spindel's mom, who runs a matchmaking site and set up rochkind with her daughter, called out what she saw as some of the article's flaws in an interview with the boston globe. ( \" my daughter is gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. \" ) finally, the mary sue offers its own list of reasons not to date hot women, including that hot women have scary strong arms from taking selfies all the time; may actually be statues brought to life rather than merely statuesque; and, of course, cooties.",

The possible nerve damage the mom of three suffered during that operation now leads people she's just met in her hometown of rosenberg to ask her, \" hey, where are you from? \" when she converses with them, even though she was born and raised in the lone star state and is of mexican heritage, ktrk notes. Experts at houston methodist sugar land hospital say alamia is one of only about 100 people who've been diagnosed with the odd speech disorder over the past century or so, which is usually caused by a brain injury or stroke, though it has been linked to other conditions as well, per cbs news. Alamia's husband, richard, was the first to notice her accent — which the ap notes \" swings between various british accents and a faint australian twang \" — after her december surgery. \" i said,'doctor is that normal for her voice? ' he said, ' oh ya. It will go away in a couple of days, ' \" he tells ktrk. His wife's neurologist reviewed her surgical report to see if there had been complications ( there hadn't ), then ran a slew of tests, only to come up with foreign accent syndrome. \" i'd read about it and heard about, but i never thought i'd see it, \" he says, adding, \" most neurologists work their entire careers and never come across [ this ]. \" although some medical experts say it can be difficult for patients to adjust to their new \" identity, \" alamia is going to speech therapy but has made her peace with her new voice — even if it never goes away. \" the accent doesn't define who i am, \" she says. \" i ' m still the same person i was before surgery; i just talk differently. \" ( an oregon woman came out of dental surgery sounding part irish, part south african and … part transylvanian. )",

        "summary": "Saturday is a big day for the presidential hopefuls from both parties, with hillary clinton and bernie sanders facing off in the nevada democratic caucuses and donald trump taking on all challengers in the south carolina republican primary. How both of those events play out could have major impacts on the rest of the race. Here are six things you need to know: both clinton and sanders have a lot to lose in nevada, nbc news reports. A clinton loss \" would launch another week's worth of negative headlines for her campaign, \" while \" a sanders loss could even be more impactful because it would set up hillary clinton to start running the table \" in the south. The washington post believes the gop side is turning into a three-man race in south carolina and beyond. Ted cruz and marco rubio have been \" attempting to position themselves as the main alternative to trump, \" but \" trump is still the biggest attraction of all, dominating the polls and attracting huge crowds wherever he goes. \" clinton made a serious mistake when \" she failed to take bernie sanders serious enough, \" allowing him to close the gap in nevada, the los angeles times reports. Now even a narrow victory over sanders in nevada \" could raise strong doubts about [ her ] candidacy. \" nbc notes that while trump has had the lead in south carolina polls for months, its no longer looking insurmountable. His 16-point lead from last month has crumbled to 5 points in one recent poll. Usa today highlights five questions, the answers to which will determine the way the nevada caucuses go. One of the major questions is whether turnout will be small enough and — especially — diverse enough to deliver a win for clinton. \" if she loses nevada because — horror of horrors — the caucus voters looked more like new hampshire and iowa, clinton will have to look in the mirror. Or at her field operatives. \" finally, things aren't looking good for jeb bush ( not to mention john kasich and ben carson ), according to politico. Morale is down in the bush camp, with even his biggest supporters believing \" saturday might be the end. \" donors are reportedly ready \" to intervene and tell bush, depending on his finish here saturday night, that his time is up \" after a week one describes as \" a kick in the balls. \"",

As they'd theorized, when participants were given naltrexone before listening to their favorite songs, their emotional responses to the music were muted.

The nsa's aggressive efforts to shut down security leaks in the wake of the edward snowden controversy have spooked government officials in their media dealings since \" any interaction — any email, any phone call — risks leaving a digital trace that could subsequently be used against them, \" the report explains, as per reuters. More than 90 journalists and attorneys, as well as a handful of \" present or retired national security officials, \" were questioned for the human rights watch and aclu report. The ap adds that journalists are trying to sneak under the reporting radar by using cheapo prepaid cell phones, encrypting electronic messages, and arranging face-to-face meetings instead of phone calls. More disturbing, however, may be the violation of americans ' civil rights — something the report hopes can be fended off with better protection for journalists and more transparency about data collection, the ap notes. \" the us holds itself out as a model of freedom and democracy, but its own surveillance programs are threatening the values it claims to represent, \" one of the report's authors says.",

The unnamed woman has been charged with attempted murder after the child was found early yesterday by cyclists who heard a noise emanating from the drain; seven people managed to removed the concrete lid and access the infant, the sydney morning herald reports. The sydney-area woman was arrested hours later, having been located via hospital records by police who went door to door in the area, reports the bbc; the baby was found in what looked like a hospital-issue blanket, and \" the umbilical cord had been cut and had been clamped so there appears to have been some sort of medical intervention since his birth, \" per a local police inspector. Court documents state she \" made full admissions to putting the less than 24-hour-old baby down a [ nearly 8-foot ] drain knowing it may kill the baby. \" police believe the child was born monday and deposited in the drain the next day, meaning the boy may have survived an incredible five days without food, notes the bbc. The baby is reported to be in stable condition. A cyclist who was among the first on the scene described the baby as having plastic \" cushioning \" around his body: \" i think that saved the baby. \" the morning herald talks to a pediatrician who explains how the child managed to survive so long without food: a mother's milk often doesn't come in until the fourth day, and so babies are born with reserves of fluid and glucose. Still, \" what was surprising was that the baby had a vigorous cry after five days. He wouldn't have lasted much longer. \"",

It involves a teenage girl at the thomas jefferson high school for science and technology in virginia, one of the nation's top high schools — the kind of place where students shoot to be accepted into all eight ivy schools, notes the washington post. In this case, the girl told her parents and friends that she had been accepted into harvard and stanford, both of whom were so desperate to have her that they created a one-of-a-kind program in which she would attend each school for two years. She said mark zuckerberg personally called her to push harvard. She produced acceptance letters and fawning emails from ivy administrators and teachers. Not a word of it was true, but her unsuspecting parents spread the word to equally unsuspecting news outlets in south korea. She became briefly famous as \" genius girl. \" but finally, the lies caught up with her, thanks in part to questions raised by her skeptical classmates, followed by disavowals from the two schools, reports the south's yonhap news agency. Her father has since written a public apology to south korea's media. \" i am sincerely sorry for causing trouble with what is not true, \" he wrote. \" i am deeply repentant that i failed to watch properly over how painful and difficult a situation the child has been in so far and that i even aggravated and enlarged her suffering. \" the story caught fire because it \" had every element that can excite koreans — the success of a korean abroad and acceptance into prestigious universities, \" says a communications professor in the country.
