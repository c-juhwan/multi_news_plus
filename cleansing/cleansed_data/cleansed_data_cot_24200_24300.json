        "summary": "Scientists claim neanderthals were doomed by everything from climate change to their big eyes. A new study offers a different theory: humans were at least partly responsible. Uk researchers say humans who migrated out of africa were \" reservoirs of tropical disease \" and may have infected neanderthals across europe with tapeworm, tuberculosis, a bacterium causing stomach ulcers, and the herpes virus. For neanderthals who had adapted to the diseases of europe, \" exposure to new pathogens carried out of africa may have been catastrophic, \" study author charlotte houldcroft says, per the university of cambridge. \" however, it is unlikely to have been similar to columbus bringing disease into america and decimating native populations. It's more likely that small bands of neanderthals each had their own infection disasters, weakening the group and tipping the balance against survival. \" experts generally believe infectious disease exploded around 8,000 years ago when the adoption of agriculture allowed humans to settle in groups with livestock, per the international business times. However, an analysis of pathogen genomes and dna from ancient bones suggests some diseases have been \" co-evolving with humans and our ancestors for tens of thousands to millions of years, \" according to the study in the american journal of physical anthropology. Tuberculosis, for example, has long been thought to have reached humans through livestock. But the evidence suggests \" environmental bacteria were the likely ancestors of many pathogens that caused disease during the advent of agriculture, and that they initially passed from humans into their animals, \" houldcroft says. Since neanderthals were hominins, human diseases likely passed to them easily, especially during interbreeding. ( blame neanderthals for your allergies. )",

            "A new study suggests that neanderthals across europe may well have been infected with diseases carried out of africa by waves of anatomically modern humans, or homo sapiens. As both were species of hominin, it would have been easier for pathogens to jump populations, say researchers. This might have contributed to the demise of neanderthals. Researchers from the universities of cambridge and oxford brookes have reviewed the latest evidence gleaned from pathogen genomes and dna from ancient bones, and concluded that some infectious diseases are likely to be many thousands of years older than previously believed. There is evidence that our ancestors interbred with neanderthals and exchanged genes associated with disease. There is also evidence that viruses moved into humans from other hominins while still in africa. So, the researchers argue, it makes sense to assume that humans could, in turn, pass disease to neanderthals, and that – if we were mating with them – we probably did. Dr charlotte houldcroft, from cambridge's division of biological anthropology, says that many of the infections likely to have passed from humans to neanderthals – such as tapeworm, tuberculosis, stomach ulcers and types of herpes – are chronic diseases that would have weakened the hunter-gathering neanderthals, making them less fit and able to find food, which could have catalysed extinction of the species. \"humans migrating out of africa",

Prosecutors'decision to spare him of criminal charges, an attorney who oversaw the federal investigation said on tuesday. The statement by andré birotte, the u.s. Attorney based in los angeles, follows armstrong's confession in a televised interview last month. \" we made a decision on that case a little over a year ago. Obviously, we've been well aware of the statements that have been made by mr. Armstrong in other media reports. That does not change my view at this time, \" birotte said at a news conference in washington to announce an unrelated lawsuit against standard &amp; poor's. The government will continue to look at the case, birotte added, but armstrong's admission \" hasn't changed our view as i stand here today. \" in february 2012, birotte said his office had closed its investigation into possible crimes by armstrong. Speculation about charges began anew after armstrong reversed his past doping denials in an interview with talk show host oprah winfrey. He told winfrey he used performance-enhancing drugs"

        "summary": "Apple tried to hold onto the full $ 548 million in damages it recouped from samsung in a lawsuit over smartphone design patents, but it looks like it may now have to settle for much less, based on a tuesday supreme court decision, the hill reports. The ruling noted that even though apple's 2011 complaint accused samsung of ripping off the look of the iphone for its own devices ( including the \" rectangular front face with rounded edges \" ), as well as how the grid that shows app icons is presented, apple couldn't collect on damages on total profits samsung took in for its phones overall ( apple had originally been awarded more than $ 1 billion by a jury in 2012, but that number was whittled down. ) and it all came down to three words, per justice sonia sotomayor, who wrote the court's 8-0 opinion, per reuters, which notes the high court almost never hears design patent cases. According to section 289 of the us patent act, the \" article of manufacture \" term used in patent law is meant to cover both the entire product that a consumer can buy, as well as individual elements, or components, of that product. The ruling points out that when an item is just one component ( e.g., a dinner plate ), it's easy to apply this law, but for a multi-component item such as a smartphone, it becomes trickier. The supreme court disagreed with the appeals court's ruling that the smartphone as a whole was the only way \" article of manufacture \" could be interpreted, instead deciding that design infringement ( and therefore damages ) could be parsed into separate components. The supreme court's decision overturned the appeals court's ruling for $ 399 million awarded to apple, but fortune notes the case is now being sent back to the lower court to decide how much apple's patents really merit.

She went on to reprise the role several times during the course of the season, even appearing in the streets of manhattan riding a mobile version of the press-room podium, before spicer resigned from his post in july. Mccarthy's spicer impression was popular, though apparently not in the white house. After her first appearance, politico reported that president trump wasn't happy with the portrayal, less because the impression lampooned spicer's now-infamous casual relationship with facts than that it was performed by a woman. Meanwhile, dave chapelle won the award for outstanding guest actor in a comedy series for his turn hosting snl after the november election. The major emmy ceremony takes place this sunday, and entertainment weekly has a preview.",

As the guardian reports, the attack on one is believed to have frightened the 209 others, who sailed over a 650-foot cliff in an apparent bid to flee. That cliff sits on the border with spain, and most of the recovered bodies — 169 — were found in the spanish village lladorre; the rest ended up on the french side of the border. Bear fur was found on one of the bodies, and the local reports that an analysis of it does point to a bear prompting the scare, which came almost exactly a year after more than 130 sheep died similarly. The french government, which has been reintroducing brown bears to the pyrenees for the last 20 years or so after hunters completely depleted the native population, will compensate the farmer. A local branch of the french farmers ' federation is furious nonetheless. Sheep breeders have previously protested the presence of bears and wolves, which they say threaten their flocks and livelihood. The current estimate suggests there are 35 brown bears inhabiting the pyrenees. Last year, one was found with a gunshot wound to the chest in northern spain, though it enjoys protected status there.

Bush a favorable rating, up from just 33 % when the former president left office in 2009. The rise in popularity comes entirely from democrats and independents: some 54 % of democrats now give bush a thumbs-up, compared to just 11 % in 2009. Bush's approval rating among republicans has fluctuated over the years, but it now stands at 76 %, the same as when he left office. The poll, conducted by ssrs, found that barack obama has a 66 % favorable rating, while president trump is well below both ex-presidents at 40 %, much of the shift in bush's popularity comes from nonwhite voters and people under 35, groups that tended to give him low marks during his presidency, the hill notes. Bush has given several speeches widely seen as criticisms of trumpism. \" bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication, \" he said in a speech last fall. \" bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone, provides permission for cruelty and bigotry, and compromises the moral education of children. \" in the cnn poll, 59 % said trump's actions and statements since becoming president have caused them to lose confidence in his ability to govern, though 49 % still approve of his handling of the economy.",

        "summary": "The oldest calendar known to exist was created some 5,000 years ago in mesopotamia — but it's looking positively youthful in the face of a new find in northern scotland. A dig at warren field in aberdeenshire in 2004 is just now giving up its secrets, with archaeologists revealing that a series of 12 pits found there may in fact be the world's oldest calendar. They believe the stone age-era pits each acted as a stand-in for a calendar month, with the 12 collectively representing a year. Additionally, the pits may have collectively represented a single lunar month, and their varied depths in the 165-foot arc-shaped row indicate that time period was split into what the independent calls three \" weeks \" — waxing, full, and waning. The australian calls out two notable aspects of the pits: for one, scotland's prehistoric hunter-gatherer tribes have long been considered \" civilization's late starters \"; the find somewhat unravels that belief. Second, their calendar took into account \" lunar drift \"; because lunar months don't precisely align with the passage of a year, most early calendars tracked only the former. But these pits would have been able to reveal the arrival of the midwinter solstice and, with it, the year's end, a further indication of the people's sophistication. A neat side note from the bbc: the warren field site was identified as one worth investigating via odd crop marks seen from above by the country's royal commission on the ancient and historical monuments.",

Created by stone age britons some 10,000 years ago, archaeologists believe that the complex of pits was designed to represent the months of the year and the lunar phases of the month. They believe it also allowed the observation of the mid-winter sunrise – in effect the birth of the new year – so that the lunar calendar could be annually re-calibrated to bring it back into line with the solar year. Remarkably the monument was in use for some 4,000 years – from around 8,000bc ( the early mesolithic period ) to around 4,000bc ( the early neolithic ). The pits were periodically re-cut – probably dozens of times, possibly hundreds of times – over those four millennia. It is therefore impossible to know whether or not they originally held timber posts or standing stones after they were first dug 10,000 years ago.

Goldman sachs capital partners — a group that manages and invests for pensions, sovereign wealth funds and other prominent clients — was given the initial opportunity to invest $ 450 million in facebook, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Chip east/bloomberg news goldman gives the $ 20.3 billion fund the \"first look \" on many investment opportunities. While most of the group's clients are big institutions, the investors also include current and former goldman partners. But the unit's chief, richard a. Friedman, a longtime goldman partner, decided the facebook deal was not suitable for his clients, in part owing to the high valuation and to a mismatch with his investment criteria. The $ 450 million investment values the web company at $ 50 billion. After goldman's deal, some industry experts cautioned that facebook's growth would need to accelerate rapidly over the next couple of years to justify such a steep price — a risk with many brand-name technology upstarts. Last year, facebook recorded revenue of approximately $ 2 billion",

Recent reports suggest that the social-networking giant has been valued at $ 50 billion. Meanwhile, the company's growth path looks like that of google's around the time of its ipo in august 2004, when it soon went on to reach the same valuation. The interest, amounting to several billion dollars in an equity offering likely to be no more than $ 1.5 billion, is a sign of investor fascination with the closely held social-networking company despite a dearth of available information about its operations and financial condition.

        "summary": "A medieval mystery sword found nearly 40 years ago in siberia belonged to the notorious ivan the terrible, if a rather colorful theory can be believed. Scholars have long wondered how the 12th-century blade — which looks central european by design and was later adorned with norse runes and a silver handle in sweden — ended up in siberia, where no such sword has ever been discovered, the siberian times reports via io9. Enter russian archaeologist vyacheslav molodin, who suspects that ivan, a russian tsar, somehow owned the sword and gave it to a legendary warrior who took part in russia's conquest of siberia. \" i am not sure that i am right, imagining all this, but the legend is really beautiful, \" says molodin of his moment-by-moment account of a fight between the cossacks and tatar forces in 1584. Molodin suggests the warrior, ivan koltso, led a cossack detachment against \" crowds of enemies... In his hands, the glittering giant sword. \" he believes koltso might have made it to his horse, but \" behind him they chase, with arrows flying. And then, suddenly, the sword falls out of the hands of the hero and drops to the ground under a young birch tree. \" it lay there for 391 years, until a team including molodin would find it under a few inches of soil. He admits that his theory isn't too popular, but notes that cossacks did use swords then despite having sabres and firearms, and koltso is believed to have died nearby. True or not, molodin's theory touches on the importance of gift-giving in middle age cultures and the fact that medieval artifacts often have \" long and complicated histories, \" reports new historian.

Fed chairman ben bernanke is widely expected to announce a third round of bond-buying to pump cash into the system, a move known as \" quantitative easing, \" the ap reports. Last month, bernanke called persistently high unemployment \" a grave concern \" that inflicts \" enormous suffering \" and said the previous two rounds of easing had created 2 million jobs. But a new stimulus this close to a presidential election is sure to anger conservatives, and could result in moves to limit the fed's authority. Another round of bond-buying would be \" another shovel full of dirt as the fed digs its own grave as a politically independent institution, \" an economics professor tells the los angeles times. The most recent precedent is alan greenspan's decision to cut the fed's benchmark interest rate to its lowest level in decades in september 1992, the new york times reports.

            "Washington — federal reserve chairman ben s. Bernanke is poised to roll out another stimulus program — and risk the wrath of conservative critics.bernanke and his central bank colleagues gather wednesday for a pivotal two-day session fresh off last week's disappointing jobs report, the latest in a string of signs that the economic recovery is faltering.and with europe, china and other nations taking steps to bolster their struggling economies in the face of a global slowdown, washington and wall street expect the fed to unveil plans for a third round of its controversial bond-buying program when the meeting ends thursday.economists said the move could help boost the economy if the fed focuses its efforts on the slowly improving housing market. By buying mortgage-backed securities, it could edge down already historically low borrowing rates.lower rates also could make banks more likely to lend because it would be easier to sell the loans to the fed and avoid risks of losses",
            "Washington — in september 1992, the federal reserve culminated a long-running effort to stimulate the sluggish economy by cutting its benchmark interest rate to 3 percent, the lowest level it had reached in almost three decades. The cut was avidly sought by the administration of president george h. W. Bush, but it was not enough to change the course of the presidential election. Years later, mr. Bush told an interviewer that the fed's chairman, alan greenspan, had cost him a second term by failing to act more quickly and more forcefully. \"i reappointed him and he disappointed me, \" mr. Bush said. On thursday, the federal reserve is poised to announce that it will once again seek to stimulate the economy in the middle of a presidential election season. Fed officials insist that they do not consider politics in setting policy. But the imminence of the election makes it inevitable",

        "summary": "More details have emerged about a traveling american family's escape from a boat that was hijacked by river pirates in brazil — including the fact that they apparently escaped after the pirates departed. Authorities in the northern state of para say adam and emily harteau and daughters colette, 6, and sierra, 3, are being treated in the city of breves for insect bites and dehydration after spending three days hiding in the jungle after leaving the boat, the wall street journal reports. They say the family and their volkswagen van were on a barge that was hijacked in a dangerous amazon delta area by pirates who abandoned the vessel after seizing goods including the family's cell phones. Crew members were eventually able to call police, but the harteaus had vanished by the time they turned up. Police say the harteaus have told them they were worried about their safety so they hid in the jungle with some food and water — and the surfboard they had left the barge on. Villagers reportedly found them on the surfboard, initially thought to have been driftwood, and contacted a passenger boat that picked them up. Para deputy secretary of public safety andre cunha has told local media that he's not entirely sure why they left the boat, but they may have been worried about police because of the small amount of marijuana that was found in their van, the los angeles times reports. Officials say the amount was too small for charges to be considered. The family plans to return to california soon after having been on the road since 2012, documenting their travels in the blog our open road.",

            "Storyville: zero days 9pm, bbc four in the week that sees the inauguration of the usa's 45th president, the news remains awash with stories about various prongs of cyberwar. Recently, most attention has been given to the allegations concerning russian interference in the 2016 us election: the hacking of the democratic party and leaking of damaging information; and the state-sponsored creation of fake newsites spreading false stories similarly detrimental to hilary clinton's campaign. Unsettling as this activity is, it's just the digital-age spin on the age-old black arts of spying and propaganda. More alarming, however, is the potential for \"hard \" cyberwarfare: attacks that go beyond hacks and misinformation, to directly disrupt the physical world – sabotage by software that can shut things down, blow things up, take actual lives. This is the stuff of hollywood techno-thrillers, of course. But, as zero days, a disturbing documentary by the prolific alex gibney, spells out in clear detail, it has also been our reality for at least seven years. Gibney's film raises several troubling issues, but its specific subject is the stuxnet virus, a malware first spotted in the wild by an",

        "summary": "If the united states geological service's reading of a magnitude 2.0 earthquake in michigan on tuesday night wasn't enough to convince you that a meteor did in fact streak through the sky there, let marc fries. The nasa scientist says he managed to track the meteorites ( those are the pieces of rock that end up on the ground after a meteor enters earth's atmosphere ) down by using weather radar data, pinpointing them to the lakeland and hamburg areas in livingston county. He explains to the detroit free press that the radars are pointed downward, versus at the sky, but the rocks \" are reflective and they will show up in radar images \" as they fall past the radar. In fact, he has even published a study on that very idea: \" doppler weather radar as a meteorite recovery tool. \" he provided this map that shows the radar reflections, which occurred between altitudes of 1.2 miles to 1.8 miles. As the title of his study suggests, the meteorites \" can be collected \" he says; because it wasn't a windy night, the meteorites should be on the ground beneath the reflection points. The ap talks to another nasa scientist, bill cooke with the meteoroid environment office, who says the meteor measured six feet wide and had the power of 100 tons of tnt when it exploded in our atmosphere. He says it was traveling at about 28,000mph, but don't be impressed: \" for a meteor this is about as slow as it gets. \" and on the smaller side: the ap points out the meteor that rocked chelyabinsk, russia, in 2013 was 10 times as wide. A half-ton meteorite was recovered months later from a russian lake.",

Billy forbus of montgomery, ala., tells wsfa he shot the snake, separating its head from the body, after finding it in his garden, then put the body in his truck bed. But when he returned an hour later with a grabber tool, hoping to show the reptile to his dad and brother, he found the snake was acting far from dead. The video shows it slithering away before suddenly striking out, knocking the tool out of forbus ' hand. \" we pretty much decided to just to leave him alone after that, \" forbus says. \" that thing had no head, and anywhere i walked around this truck and touched him, he knew where i was coming from. \" forbus should perhaps consider himself lucky. Last month, a texas man needed 26 doses of antivenom, and still nearly died, after he was bit by the head of a rattlesnake he'd decapitated with a shovel, per global news. This sort of thing actually happens pretty often as snakes retain their bite reflexes hours after death, per national geographic. \" it comes down to them being cold-blooded, \" a wildlife expert tells wsfa. \" they don't really need that much oxygen to begin with so that energy can stay … longer in them than it would us. \" that applies to a snake's venom glands, as well as the rest of its body, even when decapitated. \" the other half continues to work.

The telegraph reports four \" famous french cartoonists \" are among the dead, and the wall street journal identifies two of them as jean cabut ( known as cabu ) and editor stéphane charbonnier, who goes by charb. The guardian reports charb's life had previously been threatened, and he lived under police protection. President francois hollande, who quickly arrived on the scene, called it an \" an exceptional act of barbarism, \" per the guardian; he noted that france has prevented several other attacks \" in recent weeks. \" contento says the magazine had upped its security recently due to an uptick in threats. Meanwhile, the ap reports that with the gunmen still at large, paris is at its highest alert; security has been ramped up at various locations, including houses of worship and media offices. The satirical weekly has drawn repeated threats for its caricatures of the prophet mohammed, among other controversial sketches. ( the bbc notes that its last tweet, an hour ago, was a cartoon of isis honcho abu bakr al-baghdadi. ) in november 2011 its offices were firebombed after it made the prophet mohammed a \" guest editor \"; in response, the magazine published an issue whose cover depicted an image of a muslim planting a kiss on a figure meant to represent charlie hebdo.

The $ 244 million test was the first since 2014, according to nbc news. It was conducted amid increased worry of a potential nuclear attack from north korea. Despite tuesday's success, there are many questions surrounding the viability of the gmd system during an actual attack. Only nine of the previous 17 tests since 1999 had been successful, reuters reports. And that's with tests being scripted for success: daytime launches with personnel informed of the target's launch time, size, speed, and trajectory. It's also possible north korea could use decoys to trick the system; the gmd's interceptor rockets haven't been tested against decoys. A pentagon spokesperson says the gmd system is just one way the pentagon has of shooting down a potential north korean missile. The gmd system has cost us taxpayers more than $ 40 billion so far.",

The u.s. Military fired an icbm-type missile from the kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands toward the waters just south of alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from vandenberg air force base in california.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / updated by courtney kube, andrew rafferty and the associated press washington — the pentagon successfully tested a u.s. Long-range interceptor missile over the pacific ocean on tuesday in an exercise aimed at helping gauge american readiness to counter a potential threat from north korea. During the test, the pentagon's missile defense agency launched an interceptor rocket from an underground silo at vandenberg air force base in california. The interceptor hit and destroyed an intercontinental-range missile fired from a test site on kwajalein atoll in the pacific, the pentagon announced. U.s. Missile defense agency director vice adm. Jim syring called the test a \" critical milestone \" in a statement. \" this system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat.

            "Washington/vandenberg air force base, calif. ( reuters ) - the u.s. Military on tuesday cheered a successful, first-ever missile defense test involving a simulated attack by an intercontinental ballistic missile, in a major milestone for a program meant to defend against a mounting north korean threat. The u.s. Military fired an icbm-type missile from the kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands toward the waters just south of alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from vandenberg air force base in california. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The missile defense agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated icbm for the ground-based midcourse defense ( gmd ), managed by boeing co ( ba.n ), and hailed it as an \"incredible accomplishment. \" \"this system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat, \" vice admiral jim syring, director of the agency, said in a statement.

Us soldiers are referred to as \" perverted animals \" in the video, with pics of both us and south korean forces also flashed across the screen, business insider reports. Urgent-sounding female narration is accompanied by militaristic music in the nearly three-minute video, which was released by the state-controlled uriminzokkiri website. About midway through the footage, a still shot of what appears to be the uss carl vinson is shown in the crosshairs, with overlaid flame graphics and the threat: \" a knife will be stabbed into the throat of the carrier. \" similar fire footage is superimposed on the photo of the b-1b, with the words, \" the bomber will fall from the sky after getting hit by a hail of fire. \" the us is said to be mulling a \" multi-pronged approach \" to north korea's nuclear menace, including broad sanctions that would hit the country where it really hurts — pyongyang's purse — by isolating the country from the rest of the world's financial systems, reuters reports.

So what happened? crispin focused too much on the bros, \" actively ignoring, and even offending, every other demographic category in america. \" which meant, despite the attention-getting ads, burger king's sales shrank and it's about to lose its long-held no. 2 spot in the fast food industry to wendy's. \" the agency initially excelled mainly by whipping up attention through shock value and pop-cultural attunement, \" but couldn't maintain this initial thrill, stevenson writes.

There was the twitter game \" mac &amp; jinx \" ( based on the old children's game of jinx ) in which pairs of people who happened to write the phrase \" mac and cheese \" simultaneously on twitter got @ messages offering free mac &amp; cheese to whoever replied first. More recently, the agency whipped up a quick contest in which anyone who tweeted about mac &amp; cheese had a chance at getting his or her tweet turned into a commercial. These little stunts were fine, but it's nice to see some bona-fide professional commercials added to the mix once again. There are two new ones, and they build nicely on the campaign's earlier insight that parents just can't help stealing their kids ' mac &amp; cheese at the table. In the earlier executions, the children didn't do much about the pilfering except sit and pout about it. In the new spots, they get their revenge. In the first ad, a kid sees his chance to get back at dad when a police officer comes to school to talk about law enforcement. In the second, a girl evens the score with her father by stealing his stuff and selling it to a pawn dealer.",

        "summary": "President trump retweeted a drudge report post monday morning that announced the commander in chief's approval rating is back up to 50 %, with 50 % disapproving of his job performance, per a monday rasmussen reports poll. The daily presidential tracking gauge notes that trump's thumbs-up numbers peaked at 59 % just after when he took office, stayed in the 50s for a while, and then fell below the halfway mark in early march, where they've remained since, with a low of 42 %. But chris cillizza writes for cnn that one lone poll shouldn't be considered gospel on how trump's doing, citing other recent polls such as gallup's april 15 poll ( 41 % approve, 53 % disapprove ) and marist's april 14 poll ( 39 % approve, 49 % disapprove ). Cillizza adds there may be reasons not to put too much stock in rasmussen's results, although he's careful not to say that rasmussen is necessarily wrong. He simply notes that there are some uncertainties surrounding the group's polling methodology, including how they define \" likely voter, \" how using automated interview software instead of real people may affect outcomes, and even whether the way the numbers are dialed serves up a truly representative sample. What cillizza does say correlates: trump's numbers jump with his strike on syria. Meanwhile, another monday gallup poll shows 45 % of americans think trump has been keeping his promises — a sharp drop from 62 % in february.

        "summary": "More details are emerging about the \" unthinkable brutality \" police say university of texas freshman haruka weiser endured at the hands of homeless teen meechaiel criner. Though autopsy results aren't expected for several weeks, police sources tell the austin american-statesman that weiser was sexually assaulted and died of strangulation. A campus surveillance camera shows a man believed to be criner attempt to open the door of a van parked on campus after 9pm on april 3, reports the portland tribune. He disappears but returns around 9: 30pm and watches as weiser walks past him looking at her cellphone, per an affidavit. The man then takes a \" shiny rigid object \" from a back pocket and follows weiser behind the alumni center where her body was later found with \" obvious trauma, \" the affidavit says, per the ap. Criner is next caught on camera two hours later walking with a limp and carrying a bag weiser's friends say was hers, the affidavit notes. The next morning, firefighters found criner burning several items, including a shoe and college coursework, in an abandoned building near campus, per the affidavit. Firefighters told police that criner, who was taken to a homeless shelter, matched the suspect seen in a surveillance video. Police then found criner in possession of weiser's laptop, the affidavit says. A murder weapon has not been found. In an interview with abc 13, criner's sister says her brother — the youngest of five siblings, who never knew his father — is mentally ill and was staying with his grandmother after his mom committed suicide, but ran away last fall. His uncle says he has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old.",

While trump ignored questions about his previous comments regarding merkel, the german chancellor did say it was \" much better to talk to one another, not about one another. \" trump also declined to answer a question from a german reporter about his claim that trump tower was wiretapped, instead turning it into a joke that drew a cold reaction from merkel, cnn reports. \" at least we have something in common, perhaps, \" trump said, apparently referencing the 2013 revelation that the nsa had listened in on phone calls by merkel and other european leaders. Merkel had been understandably upset by that development. Nato was a major topic of both the meeting and press conference, with trump saying nato members must pay \" what they owe. \" germany is currently paying 1.2 % of its gdp to nato, instead of the 2 % goal.

Trump's aides had earlier attempted to quell british anger over the claims, based on a fox news report cited by his press secretary, sean spicer, in a briefing thursday, by explaining the comment to the uk government. But in an awkward moment on live television while meeting chancellor angela merkel -- whose cell phone was once tapped by the national security agency -- trump quipped that he and the german leader had something in common. Trump's response further fueled a controversy about his claims he was wiretapped by obama -- first made on twitter two weeks ago -- which have been rejected by senior members of house and senate",

As the idea percolated, he began to wonder if he might actually be onto something entirely new and, however quirky, useful. \" the more i thought about it, the less crazy it seemed, \" he tells the guardian. So mccarthy threw together the \" people walker \" facebook page ( with posts starting in april ), put up some fliers, and began charging $ 7 a mile. A q&a on the facebook page kicks off with \" why should i hire you? i can walk my own damn self. \" \" can you? \" is the quippy answer, but the fliers dig in a little more. Maybe you're looking for some motivation to get off the couch, or want a walking buddy for safety, or \" don't like listening to music or podcasts but can't walk alone in silence, forced to face thoughts of the unknown future, \" they explain. He's kept his approach light-hearted, and while he says most of the chit chat is light as well, \" i try to listen more than talk. \" he's had so much success laist reports he's already hired at least five employees to help walk people and he's even lost weight from all the work. Up next, perhaps: crowdfunding cash for an uber-esque app that would let both walking parties rate each other's pace and personality.

According to engadget, members of trollstation caused a \" mass panic \" at the tate britain and national portrait gallery when they put stockings over their heads and pretended to steal paintings they had brought with them. In one incident they took a woman hostage after she agreed to participate ahead of time. Many people fled the galleries in a panic, with one women left unconscious by the commotion, buzzfeed reports. One witness to the pranks, which took place while london was on a heightened alert following a terrorist attack in tunisia, says she was \" absolutely terrified. \" the four members of the group, ranging in age from 20 to 29, were sentenced to between four and five months in prison monday. \" the hoaxes may have seemed harmless to them, but they caused genuine distress to a number of members of the public, who should be able to go about their daily business without being put in fear in this way, \" a member of the crown prosecution service tells the bbc. Engadget quotes a judge, who said of trollstation: \" their sense of humor is warped and immature. \" a fifth member of the group was jailed in march in connection with a prank involving a fake bomb. Trollstation, which has more than 700,000 youtube subscribers, says it plans to \" reevaluate \" its pranks.",

The guardian reports that ettel, who was dubbed \" permit patty, \" has resigned from the cannabis company she founded in 2015. Internet sleuths quickly unmasked ettel's identity after video of the incident emerged saturday, and nbc news reports at least six companies that used treatwell health's marijuana tinctures severed their ties with the company. One such business says those products were some of its best-sellers, but it told the san francisco chronicle that it had discounted the products it had left in stock and wouldn't be reupping. The client reaction led the company to bring on a crisis manager and release a statement announcing ettel's resignation as ceo. Per the statement, the company is \" deeply sorry... It is ms. Ettels ' belief that treatwell, its employees, and patients should not have to suffer because of a situation that occurred in an escalated moment. And she regrets her part and is remorseful. \" as for the supposed call to police, the sfpd confirms no call was received, backing up ettel's story that she was only bluffing when making the supposed call. She told nbc news she was just asking the girl and her mom, who were stationed outside her apartment, to stop shouting. The girl's mom counters that \" she never asked us to be quiet. She came out and directly demanded to see a permit to sell water from an 8-year-old. \"",

The gadgets, which were a hot item last christmas, have an unfortunate habit of catching fire and exploding. The fox family of nashville, tenn., found this out the hard way on jan. 9, when a hoverboard caused their house to burn to the ground. Now, the family is suing amazon, claiming the retailer knowingly sold them a defective product. According to tennessee law, when the manufacturer of a product can't be found, the retailer can be held liable for damages. The family says they spent months investigating, but were unable to determine the manufacturer of the device; the seller that was listed online is apparently a sham organization. ( such confusion isn't uncommon, buzzfeed reports, due to the way hoverboards are manufactured and sold ). In fact, there's a good basis to the claim that amazon knew the devices were dangerous, as amazon actually stopped selling them last december, when it became clear that many were catching fire. Less than a month later, in january 2016, the fox home caught fire. They allege they were sold a counterfeit product, when they believed they were buying a product that would contain a samsung lithium ion battery. Their lawsuit seeks $ 30 million in damages, plus asks for penalties to be levied against amazon. The fox home was approximately 4,000 square feet and was valued at $ 1 million. In addition to the monetary loss, courthouse news service reports that the suit details the trauma the family suffered: parents megan and brian were out of the house when the fire started, and brian returned home in a panic to help their two children escape, injured but alive.",

The nhl hotshot was out in chilly edmonton on friday ahead of a game with the oilers when he spotted a homeless man wearing no shirt, cbc news reports. Ovechkin bought him a sweater, hat, and puffy blue jacket. The staff of a local café spotted the act of kindness and outed ovechkin, tweeting, \" wow! \" ovechkin, who has 10 goals in 10 games this season, per nhl.com, was out shopping with a couple of teammates when he encountered the man, per the washington post. The russian star's wife later posted texts she exchanged with her hubby in which he says ( in russian ) that he felt sorry for the man. Asked about the good deed by reporters on saturday, ovechkin said the man, who didn't recognize him, was \" a little in shock \" by the gesture. \" if you see a guy almost naked out there with that kind of temperature, i think every human can do something, you know? warm coat or a shirt or whatever, \" ovechkin said, clearly ill at ease discussing it, per the post. \" we don't have to concentrate on this moment right now, \" he added, per sports net. Abdul qureshi of boyle street community services tells the cbc that ovechkin made the man's day. \" i was happy that someone was looking out for him, because not many people do that, \" qureshi says. It wasn't the only good turn for ovechkin. His three assists helped the capitals come from behind to win saturday's game 5-2, per cbc.

John mccain, chair of the senate armed services committee, as the panel kicked off a hearing thursday into foreign cyberthreats, with russia at the top of the agenda, the new york times reports. Mccain, an outspoken advocate for investigating hacking allegations surrounding election 2016, stressed that the goal was \" not to question the outcome of the presidential election, \" but to understand the \" unprecedented attack on our democracy. \" sitting on the committee are sens. Lindsey graham, ted cruz, and new member elizabeth warren, and those testifying include director of national intelligence james clapper, one of the first in the hot seat. Clapper's response when asked if \" there's any credibility we should attach \" to julian assange: \" not in my view. \" mccain added, \" i would second those comments. \" meanwhile, donald trump appeared to agree with assange in a wednesday tweet, then denied it in a thursday follow-up. Elsewhere: an anonymous us official tells the ap that president obama has received the classified report on the russian hack job, as well as other \" foreign meddling \" in the election. Trump will receive his briefing on the report friday, as originally scheduled ( and despite his assertions of a \" very strange \" delay ). The atlantic delves into some of the hard-hitting questions, including why there's so much \" fuss \" ( \" didn't we already know about russia hacking the democratic national committee and others? \" ), what other countries and entities russia reportedly hacked, and whether the cia's case that russia tried to sway the election for trump has legs. Mccain and graham are the \" gop mavericks \" instrumental in this investigation, per politico, which notes \" neither is likely to pull punches \" and both \" have struggled to come to terms \" with trump's insistence that russia didn't interfere. \" when it comes to foreign policy, i agree with him on iran, i agree with him on china, \" graham says. \" russia: i have no idea where he's coming from. \" others taking issue with trump's position, per cnn and bloomberg: top intel officers like clapper, undersecretary of defense for intelligence marcel lettre, and michael rogers, the chief of us cyber command and director of the nsa. \" we assess that only russia's senior-most officials could have authorized the recent election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets, \" the trio",

It was the final major report on a lukewarm but durable economy before americans choose a new president next week. The labor department said friday that average hourly pay took a big step higher last month, rising 10 cents an hour to an average $ 25.92. That's 2.8 % higher than a year ago and is the biggest 12-month increase in seven years. The pickup in hourly pay follows a substantial increase last year in earnings for the typical household. The economy appears to be finally delivering widespread raises after years of sluggish pay gains. \" while this report is unlikely to change investor opinions about a december rate increase from the federal reserve, it has helped make them more sure it will happen, barring any future developments, \" notes a blogger at the wall street journal. Despite the solid unemployment news, the overall economy is growing at the slowest pace of any in a recovery since world war ii. Growth picked up to a 2.9 % annual rate in the july-september quarter, the government has estimated, much faster than the 1.1 % pace for the first half of the year.

But after announcing a $ 50,000 reward for the persistent compromise of a chromebook in guest mode last year, the company has yet to receive a single successful submission — so it has doubled its reward to $ 100,000 in the hopes that someone, anyone, can find bugs, reports venturebeat. \" great research deserves great awards, so we're putting up a standing six-figure sum, available all year round with no quotas and no maximum reward pool, \" google says in a statement. The company has already added several security measures to make chromebooks more secure, reports pc world, including automatic software update downloads, verification boot-ups, and more.

North dakota was followed by montana, idaho, wisconsin, south carolina, and south dakota. Why? tyler spraul, the study's director, cites \" higher than average alcohol consumption, \" for one. Indeed, usa today flags a study by the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism that found north and south dakota, idaho, and wisconsin were among 2009's biggest alcohol consumers. Spraul further tells usa today \" a higher chance of running into dangerous driving conditions with sleet, snow, and ice during the winter months could [ also ] be the reason that we're seeing so many of those northern states rank poorly. \" potentially undermining that argument: the wintry states of alaska and minnesota ranked 46th and 47th, respectively.

The image garnered international media attention, with the new york post writing that it found four out of seven footlongs it purchased in new york \" measured only 11 or 11.5 inches. \" a judge had given preliminary approval in october to a settlement between subway's parent company doctor's associates and plaintiffs ' attorneys. Final approval was granted on feb. 25. As part of the settlement, subway agreed to institute practices for at least four years to ensure its bread is at least 12 inches long. The judge approved $ 520,000",

One of those men was just acquitted because, the judge found, his touching of the girl's breasts and penetration of her genitals was done without \" lascivious intent, \" the los angeles times reports. Per the judge's ruling dismissing the pederasty charges, \" an incidental touching or fondling will not be considered sexual acts, if proof is not presented that it was done to satisfy a sexual desire, \" the ap reports. Diego cruz, now 21, and the three other men allegedly involved come from \" prominent \" families in the wealthy city of boca del rio in the coastal state of veracruz, the guardian reports. The judge also found that the victim was never \" helpless \" during the incident. Prosecutors say they will appeal the ruling. The case was already quite controversial in mexico, where the men involved have been nicknamed \" los porkys \" after the raunchy film of the same name, because of how long it took authorities to investigate and bring a case. Cruz fled briefly to spain but was extradited back to mexico to face charges. Of the other men allegedly involved, one was present but not accused of taking part; enrique capitaine marin was detained in march 2016 and is awaiting a ruling; and jorge coahuila has not yet been caught. Activists, and the victim's family, are outraged by the judge's ruling on cruz, saying it sets a dangerous precedent. \" in mexico, the last thing the system of justice provides is justice, \" says the victim's father.

In an investigation that took 18 months, the los angeles times interviewed hundreds of laborers in 30 camps across nine states, uncovering deplorable conditions and abuse that is easily tied to major american retailers. \" the contrast between the treatment of produce and of people is stark, \" writes richard marosi. Among his grim findings: child labor: though the situation is much improved over decades past, the mexican government estimates that 100,000 children under the age of 14 pick crops, mostly on small and medium farms that funnel produce to the us through middlemen. Living conditions: marosi calls laborer camps \" rat-infested, \" and finds they often lack beds, toilets, and water. \" they want us to take such great care of the tomatoes, but they don't take care of us, \" says one field hand. \" look at how we live. \" pay: low pay is compounded by employers who withhold wages and charge exorbitant prices at company stores, often resulting in laborers who end a back-breaking season by breaking even or even in debt. Laborers surrounded by food are often too poor to afford it, and thus starve. \" we arrive here fat, and leave skinny, \" says one worker. The times saw workers scrounging for food at rene produce, which sells to whole foods. \" we take the findings you shared very seriously, especially since rene has signed our social accountability agreement, \" says a rep. Abuse: the times found workers were frequently held against their will, and even beaten for attempting to escape.

Opposition leader suu kyi and other members of the national league for democracy are likely to boycott parliament next week over wording in a swearing-in oath. They want to take office saying they ' ll \" respect \" rather than \" safeguard \" the constitution, penned by the military bosses who once ran the country; officials have rejected their request, the telegraph reports. If the president doesn't quickly reconsider — which seems unlikely — they ' ll boycott parliament, which opens monday. Meanwhile, the european union has agreed \" in principle \" to a year's suspension of all sanctions against burma other than a weapons embargo, following a visit to burma from david cameron. Lifting the sanctions would allow aid and foreign investment to enter the country; officials ' assets would be unfrozen and leaders would be allowed to travel. Eu foreign ministers will make a firm decision on the sanctions on monday.",

A final decision on whether sanctions will be suspended will be taken at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday. \"there is now agreement in principle \" to \"a suspension of all sanctions, except for the arms embargo, \" a diplomat close to the talks, who asked not to be identified, told the afp news agency. Under the plan, travel bans and asset freezes on regime officials would be lifted. Foreign investment in the country's rich oil and gas resources as well as in its traditional logging industry would be permitted. Development and aid money would be allowed into a country that struggles with grinding poverty. There have been recent splits within the eu over when to remove sanctions on burma following the actions of the military-backed government president thein sein in moving towards democracy since november 2010. Germany has urged a swift end to sanctions but britain has previously been keen to maintain leverage in the still army-dominated country. However, in a press conference last week, prime minister david cameron and opposition leader aung san suu kyi urged the suspension of all eu measures – though not the scrapping of the sanctions. Ms suu kyi's endorsement of the suspension was seen as crucial. The 12-month suspension period \"gives us time to assess the sustainability of reform \", a diplomat said. The ministers are expected to also agree to include the possibility of reviewing the decision in six months. Western nations eager to reward sweeping reforms that culminated in ms suu kyi's election to parliament in april 1 by-elections, have already made some reciprocal gestures to encourage burma's government. Once in place, the suspension opens up what many investors see as the next big frontier to european firms.",

When asked, he said he never chanted, \" lock her up! \" racial allegations: he called accusations of racism against him \" damnably false charges. \" sessions was rejected for a federal judgeship on those grounds decades ago, but \" the caricature of me in 1986 was not correct, \" he said. \" i do not harbor the kind of animosity and race-based discrimination ideas that i was accused of. I did not. \" waterboarding: he said current law makes it \" absolutely improper and illegal. \" opposing his boss: he said he would not be \" a mere rubber stamp \" for trump and would oppose him when necessary. Russian hacking: sessions says he's confident the fbi's conclusion that moscow interfered with the us elections through hacking was \" honorably reached. \" muslim immigration: \"i have no belief and do not support the idea that muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the united states. \" overall immigration: sessions made clear, however, that he views the current process as flawed. \" fundamentally, we need to fix this immigration system. \"'dreamers ': sessions called president obama's plan to protect an estimated 700,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation \" constitutionally questionable. \" in general: \"you know who i am. You know what i believe in. You know that i am a man of my word and can be trusted to do what i say i will do. You know that i revere our constitution and am committed to the rule of law.
