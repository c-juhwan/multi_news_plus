        "summary": "A group of eight key senators has crafted a sweeping immigration overhaul deal that offers a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants living in the united states. Under an outline of the bipartisan plan seen by politico, the deal tackles immigration reform in a comprehensive measure that opens the pathway to citizenship only after implementing stricter border control measures ( ie, more agents and drones ) and moves to ensure visitors leave the country when their visas are up. The process for illegal immigrants would be two-step: first, obtain probationary legal status by registering, submitting to a background check, paying a fine, and settling back taxes. Then achieve permanent residency after completing requirements like learning english and undergoing a deeper background check. The group of senators includes democrats chuck schumer and dick durbin and republicans john mccain and marco rubio. \" look at the last election, \" mccain said yesterday. \" we are losing dramatically the hispanic vote, which we think should be ours. \" the senators ' plan will be unveiled today, a day before president obama sets out his own proposal for immigration reform. His plan is expected to offer a faster path to citizenship that, unlike the senators ' plan, is not dependent on the mexican border being declared secure, the new york times reports.",

( ap photo/dan anderson ) ( associated press ) forecasters warn alberto, a still-menacing depression after its memorial day landfall on the gulf coast, is scattering heavy rains around the south amid heightened risks of flash flooding. The first named storm of the 2018 atlantic hurricane season, subtropical storm alberto lumbered ashore monday afternoon in the florida panhandle and then weakened to a depression overnight as it trekked inland. The storm that sprang from warm waters of the gulf of mexico was now a vast, soggy system as it headed inland, dumping heavy rains in bursts all around the region. Though the storm had weakened, forecasters warned, it was capable of potentially life-threatening flash floods in the coming hours or days as the vast system spreads over alabama and large areas of georgia, tennessee and the carolinas. Authorities did not directly attribute any deaths or injuries immediately to alberto. But in north carolina, the state's governor noted a television news anchor and a photojournalist were killed monday while covering the fringes of the large system. A tree that became uprooted from rain-soaked ground toppled on their suv, killing them instantly, authorities said. North carolina gov. Roy cooper urged"

There are a couple of cocktail-themed caveats for the new location: alcoholic drinks will only be allowed while dining in and will be served in different cups than non-alcoholic beverages so patrons won't be as tempted to sneak them out, fortune notes.

Carried out by a physical therapist, two professors of social work, and a psychologist, the study argues that torture victims require medical treatment for this long-term pain response soon after torture, and that without it the body could continue to damage itself for decades. It also found that non-physical torture — pows said they were subjected to extreme isolation, deprivation, and mock executions — may have some role in the long-term alteration of physical pain response. The study recommended a conception of torture that suggests a physical therapy response to the likelihood of long-term pain problems. The study looked at a group of slightly more than 100 israeli combat veterans of the country's 1973 war with syria and egypt. Two-thirds had been taken prisoner during the conflict and tortured, and the other third had not.

            "The supreme court announced monday that it will not take up a dispute involving a small new mexico wedding-photography firm that refused to provide services for a same-sex commitment ceremony. The justices indicated in a routine order list that they would not hear the closely watched case, elane photography v. Willock. As usual, they did not offer any explanation for declining to consider the case. Elane photography's owner, elaine huguenin, said her religious beliefs led her to decline to photograph same-sex weddings. However, after a lesbian couple complained about her refusing the work, the new mexico supreme court ruled last year that the move amounted to illegal discrimination. ( photos: where same-sex couples can wed ) conservative and libertarian groups took up huguenin's cause, arguing that forcing her to photograph such an event violated her constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of religion. They argued that the law was akin to forcing an author or artist to focus on a subject matter he or she did not wish to address.

            "The supreme court announced monday that it will not take up a dispute involving a small new mexico wedding-photography firm that refused to provide services for a same-sex commitment ceremony. The justices indicated in a routine order list that they would not hear the closely watched case, elane photography v. Willock. As usual, they did not offer any explanation for declining to consider the case. Elane photography's owner, elaine huguenin, said her religious beliefs led her to decline to photograph same-sex weddings. However, after a lesbian couple complained about her refusing the work, the new mexico supreme court ruled last year that the move amounted to illegal discrimination. ( photos: where same-sex couples can wed ) conservative and libertarian groups took up huguenin's cause, arguing that forcing her to photograph such an event violated her constitutional rights to free speech and freedom of religion. They argued that the law was akin to forcing an author or artist to focus on a subject matter he or she did not wish to address. However, gay rights groups and other civil rights organizations said huguenin was offering a commercial service like any other and could therefore be compelled to comply with anti-discrimination laws.

Pao famously sued venture capital firm kleiner perkins caufield &amp; byers over alleged gender discrimination and lost big in march. A jury found that pao's gender was not the reason she was passed over for a promotion, and ruled in favor of kpcb on all counts. The firm tried to recover the $ 972,814 they spent over the course of the trial, but pao and her attorneys argued that the figure was \" grossly excessive and unreasonable, \" reports usa today. San francisco superior court judge harold kahn shaved that number down to about $ 276,000, based on pao's resources. \" this tentative ruling recognizes that our settlement offer was reasonable and made in good faith, \" says a statement from kpcb partner christina lee. \" it also recognizes the cost rules still apply when a plaintiff refuses a reasonable settlement offer and forces the parties to go through an expensive trial. \" pao, heralded as a hero for women in tech, is now the interim ceo of reddit. She is appealing the ruling against her but will drop it if kpcb pays her $ 2.7 million court costs, according to techcrunch. Both sides will be in court today.",

The results held true even when the heads of weak men were superimposed onto the bodies of strong ones, a deception done to make sure participants weren't making judgments based on attractiveness alone. \" our findings are consistent with a lot of real examples of strong men in positions of power, \" says cameron anderson, a professor of management at berkeley, in a eureka alert news release. But researchers say the link between strength and leadership isn't about being physically intimidating — those who looked like they might act aggressively toward others actually got lower marks. \" the conferral of status upon formidable men, perhaps counter-intuitively, serves a fundamentally pro-social function — to enhance the effectiveness of cooperation within the group, \" says anderson. But anderson adds another curve ball, reporting this week in the harvard business review that in another series of studies he found that powerful people who have to share that power by working in a group ( think legislatures ) tend to under-perform.

            "All too commonly, we see groups of leaders fail to accomplish their goals — legislators who cannot agree on a bill, heads of state who cannot broker meaningful peace deals, or boards of directors who make disastrous decisions for their companies. Why do powerful people, when working together, fail as often as they do? this question is particularly vexing because researchers have long found power to boost individual performance in a variety of ways. When people work alone, feeling powerful helps them process information more effectively, think more creatively, and focus for longer stretches of time. If power enhances individual performance, then by extension one would assume that groups comprising high-power individuals would perform particularly well. But our research found the opposite: power hampers the ability of leaders to work with other leaders.

A rep for marina meats tells cbs san francisco that buyers likely wouldn't notice if their ground beef contained heart meat — high in iron and b-12 — though beef with more than 10 % heart meat has \" a little more iron flavor. \" he does say heart meat should be mentioned on labels, though.

Conservative critics who were worried hillary clinton would win warned the move could backfire in allowing her to nominate someone to the left of the moderate garland. Now, donald trump can nominate someone to the right. Cnn recalls that trump himself spoke of the issue in july: \" if you really like donald trump, that's great, but if you don't, you have to vote for me anyway, \" he said. \" you know why? supreme court judges! supreme court judges! \" given that ruth bader ginsburg is 83, anthony kennedy is 80, and stephen breyer is 78, it seems likely he ' ll get the chance. An addition of two conservative justices could affect decisions on everything from abortion to campaign finance rules to gun restrictions. Trump released of a list of 11 potential names in may, then another 10 names in september after criticism that the first list was mostly white men. One name that has drawn particular media attention is that of william pryor of alabama, who has called roe v. Wade \" the worst abomination in the history of constitutional law. \" politico notes that exit polls suggest the supreme court was a motivating factor among trump voters.",

        "summary": "A new study on mice published may 24 in the journal of neuroscience shows that missing out on sleep may cause parts of our brains to start eating other parts. And the telegraph reports that's not necessarily something you want to be happening. The study revolves around two types of glial cells: astrocytes and microglial cells, according to new scientist. Astrocytes get rid of worn-out and unnecessary synapses, while microglial cells do the same to damaged cells and debris. Science alert reports both types of glial cells are active during sleep and play an important role in repairing the brain at the end of the day. So it's somewhat unexpected that astrocytes stepped up their activity — more than doubling it — in the brains of chronically sleep-deprived mice. \" we show for the first time that portions of synapses are literally eaten by astrocytes because of sleep loss, \" researcher michele bellesi says. That may not be a bad thing, as the astrocytes were still going to work on the largest, most-used synapses. As bellesi puts it, \" they are like old pieces of furniture, and so probably need more attention and cleaning. \" what is more likely to be a problem is the increase in microglial activity caused by lack of sleep. Increased microglial activity has been linked to alzheimer's in the past. It's unclear if the same thing happens in the brains of humans or if catching up on sleep can reverse it.

            "The reason we sleep goes far beyond simply replenishing our energy levels every 12 hours - our brains actually change states when we sleep to clear away the toxic byproducts of neural activity left behind during the day. Weirdly enough, the same process starts to occur in brains that are chronically sleep-deprived too - except it's kicked into hyperdrive. Researchers have found that persistently poor sleep causes the brain to clear a significant amount of neurons and synaptic connections, and recovering sleep might not be able to reverse the damage. A team led by neuroscientist michele bellesi from the marche polytechnic university in italy has examined the mammalian brain's response to poor sleeping habits, and found a bizarre similarity between the well-rested and sleepless mice. Like the cells elsewhere in your body, the neurons in your brain are being constantly refreshed by two different types of glial cell - support cells that are often called the glue of the nervous system. The microglial cells are responsible for clearing out old and worn out cells via a process called phagocytosis - meaning \" to devour \" in greek. The astrocytes ' job is to prune unnecessary synapses ( connections ) in the brain to refresh and reshape its wiring. We've known that this process occurs when we sleep to clear away the neurological wear and tear of the day, but now it appears that the same thing happens when we start to lose sleep. But rather than being a good thing, the brain goes overboard with the clearing, and starts to harm itself instead. Think of it like the garbage being cleared out while you're asleep, versus someone coming into your house after several sleepless nights and indiscriminately tossing out your television, fridge, and family dog. \" we show for the first time that portions of synapses are literally eaten by astrocytes because of sleep loss, \" bellesi told andy coghlan at new scientist.

The loss figures do not include interest or taxes, meaning uber's losses could be even higher than reported. The company is believed to have lost at least $ 2 billion in 2015. Insiders tell the wall street journal that the losses resulted from big spending on promotions to attract new drivers, and on investment in new parts of the business like the ubereats delivery service and the self-driving car project that has led to clashes with california regulators. According to cnbc, uber's losses in the third quarter would have been even higher if it hadn't left the china market, selling its local business to beijing-based rival didi chuxing as part of a deal that saw the chinese firm invest $ 1 billion in uber.

        "summary": "The good news keeps on coming for donald trump. A cnn poll that sampled 1,002 adults from thursday to sunday shows the real estate mogul with 41 % support among republican voters across the country — a new high up from 39 % in december. That's more than double the 19 % support of nearest rival ted cruz. Marco rubio is next with just 8 %. Even voters who don't support trump think he's unstoppable: more than two-thirds believe he will become the republican nominee, and 63 % say he's the republican candidate most likely to win come november. An nbc news poll of 9,690 adults conducted last week similarly shows trump with 39 % support among republican and republican-leaning voters, while hillary clinton has a 14-point lead with 51 % support among democratic and democratic-leaning voters. Trump has less to brag about in iowa, though. A quinnipiac university survey released tuesday shows him neck and neck with cruz in that state, leading by just 2 points, per politico. That explains why the cruz camp is targeting trump so rigorously, but trump appears to have finally rattled some republican groups, too. Anti-trump pacs are now spending big to attack the frontrunner, intending to reverse the idea that he fights for the little guy, reports msnbc. One online ad even mentions the time he supported impeaching george w. Bush. Still, not all anti-trump groups are on the same page. \" this contest is not yet about defeating donald trump, it is about finding an alternative to him, \" a republican consultant told trump critics in an email on monday. \" if that alternative is cruz, the republican party's future is in doubt. \" ( glenn beck likes bernie sanders more than trump. )",

There might even be more talk this time around given that woods ' arrest for dui on monday is just the latest scandal to plague him — and there's now a mugshot in the mix. What columnists are saying about it and the golfer in general: the sex scandal that tarnished woods'reputation in 2009 was bad. Given the dangers involved, \" this is worse, \" writes christine brennan at usa today. In comparing woods ' mugshot to a photo of woods after his 1997 masters win, she adds \" the very public demise of one of the greatest athletic icons of this or any generation \" is clear, and it's \" sad, horrifying, unacceptable, shocking. \" but damien cox wonders why anyone would be shocked by the dui charge when \" we don't know, and never knew, any of the really important stuff about woods. \" the superstar athlete might have seemed appealing at the height of his career, cox writes at the toronto star. But like oj simpson, woods ' \" public persona was completely at odds with who he really was. \" ed graney agrees. There can be no fall from grace because the grace associated with woods was imaginary, he writes at the las vegas review-journal. The portrait of a \" once-in-a-lifetime athlete \" with a gorgeous wife and happy family was \" the greatest myth of all \" and this latest scandal only serves to remind us that tiger \" is like most of us. Human. Flawed. Sort of a mess. \" scott ostler, meanwhile, thinks woods should get some advice from john daly. Woods ' former rival drinks, smokes, and is overweight, but he has \" a life with fun and meaning, a female companion, and even good golf. \" with a tip from daly, woods ' next win might be on the course, rather than \" in the'scariest police mug shot ' contest, \" ostler writes at the san francisco chronicle.

Ted cruz and marco rubio will likely pass, but keep an eye on chris christie or perhaps jeb bush or carly fiorina. But which trump? cnn notes that trump has been content in some debates to \" fade into the background, \" but he also knows that millions will be tuning in to watch him defend his plan to keep muslims out of the country. Does he \" play it safe and lock in his front-runner status? \" cruz vs. Rubio: now that he's near the top of the polls, cruz is \" likely to come under sharp attack, \" says the new york times. Look for rubio in particular to go after him on immigration and national security, particularly over cruz's support of guest-worker visas and curbing domestic surveillance. Rubio himself, though, is vulnerable over his 2013 work on providing immigrants a path to citizenship, a topic that has yet to surface in the debates. Christie emerging: one of slate's key questions is: \" what will chris christie do? \" he's rising in the polls, especially in new hampshire, and given bush's lackluster debate performances, the new jersey governor is the \" establishment man best suited to try to shake things up. \" scary times: a big topic is expected to be foreign policy and the fight against isis because of the attacks on paris and san bernardino, notes time: \" the more serious tone will likely reward candidates who adapt their messages to fit the new dynamic of the race, and may pose a problem for those who struggle on the substance. \" details: the main debate airs at 8: 30 eastern on cnn.

Located in poplar bluff, mo., the nation's largest manufacturer of nails says that it was forced to raise prices due to the new 25 % tariff on steel from mexico and canada, and orders subsequently dropped 50 %. It is hoping the commerce dept. Will grant it an exemption from paying the tariff. Company spokesman james glassman told cnn that the company is \" on the brink of extinction \" and could relocate to mexico. Mid-continent nail is one of an estimated 21,000 us companies that have applied for an exemption to the tariff. Mid-continent's troubles underscore a concern among analysts that the trade war could result in job losses in the us. Indeed, this week, harley-davidson announced that it is moving some of its production offshore because of the 31 % tariff that europe imposed following the white house's steel tariffs on europe, reports the chicago tribune. Supporters of tariffs say that job losses are offset by job gains as protections help us businesses reopen. One analyst suggested that the tariffs would help create 26,000 steel and aluminum jobs, but that retaliation from trading partners could cost more than 495,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy. \"for every american job gained, more than 18 jobs would be lost, \" she told the huffpost.",

The new deadline for a political deal would be march 1, with all details ironed out by july 1. The group — including us secretary of state john kerry, iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif, and diplomats from britain, france, china, germany, and russia — will likely meet again in a \" yet-to-be-determined location \" in december, according to an email sent to reuters by an unidentified western diplomat. Holding things up, among other issues, is the sanctions-lifting process itself, cnn reports: while some in iran feel that there should be an immediate \" lifting of significant sanctions \" — including energy and banking penalties — to show the other countries'sincere intentions, the p5+1 members meeting in vienna, along with germany, have stated they'd prefer to lift them gradually to keep an eye on iran. This mistrust may not be unwarranted: the head of the international atomic energy agency said iran isn't letting his group in to check out a military complex, cnn notes. Also putting some pressure on an agreement: the fact that republicans will be taking control of the senate in january and may make iran skittish with talks of new sanctions.

        "summary": "A science publisher in britain has retracted 43 scientific papers after learning that the peer-review process behind them was fake — possibly pointing to a wider problem in science publishing, the washington post reports via smithsonian. Biomed central, which has 277 peer-reviewed journals, says it initially received convincing peer review reports on the articles. But then biomed central noticed that the reviewers ' email addresses didn't seem to fit any institution, and the authors had written articles across various specialized fields. So the publisher investigated, and learned that the authors hadn't written the articles at all; someone else had just used their names. \" there is an element of exploitation, \" says jigisha patel, associate editorial director for research integrity at biomed central. \" if authors are naive and want to get their manuscripts published, they can be exploited \" by services that charge fees for polishing articles and perhaps guaranteeing publication. Patel's boss at biomed central source agrees, but says it's unclear whether the authors knew about the fake reviewers and possibly concocted their names, retraction watch reports. Most of the fake articles apparently came from china, but patel says it isn't \" a china problem. We get a lot of robust research of china. \" meanwhile, an anonymous tool called pubpeer is allowing scientists to give feedback after articles are published to help weed out mistakes, vox reports.",

            "Update: one of the founders of pubpeer, neuroscientist brandon stell, just revealed his identity in the journal nature and at retraction watch. The q&a below was penned by stell and other pubpeer co-founders, who have chosen to remain anonymous. When people talk about the flaws in the scientific process, they often raise the problem of peer review. Right now, when a researcher submits an article for publication in a journal, it's sent off to his or her peers for constructive criticism or even rejection. The idea is that science is like a self-cleansing machine: the scrutiny of one's colleagues is meant to ensure quality and keep the junk at bay. But there are problems with this traditional \" pre-publication \" peer review model: it relies on the goodwill of scientists, who are increasingly busy and may not spend the time required to properly critique a work; it's subject to the biases of a select few; it's slow; and it sometimes fails. This means that even in the highest-quality journals, mistakes, flaws, and even fraudulent work make it on the record. In the past, there was no way to publicly point out those errors, barring the rare event of a retraction. Now the ( anonymous ) founders of a new website, pubpeer, are trying to"

        "summary": "On sunday, olympic swimmer fu yuanhui did something kind of extraordinary: she told a tv interviewer she was menstruating. After china finished 4th in the 4x100 relay, fu was seen holding her stomach, and when asked if she was feeling ill, she put it plainly: \" because my period came yesterday, i ' m feeling a bit weak, but this is not an excuse. \" quartz explains how major such a simple statement is: not only did she break \" a great sporting taboo, \" \" it was the first time many chinese people realized it is possible to swim while being on your period. \" that it came from fu made it all the more impactful. China has, in the last week, fallen for the 20-year-old. Amid a sea of elite athletes whose \" vocabulary is often robotically limited by the state parlance, \" as the ap puts it, fu has emerged as the foil. An hour-long live-stream she did last wednesday — during which she burped and ate cupcakes, reports quartz — has been watched a staggering 11 million times, reports cnn. Her post-race facial expressions and comments ( like saying she used \" primordial force \" in rio ) are winning over the public. As for her period comment, the bbc reports it drove a lot of social media chatter — about fu and about tampons, which are a rarity in china: a 2015 survey found 2 % of women there use them, compared to four out of every 10 us women. ( a us startup has gotten $ 1 million in funding for a product that it calls an anti-tampon. )",

In a series of tweets thursday, hill insisted, \" i do not support anti-semitism, killing jewish people, or any of the other things attributed to my speech. I have spent my life fighting these things. \" he said his goal is to \" support palestinian freedom \" and \" palestinian self-determination \" and that he's simply \" deeply critical of israeli policy and practice. \" he also said the phrase \" river to the sea \" has a \" variety of meanings \" and \" precedes hamas by more than 50 years. \" per al jazeera, many pro-palestinian activists, journalists, and politicians are calling hill's firing a \" kowtowing to right-wing israeli groups. \" a petition started by intercept journalist ryan grim, calling for cnn to rehire hill and offer an apology \" to the world, \" had more than 4,700 signatures as of friday morning.

        "summary": "A federal appeals court in chicago narrowly overturned a ruling friday that could have freed a wisconsin inmate featured in the making a murderer series from prison, though one dissenting judge called the case \" a profound miscarriage of justice. \" a federal magistrate judge overturned brendan dassey's conviction last year, ruling that detectives took advantage of his youth — he was 16 at the time — and learning disabilities to coerce him into confessing he helped his uncle, steven avery, rape and kill photographer teresa halbach in 2005; dassey was sentenced to life in 2007. A three-judge panel from the 7th us circuit court of appeals upheld the magistrate's ruling in june.

        "summary": "The gop chairman of the house panel exploring possible ties between russia and the trump campaign apologized in private to his democratic colleagues thursday for his controversial decision to brief president trump before them on new information, while cnn is out with a potentially big development. Here's a look at developments: \"it was a judgment call on my part, \" rep. Devin nunes told reporters thursday about his decision to call a news conference, then visit the white house, to assert that communications of trump associates may have been picked up \" incidentally \" in surveillance. Behind closed doors, he apologized to angry democrats for the move, reports the guardian. The lawfare blog does a deep dive into that nunes news conference here, finding that what he's alleging is a \" bit opaque. \" the larger development comes via cnn, which reports that the fbi is investigating whether trump associates communicated with russian operatives during the campaign to coordinate the release of information hackers stole from democrats. The agency is looking at travel, business, and phone records, and other accounts of meetings, per the report, which notes that the information is so far \" not conclusive. \" read it in full here. A post at vox sees the cnn story as \" stunning \" if true because \" it is the first such report suggesting that the fbi may have credible information — say, an account of a meeting where collusion was discussed, to give one wholly hypothetical example — of a possible trump campaign-russia plot against hillary clinton. \" read the assessment here. When asked by chuck todd of nbc news whether the evidence of collusion was circumstantial, the ranking democrat on the house intelligence panel responded, \" i can't go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now. \" that's further than adam schiff would go just last weekend, but things seem to have changed. \" there is evidence that is not circumstantial and is very much worthy of an investigation, \" schiff said. Schiff separately lashed out at nunes for his wednesday press conference, accusing him of being a \" surrogate \" of the president instead an independent panel chairman. The public sniping prompted sen. John mccain to call for a special committee to step in to investigate the alleged russian ties because the house panel has \" lost the credibility to handle this alone, \" per politico. Trump, meanwhile, tweets that news accounts of what's going on are \" totally biased and fake. \" breitbart has a post with \" four major holes \" on the allegations schiff made against trump at fbi chief james comey's hearing, including his",

An earlier pencourage survey found that social-media lies usually added luster to otherwise ho-hum evenings or made relationships or careers look better; people said they wrote the posts out of jealousy or \" fear of appearing boring. \" the only study to measure the impact of social media on memory, by the psychonomics bulletin and review, considered its impact \" damaging to autobiographical memory. \" peter clayton, a co-founder of pencourage — which hosts over 65,000 online diaries — says we are \" slowly wiping \" our memories with \" scattered \" social-media posts, and would benefit from diaries: \" we knew there was a real need for a safe space to preserve and share the true chronicles and lessons of our lives, the ones we actually live and should protect, \" he says. ( on the bright side, one study finds that lost memories can be restored. )",

Mcmaster shot down rumors in january that he was considering leaving the white house, calling it \" a tremendous honor to do this job every day. \" \"i have a job and it is my intention to go as long and hard as i can in service of the president and the nation, \" mcmaster told reporters last month.

A \" mega-brothel \" is more what they have in mind, in what they say is an effort to help keep the municipality's sex workers safe, per the guardian. Under this new initiative, ostend's red-light district ( prostitution is legal in belgium ) will be emptied out and all sex workers will be moved to the \" hangar d ' amour \" ( \" hangar of love \" ), which will also boast a brewery, bar, information desk, and police outpost once renovations are done. Johan vande lanotte, ostend's mayor, says the new location will ultimately offer the sex workers better working conditions and more security. \" the ladies will enter into a rental contract directly with the owner, as a result of which intermediaries will be excluded, \" he notes. And that could be an important factor in a country the evening standard notes still has a black mark from the un's office on drugs and crime, which lists nations rife with sex trafficking. Out of the 26,000 estimated sex workers in belgium, about 80 % of them are believed to be victims of trafficking or other forms of exploitation, authorities say. The brothel is currently set for a 2020 opening, the het nieuwsblad newspaper reports, via newsweek, and the company in charge of it ( which also runs another brothel in antwerp ) will pony up about $ 65,000 a month to rent the space. One aspect of the hangar that won't change, due to its protected architectural status, is its exterior; only the inside will eventually get an overhaul.

Police in nova scotia arrested two 18-year-old males on child pornography charges, reports cnn. The family of rehtaeh parsons says the then-15-year-old went to a booze-filled party in halifax in november 2011 and was sexually assaulted by four teen boys. One took a photo, and the image soon was in wide circulation at rehtaeh's school. She hanged herself this april. The local police chief says no sexual assault charges were filed because \" the available evidence did not meet the threshold, \" reports the toronto star. But he said cops had enough to charge one of the teens with creating child pornography and the other with distributing it. The case is reminiscent of the one involving high school football players in steubenville, ohio, in that \" the hive mind of the internet played an indispensable role here, \" writes emily bazelon at slate.

In a letter sent to committee chair devin nunes, schiff alleges that on wednesday his staff realized that the four-page memo president trump is considering for release had been \" secretly altered, \" making it \" materially different \" than the version the committee approved for release on monday. The letter calls it \" imperative \" that the memo be withdrawn, per cnn. \" if the majority remains intent on releasing its document to the public, despite repeated warnings from doj and the fbi, it must hold a new vote to release to the public its modified document, \" it continues. Schiff tweeted a copy of his letter, which does not detail how the discovery was initially made. A rep for nunes says the allegations are essentially hogwash and calls them an \" increasingly strange attempt \" to keep the memo from seeing the light of day. Per the rep, there were changes made, but they include only fixes to grammar and \" two edits requested by the fbi and by the minority themselves. \" the washington post observes that while congressmen criticize their peers regularly, \" rarely does a member literally blow the whistle on another lawmaker in such dramatic fashion in full public view. \" and it argues that the case of schiff and nunes is particularly remarkable, in that the pair were formerly described as having \" something of a bromance. \" its piece looks at their backgrounds and their seemingly shattered relationship.",

        "summary": "In an exciting breakthrough in the fight against aids, four monkeys injected with an experimental compound have remained hiv-free for almost a year despite repeated efforts to infect them with large doses of the virus. The researchers, whose study is published in the journal nature, say the compound they've engineered blocks the virus so effectively it could function as a vaccine — and halt aids in people already infected. Lead researcher michael farzan of the scripps research institute tells the new york times that the experimental protein blocks both sites that hiv uses to attach itself to cells, demonstrating with his hands in what one of his colleagues says is \" the grip for a two-seam cut fastball. \" the researchers say the study, which builds on more than a decade of research on how the virus that causes aids enters cells, has found that the compound blocks all known strains of hiv, cbs reports. Farzan tells the wall street journal that the next step will be testing the compound in people who already have hiv to show it can work therapeutically, followed by testing it as a vaccine in people at high risk of infection. Experts not involved with the work say it appears so promising that they hope it can move into the human testing stage quickly. ( an earlier attempt to create an aids vaccine was foiled by a common-cold virus. )",

After four months in the job, he's not bad, he's just nowhere near the insightful host stewart was, writes willa paskin. As a result, the show itself feels different as noah and the writers find their way: he is \" a potemkin jon stewart, someone smooth and ingratiating who is reaching for unconverted viewers, instead of an inveterate political satirist preaching to the deeply informed. \" too often, the jokes feel empty and superficial, more like those that would come from one of the late-night jimmys, writes paskin. Noah rarely goes for the jugular, and he never seems to get outraged as stewart did. He's more \" milquetoast \" and \" soothing, \" which is precisely the opposite of what viewers need in this crazy election year. \" not so long ago, we would have learned of these bizarre happenings and thought, ' i can't wait to see what the daily show has to say about this, ' \" writes paskin. \" now, it's only likely to have the eighth-best joke on the subject. You still may laugh, but an inessential daily show is a real loss. \" it's early in noah's tenure, and he and his writing team still have time to figure out how to make his strengths work better for the show.

On tuesday, police finally caught the alleged burglars, the san francisco chronicle reports. Several local tips pointed them to patrick william mullen, 50, and randy hopper, 26 — including one neighbor who said he heard them bragging about the burglary. Police recovered one of richmond's rings and a bracelet from the suspects. Richmond responded with a suitably tart facebook post: \" i thought i'd let you know that i have forgiven you. I ' m afraid though, that your fellow inmates won't be as accepting of your behavior as i have been. I wish you luck in your future career as prison inmates.

Relying on white house tapes and interviews with people involved, the morning news describes a \" palpable tension \" radiating from haig's office even before the 1981 shooting. Deprived of a crisis-management role he coveted, haig quickly threatened to resign, but reagan talked him down. Who got the position? vice president george bush. Well, a crisis sure came up: on march 30, john hinckley jr shot the president and three others outside a washington hotel. But with bush stuck on air force two, haig assumed a commanding presence behind the scenes and before the press: \" constitutionally, gentlemen, you have the president, the vice president and the secretary of state, in that order, \" haig told them. \" as of now, i am in control here at the white house, pending return of the vice president. \" a reagan official later called the remarks \" eminently stupid \"; bush watched stoically on the plane's tv, saying nothing. He soon arrived at the white house, taking the helm and warmly greeting haig, who fell quiet. \" he came in with perfect equanimity, \" a former official says of bush. The vice president visited nancy reagan, spoke on national television, and suggested that officials create an air of normalcy prior to the president's return. Haig later resigned ( reportedly inspiring high-fives in the oval office ) and ran for the gop presidential nomination in 1988, but bush won the nomination — and the presidency.

        "summary": "The perception of neanderthals as big, stupid oafs has been mostly debunked. Now, a new study is helping buck another stereotype depicting the human relatives as especially prone to violence. The idea stems from trauma, particularly to the head and neck, visible among neanderthal remains. When researchers compiled reports on the skull bones of 114 neanderthals and 90 early modern humans who inhabited europe and asia some 20,000 to 80,000 years ago, however, they found similar levels of head injuries in both groups, per npr and nature. \" there is no statistical difference between the two, which means that they cannot be differentiated, \" says katerina harvati of germany's university of tuebingen, whose study was published wednesday in nature. The study not only suggests danger from interpersonal violence, accidents, and predator attacks was as real for neanderthals as for our own ancestors, it shows other similarities among the two groups. For example, males had a higher rate of trauma than females, as is true of humans today. Neanderthals who suffered trauma were more likely to die before the age of 30, though, with researchers speculating that they might've had a greater risk of death after injury or weren't as adept at caring for their injured as early modern humans. This \" might be a key insight into why our species had such a demographic advantage over neanderthals, \" per the nature report, which raises the possibility that neanderthals might've still had more non-cranial injuries than early modern humans.

            "Neanderthals are commonly depicted as leading dangerous lives and permanently struggling for survival. This view largely relies on the high incidences of trauma that have been reported1,2 and have variously been attributed to violent social behaviour3,4, highly mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyles2 or attacks by carnivores5. The described neanderthal pattern of predominantly cranial injuries is further thought to reflect violent encounters with large prey mammals, resulting from the use of close-range hunting weapons1. These interpretations directly shape our understanding of neanderthal lifestyles, health and hunting abilities, yet mainly rest on descriptive, case-based evidence. Quantitative, population-level studies of traumatic injuries are rare.

            "Neanderthals are commonly depicted as leading dangerous lives and permanently struggling for survival. This view largely relies on the high incidences of trauma that have been reported1,2 and have variously been attributed to violent social behaviour3,4, highly mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyles2 or attacks by carnivores5. The described neanderthal pattern of predominantly cranial injuries is further thought to reflect violent encounters with large prey mammals, resulting from the use of close-range hunting weapons1. These interpretations directly shape our understanding of neanderthal lifestyles, health and hunting abilities, yet mainly rest on descriptive, case-based evidence. Quantitative, population-level studies of traumatic injuries are rare. Here we reassess the hypothesis of higher cranial trauma prevalence among neanderthals using a population-level approach — accounting for preservation bias and other contextual data — and an exhaustive fossil database. We show that neanderthals and early upper palaeolithic anatomically modern humans exhibit similar overall incidences of cranial trauma, which are higher for males",
            "Injuries are part of everyday life, from a scratch on the skin to a broken bone to a fatal trauma. Although many injuries are accidental, others can arise as a consequence of an individual's or a group's behaviour, activity or social norms — characteristics that tell us about societies and the inherent tensions and risks within and between different groups. Writing in nature, beier et al.1 provide evidence that challenges the long-standing view2 that neanderthal populations experienced a level of traumatic injuries that was significantly higher than that of humans. The result calls into question claims2,3 that the behaviour and technologies of neanderthals exposed them to particularly high levels of risk and danger. Read the paper: similar cranial trauma prevalence among neanderthals and upper palaeolithic modern humans reports of injuries and deaths are constantly in the news. As well as being drawn to read the stories of individuals, such information is",

        "summary": "Abraham lincoln helped free a black male slave long before the civil war, and researchers say they've found the man's grave — in a former psychiatric hospital's cemetery, the ap reports. A budding lawyer, lincoln won a case before the illinois supreme court in 1841 that released nance legins-costley from indentured servitude, which historians say amounted to slavery for a black woman. Legins-costley walked away with her 10-month-old son, william henry costley, and lived to a ripe old age in her central illinois hometown of pekin. But what became of the first black male slave freed by lincoln? an amateur historian named carl adams spent years investigating the story and published a book about legins-costley last year, nance: trials of the first slave freed by abraham lincoln — a true story of nance legins-costley. The editor of a history journal says nance tells \" the only story of lincoln that is really new, \" according to a site dedicated to the book. Costley apparently enlisted in a colored-troops regiment from illinois in 1864, was wounded in the war, and found himself dispatched in galveston, texas. A few years later, an all-white jury found him not guilty in the shooting death of a man considered disreputable; costley said he was protecting a woman when he pulled the trigger. Eventually, costley moved to minnesota, became an invalid, and lived in a psychiatric hospital in rochester. There, adams says, lies a grave that matches a number from hospital records as costley's. It also recently received a \" costley \" headstone. \" i think it is so likely that it's nearly a sure thing, \" says a lincoln expert.

        "summary": "Reading books does more than ward off dementia: it also increases your lifespan, according to yale researchers. In fact, the more time a person spends reading, the less likely they are to die. Researchers asked 3,635 people over 50 about their reading habits, then checked back in after 12 years. They found reading books for up to 3.5 hours per week — or an average of 30 minutes per day — lowered a person's risk of death by 17 %, reports the new york times. People who read books for more than 3.5 hours per week enjoyed a 23 % lower risk of death. Researchers say books encourage \" cognitive engagement \" and \" promote empathy, social perception, and emotional intelligence, which are cognitive processes that can lead to greater survival, \" per the guardian. People who read newspapers and magazines also had a \" survival advantage \" over people who didn't read at all, but it was significantly less than with book readers, who were predominantly female, college-educated, and earning a high income. \" books engage the reader's mind more — providing more cognitive benefit, and therefore increasing the lifespan, \" a researcher explains. Overall, 33 % of non-readers died after 12 years, compared to 27 % of book readers. Book readers also lived two years longer than non-readers on average. \" these findings suggest that the benefits of reading books include a longer life in which to read them, \" researchers say, per upi, urging people to pick up a book rather than the remote.

        "summary": "Motion sickness is, some scientists think, caused by conflicting messages that our ears and eyes send to our brain when we are in motion. In three out of 10 of us, it can be downright debilitating, resulting in cold sweats, dizziness, severe nausea, and more. But now researchers at imperial college london are reporting in the journal neurology that they've built a device that can essentially trick the brain into not being confused via a mild electrical current delivered through the scalp. Not only did it help the volunteers in the study feel less sick when placed in a rotating chair that can \" make you very sick, very quickly, \" lead researcher dr. Qadeer arshad tells cbs news, but it can even be preventative, and all without adverse effects. Arshad is so confident in his team's findings that he predicts the device will be ready in five to 10 years, and that the misery of motion sickness will then be a thing of the past. \" we hope it might even integrate with a mobile phone, which would be able to deliver the small amount of electricity required via the headphone jack, \" arshad says. \" you would temporarily attach small electrodes to your scalp before traveling — on a cross channel ferry, for example. \" the technology might even extend to other applications since the treatment enhances concentration, too. Arshad says he's already fielded interest from the military, \" and we imagine that other groups such as students and people who spend long periods playing computer games will also want to try it out. \" ( nearly one in five injuries at theme parks are thanks to motion sickness. )",

But now jahi is on life support even as her family tries to comprehend what went wrong. The california teen was having her tonsils removed in an attempt to alleviate her sleep apnea, but after the surgery at oakland children's hospital last monday, something went wrong while she was in recovery. She was initially awake and talking, but within 30 minutes was choking on her own blood and couldn't speak, nbc bay area reports. She continued to bleed from her nose and mouth, ktvu reports. \" my daughter had actual clots sliding out of her mouth and they gave me a cup and said, ' here catch them with the cup so we can measure them, \" winkfield tells abc local. Adds jahi's grandmother, herself a nurse at a different facility, \" i went in and i said ' is this normal, do you guys find this to be normal? ' and they said ' i don't really know, ' and i said ' well then get a doctor. ' \" an uncle claims that the family had to suction the blood themselves when no staff immediately responded. Jahi ultimately went into cardiac arrest, and though she was revived, she is now brain-dead. The family, which says hospital staff is pressuring them to turn off life support, wants an investigation. Doctors say the teen is not expected to recover, cbs local reports.",

The intercept reports that six of larpenter's deputies raided another police officer's home this week in a bid to find the author of the exposedat blog, which calls itself an \" underground watchdog group \" devoted to exposing corruption. After a search warrant was executed, investigators seized computers and cellphones from the home of wayne anderson, a former parish deputy who now serves in the police force of houma, the parish seat. He's accused of defaming insurance agent tony alford in several blog posts, including one that points out that alford's office is managed by larpenter's wife — and that larpenter gave alford the sheriff's office insurance contract. When wwl asked the sheriff whether he should be using the police to expose somebody who questioned his use of public money, he said, \" if you're gonna lie about me and make it under a fictitious name, i ' m gonna come after you. \" jerri smitko, one of anderson's attorneys, says he was placed on leave soon after the raid. She says he denies being the blog's author, but the blog is clearly free speech protected under the first amendment no matter who's behind it. \" i don't want to have to worry about getting falsely arrested or having a bogus search warrant executed on me or anyone else, just because we exercised our constitutional rights, \" smitko says. \" that's not the society we're supposed to be living in. \"",

One woman told police that after assange pulled her clothes off, she \" tried to put on some articles of clothing as it was going too quickly and uncomfortably but assange ripped them off again. \" she said assange held her arms and pinned her legs and prevented her from reaching for a condom. He eventually agreed to use one, but she said he had \" done something \" to it that caused it to tear, and they had unprotected sex. As has been previously reported, the second woman says she woke to assange having unprotected sex with her. The times notes a potential positive for assange: the report shows that both women continued their relationships with him after the encounters, a fact that his supporters have used to buttress their case that the charges are trumped up. The women say they went to police only after talking to each other and realizing they had similar experiences — and when assange refused their request to get tested for stds.

Assange's legal troubles. The swedish report traces events over a four-day period in august when mr. Assange, a 39-year-old australian, had what he has described as consensual sexual relationships with two swedish women. Their accounts, which form the basis of an extradition case against mr. Assange, state that their encounters with him began consensually, but became nonconsensual when he persisted in having unprotected sex with them in defiance of their insistence that he use a condom. The case has prompted widespread controversy, with supporters of mr. Assange alleging that he is the victim, and the women are complicit, in an american-inspired vendetta seeking to punish wikileaks for posting hundreds of thousands of secret american documents on the internet. The conspiracy, supporters of mr. Assange have said, hinges on what they have described as an improbable coincidence: that he is facing potential criminal charges in a sex case just as he is challenging the united states government. These critics have also pointed to possible political manipulation of the swedish prosecutor's office, which had dropped the most serious allegations against mr. Assange",

        "summary": "Russia not only warned the fbi about tamerlan tsarnaev in 2011, it raised concerns to the cia as well, reports the washington post. In response, the cia asked the national counterterrorism center — the top us counterterror agency — to add tsarnaev's name to a database that feeds national watch lists. Tsarnaev's name did indeed get added to the database, says the post, and that's sure to raise more questions about why authorities weren't keeping a closer watch on him. Russia reportedly spoke to the cia months after the fbi closed its own inquiry into tsarnaev and deemed him to be no risk. As with most developing stories in the boston investigation, different services have different takes. Reuters, for instance, agrees that the elder tsarnaev's name got added to the terrorist identities datamart environment, or tide, but it says that happened because of the 2011 fbi inquiry. It has no mention of the cia angle. Reuters adds that the tide database is so big — with more than 500,000 names — that there's no guarantee people who show up on it will face close scrutiny.",

            "A combination of handout pictures released through the fbi website on april 18, 2013 show dzhokhar and tamerlan tsarnaev ( l ), suspects wanted for questioning in relation to the boston marathon bombing april 15. Washington the name of one of the boston marathon bombing suspects, tamerlan tsarnaev, was listed on the u.s. Government's highly classified central database of people it views as potential terrorists. But the list is so vast that this did not mean authorities automatically kept close tabs on him, sources close to the bombing investigation said on tuesday. Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a police shootout early friday, while his younger brother dzhokhar, 19, was captured later that day. Prosecutors say the brothers, ethnic chechens who had been living in the united states for more than a decade, planted two bombs that exploded near the finish line of the marathon on april 15, killing three people and wounding more than 200. The sources said tamerlan tsarnaev's details were entered into tide, a database maintained by the national counterterrorism center, because the fbi spoke to him in 2011 while investigating a russian tip-off that he had become a follower of radical islamists. The fbi found nothing to suggest he was an active threat, but all the same placed his name on the \" terrorist identities datamart environment \" list. The fbi has not said what it did find about tsarnaev. But the database, which holds more than half a million names, is only a repository of information on people who u.s. Authorities see as known, suspected or potential terrorists from around the world. Because of its huge size, u.s. Investigators do not routinely monitor everyone registered there, said u.s. Officials familiar with the database. As of 2008, tide contained more than 540,000 names, although they represented about 450,000 actual people, because some of the entries are aliases or different name spellings for the same person. Fewer than 5 percent of the tide entries were u.s. Citizens or legal residents, according to a description of the database on the nctc website. Tide and other databases the tide database is one of many federal security databases set up after the september 11, 2001, attacks. The database system has been criticized in the past for being too cumbersome, especially in light of an attempted attack on a plane in 2009.

The ap reports that robert hutton was located in april after his sister submitted his name as a possible gacy victim, cook county sheriff tom dart said yesterday. Investigators in dart's office collected dna samples two years ago from the remains of eight unnamed victims in an effort to id them, and investigators acted quickly on the hutton lead because of how closely he fit the victim profile: hutton, who was 21 when he was last heard from in 1972, was a hitchhiker who often traveled by bus, worked in construction, and presumably passed through chicago, where gacy lived. Investigators eventually traced a man with the same identifying information to colorado, only to learn he had moved. They later located the same man in rural montana, and he confirmed to local law enforcement authorities that he was the same robert hutton who disappeared in 1972. The sheriff's detective who spoke with hutton tells the sun-times, \" he said that he had just gotten caught up in the ' 70s lifestyle, so to speak... Years went by and he became a little bit embarrassed that he hadn't had contact with his family, and i think it made it easier to dismiss them. \" dart said hutton has visited his father and plans to visit his sister. The sun-times has this odd fact: hutton lived in the same montana town as his father's brother-in-law, and the two had actually met — but never swapped last names. Since the gacy investigation was reopened, one additional victim has been identified and seven missing persons cases have been closed; five were found alive and two had died of natural causes.",

But by 1967, both were widowed and bonding over their shared loneliness. A year later, their relationship had turned romantic, at least on one side. Ormsby gore — a close friend of jfk and a former british ambassador to the us — proposed marriage to jacqueline, who declined and wed aristotle onassis instead, reports the new york times. \" if ever i can find some healing and some comfort — it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain, \" she wrote in one of 19 letters to ormsby gore to be sold at auction by bonhams in london next month. \" i can find that now — if the world will let us. \" in a draft letter, ormsby gore described how his \" pathetic plans \" for the pair had been dashed. \" as for your photograph i weep when i look at it, \" he wrote. After marrying onassis, jacqueline replied, \" we have known so much &amp; shared &amp; lost so much together. I hope that bond of love and pain will never be cut. \" a rep for bonhams says it's rare to find items with \" this quantity of insight into jackie's personal life and that level of intimacy. \" the letters, along with ormsby gore's white house pass from the day after jfk's assassination, are among several family heirlooms that will be sold to pay for the upkeep of the ormsby gore family's historic home in wales, reports the telegraph.

        "summary": "Russell ladd remembers seeing the shipwreck as a boy fishing with his father at low tide. His father told him it was the clotilda, the last american slave ship, though ladd wasn't sure he believed him. He might now. Using ladd's account and historical records, including the journal of clotilda's captain, al.com reporter ben raines believes he's found the remains of the ship that illegally carried 110 slaves to mobile county, ala., from benin, africa, in 1860, more than 50 years after the transfer of new slaves was outlawed. According to historian sylvianne diouf's book, dreams of africa in alabama, plantation owner timothy meaher made a bet that he could sneak slaves into mobile, and hired capt. William foster for the job. When the clotilda returned to mobile, the slaves were removed. \" then i burned her and sunk her in 20 feet of water, \" foster wrote in his journal. Foster described burning the ship next to 12 mile island in the lower mobile-tensaw delta, which is where raines found a burnt wreck sticking out of the mud \" like a dinosaur backbone \" at extremely low tide, per the los angeles times. Built around the same time as the clotilda, it's the same width at 23 feet. But though its 124-foot length doesn't line up with what was reported as the clotilda's 86-foot expanse, raines believes this figure might instead refer to the distance between the clotilda's rudder and the base of the bow, as this was used to estimate cargo capacity. \" the location is right, the construction seems to be right, from the proper time period, it appears to be burnt. So i'd say very compelling, \" says archaeologist greg cook. Raines hopes an excavation will confirm his theory, but notes that permits \" and a lot of money \" need to be acquired first.",

What's left of the ship lies partially buried in mud alongside an island in the lower mobile-tensaw delta, a few miles north of the city of mobile. The hull is tipped to the port side, which appears almost completely buried in mud. The entire length of the starboard side, however, is almost fully exposed. The wreck, which is normally underwater, was exposed during extreme low tides brought on by the same weather system that brought the \" bomb cyclone \" to the eastern seaboard. Low tide around mobile was about two and a half feet below normal thanks to north winds that blew for days. \" i ' m quaking with excitement. This would be a story of world historical significance, if this is the clotilda, \" said john sledge, a senior historian with mobile historical commission, and author of the mobile river, an exhaustive history of the river. \" it's certainly in the right vicinity...
