On thursday, trump had demanded a vote on the republican replacement for obamacare despite it appearing primed to fail. On friday, cnn reports trump called ryan and asked him to pull the bill without a vote. Sean spicer says trump \" left everything on the field \" trying to make a deal to get the ahca approved. Hospital and insurer stocks saw an immediate improvement with the news there would be no vote, according to reuters.",

Swift, the great-nephew of daniel boone who came to the state in the mid-1800s with a plan to be a fur trapper. Gold called his name instead. He found it at bidwell's bar, with the paper quoting a fellow prospector as saying swift was an exceptional miner who \" must have made $ 100,000 \" in one prospecting season. Indeed, reports at the time indicate he arrived in san francisco with more than $ 500,000 in gold, which he had minted into octagonal slugs — and began to bury around the bay area. The vacaville reporter previously reported that swift reburied roughly $ 100,000 in gold after building his mansion in 1858, but the chronicle reports a \" scatter-brained \" swift failed to recall where he had put much of it. He died in 1875 with much of his haul secreted away in forgotten locations. Some was found in the early 20th century, including $ 30,000 found in 1904 while repairing a chimney on his property. But the last big find was in 1914, suggesting, in the chronicle's view, there's more out there to be found... And not much more than unhelpful-seeming clues to go on. The reporter notes a \" list in his handwriting miraculously survived, \" but the clues are of this sort: \" 1 tin box &amp; 1 little bottle boath in the saim hoal. \"",

The kentuckian had come to california as a 19-year-old, nine years before the gold rush would change the state forever. Young swift, whose great-uncle was the legendary explorer daniel boone, hoped he would make his fortune in fur trapping — but he soon made his name as an insurrectionist. In 1846, swift was one of 33 americans who captured sonoma during the bear flag revolt. He stayed on in sonoma for another year, commanding a company and earning the rank of captain, before the lure of wealth called to him again.

White also said the sec was working on rules to prevent the computers from engaging in strategies that put the market at risk of massive swings, like the infamous flash crash.

Even if the materials, called dispersants, are effective, bp has already bought up more than a third of the world's supply. If the leak from 5,000 feet beneath the surface continues for weeks, or months, that stockpile could run out. On thursday bp began using the chemical compounds to dissolve the crude oil, both on the surface and deep below, deploying an estimated 100,000 gallons. Dispersing the oil is considered one of the best ways to protect birds and keep the slick from making landfall. But the dispersants contain harmful toxins of their own and can concentrate leftover oil toxins in the water, where they can kill fish and migrate great distances. The exact makeup of the dispersants is kept secret under competitive trade laws, but a worker safety sheet for one product, called corexit, says it includes 2-butoxyethanol, a compound associated with headaches, vomiting and reproductive problems at high doses. \"there is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil, \" said richard charter, a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills who is a senior policy advisor for marine programs for defenders of wildlife and"

Even if the materials, called dispersants, are effective, bp has already bought up more than a third of the world's supply. If the leak from 5,000 feet beneath the surface continues for weeks, or months, that stockpile could run out. On thursday bp began using the chemical compounds to dissolve the crude oil, both on the surface and deep below, deploying an estimated 100,000 gallons. Dispersing the oil is considered one of the best ways to protect birds and keep the slick from making landfall. But the dispersants contain harmful toxins of their own and can concentrate leftover oil toxins in the water, where they can kill fish and migrate great distances. The exact makeup of the dispersants is kept secret under competitive trade laws, but a worker safety sheet for one product, called corexit, says it includes 2-butoxyethanol, a compound associated with headaches, vomiting and reproductive problems at high doses. \"there is a chemical toxicity to the dispersant compound that in many ways is worse than oil, \" said richard charter, a foremost expert on marine biology and oil spills who is a senior policy advisor for marine programs for defenders of wildlife and"

As giuliani waits for a response, another member of trump's inner circle — roger stone — predicts that mueller \" is coming for me, \" reports the hill. Stone is so sure of it that he sent an email to supporters requesting donations for his legal defense fund. \" i ' m next on the crooked special prosecutor's hit list because i've advised donald trump for the past 39 years, \" he wrote.

        "summary": "Scientists trying to better understand the nation's rising opioid addictions have uncovered an interesting wrinkle: a patient's risk of getting hooked might depend on which er doctor they happen to get. In a new england journal of medicine study, researchers found that patients whose er doctors are more likely to prescribe opioids are more likely to develop an addiction compared to the patients of er doctors who prescribe less frequently. It may sound like an obvious chain of events, but it remains unclear why two patients given the same opioid prescription after similar complaints have different addiction risks depending on their er doc. The takeaway is \" not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients, \" the lead author tells the new york times. But \" their patients have worse outcomes that we weren't aware of before. \" after tracking 375,000 medicare patients in ers between 2008 and 2011, researchers found that one in every 48 patients prescribed opioids ends up using them long-term, or more than half a year. But when comparing \" high-intensity \" prescribing docs ( who gave opioids to one in four patients ) to \" low-intensity \" prescribers ( one in 14 ), patients of the first group had a 30 % greater risk of turning into long-time users. It may be a simple numbers game, as observed in a post at pacific standard: \" the more prescriptions doctors give out, the more likely they ' ll end up handing a script to someone who will have a serious problem later. \" but one doctor sees a larger issue: among er doctors, there's no consensus \" about when to prescribe opioids and what dose to give. \" ( this is how long it takes to become dependent. )",

We defined an index visit as the earliest visit at which a beneficiary had an evaluation and a management claim by an emergency medicine physician with a place-of-service designation in the emergency department. Emergency medicine physicians were defined as physicians with an emergency medicine specialty who billed 90 % or more of claims with an emergency department place of service. We included only one index visit to the emergency department per beneficiary and excluded all visits to the emergency department that resulted in a hospital admission. We limited our analyses to beneficiaries who had been continuously enrolled in medicare part d for 18 months or more, including at least the period from 6 months before the index visit to 12 months afterward. We included only beneficiaries who had not had an opioid prescription filled in the 6 months before the index visit. In addition, we excluded beneficiaries with hospice claims or a cancer diagnosis between 2008 and 2012. We assigned each index emergency department visit to a physician according to the billing national provider identifier ( npi ) and then linked each visit to a hospital by matching to facility claims in the outpatient department file according to the date and beneficiary.

As the opioid epidemic continues to devastate communities around the country, the study was the latest attempt to identify a starting point on the path to excessive use. \"this is the analysis we have been looking for to show the risk of a single exposure of a patient in an emergency room to an opioid, \" said dr.

The attacks come a day after intense gun battles in the southern city of aden, between rival troops loyal to yemen's former and current president, left 13 dead and forced closure of the city's international airport. Witnesses said that at least two suicide bombers attacked inside the badr mosque. One walked inside the mosque and detonated his device, causing panic as dozens of worshippers rushed toward the outside gates. A second suicide bomber then attacked amid panicked crowds trying to escape. One witness at the al-hashoosh mosque, located in sanaa's northern district, said that he was thrown 6 feet by the blast. \" the heads, legs, and arms of the dead people were scattered on the floor of the mosque, \" mohammed al-ansi told the ap, adding, \" blood is running like a river. \" al-ansi added that many of those who didn't die in the explosion were seriously injured by shattered glass falling from the mosque's windows. The shiite tv network aired footage from inside al-hashoosh mosque, where screaming volunteers used bloodied blankets to carry victims. Among the dead: a small child.",

        "summary": "Vincent van gogh may have cut off his own ear in response to what most people would consider happy news, according to a writer who has taken a fresh look at one of history's famous self-mutilations. Martin bailey says van gogh didn't take a razor to his ear because of an argument with fellow artist paul gauguin, though the two did quarrel that day in 1888, the guardian reports. Instead, van gogh cut his ear off because he had learned that his brother, theo, was going to get married, bailey says. He says the struggling artist feared that the marriage would end his close relationship with his brother — and that it would cause theo to cut off the financial support van gogh relied on. Bailey says that van gogh didn't learn of the engagement while he was recovering in hospital, as previously thought, but in a letter that was delivered to him in provence just hours before the self-mutilation. \" had van gogh been elated by the engagement, it is virtually inconceivable that he would have sliced off part of his ear a few hours after receiving theo's news, whatever other difficulties he was facing, \" bailey writes in new book studio of the south, per the telegraph. Bailey, writing in the art newspaper, says his research into van gogh's years in provence has also yielded clues to the whereabouts of van gogh's famous bed. He believes it was donated to needy people in a small dutch town months after the end of world war ii. ( this museum grew an ear from van gogh dna. )",

Just then the shark struck. \"it felt like something very heavy had a very hard grip on my leg, \" he said. \"i didn't feel pain from the lacerations. I ' m not quite sure it pulled me under. Some people said they saw my head go under. I don't remember that. \" myers said the shark grabbed his left foot, and he kicked with his free right foot at what he believes was the creature's snout. \"i've got a lot of lacerations on my right foot where i kicked at it, and i imagine i kicked its teeth and it let me go, \" he said. \"i imagine it must have been the snout i was kicking. \" earlier this week state",
            "Last monday's shark attack off truro's ballston beach – the first in 76 years on cape cod – set off a media furor and horrified beachgoers along the storied massachusetts peninsula that attracts millions of vacationers every summer. It may also force the hordes that crowd the cape's beaches to relearn a lesson lost for decades when seals had all but disappeared from the new england coasts – that swimming among shark's prey is very dangerous. Lifeguards were on high alert, hundreds of spurious dorsal fin sightings were reported and airborne spotters scanned the offshore swells for great white sharks, the prime suspect in the attack on chris myers, 50. More than 300,000 grey seals, and their vulnerable pups, now live on the cape – a population 30 times the nadir in the 1960s – and the return of the seals has attracted a return, inshore, of great white sharks. \"the reason the great white sharks are coming closer to shore in the cape cod area, specifically on the eastern shore, is because of the growing grey seal population, \" said greg skomal, a massachusetts marine biologist. Mr. Myers and his 16-year-old son were swimming several hundred metres offshore, close to known seal colonies, when something bit his lower legs.

Lonnie franklin jr., 63, was convicted of murdering 10 women, one only 15 years old, between 1985 and 2007 in south los angeles. A jury will now decide whether franklin receives life in prison or the death penalty. Franklin, a former garbage collector and police garage attendant, would kill his victims and leave them partially clothed or naked in alleys and dumpsters near his home, according to cnn. He was tied to killings in 2010 using new dna technology. The ap reports a cop posing as a busboy got franklin's dna off pizza crusts and napkins following a birthday celebration. It matched saliva found on the breasts of many of the victims. More than 60 witnesses testified during the three-month trial. A surviving victim ( franklin was also found guilty of attempted murder ) recalled franklin luring her into his car, abruptly shooting her in the chest, then getting on top of her. The last thing she remembered before passing out was a camera flash. She said he pushed her out of the car when he thought she was dead. A number of franklin's victims were prostitutes or drug addicts; all of them were black. The murders never gained the attention received by other slayings in california, and many blamed police indifference for them going unsolved. Families of the victims, many in tears, were present when the verdict was read. \" he doesn't value life, \" cnn quotes the sister of franklin's 15-year-old victim as saying. \" he doesn't care. \" prosecutors believe they have evidence of at least five more victims.",

The two 3-year-old siblings of the 19-month-old little girl who died, j ' zyra thompson, told authorities that one of them put the baby in the oven and the other one turned it on and made it \" hot, \" abc 13 reports. J ' zyra, they said, kicked the oven door while she was trapped inside. The oldest sibling, 5, was apparently asleep at the time, click2houston reports. When racqual thompson, the children's mother, returned home from going out with her boyfriend to get takeout pizza and pick up a prescription, she attempted cpr, but it was too late. J ' zyra died of multiple burns. Police say racqual thompson had left the children without informing a grandmother who also lived at the apartment complex. The three surviving children are in foster care, as cps could not find suitable relatives to care for them. Criminal charges are expected, though none have yet been filed. ( in kentucky, an arrest has been made in the killing of a girl who went missing at a football game. )",

The interior department cancelled auctions for drilling rights in the chukchi and beaufort seas while declining to extend the arctic leases of shell ( expires in 2017 ) and statoil ( expires in 2020 ), according to npr. \" in light of shell's announcement, the amount of acreage already under lease, and current market conditions, it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the arctic in the next year and a half, \" interior secretary sally jewell says in a statement. The shell announcement jewell is talking about is the oil giant's decision last month to halt its arctic drilling after accidents, delays, and $ 7 billion with nothing to show for it, the times reports. The moves by the obama administration friday basically block drilling in the alaskan arctic for two years. It's a decision one alaskan senator calls \" stunning, \" \" destructive, \" and \" shortsighted. \" but miyoko sakashita of the environmental group center for biological diversity tells the bbc it's great news for the arctic and its wildlife. \" we need to keep all the arctic oil in the ground, \" she says. The us geological survey believes the arctic holds about 13 % of the world's undiscovered oil, but the times reports offshore arctic drilling is declining — due to concerns over safety, cost, and the environment — in the us, canada, and greenland.",

Steinle was fatally shot on july 1, 2015, as she walked on pier 14. Zarate's defense attorneys said he found a handgun wrapped in a shirt under a chair and it accidentally went off as he picked it up, nbc reports. The gun turned out to have been stolen from a federal agent days earlier, and prosecutors argued that zarate deliberately pointed it at the 32-year-old steinle. Zarate — who was wanted for a sixth deportation when he was arrested for the shooting — was found guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and will be sentenced at a later date. Months before the shooting, zarate was released under san francisco's \" sanctuary city \" policy, and trump complained friday that he \" came back and back over the weakly protected obama border. \" he added that the \" schumer/pelosi democrats \" are weak on crime and \" will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 elections. \" steinle died in the arms of her father, jim steinle, who tells the san francisco chronicle that the family is shocked and saddened by the verdict. \" justice was rendered but not served, \" he says.",

Yet i never see those critics go after other sources of privacy violations, such as say the friends and acquaintances who gossip behind our backs. If privacy were so important, you might expect the overall campaign to be \"pro-privacy \" rather than just \"anti-corporate \" or \"anti-tech. \" one possibility is that service users don't see much of a chance that the \"zip files \" assembled on them by the algorithms stand much chance of harming their fortunes or even being released in decipherable form. Still, people are made vaguely uncomfortable by some of what is going on. Could it be a \"control \" issue rather than a privacy issue? that is, people do not like \"feeling out of control \" when it comes to their lives, including their personal data. They used to \"feel in control \" and now they do not, in part because of the very media critics who view themselves as solving the privacy problem.

Galbraith's bio claims that he spent \" several years with the royal military police \" and that the protagonist of his novel — one-legged afghanistan veteran cormoran strike — \" grew directly out of his own experiences and those of his military friends. \" indeed, rowling created a full backstory for her alter ego, who apparently eventually found himself in the rmp's plain-clothes special investigative branch, before leaving for the civilian security industry. While so far rowling's invention appears to be flying under the radar, fake military service claims often prove contentious. In the us, it's even illegal to profit from them, thanks to the new stolen valor act, which was signed into law last month to replace an earlier version struck down by the supreme court.

With a time of 18.7 seconds in the 50-meter preliminary, phelps — outfitted in a special wetsuit and monofin — \" lost \" to a hammerhead ( time: 15.1 ), but \" won \" over a reef shark ( 18.9 seconds ). Phelps lost the 100-meter competition ( one of his world-record specialties, per the independent ) against the great white, 38.1 to 36.1, per tmz. Ew.com reports the two early races were in the bahamas, while the main event was filmed last month in south africa; the washington post notes that swim took place in 56-degree open water. Phelps acknowledged the chilly swim after the special aired, tweeting: \" rematch? next time.. Warmer water. \" ( live science explains how great whites manage in such frigid temps. ) other fans simply laughed at the outrage. \" wait...

        "summary": "A utah bill designed to outlaw do-it-yourself abortions has drawn national attention, with bloggers railing that the law could punish women for accidental miscarriages. The bill, which has already passed both chambers of utah's legislature, would allow women to be charged with homicide if they committed an \"intentional, knowing or reckless act \" that led to a miscarriage. It was created after a woman allegedly paid a man to beat her until she miscarried. But critics warned that the legal definition of \"reckless \" is so broad that women could be jailed for not wearing a seatbelt, or returning to an abusive spouse, notes jezebel. It's also the rare abortion law directly targeting women. \"for all these years the anti-choice movement has said, 'we want to outlaw abortion, not put women in jail, ' \" one pro-choice group tells rh reality check, \"but what this law says is, 'no, we really want to put women in jail.

He returned from belgium after six years, having suffered a serious brain injury, and committed suicide in 1948. Unbeknownst to any of his children in canada, hellyer also left behind their half-sister overseas, the result of an affair he had while stationed in ghent. Belgium's florence heene, 71, who knew only that her father was a canadian soldier named herbert, found his photo in a box of her mother's things and shared it on facebook recently in an effort to find out more about him. Hellyer's great-granddaughter saw the photo circulating in the media in canada — a blogger at the toronto sun was among those on the case — and thought it looked familiar. In a box of her own mother's items, she found an identical picture hellyer had sent home during the war, signed, \" love from daddy. \" \" i ' m an elderly woman, i know what went on in the war and it's to be expected, \" janes, 79, says of her father's affair.

Police also say there were no signs of forced entry, and the photos were returned less than a week later. The gelatin-silver prints were made by alex v.

In his post-charlottesville remarks, president trump blamed the antifa movement for contributing to the violence, and sunday's confrontation \" marked another street brawl between opposing ends of the political spectrum — violence that has become a regular feature of the trump years and gives signs of spiraling upward, \" per the washington post. So just what is antifa? in a new york times op-ed, columbia professor todd gitlin offers some insights, describing antifa as the \" backlash to the backlash, a defensive response to the growing presence of right-wing extremism. \" given antifa members ' willingness to use violence, he sees cause for concern. \" they do not advocate a positive doctrine, racial or otherwise, \" writes gitlin of antifa adherents. \" some supporters consider themselves ( as mr. Trump accurately said ) anarchists, some marxists of different stripes. \" no national organization exists, and groups ( usually all men ) spring up locally. Antifa groups typically are unarmed, but gitlin sees the potential for that to change as confrontations with right-wing groups escalate. \" if effectively contained and self-contained, many of its supporters would likely return to the kind of nonviolent left-wing, anti-racist organizing that they were involved in before mr.

Authorities continued to try to find a match for the print over the years, and finally an fbi squad that typically focuses on disaster victims found one. Hernandez, who until friday was known only as john doe no. 80, was identified thanks to a couple of minor arrests prior to his death. His only known relative, a sister living in mexico, was notified. Hernandez was buried in a mass grave with other unclaimed bodies. Because the pep boys had been set on fire, his death was ruled a homicide. It remains one of the 23 unsolved homicides related to the riots, which left 53 people dead and more than 2,000 injured. The deadliest riots in us history started after a jury acquitted four white police officers accused of beating rodney king, a black motorist.",

The coroner's office did not immediately respond to questions friday about whether hernandez's fingerprints had been run through databases previously. Attempts to reach hernandez's family members on friday were unsuccessful. The looting and violence that would turn into one of the deadliest race riots in american history was sparked after a jury acquitted four white police officers in the beating of black motorist rodney king. Video shot by a citizen captured officers repeatedly striking, kicking and using a stun gun on king, even after he was on the ground.

            "Frankly, i ' m not going to get whipped up over whether a woman wants to give birth in a hospital or a swimming pool or on a pile of leaves, but i do find the premise of having an entire film crew around to document and televise the experience does somewhat undercut the whole \" in the wild \" thing a bit. And i definitely find lifetime's branding of childbirth as an insistently \" crazy \" event spectacularly offensive. Japanese game shows are crazy. Sandy hook truthers are crazy. Birth is actually just how human beings arrive on the planet, thanks. But what if birthing babies in a creek isn't your idea of solid appointment television? wait, there's more. What about \" girlfriend intervention, \" a new show that's basically \" queer eye for the straight guy \" but instead of gay men it's black women and instead of straights it's whites? here, let lifetime describe it for you: \" our wise, poised and stylish african american women, in each episode, help a white sister seeking a complete makeover to restore her confidence and inner glow …. Who better to teach a woman how to get that sparkle in her eye and spring back in her step? \" note street cred bestowing use of the word \"",
            "Lifetime's new reality show is delivering some controversy before it's even been born. The network announced wednesday a new series titled born in the wild that chronicles pregnant women giving birth outdoors, unassisted by doctors. \"what happens when the craziest experience of a woman's life becomes truly wild, and soon-to-be parents decide to take on an unassisted birth in the outdoors? \" asks the press release. \"born in the wild will document the journeys of young, expectant parents who have chosen to give birth 'in the wild. ' \" it's certainly a head-turning tv hook. But one obstetrician says we already know what happens when women give birth in the wild, and it isn't good. \"i understand everybody wants to believe we overmedicalize pregnancy and that it's a natural process. But it's a natural process that historically has caused an extraordinary loss of life, \" says ron jaekle, md, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the university of cincinnati medical center and the cincinnati children's hospital fetal center. \"there is not a single piece of literature that we had to read growing up that didn't talk about somebody's mother or wife dying in childbirth, it was part of the national vocabulary. In the 1900s, a women died for every 1,000 babies born"

Other orcas in the pod swimming through pacific northwest waters near the us-canada border are taking turns carrying the corpse after the effort caused the 20-year-old mother known as j35 to fall behind with labored breathing. Trailing the main pod with improved breathing, j35 was seen with the now-decomposing corpse thursday in the strait of juan de fuca alongside immediate family members who are keeping her fed, per kcpq. But \" because we've seen her so many times without the calf, we know that somebody else has it, \" jenny atkinson of san juan island's whale museum tells the cbc. The same pod held a similar display 15 years ago, but this is the longest period of orca mourning on record, per national geographic. Audio recordings indeed suggest the pod is using calls and whistles perhaps related to mourning. They sound \" more like a very urgent call, \" says atkinson. \" i think that what you're seeing is the depth of importance of this calf and the grief of the mother and the family. \" it's a tight-knit one: there are just 75 orcas in three pods in the southern resident population around oregon, washington, and vancouver island, down from 83 in 2016.

Declines in chinook salmon have hit the population hard, per nat geo.

Megna started seeing smaller symptoms, like a constantly runny nose and digestive issues, early on, but in 2006 blood began showing in his urine, and a diagnosis delivered heart-sinking news: he had a \" super-rare \" form of kidney disease that only 20 people in the world have. And while megna, who's been disabled since 2011, has applied for compensation cash from the james zadroga health and compensation act of 2010, there's a complication: kidney disease isn't one of the recognized illnesses covered by the fund. That means the divorced dad of three isn't eligible for any money — even though mary ann mclaughlin, a mount sinai medical center researcher who petitioned the fund two years ago to add the disease based on initial research, has examined megna's records and believes the wtc toxins \" may more likely than not \" be tied to his sickness. However, a rep for the cdc's national institute for occupational safety and health, which runs the program, says a disease can be added to the list — and compensation issued — only after \" published, peer-reviewed epidemiologic evidence \" shows \" substantial support \" for a direct link between the wtc fallout and the disease. Megna will have to hold tight, per the rep, who says once mclaughlin publishes her study, kidney disease eligibility will be considered. But that's time megna — $ 120,000 behind on his mortgage and anticipating dialysis down the road ( his kidneys are now functioning at 45 %, per the star-ledger ) — says he doesn't have. \" when they asked us to come down to help that day, i didn't wait, \" he tells the paper.",

Demonstrators chanted \" death to america, \" \" death to christians, \" and \" death to karzai, \" the latter referring to afghan president hamid karzai, in the biggest protests since unrest erupted last week over plans by a u.s. Pastor to burn the koran. \" there are more than 10,000 of the demonstrators and some of them are waving the taliban flag, \" police officer mohammad usman. The protests come three days before a parliamentary election which the taliban have vowed to disrupt. The election is a key test of stability in afghanistan before u.s. President barack obama conducts a war strategy review in december. They follow three days of protests at the weekend over plans by an obscure u.s. Pastor, which he later abandoned, to burn copies of the koran to mark the anniversary of the september 11, 2001, hijacked airliner attacks on the united states. Three people were killed in those protests. Observers including the top u.n. Diplomat in afghanistan had warned the taliban may try to exploit the koran-burning protests. A police source later said one person had been killed and five wounded, and that the toll could rise. The"

At age 16, ivins rosier confessed to breaking into the home of florida highway patrol trooper robert boody in west palm beach and shooting the 5-year-old german shepherd, the newspaper noted in may. Rosier's attorney argued that a detective \" hustled \" the boy during interrogation by equating the dog's death to the \" murder of a law enforcement officer \" ( which wasn't legally true ). Rosier's attorney also wanted his client sentenced as a juvenile with a maximum sentence of 6 years, cbs 12 reports. \" i believe this to be sadistic to do this to a child, \" said rosier's attorney, who plans to appeal. He conceded that rosier's crimes were serious, \" but when you look at the range of punishments available, that's why they call it juvenile. \" ultimately, rosier's sentence resulted from convictions on three felony counts: cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building. \" a gun in a 16-year-old's hand can do equally the damage as a gun in an adult's hand, \" said the prosecuting attorney. \" he's not a child. \" the trooper, boody, cried when testifying about how he came home to find his dog crippled by gunshot wounds.

        "summary": "Good news: a mathematical model has been created that could help save your life in the event that your city is hit by a nuclear bomb. Scientist michael dillon's model, published tuesday, is about reducing radiation risk from the bomb's fallout, and calculates \" optimal shelter exit time. \" the longstanding advice has been to immediately seek shelter, ideally underground, if a bomb hits. But there is better and worse shelter — the latter being \" lightweight \" buildings ( such as ones made of wood ) or ones without basements; the afp reports more than 20 % of us homes fall into the worse category. Here is dillon's determination for people living within 20 miles of a low-yield nuclear blast, meaning one a bit smaller than hiroshima: if it would take five minutes or less to reach better shelter ( that concrete basement, or the center of a large building, like a big office, reports livescience ), bypass the more immediate shelter and go there straight away. If better shelter is 15 minutes away, stay in the worse shelter for up to 30 minutes, then head out. As for the transit period, don't waste time worrying about protecting your body from the radiation, he says, which can mostly be rinsed off once you get to your shelter. The findings are actually intended for emergency planning officials, who can make use of the findings when designing \" an optimal low-yield nuclear detonation response strategy, \" writes dillon, who works at california's lawrence livermore national laboratory.",

            "Scientist releases guide to surviving a nuclear bomb in your city by agence france-presse tuesday, january 14, 2014 20: 51 edt a scientist published a guide wednesday to help authorities limit deaths from fallout after a city is hit by a nuclear bomb. Taking cover in existing buildings is widely accepted as a critical first action after a nuclear blast in a major city. But how long people should stay there before moving to better shelter is a more complex question. Buildings that are lightweight or lack a basement are more easily penetrated by radioactive dust. Writing in a british scientific journal, michael dillon of the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california, has now come up with a mathematical model for the \"optimal shelter exit time \" to minimise radiation risk. Based on his calculations, if adequate shelter is 15 minutes away, individuals should remain in their initial, poor-quality shelter no longer than 30 minutes after detonation. If, however, the better shelter is only five minutes away, individuals should move there immediately and forego the closer but unsafe buildings altogether, he wrote. Reaching adequate shelter rapidly could save between 10,000 and 100,000 individuals from fatal exposure in the event of a single, low-yield detonation, said the study published in proceedings of the royal society a. \"these methods are intended to assist emergency planning officials in the development of an",

The threats of catastrophic cold war-style nuclear bombs have subsided since international agreements like the 1970 treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons have taken hold to protect society from the annihilative attacks that flattened hiroshima and nagaski, in japan, during world war ii. Still, the threat of smaller-scale nuclear attacks with explosive energy orders of magnitude less intense has increased in recent years as the technology to build such weapons has become more prevalent. These smaller-scale detonations may not be strong enough to flatten cities, but they do produce harmful radioactive fallout that residents must avoid to reduce the nauseating effects of radiation poisoning and longer-term risks of cancer.

Researchers found that the diet, which focuses on fruits, veggies, whole grains, and olive oil, is good for our dna, the new york times reports. Nearly 4,700 women were followed for more than 20 years, and those whose diets were more similar to the mediterranean diet had longer telomeres — protective structures found on the ends of chromosomes that \" are often compared to the plastic caps that prevent shoelaces from unravelling, \" as larry husten explains at forbes. Shorter telomeres have been linked to shorter life expectancy and chronic diseases associated with aging. Chromosomes store our dna code, and telomeres help to prevent the loss of genetic information — so the mediterranean diet appears to \" stop our dna code from scrambling as we age, \" thus keeping us \" genetically younger, \" writes michelle roberts at the bbc. But husten cautions that, though the diet has been linked to other health benefits in the past, this study shouldn't be given too much weight. It appears to be \" excellent \" and \" well-performed, \" he writes, but it was an observational study, and as such has limitations — for example, it's possible that there were already genetic differences between subjects who adhered to the diet and those who didn't.",

But does our affection for these feline friends move in just one direction? new research in the journal plos one suggests that domesticated cats are more independent than dogs because they have less \" secure attachment \" to their owners. In this case, attachment \" is not simply an affectionate bond, \" the researchers write, but relates to \" the carer being perceived as a focus of safety and security in otherwise threatening environments. \" past research has indicated that some cats whose owners leave them alone display signs of separation anxiety, as dogs do. \" but the results of our study show that they are in fact much more independent than canine companions, \" says lead researcher daniel mills. \" it seems that what we interpret as separation anxiety might actually be signs of frustration. \" behavioral scientists at the university of lincoln in the uk tested this by observing cats in unfamiliar environments with their owners, with strangers, and alone. They were looking for three distinct characteristics of attachment: the amount of contact a cat sought, its level of passive behavior, and its distress when the owner was absent. Cats were, it turns out, more vocal when their owners left them than when strangers did, but they demonstrated no other signs of attachment, hence the possibility that the vocalization was not one of longing; the researchers posit it could indicate frustration or just be a \" learned response. \" \" our findings don't disagree with the notion that cats develop social preferences or close relationships, \" says mills, \" but they do show that these relationships do not appear to be typically based on a need for safety and security. \" ( one woman's attempt to rescue her cat from a cliff didn't go so well. )",

However methodological problems in this latter research make the claim that the cat-owner bond is typically a secure attachment, operationally definable by its behaviour in the sst, questionable. We therefore developed an adapted version of the sst with the necessary methodological controls which include a full counterbalance of the procedure. A cross-over design experiment with 20 cat-owner pairs ( 10 each undertaking one of the two versions of the sst first ) and continuous focal sampling was used to record the duration of a range of behavioural states expressed by the cats that might be useful for assessing secure attachment. Since data were not normally distributed, non-parametric analyses were used on those behaviours shown to be reliable across the two versions of the test ( which excluded much cat behaviour ). Although cats vocalised more when the owner rather the stranger left the cat with the other individual, there was no other evidence consistent with the interpretation of the bond between a cat and its owner meeting the requirements of a secure attachment.

Killed were steven craenmehr, who was riding a bike, and an austin woman who was riding a moped. She hasn't been identified. Craenmehr worked for amsterdam's massivemusic. Because he is charged with capital murder, owens faces the death penalty. \"that vehicle was used as a weapon, and he will be charged with those crimes, \" says austin's police chief. Two people remain in critical condition with head injuries, and six others are still in the hospital with lesser injuries. A soldier at fort hood, meanwhile, has reported that his car was stolen, and it appears to be the vehicle driven by owens, reports mysanantonio.com. Owens himself is not a fort hood soldier. In 2011, he was charged with driving under the influence and leaving the scene of an accident in fairbanks, alaska, reports a separate american-statesman story.",

British prime minister david cameron announced on monday that he will resign on wednesday afternoon, and a hot mic caught him singing a few notes to himself as he walked the few steps back to his no. 10 downing street residence after speaking to the press, cnn reports. He can be heard saying \" right \" as he steps inside and removes the microphone. Some have said the tune sounded like the start of the west wing theme, while others believe it sounded more like a winnie the pooh-style song, the guardian reports. After a detailed musical analysis, classic fm concluded that cameron's musical notes suggested \" wagnerian fanfare, beethoven-esque harmonic doubt, and then a strange contemporary flourish at the end, \" a composition that might demonstrate the \" unresolved nature of cameron's swift departure from office. \" the prime minister is expected to offer his resignation to the queen on wednesday. He will be replaced by theresa may, who prevailed in the conservative party's post-brexit leadership race after all of her opponents dropped out.

Recent complaints about the state of apple and photography have compelled me to take a journey down the historical highway in the hope of gaining some perspective on just where we stand in regard to taking and making images with our cameras. Why you should care about cloudkit if you've lived through the last couple iterations of os x and ios, you've probably had the opportunity to develop a special love/hate relationship with icloud.

        "summary": "For the last four decades, cobalt mining has been almost non-existent in the us. That's changing now with what the bbc labels a rush for the precious metal recently named as critical to the us economy. With increases in price and demand for the silver-blue mineral — used in everything from the lithium-ion batteries to jet engines to drones — mining firms that have \" never actually gone looking for cobalt \" are doing so, says trent mell, ceo of canada-based first cobalt. His is one of several firms planning to dig for cobalt in the us, including in idaho and missouri, over the next several years. Along with the risks — there's availability and price volatility to consider, not to mention the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to establish a mine — comes the potential for big rewards. Consumption of cobalt — selling for $ 32 a pound, up from $ 20 in early 2011 — is on pace to rise 8 % to 10 % a year, per the bbc. Indeed, some analysts expect to see shortages as soon as 2022. American-mined cobalt could ease the burden and might even fetch a premium price as the us looks to ease its reliance on imports and more companies begin to request ethical sources of the metal. Abc australia reports that more than 60 % of the world's supply comes from the democratic republic of congo, where amnesty international claims child slaves toil in mines. Some, however, see the rush as coming too late. Tiberius group ceo christoph eibl tells bloomberg that \" the craziness that you see in cobalt will in many ways actually be corrected. \" for example, future batteries may use less lithium, he says. \" there's so much uncertainty about how future technologies will be applied. \"",

But there is a catch. Cobalt is mined in a string of countries around the world including australia, but most of the world's supply comes from just one country in africa, the democratic republic of congo ( drc ) — a nation with a long record of poorly-enforced labour standards and child exploitation. And because cobalt is in such high demand right now, its global price has soared, doubling over the course of last year. According to human rights organisation amnesty international, that growth has put pressure on miners in the drc to ramp up production, leading in turn to tens of thousands of children being lured or forced into gruelling and dangerous mine work.

The aptly nicknamed bonnie and clyde made a run for it on may 24 as they were being relocated to a different enclosure at high park zoo. Capybaras, native to south america, are known as the world's largest rodents, weighing as much as a grown man ( up to 220 pounds in captivity, less in the wild ) and reaching a length of 4 feet. What could make finding these two escapees difficult: they adapt well to new environments, can make do with plants that usually aren't on their dinner plates, and can hide out quite well in the water — and the zoo is surrounded by lots of it. What toronto residents don't have to worry too much about with bonnie and clyde, who've already earned their own twitter parody account, is being attacked: although there have been occasional reports of the creature biting humans, \" when it senses danger, it dashes toward the nearest deep water at a gallop, \" a capybara expert tells national geographic. Oddly enough, even though the rodents are huge as far as rodents go, they may not be simple to spot. \" they can be deceptive in the proximity of humans, \" a university of sao paulo wildlife ecologist says. Still, rescuers may be getting closer: citynews notes traps were set out around toronto after one of the creatures was spotted sunday, and a citynews reporter had another sighting friday morning when he saw one of the animals taking a dip in a pond in high park.

            "President donald trump defended his sweeping immigration policy by calling it \"similar to what president obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from iraq for six months. \" that's a faulty comparison. There was a delay in processing iraqi refugees in 2011 after it was discovered that two iraqi refugees living in kentucky had been involved in roadside bombing attacks on u.s. Troops in iraq. One of the refugee's fingerprints were found on a detonation device in iraq, prompting u.s. Immigration, security and intelligence agencies to use federal databases to rescreen about 58,000 iraqi refugees in the u.s. And more than 25,000 iraqis who had been approved to enter the u.s., but had not yet been admitted, department of homeland security officials testified at the time. The kentucky case not only caused a backlog in processing iraqi refugees in 2011, but it also resulted in an overhaul of the refugee screening process. The obama administration's actions were limited to one country and in response to a specific threat — the potential for other iraqi refugees to take advantage of a flaw in the screening process. By contrast, trump ordered a far wider ban — albeit also temporary — without identifying a specific threat. President trump signed an executive order on jan. 27 that bars syrian refugees from entering the u.s. Indefinitely and bars all other refugees for 120 days, and keeps out visitors for 90 days from seven predominately muslim countries: iraq, syria, iran, sudan, libya, somalia and yemen.
