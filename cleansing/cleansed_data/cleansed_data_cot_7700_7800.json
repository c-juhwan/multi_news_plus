The montana supreme court says todd baugh will be publicly censured on july 1 and his 31-day suspension will begin on december 1, taking him to the end of his term, reports the billings gazette. The 72-year-old judge — who later apologized for his comments, said he misread the law, and tried to retract the sentence — is not seeking re-election. The court decided baugh had violated a state law that requires judges to \" act in a manner that promotes public confidence \" in the justice system and \" avoids impropriety, \" reports nbc. \" he has caused montana citizens, as well as others, to question the fairness of our justice system and whether prejudice or bias affected the outcome \" of the case, the judges wrote. The court also rejected a request from the 54-year-old teacher to reconsider a ruling expected to see him serve more time in prison. Stacey rambold — whose lawyers say there was a \" lynch mob \" mentality in the outcry over the case — received the original sentence after breaking an agreement with the state reached when his victim killed herself before the case could go to trial.",

        "summary": "The days of uncontrollably binging on leftover christmas goodies may be numbered. The telegraph reports researchers have figured out a hormone produced in the liver that reduces the desire to eat sugar. Fibroblast growth factor 21 — or fgf21 — is produced when carbohydrate levels in the body get too high and tells the brain to suppress the body's desire for sugar. \" we never imagined that a circulating, liver-derived factor would exist whose function is to control sweet appetite, \" rt quotes study co-author matthew gillum as saying. Hormones have been known to suppress appetites as a whole but never individual types of nutrients. \" this is the first liver-derived hormone we know that regulates sugar intake specifically, \" says researcher dr. Matthew potthoff of the university of iowa. According to the study — published in cell metabolism — mice born with an fgf21 deficiency ate more sugar, while those born with an excess of the hormone ate much less. But it doesn't have to be left up to nature. Researchers found mice injected with fgf21 ate seven times less sugar, the telegraph reports. A second study found a similar effect in primates given a dose of the hormone, according to a press release. This could be good news for obese people or those with diabetes. \" fgf21 can help people who might not be able to sense when they've had enough sugar, \" researcher lucas bondurant says. According to the press release, the same hormone could also suppress the desire for alcohol. ( speaking of sugar, there's a senator in charge of stocking a candy desk. )",

He performed with a regional affiliate of the wu-tang clan starting in 2012, courthouse news service reports.

The story was later corrected, but tmz never issued a retraction, and other news outlets picked up tmz's original, incorrect version, the lawsuit says. As a result, the wu-tang clan apparently believed roxx to be the person who had done the penis-cutting and put a picture of him on its blog along with a blog post saying, \" this motherf --- er ain't got s --- to do with the wu-tang brand! \" roxx says that, though the wu-tang clan's killah priest later acknowledged roxx wasn't the true subject of the story, he said he couldn't allow roxx to perform with wu-tang-affiliated musicians since some members of the public still believed him to be the penis-cutter. Now roxx is suing not just tmz and its parent company but, according to the hollywood reporter, a number of other media outlets that picked up the story, blaming them for his loss of the wu-tang clan's endorsement, as well as for the harassment he received in prison ( where he was when the story broke ) from other inmates over the story. He says his career is still suffering, and he has to wear sunglasses in public so as not to be mistaken as a rapper who cut off his penis.

Johnson, as andre roxx, toured with wu tang members killah priest, cappadonna and eternal, earning $ 2,000 to $ 4,500 per live appearance, according to his complaint. In april 2014, a different andre johnson, who performs as christ bearer in the group northstar and a different regional wu tang clan and killah priest-affiliated group called west coast killa beez, cut off his own penis and jumped out of a second story window during a party in north hollywood, court records show.

        "summary": "The continuing investigation into the crash of an asiana airlines plane still hasn't spotted any mechanical trouble — meaning it's likely that pilot mistakes were to blame for the disaster, sky news reports. National transportation safety board chair deborah hersman offered new information about investigators ' findings, with concern centered on how pilots could have failed to notice their slow speed during landing, the ap reports. Pilots said they believed the plane's \" autothrottle \" was controlling its speed, but while the device was \" armed, \" it appears to have been set to idle. When the plane's altitude was 500 feet, its airspeed was 134 knots — below the target of 137. A warning sounded; pilots recognized that they weren't aligned with the runway and tried to fix the problem. By the time they'd reached 200 feet, their speed was just 118 knots; pilots are supposed to abort a landing if they're more than 5 knots below target. But they didn't mention speed at all between 500 and 100 feet, hersman says. \" the first thing that's taught to a pilot is to look at the airspeed indicator. It is the most important instrument in the cockpit, \" says a longtime pilot. \" there are a lot of very experienced airline pilots who are scratching their heads right now. \" as for reports of blinding light, the issue doesn't appear to have affected the flight, usa today reports. Eleven minutes worth of of 911 calls have also been released, revealing the chaos in the immediate aftermath of the crash, reuters reports. Some of the calls indicate that people near the end of the runway were left unattended as emergency responders initially stuck near the main crash area. Other callers reported not seeing emergency vehicles, but responders say that's because vehicles are not brought too close to the scene in an effort to avoid collisions — or the vehicles being caught in an explosion. Surprised at how much information the ntsb is releasing? it is unusual, the christian science monitor reports, and while some are praising the transparency, others fear it will lead to incorrect conclusions before the investigation is complete.",

Approximately 200,000 migrants have entered germany since the start of september — mostly from austria, which shares a border with bavaria — and more are on the way. One bavarian official calls it a \" massive, uncontrolled influx. \" on friday, the state threatened to take the german government to court if it doesn't do something to slow or stop the arrival of migrants. Bavaria wants migrants to be forced to settle in the first eu country in which they arrive. In addition to threatening a lawsuit against the federal government, bavaria is also warning it could start turning away migrants at the austrian border, the telegraph reports. But it's unclear how this threat is anything but idle as the german government controls the border and any attempt to set up independent border patrols would likely be illegal. Bavarian officials also said they are considering sending migrants to other parts of germany without waiting for the federal government to redistribute them. According to reuters, german chancellor angela merkel has said she won't cap the number of migrants allowed into germany. But the telegraph notes bavaria's threats are coming at a time when public opinion is starting to swing against merkel and the incoming migrants.",

Merkel has made clear that she will not introduce a refugee cap, telling ard television in an interview on wednesday that this would not work. \" the problem is, you can't shut the borders, \" merkel said. \" then we'd need a 3,000 kilometer fence and we've seen in hungary what happens when you build a fence.

It can be lactose-free, or organic; probably it can be made from birch bark. A class-action lawsuit was filed here in new york against blue diamond almond breeze and silk brand almond milk products. According to the suit, these almond milk products contain only 2 % almonds. In a false advertising claim of this nature, the question is not really whether the product contains 2 % almonds or 100 % almonds. The questions are: ( 1 ) what percent do consumers believe they are buying, and does the packaging and promotion send a deceptive signal? ( 2 ) under the laws of the state of new york in which the lawsuits have been filed, are these",

Why? because of the bad news: you are likely getting duped. According to a new lawsuit, almond breeze products only contain 2 percent of almonds and mostly consist of water, sugar, sunflower lecithin, and carrageenan, the blog food navigator reports. Almond breeze is among the top five milk substitute brands in the country. The class action lawsuit, filed by two unhappy almond milk drinkers in the us district court in new york earlier this month, seeks $ 5 million in damages from the products'distributor, blue diamond growers. While blue diamond growers doesn't label how much of a percentage of its milk is made from almonds,"

The metabolic disorder, diagnosed in 2013, is already slowing eliza's ability to talk, reports people, and will eventually rob her of the ability to walk, eat, and finally, to breathe. Most people with the syndrome die by their teen years, so while the isolation — now in its fifth month — is taking its toll, the family says it's worth it. \" we ' ll do this as long as it takes, \" says dad glenn o ' neill. Their aim is to keep her healthy so she can take part in a clinical trial, likely early next year, they hope will lead to a cure. \" we have heard stories from families of older kids with sanfilippo where a sickness at this stage started the downward slide even faster and they never fully recovered, \" says glenn o ' neill. Because even fairly benign viruses like the common cold can exacerbate eliza's symptoms and speed the progression of the disorder, mom cara o ' neill has quit her job as a pediatrician and glenn o ' neill now works from home, while eliza and her 7-year-old brother, beckham, are home-schooled. Though the family does go out on a rare occasion to, say, a deserted beach or field, reports the new york daily news, they have groceries delivered to their doorstep and wipe all incoming packages with antibacterial wipes.

Between march and may, he sent three letters to fifa's president, one of which promised \" all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the united states without discrimination. \" us soccer president carlos cordeiro describes the assurances as \" powerful, \" though the times notes they were only needed because us officials \" quickly encountered uncomfortable questions from soccer associations \" regarding trump's travel restrictions. In april, trump suggested any country that lobbied against the north american bid would lose us support, \" including at the united nations. \" days later, he called on african countries to support the north american bid during a meeting with nigerian president muhammadu buhari.",

Chai said after his show. \"i really have no words. \" others in the industry were reeling from the news as well. As fashion director at saks fifth avenue in the early 1990s, nicole fischelis was the one who first convinced the store to start carrying alexander mcqueen's line, making saks the first retailer in the u.s. To do so. Upon hearing of mr. Mcqueen's death, ms. Fischelis, who is the current fashion director at macy's inc., said: \"i am totally devastated.

Satellite images have confirmed the existence of a river network that spanned hundreds of miles and made the region habitable for plants, animals, and humans as recently as 5,000 years ago, according to a french study in nature communications. The river network formed during periods of heavy rain that began some 245,000 years ago, according to the study, and it was impressive: if water still flowed through the 320-milelong river system today, it would be the 12th-largest drainage basin in the world. \" the present-day saharan desert was the location of extensive vegetation, animal life and human settlements, \" the researchers tell the christian science monitor. The new findings jibe with the theory that there was once a river system feeding into a previously identified underwater canyon found off the coast of mauritania. A scientist with the uk's national oceanography centre tells the guardian that the discovery is a case study for the drastic results of climate change. \"within just a couple of thousand years, the sahara went from being wet and humid, with lots of sediment being transported into the canyon, to something that's arid and dry, \" he says. An intriguing footnote: the study suggests wet and dry periods have fluctuated in the desert roughly every 20,000 years, meaning \" the sahara could be home to life and vegetation again, \" observes quartz. If the pattern holds, it's due for a change in about 15,000 years. ( a desert in chile recently came to life in a colorful way. )",

            "Today, the sahara is thousands of miles of hot, dry sand stretching across northern africa. But it hasn't always been that way. Thousands of years ago, a vast river system flowed through the western sahara. Researchers found markers of these ancient rivers buried beneath the sand dunes, according to a new study published tuesday in the journal nature communications.

The only well-documented humid phase in the region is the early holocene ahp, which is characterized by a strong summer insolation ( fig. 2 ) driving the itcz and the associated precipitations to higher latitudes than at the present. At that time, equatorial lakes reached their highest level ( fig. 2 ) and the present-day saharan desert was the location of extensive vegetation, animal life and human settlements3, 4, 23.

Asked if it has anything to do with his potential vp, cruz told reporters they'd have to wait and see, per politico. Some speculation: rumors are flying that indiana gov. Mike pence may endorse cruz at the event, reports the hill. Both cruz and donald trump have met with the governor, though trump told cnn on wednesday that pence may not endorse either candidate. Trump is at least toying with the possibility that cruz will name carly fiorina as his running mate. \" i think it hurts him. I can't imagine he does it, \" he told fox &amp; friends, per usa today. Hopping over to good morning america, he said fiorina \" never resonated with the people. So, i mean, carly is not going to do the trick. \" announcing a running mate this early \" would be an unusual development in a remarkable campaign, to say the least, \" writes cooper allen at usa today. But it has been done before. Ronald reagan named his pick for vp before the 1976 republican convention, though he was ultimately defeated by gerald ford. After cruz lost five states to trump on tuesday, john podhoretz wouldn't be surprised if he threw in the towel. \" if trump wins the primary next week in the hoosier state, cruz is toast, \" he writes at the new york post. \" people are kidding themselves if they think tuesday night's results won't have an effect on voters in indiana and elsewhere. \"",

Understandably, they want to hold kim jung un and his thuggish regime responsible for the death of their son, who was a student at the academically rigorous university of virginia.

        "summary": "It was billed as golf's first pay-per-view broadcast: phil mickelson vs. Tiger woods in a $ 9 million made-for-tv match friday in las vegas. Only 700 invited guests were allowed to watch, and what they saw was mickelson win on the 22nd hole. Mickelson was 1 up after 16 holes at shadow creek golf club, but woods tied it with birdie from the fringe of the green on the par-3 17th. Both birdied the par-5 18th and then parred the first playoff hole before it went to the par-3 extra hole — which was pitch shots off the practice putting green — that they kept playing until there was a winner. Mickelson made a 4-foot birdie putt on his third attempt at the 93-yard hole. The bbc called it \" a suitably extraordinary finish to an event which, although lacking quality as a sporting spectacle, had promised to show golf as it had never been seen before. \" the match was marred by technical difficulties with viewers unable to view it on tv after paying $ 19.95. Turner and bleacher report representatives sent out links on social media allowing people to view it for free online. The match was billed as a chance for viewers to watch an untraditional golf broadcast as both golfers and their caddies were mic'd up. There was some banter between woods and mickelson early on but not much as the stakes increased. After the match, mickelson said to woods: \" just know i will never let you live that down. It's not the masters or the us open, but it is nice to have a little something on you. \" bleacher report notes mickelson's winnings outpace the $ 8.7 million pga tour leading money winner justin thomas won in total last season. Espn reports mickelson will actually walk with more than $ 9 million: a side bet with woods earned him $ 600,000 for the phil &amp; amy mickelson foundation.",

Here's a sampling of what they're saying: to the editors of the new york times, it's \" a good thing. \" the report says the affordable care act won't \" produce an increase in unemployment ( workers unable to find jobs ) or underemployment ( part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week ), \" they write. Instead, \" the report is about the choices workers can make when they are no longer tethered to an employer because of health benefits. \" writing in the los angeles times, michael hiltzik agrees: \" the cbo projects that the act will reduce the supply of labor, not the availability of jobs. \" indeed, \" it suggests that aggregate demand for labor ( that is, the number of jobs ) will increase. \" citing an economist, he adds that flexibility provided by obamacare will help \" older workers with serious health conditions \" who work for the purpose of benefits; it will also help young moms who might go back to work early for coverage. The wall street journal's editors disagree. \" for low-wage, lower-skilled or discouraged workers in particular, obamacare offers incentives that can force them to trade jobs for entitlement benefits, \" they write. The cbo's report points to \" an implicit tax on additional earnings \" — because under the law, health subsidies disappear as one's income increases. \" these effective marginal tax rates reduce the rewards for work. \" in the washington post, dana milbank sees the report as a boost for republicans. The white house has often trumpeted cbo findings on the health law; now, \" obamacare has been undermined by the very entity ( officials ) had used to validate it. \" a shrinking workforce \" will inevitably be a drag on economic growth, as more people decide government handouts are more attractive than working more and paying higher taxes. \"",

Local media shot video of him scrolling through the material, and even showing it to colleagues, during a debate in the chamber of deputies ( something like the us congress ). On the table beside him lay an invite to a christian mass at the central bishops of brazil location, providing \" a contrast to the decidedly un-christian film he was watching, \" the telegraph reports. On his facebook page, rodrigues says he was just combing through material from \" nearly a hundred groups \" on whatsapp to \" separate the wheat from the chaff, \" per the mirror. Many people on facebook seem to buy that, leaving him messages that the independent describes as \" overwhelmingly positive. \" meanwhile, brazilian journalists are reacting differently, with a female reporter calling rodrigues ' actions \" flagrant \" and the images \" obscene, \" the latin times reports. Male reporters who interviewed rodrigues, however, write that the social democratic party member \" wasn't 100 percent focused during the extremely long debates on private finance re-election and other matters. \" ( a us politician made headlines by sexting anthony weiner's old flame. )",

The american kratom association accused the fda of being biased and called its research, which found that 25 compounds in kratom behave like opioids, an \" unprecedented abuse of science, \" nbc reports. Kratom, which has been used in southeast asia for centuries, is still legal, but fda inspectors have been destroying shipments from overseas for months, reports the ap.

But technically turner, 22, wasn't convicted of rape: he was convicted of three counts of sexual assault — assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated woman, sexually penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object, and sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object — and california lawmakers now want to modify state laws so that all sexual penetration without consent is deemed rape, the independent reports. This initiative comes via the california legislative women's caucus, some of whose members believe the state's current definition of rape — \" an act of sexual intercourse without consent involving penile penetration \" — is too limiting. How these lawmakers think california should define rape: the same way the fbi does, which is: \" penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. \" this definition wouldn't allow for \" wiggle room, \" wrote assemblywoman cristina garcia, the caucus's vice chair, in a blog post at time. \" sexual penetration without consent is rape, \" she asserted. \" it is never invited, wanted, or warranted. Rape is rape, period. \" she says that by tying the act of rape strictly to an act of \" sexual intercourse \" ( meaning penile penetration ), we're doing a disservice to victims. \" hopefully, being able to properly label the crime will ensure more survivors will see justice done. \" ( how stanford graduates expressed their outrage. )",

        "summary": "A massive new autism study adds to the evidence that parents ' age plays a role in their children's risk of autism — including the suggestion that a couple with a big age gap has a higher risk. \" though we've seen research on autism and parental age before, this study is like no other, \" the study's co-author says in a post at eureka alert. Scientists studied the medical records of nearly 6 million kids across five countries ( not including the us ) and found that paternal age had the greatest influence on autism risk. A child born to a dad over 50 had a 66 % higher risk of autism than one born to a dad in his 20s. A child born to a man in his 40s had a 28 % higher risk. Men over 50 may have genetic mutations in their sperm that play a role in autism development, though other factors are probably involved, reports healthday. However, a mom's age also was a factor, perhaps due to genetic mutations in eggs. The autism risk in children born to a mom in her 40s jumped 15 %. When both parents were older, the risk climbed again. Interestingly, the autism risk also spiked if a mother was especially young. The children of teen moms saw an 18 % increased risk compared to those of women in their 20s, which researchers weren't able to explain, per medical daily. The study also is the first to link increased autism risk to an age gap among parents. The risk of autism in this group was highest when dads were between 35 and 44 or moms were in their 30s and their partners were at least 10 years their junior. That's another subject that needs more study. Researchers stressed they don't want to stress people. \" although risk for autism may increase when parents are older or have a gap in ages, most of the children born to such couples will [ not develop autism ], \" says one.

In the past 30 years, not only has the number of high school graduates enrolled in four-year universities increased by 11 %, but college tuition has also soared over 200 %. As more students attend college at a cost higher than ever before, millennials have increasingly turned to loans to help finance their education. While much of the college debt dialogue is over immediate issues like employment and repayment, there is another glaring challenge that graduates will have to deal with for years to come: retirement. When will students be able to retire given that many are spending the first ten years ( or more ) of their careers paying off their hefty loans? nerdwallet conducted a study",
            "A growing percentage of middle-class americans say they have saved so little for retirement that they expect to work into their 80s or even until they either get too sick or die, according to a recent survey. Nearly half of middle-class workers said they are not confident that they will be able to save enough to retire comfortably, according to a wells fargo survey of 1,000 workers between the ages of 25 and 75, with household incomes between $ 25,000 and $ 100,000. As a result, 34 % said they plan to work until they're at least 80 -- that's up from 25 % in 2011 and 30 % last year. An even larger percentage, 37 %, said they ' ll never retire and plan to either work until they get too sick or die, the survey found.

In the bigger one, mueller must explain to a judge why he believes former trump campaign manager paul manafort lied to investigators in violation of his plea deal, reports the hill. In the other, federal prosecutors in new york will file memos spelling out how former trump attorney michael cohen cooperated with them, reports the ap. Expect lots of redacted material, but on manafort in particular, \" there will be plenty of clues and indicators about where mueller has gone and will go, \" says elie honig, former assistant us attorney for the southern district of new york. President trump, meanwhile, has unleashed a fresh storm of criticism, with five anti-mueller tweets friday morning alone. \" will robert mueller's big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his republicans only report, \" he wrote in one. In that and others, here, here, here, and here, the president makes the case that mueller and \" leakin ' lyin ' james comey \" have unfairly gone after trump and his allies while letting hillary clinton and her allies off the hook. And those tweets follow three from thursday night on the subject, culminating with, \" fake news - the enemy of the people! \" friday's court filings come after mueller filed a sentencing memo tuesday in the case of former national security adviser michael flynn, notes nbc news. That one had many blacked-out details, but it stated that flynn provided \" substantial assistance \" to mueller's team. Axios, for one, thinks the mueller \" endgame \" is near.",

But although vladimir putin called obama and his allies \" political corpses, \" accusing them of trying to sabotage donald trump's foreign policy plans and further damage us-russia ties, per the new york times, he's now saying he won't engage in \" irresponsible diplomacy \" by taking the deportation route, opting instead to mend those ties once donald trump takes office, the bbc reports. \" we won't create problems for american diplomats, \" putin said in a statement released friday, the washington post reports. Prior to that, russian diplomats around the world slammed the new us sanctions, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman calling the obama administration a \" group of foreign policy losers, angry, and ignorant. \" russian prime minister dmitry medvedev, meanwhile, said he was disappointed, per the ap. \" it is sad that the obama administration that began its life by restoring ties ends it with anti-russian death throes, \" he tweeted. Trump said thursday that it is time to \" move on \" from the controversy, though some congressional republicans welcomed what they called an overdue harder line on russia, the washington post reports. Sens. John mccain and lindsey graham were among those calling for tougher sanctions.",

In a look at 423 patients who'd recently been diagnosed, researchers found that the incidence of depression and anxiety was twice as high among those who'd recently been diagnosed versus the wider population, the bbc reports. Some 14 % of patients had depression at the beginning of the study; in healthy subjects, the figure was just 6.6 %. The number of patients with depression increased slightly over the course of the two-year study, while it decreased a bit among the non-parkinson's population. A researcher points to both psychological and physical reasons for depression in parkinson's patients, who, another expert notes, can suffer from depression and anxiety a decade before parkinson's develops. One issue, a neurology professor told nbc last week, is that the public perception of the illness is \" far more grim and dire than reality \": \" the majority of people with parkinson's are walking around without telling anyone.

With a congressional reporting deadline looming, secretary of state hillary rodham clinton and top military officials are said to favor placing sanctions on the network, which operates in afghanistan and pakistan, according to half a dozen current and former administration officials. A designation as a terrorist organization would help dry up the group's fund-raising activities in countries like saudi arabia and united arab emirates, press pakistan to carry out long-promised military action against the insurgents, and sharpen the administration's focus on devising policies and operations to weaken the group, advocates say. But no final decision has been made. A spirited internal debate has american officials, including several at the white house, worried about the consequences of such a designation not only for relations with pakistan, but also for peace talks with the taliban and the fate of sgt.

In early august, congress gave secretary of state hillary rodham clinton 30 days to determine whether the haqqani group, considered the most lethal opponent of u.s. Forces in afghanistan, meets the criteria for designation — a foreign organization engaging in terrorist activity that threatens u.s. Citizens or national security. If she says it does not, clinton must explain her rationale in a report that is due to congress on sept. 9. Acknowledgment that the group meets the criteria, however, would probably force the administration to take action, which is strongly advocated by the military but has been resisted by the white house and some in the state department. Senior officials have repeatedly called the haqqani network the most significant threat to the u.s.

A designation as a terrorist organization would help dry up the group's fund-raising activities in countries like saudi arabia and united arab emirates, press pakistan to carry out long-promised military action against the insurgents, and sharpen the administration's focus on devising policies and operations to weaken the group, advocates say. But no final decision has been made. A spirited internal debate has american officials, including several at the white house, worried about the consequences of such a designation not only for relations with pakistan, but also for peace talks with the taliban and the fate of sgt.

The obama administration is deeply divided over whether to designate the pakistan-based haqqani network as a terrorist group. ( ishtiaq mahsud/ap ) just days before a congressional deadline, the obama administration is deeply divided over whether to designate the pakistan-based haqqani network as a terrorist group, with some officials worried that doing so could complicate efforts to restart peace talks with the taliban and undermine already-fraught relations with pakistan. In early august, congress gave secretary of state hillary rodham clinton 30 days to determine whether the haqqani group, considered the most lethal opponent of u.s. Forces in afghanistan, meets the criteria for designation — a foreign organization engaging in terrorist activity that threatens u.s. Citizens or national security. If she says it does not, clinton must explain her rationale in a report that is due to congress on sept. 9. Acknowledgment that the group meets the criteria, however, would probably force the administration to take action, which is strongly advocated by the military but has been resisted by the white house and some in the state department. Senior officials have repeatedly called the haqqani network the most significant threat to the u.s. Goal of exiting a relatively peaceful afghanistan by the end of 2014 and have accused pakistan of direct support for its leadership. The network has"

And now the north dakota 18-year-old is putting the future she planned for — cosmetology school — on hold, replacing it with a new goal: to become the legal guardian of her sister meagan, 16, and brother spencer, 14. The jackson siblings had a difficult upbringing: mom rebecca started doing meth when mackenzie was little, both parents were in poor health, and a couple months before dad cory died, meagan and spencer were put into foster care. \" the conditions of my house weren't good for them to be in and my dad was drinking a lot, \" mackenzie tells people. \" but it was only after my dad died that i knew i was now going to be in charge of getting them back. \" she had already been taking care of her siblings since their mother's death, taking on responsibilities like grocery shopping and making sure the younger kids made it to school, doctor's appointments, and other things, all while keeping her own grades up. After her dad's death, she called social services and began working to become their legal guardian; she also moved out of the house they had been living in. \" i want spencer and meagan to come back to a new house where we can make new memories, \" she explains. She adds that while an older relative could also become the teens ' guardian, \" i know them the best. They're my responsibility. \" and, she tells valley news live, \" they just really want to come home with me, they just really want their sister, that's all they want. \" but she will have support from other family members, including a 34-year-old cousin who lives nearby and says, \" she deserves to have her siblings. They belong together. \" a gofundme campaign has raised more than $ 12,000 to help the family, and kfgo reports that a benefit is being held for the family today at a local church. Jackson will find out whether she was approved at a feb. 19 hearing. ( new hampshire authorities say 9-year-old twins were left home alone — for four months. )",

            "How do you find your place in a world that demeans, underestimates and ignores you, then treats you like a punch line when you're gone? this is the central question of \" mad men's \" \" the beautiful girls, \" but as always, the answers aren't very clear. Whether you draw lines in the sand, stomp your feet and act on principle, or surrender, whimper and weep, then try desperately to regain your footing, you ' ll still end up compromised. You either operate completely outside of the social norms and navigate the world around you with total disregard for what other people expect of you ( like peggy's friend joyce ), or you're constantly pushed into a subordinate role ( like joan, peggy and faye, sharing an alienated elevator ride at the end of the episode ). This week we see what women give up to get what they want. Peggy compromises her principles ( yet again ) in order to remain in a position of power; sally gives up her own safety and security and endangers her relationship with her mother in order to be closer to her father; faye surrenders to don's charms and to his innate sense of privilege in order to have some love in her life; and joan gives in to roger's relentless pursuit once it's clear that he's the only man ( or person, for that matter ) who offers her real support and comfort. Which of these women is honoring her ideals, and which is surrendering some crucial part of herself just to satisfy other people's expectations? \" it's a business of sadists and masochists, \" says mrs. Blankenship to peggy, \" and you know which one you are. \" although the overarching theme of liberation vs. Servitude was, at times, a little too omnipresent, echoing through every scene with the subtlety of a tuba honking away in the corner of a bar, there was still plenty to love in this episode,"

Nearly all gop senators say trump shouldn't fire mueller. But republicans who support the legislation say it's necessary to guard against presidential interference by giving congress more oversight power. The legislation would give any special counsel a 10-day window to seek expedited judicial review of a firing and would put into law existing justice department regulations that a special counsel can only be fired for good cause. Per bloomberg, multiple republican lawmakers — including ones who oppose the legislation protecting mueller — have warned trump could face impeachment were he to fire the special counsel.

Since discovering his remains under a parking lot in leicester in 2012, scientists have determined he had a bad case of roundworms and died a brutal death. Now they say an analysis of his dna points to cuckolding — female infidelity. In a study published in nature communications, scientists explain that richard's dna was a match with relatives on the maternal side, but there were no matches between his dna and that of \" five genealogically determined male-line relatives, \" indicating a \" false-paternity event ( or events ) \" happened at some point. At which point, they don't know, but they note it could be of \" key historical significance. \" if the false paternity occurred in the family of john of gaunt, \" his son, henry iv, and henry's direct descendants ( henry v and henry vi ) would have had no legitimate claim to the crown, \" the study authors write. \" this would also hold true, indirectly, for the entire tudor dynasty ( henry vii, henry viii, edward vi, mary i and elizabeth i ). \" but as one of the authors tells the bbc and guardian, \" this is not a criminal investigation.... Royal succession isn't straightforward inheritance.... History has taken a series of twists and turns. \" the tudors, for instance, took the crown when king richard iii was defeated and killed at battle, though they used their ancestry to back up their claim. As national geographic reports, the authors also determined with 99.9994 % certainty that the bones belong to richard iii.

In what might just be the best news you read all day, a new study published in addictive behaviors finds playing tetris for just 3 minutes reduces cravings by an average 20 %. And that doesn't just apply to cravings for chocolate. Researchers say it works on hankerings for sex, sleep, cigarettes, and more. Over one week, psychologists prompted 31 participants, ages 18 to 27, to report cravings for food and drink, drugs ( think coffee, alcohol, and cigarettes ), and activities, including how strong those cravings were, seven times a day via text message. Of those, 15 participants were told to play 3 minutes of tetris in between and report back. The result: \" playing tetris decreased craving strength... From 70 % to 56 %, \" researcher jackie andrade says in a press release. What sort of power might tetris hold? a relatively simple one, it turns out. \" craving involves imagining the experience of consuming a particular substance or indulging in a particular activity, \" says andrade. It's \" hard to imagine something vividly and play tetris at the same time. \" and the effect didn't wear off: those who played averaged 40 sessions during the week, but the impact remained consistent. Researchers were so impressed that they hope to test the theory on people with drug addictions. Just as significantly, \" this is the first demonstration that cognitive interference can be used outside the lab to reduce cravings for substances and activities other than eating, \" the researchers write. As far as undergrads ' cravings, they reported wanting something about 30 % of the time: about two-thirds of cravings were for food and non-alcoholic drinks; 21 % were for cigarettes, beer, etc.; and 16 % were for activities, including sleep, video games, socializing, and sex.

According to a study published in plos one, the suspected vampires were not immigrants to the area but locals who probably perished in the cholera epidemics that swept the region at the time. Ancient lore says being the first to perish in an epidemic is one of the things that can turn a person into a vampire, study co-author lesley gregoricka tells livescience. \" people were up close and personal with death at this point, but didn't have a good way to explain what was happening, \" she says. \" people of the post-medieval period did not understand how disease was spread, and rather than a scientific explanation for these epidemics, cholera and the deaths that resulted from it were explained by the supernatural — in this case, vampires, \" says gregoricka, a bioarchaeologist at the university of south alabama, in a press release. Dying a violent death or being an outsider also put one at risk of becoming a vampire, according to lore, but the bodies bore no signs of violence and testing revealed they were from the area. The sickles were in place to decapitate the body if it tried to rise, and rocks or bricks were placed to prevent them from feeding, the study says — though strangely enough, the \" vampires \" weren't segregated in the cemetery but were buried among other villagers. ( in this \" vampire grave, \" the deceased had a stake driven through his heart. )",

Lendas was described as in \" stable \" condition by an official ( indeed, he's standing and talking quite normally in the bbc video ). The couple had arrived in sri lanka six days after their wedding; his bride tells the bbc she's \" so happy \" he's alive, and the couple expresses their thanks to \" kent from canada, \" who apparently talked to lendas throughout his ordeal.

        "summary": "Two and a half months in, how is neil gorsuch doing on the supreme court? the consensus seems to be that he's making his mark already. A sample of the coverage as the court's term ended monday: cnn says gorsuch is \" no ordinary junior-most justice, \" noting that he's jumped right in and is already making good on president trump's promise to add a strong conservative voice to the high court. The site runs down his actions on the court, including a recent dissent he wrote in a gay marriage case. Bloomberg says gorsuch has \" aligned himself with arch-conservative justice clarence thomas, \" noting that both justices recently criticized the majority of the court for not allowing trump's full travel ban to go into effect immediately. The site also calls him \" aggressive, \" and says he is \" confirming [ liberals ' ] worst fears. \" the los angeles times calls gorsuch \" the new antonin scalia, \" adding that it's rare to get the \" full sense \" of a new justice so early in his tenure. Per fivethirtyeight, gorsuch \" has paid dividends for trump more than perhaps any other move the president has made. \" he's certainly one of the most conservative voices on the court, and may even end up to the right of scalia. The san francisco chronicle looks specifically at four cases in which gorsuch \" made his mark \" monday — the travel ban case, plus cases on california's gun law, lesbian parents, and a religious school's use of taxpayer funds. The conservative washington examiner says gorsuch did not disappoint in the aforementioned religious liberty case, which it takes a closer look at, while the daily caller says he has so far \" deliver[ ed ] for conservatives. \" meanwhile, the huffington post calls gorsuch \" the anti-lgbtq nightmare his gay friends hoped he wasn't, \" and the hill notes that a democratic senator recently compared gorsuch, thomas, and samuel alito to \" the three horsemen of the apocalypse. \"",

He allegedly filed paperwork with social security saying the long-dead sibling was \"suffering from depression. \" \"this is an outrageous theft of benefits moneys that are intended for those truly in need, \" said state welfare inspector general catherine leahy scott. The city department of sanitation cleaner used an \"an intricate plot to ensure a constant cash flow of government benefits he was not entitled to \" by \"assuming a false identity for nearly two decades, \" scott said. Queens district attorney richard brown said murphy hatched the \"brazen scheme \" back in 1994.

The fraud went on for 20 years until murphy was done in by facial-recognition technology at the state department of motor vehicles — which picked up on the fact that thomas ' face was also on the license he got in robert's name, authorities said. \"it sounds like a novel, doesn't it? \" said kevin ryan, a spokesman for the queens district attorney's office, which is prosecuting murphy. Another source added, \"it's amazing, and a little bit morbid. \" nothing was too low for murphy, now 52, in his quest for money, authorities said. Posing as robert, thomas murphy allegedly claimed he suffered from depression and qualified for social security disability benefits in his brother's name. Thomas murphy also received government housing",
            "Roy hsu/getty images thomas murphy, 52, was busted for allegedly spending two decades collecting welfare benefits from his dead twin brother. No wonder he was depressed — he'd been dead since 1962! a queens man impersonated his dead twin to pocket $ 581,000 in welfare benefits, officials said tuesday. Thomas murphy, 52, was arrested on a slew of charges — including grand larceny, fraud and identity theft — for what prosecutors said was an almost two-decade long scam of posing as his dead brother. He allegedly filed paperwork with social security saying the long-dead sibling was \"suffering from depression. \" \"this is an outrageous theft of benefits moneys that are intended for those truly in need, \" said state welfare inspector general catherine leahy scott. The city department of sanitation cleaner used an \"an intricate plot to ensure a constant cash flow of government benefits he was not entitled to \" by \"assuming a false identity for nearly two decades, \" scott said. Queens district attorney richard brown said murphy hatched the \"brazen scheme \" back in 1994. That's when court papers say he first made use of his dead brother's identity — applying for social security benefits in his late sibling's name. The twin, robert murphy, died a day after he and thomas were born in 1962, court papers say. For reasons"

Jean haley and martha williams were found saturday morning after both fell outside the door of haley's home in barrington on friday night, reports the providence journal. Police don't suspect foul play. The women had little chance of surviving the night's freezing temperatures, which the ap notes were among new england's coldest of the year. Authorities say the women had been out to dinner earlier with their 89-year-old younger sister, and it appears that williams fell first, perhaps while walking back to her car after dropping her twin sister off. At that point, authorities think haley fell while trying to get help. She \" may have tripped on a rug on the floor of the garage as she attempted to enter her house to call for assistance, \" says the barrington police chief. The younger sister wasn't with them at that point, and the home is located on a quiet road and \" somewhat isolated, \" notes the washinigton post. A neighbor looking out the window saw williams the next morning lying near the rear of her vehicle in the driveway. Her sister was found in the garage.

        "summary": "More wrongfully convicted people were exonerated last year than ever before in the us, a study by two law schools behind the national registry of exonerations finds. Some 87 people were found to have been wrongfully convicted, compared to 83 in 2009, the study's previous high, per the new york times. Standout details: some 17 % of exonerations last year followed guilty pleas, often made in exchange for a reduced sentence. About half the exonerations were for murder convictions; in one case, a wrongfully convicted man was sentenced to death. Why the increase? much of it has to do with a newfound willingness among prosecutors to revisit previous cases, the study finds. The registry's editor tells npr: \" the sharp, cold shower that dna ( evidence ) gave to the criminal justice system... Showed we made mistakes in a lot of cases where it never occurred to anybody that a mistake had been made. \" indeed, nearly 40 % of 2013's exonerations were either initiated by law enforcement or included police and prosecutors ' cooperation, the ap reports.

Tens of thousands of protesters have also come out on the streets in alexandria, egypt's second largest city. There were also reports of a protest outside the parliament building in the capital. Witnesses said protesters had pitched a tent in front of the building and are likely to stay there. According to hoda abdel-hamid, al jazeera's correspondent in the egyptian capital, the crowd at tahrir square grew rapidly on tuesday afternoon, with many first-timers joining protesters seeking mubarak's immediate ouster. The newcomers said they had been inspired in part by the release of wael ghonim, the google executive, after what he said was two weeks of detention by state security authorities.

Their 1,400-pound boat — 2,900 pounds with all their stuff in it — has neither engine nor sail; the couple will depend on their rowing skills to make the 2,400-mile journey to oahu. They plan to set off this week if the weather is amenable. Fortunately, both are serious athletes. Inkinen is a triathlete — one of the top amateurs in the world for his age, the daily mail reports — and loring recently won nepal's mount everest marathon in the women's division. Their first overnight date was climbing mount kilimanjaro. \" both of us were looking for a new and difficult adventure that would push our mental and physical capabilities, \" says inkinen. They're also hoping to raise awareness and money for their campaign for better nutrition. Inkinen found out he was pre-diabetic several years ago and now \" won't go near sugar, \" says a website dedicated to the row. The biggest challenge of the 60-day trip may not be physical, however. \" i think the biggest threat will be to our relationship, \" loring notes.",

I was his age when lennon was shot, so all my fandom is overshadowed with sadness; for him, it's all just great songs and round glasses.

Amnesty and ngo afrewatch note children as young as 7 mine cobalt for lithium batteries found in products made by apple, microsoft, sony, samsung, and other major brands. Amnesty says it interviewed 70 adults and 17 children who spoke of working 12 hours a day in life-threatening conditions, reports the verge. They said they wore no masks or gloves to protect against harmful chemicals and dust, experienced major health problems, faced physical abuse, and were extorted by state officials — all for $ 1 or $ 2 per day, per the guardian. \" i would spend 24 hours down in the tunnels, \" said a 14-year-old, per the bbc. \" i had to relieve myself down in the tunnels. \" the report notes at least 80 miners died in mines in southern drc between september 2014 and december 2015; a 2014 unicef report found 40,000 children working in southern mines. The amnesty report accuses congo dongfang mining — one of the largest mineral processors in the country, and a subsidiary of china's huayou cobalt — of receiving cobalt mined using child labor, then passing it along the supply chain. However, huayou cobalt says it \" has not been aware that any of our legitimate suppliers has hired child labor in their mining sites or operated in unsafe working conditions. \" amnesty notes more than half the world's cobalt supply comes from the drc, and 16 brands named as customers couldn't verify the source of their cobalt, or as gizmodo puts it, \" [ failed ] to perform the basic checks \" to ensure child labor isn't involved.

Tmz reports that the teen was actually trying to help kardashian get inside the building but started yelling racial obscenities at the paparazzi as he did so, and kardashian scolded him for his choice of words. The man then started yelling at her — among other things, he reportedly called her an \" [ n-word ] lover. \" kardashian then called west, and the man allegedly used the n-word again, this time referring to west. \" at this point kim was seriously afraid for her life, \" people's source says. \" [ the alleged victim ] was going nuts.

The post was established by congress more than eight years ago, and the 171-page assessment on \"learning from iraq \" is its final major report. Much of the study, which is to be released wednesday, covers the more than $ 60 billion in american aid that was used to carry out projects in iraq.

It serves as a follow-up to our previous comprehensive review of the rebuilding effort, hard lessons: the iraq reconstruction experience. This study provides much more than a recapitulation of what the reconstruction program accomplished and what my office found in the interstices. While examining both of these issues and many more, learning from iraq importantly captures the effects of the rebuilding program as derived from 44 interviews with the recipients ( the iraqi leadership ), the executors ( u.s. Senior leaders ), and the providers ( congressional members ). These interviews piece together an instructive picture of what was the largest stabilization and reconstruction operation ever undertaken by the united states ( until recently overtaken by afghanistan ). The body of this report reveals countless details about the use of more than $ 60 billion in taxpayer dollars to support programs and projects in iraq. It articulates numerous lessons derived from sigir's 220 audits and 170 inspections, and it lists the varying consequences meted out from the 82 convictions achieved through our investigations. It urges and substantiates necessary reforms that could improve stabilization and reconstruction operations, and it highlights the financial benefits accomplished by sigir's work"

Uruguayan soccer officials argued the incident was all played up by the media, however. \" everybody knows the british media have an issue with suarez \" and the pictures \" don't show anything, \" uruguay's captain told the guardian. Others argued the images of bite marks on chiellini were photoshopped to appear worse. Uruguay's soccer federation president even told the ap that italy may have to answer to fifa officials as members of italy's staff tried to hit suarez afterward, he said. The fifa disciplinary committee could have suspended suarez for anywhere from two games to two years, but how they landed on four months isn't clear. Meanwhile, the whole debacle has paid off for a lucky few: the ap notes more than 150 people across europe bet that suarez would again sink his teeth into someone on the pitch, raking in winnings at odds of about 175: 1.",

        "summary": "In 2012, a troop of boy scouts stoned a rabid beaver to death. Those upstate new york boys have nothing on cas overton, who strangled an attacking raccoon to death with her bare hands on saturday afternoon. It's worth noting the henrico county, va., woman is 75 years old, and the raccoon was confirmed yesterday to have rabies. The attack occurred at the richmond-area lewis ginter botanical garden, where the self-proclaimed \" terrific animal lover \" was bird-watching. Overton was surprised by the raccoon while studying birds in a tree; she believes it emerged from a bamboo thicket. After being unable to shake off the violent animal, which had \" grabbed a hold of my pant leg and bit me at the same time, \" overton literally took matters into her own hands. \" as i moved backward away from it, i grabbed its neck and i knew that i couldn't get away from it, \" she tells the times-dispatch. \" if i ran, it would be faster than i would and would just tear me to pieces. So i threw it to the ground and i strangled it — with both hands. \" once the animal had stopped moving she made her way to find help, and was taken via ambulance to a hospital where she has started getting rabies shots. Wwbt reports it's henrico's first confirmed rabies case of the year; there were seven cases last year. ( meanwhile, a carpenter has lost his job because of a raccoon. )",

Silvani vinceti says his research shows that leonardo da vinci used two models — one female and one male — to create the famous 16th-century portrait that hangs at the louvre, the guardian reports. \" i believe that this goes with a long-time fascination of leonardo's, that is, the subject of androgyny, \" he says, adding that, for da vinci, the \" perfect person was a combination of a man and a woman. \" vinceti says he examined the painting — \" arguably the world's most famous, \" per the telegraph — using infrared technology. In the first layer, he says, the mona lisa's face looks \" melancholic and sad, \" with no trace of a smile. So who were the models? the female, many historians agree, was lisa gherardini, the wife of a florentine silk merchant. The male, according to vinceti, is likely da vinci's longtime assistant gian giacomo caprotti ( aka salai, or little devil ), who was da vinci's \" supposed main male squeeze, \" per the new york post. His conclusion is based on comparisons of the mona lisa's face with other paintings for which caprotti served as the model, including st. John the baptist. Caprotti is discernible, \" particularly in mona lisa's nose, her forehead, and her smile, \" vinceti tells the telegraph. Not everyone is convinced. \" the infra-red images do nothing to support the idea, \" says art historian martin kemp, adding that vinceti's theory is \" a mish-mash of known things, semi-known things, and complete fantasy. \" the mona lisa has long been the subject of various theories, including, per the telegraph, that a lost original depicted her naked.

Manley said the two injured men were apparently riding or pushing bikes sunday night when a device at the side of the road exploded. \" our safety message to this point has been involving the handling of packages, and telling this community'do not handle packages, do not pick up packages, do not disturb packages, ' \" the chief said. \" we now need to have an extra level of vigilance and pay attention to any suspicious device, whether it be a package, a bag, a backpack, anything that looks out of place and please do not approach it. \" he said police believe the latest device is connected to the previous three, but the scene is still being investigated, the bbc reports. Hours before the latest blast, manley addressed the bomber, saying police are listening and \" want to understand what brought you to this point. \"",

Sources say trump would subtly — and not so subtly — try to embarrass priebus, calling him \" reince-y, \" saying he would make a good car salesman, and mocking him for being excited to see his house from air force one. Priebus would be forced to \" literally sprint \" to the oval office to attend meetings he wasn't invited to. Officials say trump was hoping priebus would take the hint and leave the job on his own. It didn't happen, and trump essentially fired priebus by tweet on friday. By that point, the firing made sense. \" trump had reduced the poor fellow to a nerve-wracked white house prowler, \" vanity fair states.
