A woman who came forward this week claiming to be his daughter and alleging that he had faked his own death in 1984 is actually an actress named alexandra tatarsky, says the website.

Tsg reports that tatarsky hatched the hoax with kaufman's brother michael, after the pair met at a gallery featuring an exhibition of the comic's life. As for michael — who read a letter supposedly written by his late brother at the andy kaufman awards on monday night — he seems to be backtracking quickly, notes usa today. \" i think i've been misquoted, ok? \" he tells the hollywood reporter while postponing an interview. \" i never came out with, ' he's alive.

It's the second time he's ended up hospital-bound while in police custody; he passed out in a jail cell in november because of a blood clot. Knight was charged yesterday with murder after he struck two men with his pickup truck last week. Prosecutors allege that knight intended to run down a friend and another man after an argument on a movie set. The friend, terry carter, was killed; cle \" bone \" sloan was injured, tmz reports. Attorney james blatt says knight accidentally ran over the men on thursday as he tried to escape a vicious attack. Knight's initial bail of $ 2 million was revoked yesterday after a court commissioner agreed that he was a potential flight risk and could intimidate witnesses. Knight faced four felony counts including murder in the death of 55-year-old carter; \" attempted, willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder \" involving 51-year-old sloan; plus two charges of hit-and-run. Authorities say knight had argued with sloan, who was working at a location for straight outta compton, a film about the rise of the rap group nwa. They allege the argument resumed in the parking lot where the two men were run down after knight and sloan exchanged punches through the pickup truck's window. A conviction could result in knight's third serious felony under california's three strikes sentencing law, and lead to a life sentence.",

        "summary": "It's a gradual and cruel fate: an inherited form of vision loss that typically ends in blindness and has had no cure. But for those with mutations in a gene known as rpe65 comes a balm. The fda in december approved luxturna, a new gene therapy that can treat the progressive blindness, and on wednesday, its maker revealed the staggering cost: $ 425,000 per eye. Pricing it was entering a bit of a brave new world: nbc news reports luxturna is the first \" true gene therapy \" that's gotten the green light here for an inherited disease, and unlike other pharmaceutical companies ' workhorses — drugs that patients take for weeks, months, or even a lifetime — luxturna is expensive to create and delivered just once. And as the washington post explains, luxturna isn't necessarily a cure for the up to 2,000 americans who suffer from the disease. In trials, it has \" worked \" for patients for as long as four years ( fiercebiotech explains patients are born with poor vision, and their vision doesn't become \" normal \" with luxturna but does functionally improve ), though there are indications its effects could extend beyond that mark. The guardian reports that maker spark therapeutics had previously tossed out the figure $ 1 million when discussing the total treatment cost, saying that was a fair amount when you consider the cost of blindness. The post says it went with the lower figure in part because insurers indicated $ 500,000 per eye would shrink the pool of those who qualified, and the company is discussing rebate and payment plan options. But one critic tells nbc he wants spark to release its r&d costs so \" analysts, payers, and the public have a basis to assess spark's decision. \"",

        "summary": "As part of his ongoing attempt to appear more presidential, donald trump gave a speech on foreign policy wednesday in which he called for the country to be \" america first \" in its dealings with the rest of the world. \"both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours, and we — while being fair to them — must start doing the same, \" trump said, per the hill. Trump said the us has been making too many deals that hurt it and needs to have a \" two-way street \" in the future, cnn reports. He characterized the foreign policy of obama and clinton as \" randomness \" and \" chaos \" and criticized them for ignoring islamic extremists. Here are some of the early reactions to trump's speech: chris cillizza at the washington post, among others, knocked the speech's lack of specifics: \" the 45-minute speech was heavy on what the country has done wrong under president obama and decidedly light on the specifics of how trump will fix things. \" cnn's fareed zakaria called the speech \" bizarre \" and \" incoherent. \" but ann coulter was a fan. \" greatest foreign policy speech since washington's farewell address, \" she tweeted. Lindsey graham's twitter account, on the other hand, had burns for days. For example, \" are we sure the guy running the teleprompter has the pages in the right order? \" and, \" not sure who is advising trump on foreign policy but i can understand why he's not revealing their names. \" david sanger at the new york times says trump \" left questions on the table \" and included \" many big, trump-like themes \" that nonetheless contradicted each other. White house press secretary josh earnest pounced on trump's mispronunciation of tanzania: \" apparently, the phonetics are not included on the teleprompter. \" that slip didn't bother newt gingrich at all. \" washington elites mock trump for mispronouncing tanzania, \" he tweeted. \" they don't get it. He said the most important word correctly: america. He gets it. \" finally, the new republic's ryu spaeth was left unimpressed: \" he declared that america is ' finally going to have a coherent foreign policy, ' but literally nothing could be less coherent than the rambling, uncharacteristically telepromptered speech he gave today. \"",

            "Washington ( ap ) — the trump administration is cutting off u.s. Funding to the united nations agency for reproductive health under an abortion-related provision in a law that democratic and republican administrations have used as a cudgel in the global culture wars. The u.n. Population fund will lose $ 32.5 million in funding from the 2017 budget, the state department said, with funds shifted to similar programs at the u.s. Agency for international development. The administration accused the agency, through its work with china's government, of supporting population control programs in china that include coercive abortion. It wasn't immediately clear whether the u.n. Fund would also lose out on tens of millions of additional dollars it has typically received from the u.s. In \" non-core \" funds. By halting assistance to the u.n. Population fund, the trump administration is following through on promises to let socially conservative policies that president donald trump embraced in his campaign determine the way the u.s. Government operates and conducts itself in the world. Though focused on forced abortion — a concept opposed by liberals and conservatives alike — the move to invoke the \"",

Despite the economic downturn, property crimes like burglary were down 8 %, a small decline but the ninth consecutive annual one, reuters notes. The fall in violent crime is because of a combination of factors, including better policing, an older population, and the tendency of communities to pull together when faced with a crisis like the economic downturn, a university of maryland criminology professor tells msnbc. \" we also have a record number of immigrants, and, contrary to popular belief, immigrants have lower crime rates than the rest of society, \" he says.

According to fbi analysis, the homicide drop would mean that nearly 280 fewer americans were murdered last year, which would be the lowest homicide death toll since the mid-1950s.

Also called a white rainbow, a moonbow appears when moonlight ( which is sunlight reflected off the moon ) in the days just before, during, and after a full moon hits the mist generated by the falls. Because we can't see colors well in low light, a moonbow appears white, reports bbc travel, though photographers can use long exposures to capture its actual colors. Moonbows are occasionally — but not regularly — seen elsewhere in the world, including at yosemite falls in california. What makes cumblerland falls and victoria falls so unique is that they boast just the right amount of splash along a wide enough ( rather than deep and narrow ) gorge so that moonlight can reach down and across the mist. Cnn notes that because sunlight is much stronger than moonlight, moonbows are rainbow's fainter cousin. They're temperamental in other ways: cloudy nights can prevent the bow from forming, and niagara falls on the us-canada border has lost its moonbow thanks to light pollution. Bustle reports on one photographer who in november caught a similar fogbow, which forms in the fog, arching over a solitary tree in scotland; it went viral on instagram and twitter.

The difference, of course, is that the moon doesn't produce its own light. So it's light from the sun reflecting off the",

Hyde-smith's campaign reported the mlb donation on nov. 23, well after her controversial joke about a public hanging made the news, though the league says it was made earlier. Walmart, union pacific, and other corporate donors have also asked the campaign to return their donations. Polls show that democratic rival mike espy has narrowed hyde-smith's lead and is gaining momentum, though the republican is still expected to win tuesday's runoff election. President trump is planning to appear at two hyde-smith rallies monday night. \" i think espy supporters are probably a little more energized than hyde-smith, \" former rnc committeeman henry barbour tells politico. \" but i do think conservative voters realize this race is going to decide if we have a conservative or liberal representing us in washington and that is very motivating to conservative voters. \" ( hyde-smith went to a \" segregation academy \" in the 1970s. )",

        "summary": "A new survey of hospital practices may make it more common for doctors to actively treat a baby born at 22 weeks, at least a week younger than the generally accepted standard for viability, reports the new york times. The study in the new england journal of medicine found that hospitals that chose to treat babies at that age, rather than providing \" comfort care \" until they die, had at least limited success: babies at 22 weeks did not survive without active treatment, but they had a survival rate of 23 % if they received it. Of the 18 survivors, six had serious issues such as cerebral palsy, blindness, or deafness as toddlers. One of the major takeaways of the study is that hospitals vary widely in their preemie practices, with no real standard on what the treatment cutoff should be, reports the ap. \" it confirms that if you don't do anything, these babies will not make it, and if you do something, some of them will make it, \" the chief of neonatology at the university of florida, who was not involved with the study, tells the times. \" many who have survived have survived with severe handicaps. \" this is the first major assessment of preemie care, and while it shows that most 22-week-olds don't make it, the results could raise pressure on hospitals with a higher age for treatment cutoff to lower it. \" the main message is that there's potential for more babies to survive without major or severe impairment at gestational ages that physicians once thought was impossible, \" a researcher from the university of alabama at birmingham tells al.com.",

Made with special binders, the revamped pills would turn into a gooey substance instead of powder or liquid if someone tried to crush or dissolve them, making the drug extremely difficult to snort or inject, cbs news notes. But a new study published in jama psychiatry that examined surveys of 11,000 drug users at 150 treatment facilities across 48 states found that hardcore addicts will either find novel ways to circumvent the pill's properties or, just as bad, turn to a cheaper street drug: heroin. Washington university school of medicine researchers discovered that although the percentage of addicts entering rehab who had used oxycontin within the past 30 days declined since the abuse-deterrent pill was introduced ( 45 % in 2010; 26 % in 2012 ), addicts \" have figured out how to circumvent \" it, theodore cicero, the study's lead author, tells cbs. He adds that users go online to trade techniques on \" cooking \" the pill to get a stronger high, and when that doesn't work, they often turn to heroin, which is often cheaper and easier to get than prescription drugs: almost 50 % of addicts entering rehab said they had used heroin within the past 30 days. \" there are people who will continue to use, no matter what the drug makers do, \" cicero says. \" until we focus more on why people use these drugs, we won't be able to solve this problem. \" ( the new face of heroin may not be what you expect. )",

Jenera had been part of a suicide pact made by young girls in the community of 400 oji-cree, which suffered the suicides of two of jenera's 12-year-old friends, jolyn winter and chantel fox, in january, report cbc news and the toronto star. Community leaders learned of the pact last summer and had hoped to prevent the loss of life. Jenera, one of 40 young people deemed at risk of suicide in wapekeka, received specialized care outside of the community, reports aptn. Three weeks after she returned home, she was found dead at an outdoor ice rink by another 12-year-old, prompting wapekeka to declare a state of emergency tuesday. Following the january deaths, health canada set aside $ 380,000 annually to pay for four youth mental health workers in wapekeka until 2019. But community leaders say the money has yet to arrive and they're still floundering. \" we don't have enough personnel to keep watching people on a 24/7 basis that are at high risk. We try, but we just don't have the resources, \" wapekeka band manager joshua frogg tells the cbc. He hopes the state of emergency will trigger an immediate response. In addition to mental health workers, frogg says a health and safety plan should be in place for at-risk youth returning to wapekeka. No such plan was in place for jenera, he says, adding she was allowed to return home against the advice of a psychiatrist. ( the problem isn't limited to ontario. )",

Researchers looked at 40 volunteers, all back pain sufferers, and found that brain scans could predict with 85 % accuracy whether their pain would become chronic. At issue is the emotional response to injury and the relationship between two brain regions, the nucleus accumbens and the frontal cortex, the telegraph reports. When these brain regions — related to motivational and emotional behavior — get to talking, the odds increase that pain will become chronic, explains psychcentral. \" the injury itself is not enough to explain the ongoing pain, \" says the study's lead researcher. \" it has to do with the injury combined with the state of the brain. \" but while brain scans did connect chronic pain to communication levels in the brain, they did not establish a causal link, notes health day news.",

One expert says warmbier's family may have decided not to treat a medical issue — such as pneumonia, or sepsis, or a urinary tract infection — given that warmbier was unlikely ever to recover from his vegetative state. Another says warmbier may have suffered a pulmonary embolism, with his long flight from north korea making a blood clot more likely. Here's what else you need to know about warmbier and north korea following the 22-year-old's death: we should have more details on warmbier's death late tuesday or wednesday when the coroner releases initial autopsy findings, reuters reports. The cavalier daily reports the university of virginia student council will hold a vigil for warmbier at 9pm tuesday on campus. \" the thoughts and prayers of the university of virginia student body are with the warmbier family and all those who loved otto, \" the council said in a statement. Warmbier's funeral will be held thursday morning at wyoming high school in ohio, abc news tweets. Despite trump's apparent willingness to sit down with kim jong un, experts say warmbier's death dramatically reduces — if not outright kills — chances for an improved relationship between the us and north korea. \" there is going to be a lot of anger, \" the director of the us-korea institute at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies tells the new york times. Time reports south korean president moon jae-in condemned north korea's \" unjust and cruel treatment \" of warmbier without outright accusing its government of murder. \" we cannot know for sure that north korea killed mr. Warmbier, \" moon said. \" but i believe it is quite clear that they have a heavy responsibility in the process that led to mr. Warmbier's death. \"",

We consider this act to be unacceptable and condemn it in the strongest terms. It is another example of the syrian authorities'disregard for international norms, peace and security, and human life. Our thoughts at this difficult time are with the missing turkish aircrew, their families and their loved ones. We continue to follow the situation closely and with great concern, and will remain seized of developments on the south-eastern border of nato. The security of the alliance is indivisible.

So says tina wilson, a londoner who found after a breakup that her friends were trying to play matchmaker, but that they didn't have any good tools to find someone for her online, reports mashable. So she started her own, an app called wingman, which works much like many dating apps but requires the participation of both the person who will be doing the dating and the friend who will be doing the deciding. The dater can't write his or her own profile or make his or her own connections with other potential daters — only the \" wingman \" can. The app has been up and running in the uk for a few years now, but is just being released in the us. In practice, at least so far, mostly women are doing the matchmaking, but there is a pretty even number of men and women daters. And having a friend involved serves as a confidence-booster, too, reports the verge. Friends tend to write lovely, flattering profiles, and they are the ones to \" absorb \" the rejections that the person doing the dating will never have to see. One woman describes it being a real help when her mother and sister took the reigns after she moved to a new city and didn't know anyone.

        "summary": "Fbi director james comey has waded into the controversy surrounding president trump's claim that he was wiretapped by former president obama last fall, the new york times reports. Officials say comey has asked the justice department to publicly reject trump's explosive claim, both because he believes it's false and because he believes it suggests the fbi was engaged in illegal behavior. The times'sources say senior fbi officials are also worried that if the public believes there was a court-approved trump wiretap, they might expect them to find solid evidence of russian interference in last year's election. In other coverage: the white house has demanded a congressional investigation of its claims, though lawmakers from both parties say they want more evidence to back up trump's allegations, nbc news reports. \" i've never heard that allegation made before by anybody, \" gop sen. Marco rubio said sunday. Key members of congress say they will obey trump's request, though the ap notes that any such investigation could be risky for trump, since democrats will have access to evidence, including any findings that could be damaging to the president. We \" will follow the evidence where it leads, and we will continue to be guided by the intelligence and facts as we compile our findings, \" sen. Richard burr, the republican chair of the senate intelligence committee, said sunday. Politico has more on the \" baffled \" reaction of lawmakers to trump's claims, with even some of the president's closest allies wary about discussing the allegations. The washington post says it interviewed 17 white house officials and others for a report on trump's \" fury \" at leaks and other setbacks in the days surrounding his obama accusation. The new york times looks at how the accusation took around 36 hours to go from an \" unfounded conspiratorial rant \" on conservative talk radio to trump's twitter feed. Former attorney general michael mukasey says he believes there may have been surveillance of trump tower, but he doesn't think obama ordered it, the hill reports. Mukasey, who served in the george w. Bush administration, told abc's this week that the justice department could have ordered a wiretap in the belief \" that somebody in trump tower may have been acting as an agent of the russians for whatever purpose. \"",

Nearly 29,000 people have signed on online petition calling for a harsher sentence for 39-year-old joshua robinson, who received a four-year prison sentence following the 2015 bust. The straits times says he pleaded guilty to charges of having sex with minors, as well as to showing an obscene film to a 6-year-old. Robinson's original arrest was for having sex with one of the girls, whom he met via a dating app, but when cops raided his apartment, they also found thousands of xxx-rated films, including one that showed him having sex with the second teen, whom he'd met a couple of years earlier. Sarah woon, who started the petition and says she knows the family of the 6-year-old, says she finds it \" absolutely intolerable \" that robinson only got four years, sans caning ( which the bbc notes is a typical singaporean punishment ). The south china morning post reports the legal age of consent in the country is 16, and that the maximum sentence for consensual sexual intercourse with minors 14 and older is a fine and/or 10 years in prison. Prosecutors say they won't appeal the sentence because robinson wasn't charged with rape or sexual assault, and because they said the girls had consented to the sex acts, but the country's home affairs minister said wednesday that officials will be reviewing cases like robinson's to determine if they should be \" dealt with more severely through higher penalties. \" ( meanwhile, two guys who spray-painted a singapore train got a caning sentence. )",

        "summary": "Stephen colbert's long-awaited takeover of the late show took place last night, and the critics are weighing in. The overall consensus: he may not be david letterman's clone, but that's probably not what we want anyway. The consensus is colbert looks to be a solid addition to the late-night lineup. Some of the reviews: \" it was good, it was very, very good, \" was the assessment of robert lloyd, who concedes for the los angeles times that there were a \" few small glitches and creaks, \" but that \" you don't leave a great party complaining about a crack in the bowl the potato chips were in. \" he adds while colbert shares certain traits with letterman — \" curiosity, intelligence, seriousness, a sense of the absurd, a speedy mind, a nose for phoniness \" — he's also \" less acerbic \" and \" less haunted. \" lloyd grove also points out discrepancies between colbert ( \" the joyful jester \" ) and letterman ( \" the great cynic \" ) for the daily beast, noting there \" was nary a sour whiff of the world-weary psychic struggle, the undercurrent of self-flagellating insecurity, or the deep suspicion of human motives that fueled letterman's comic genius. \" instead, colbert offered himself up as an \" all-singing, all-dancing performer with a sweetly magnetic smile \" and a knack for sending up the media ( donald trump obsession was last night's target ). What grove didn't care for: some of the prepared skits he says fell flat. James poniewozik writes for the new york times that the show was built \" around a vibe of smart fun and an urge to show off its host's many skills, \" including his interviewing acumen. \" the host showed he had both fastballs and changeups in his repertoire, \" poniewozik says of colbert's back-and-forth with jeb bush, in which colbert \" refused to let [ bush ] wiggle out with a joke answer \" as to how he differs politically from brother george w. It would be both \" stupid \" and \" amateur \" to give colbert a full-fledged review based on one show, tim goodman writes for the hollywood reporter, so he gives a \" first impression. \" \" this first night seemed like an amalgamation of every piece of colbert \" and \" there were some nerves \" — but \" how could there not be? \" he writes. \" there were plenty of flashes of the wickedly smart and super-fast comedic intellect he's honed over the years.

It's an addiction the taliban has proved willing to exploit. \" the taliban are sending boys — beautiful boys, handsome boys — to penetrate checkpoints and kill, drug, and poison policemen, \" says a former police chief, who calls bacha bazi the \" biggest weakness of police forces. \" officials say the taliban has killed hundreds of police officers in this way over the past two years. There were at least six such attacks between january and april alone. One former police officer recalls a young sex slave opening fire in the middle of the night, killing seven other officers. The boys — between the ages of 12 and 15 — are often abducted from playgrounds to be sex slaves, the poorer the better, rt reports. Many of them see the taliban as the only escape from their police abusers. Bacha bazi, which was banned under taliban rule, is not seen as pedophilia or homosexuality, which is illegal in afghanistan. The director of child soldiers international blames the practice partly on the limited access to women in afghan society. The pentagon launched an investigation in february after long ignoring reports from soldiers.",

        "summary": "Dr. Robert lustig has studied childhood obesity for 16 years and cross-analyzed numerous studies to come to a not-so-sweet conclusion: sugar should be thought of along the same lines as tobacco, cocaine, or alcohol, he told the guardian in august. Now lustig is a member of a 12-scientist team working on sugarscience, a university of california-san francisco initiative that hopes to showcase reputable studies on added sugars and how they impact health, a ucsf news article reports. The sugarscience group has already reviewed more than 8,000 papers and found evidence to support lustig's previous assertions, linking excess sugar consumption to such chronic diseases as type 2 diabetes and liver and heart disease. Laura schmidt, the initiative's lead researcher, told the chicago tribune in december that the point of the project is to make these findings accessible to the public through its website and social media. The average american consumes 19.5 teaspoons of added sugar a day, significantly higher than what the american heart association recommends ( 6 teaspoons for women, 9 teaspoons for men, and 3 to 6 teaspoons for kids, according to ucsf ). Schmidt notes that added sugars show up in 74 % of all packaged foods and appear under at least 60 different names, making them hard to find on food labels. Though some have said that calling sugar a poison is high-fructose hyperbole — a 2013 scientific american article noted that \" many worrying fructose studies use unrealistic doses \" of sugar and that rodents used as subjects process it differently than humans — not many are disputing we should eat less of it. The fda is considering expanding its food labels to include an \" added sugars \" category to help consumers keep their sugar intake in check. ( the who says just 5 % of your calories should be from sugar. )",

The strain, identified in cows ' milk by researchers studying udder infections, is genetically very different from the dozens of other strains of superbug identified, reports the bbc.

Illnesses that cross the species barrier can be particularly lethal. Finding a new mrsa strain in both humans and cows is \" very worrying, \" said one of the researchers who discovered the phenomenon. Environmental groups say the discovery of the bug shows that the problem of antibiotic overuse at farms needs to be addressed, the guardian notes. \" dairy systems are becoming ever more antibiotic-dependent, \" the director of the soil association says. \" we need to get farmers off this treadmill, even if that means that milk has to cost a few pennies more. \"",

So kim and kanye have found a surrogate through an agency and agreed to pay the following: -- $ 45,000 in 10, $ 4,500 monthly installments -- if there are multiples, the surrogate gets $ 5k for each additional kid -- if the surrogate loses reproductive organs, she gets $ 4,000 kim and kanye are also required to deposit $ 68,850 with the agency. The surrogate is required to refrain from smoking, drinking and drugs during the pregnancy. She also agrees to restrict sexual activities in the weeks leading up to the pregnancy, including foregoing sexual intercourse for 3 weeks following embryo implantation. The surrogate cannot go in hot tubs or saunas, cannot handle or change cat litter, apply hair dye, drink more than one caffeinated beverage per day or eat raw fish. The agreement provides that kim and kanye \" assume the legal and parental responsibilities for any child... That may possess any congenital or other abnormalities or defects. \"",
            "Let the name game begin. Multiple sources tell e! news that kim kardashian has decided to have another baby with husband kanye west. The e! reality star and the grammy-winning musician are already parents to daughter north west, 4, and son saint west, 18 months. Because kim has placenta accreta, making a third pregnancy potentially life-threatening, they used an agency to hire a surrogate. The question of whether to have another child is one kim has been public about in the past. In the nov. 13, 2016 episode of keeping up with the kardashians, kim — who celebrated her third wedding anniversary may 2 — said she \" would love to maybe \" have another baby. So, she talked to ob/gyn dr. Paul crane to weigh her options, given her complicated pregnancies and deliveries. Because she suffered from toxemia and a retained placenta, which was \" traumatic \" on her body, the odds of her having another difficult pregnancy are higher, dr. Crane explained."

The two are \" blind sheik \" omar abdel-rahman, mastermind of the 1993 attack on the world trade center, and aafia siddiqui, a female pakistani scientist convicted of trying to kill us soldiers and fbi agents while in custody.

        "summary": "The manhunt is over. Police caught boston bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev tonight after finding him hiding in a boat in a watertown backyard, reports wcvb. Tsarnaev was taken by ambulance to a hospital; the ap reports that he is in serious condition. Multiple gunshots were heard at the scene of his arrest earlier this evening, preceding a standoff of about two hours. The developments began shortly after police wrapped up a late-afternoon news conference to say the 19-year-old was still at large. Nbc news spoke with a relative of the resident who found tsarnaev, and the story is a wild one: in the relative's telling, the man was having a cigarette outside when he saw that the boat's tarp was loose; he went to fix it, saw a person and bloody clothes inside the boat, \" freaked out, \" and called police. Helicopters used thermal imaging to confirm tsarnaev's presence. Some other developments and revelations: \"all in all, this has been a tough week, but we have seen the character of our country once more, \" said president obama after the arrest. \" tonight our nation is in debt to the people of boston and the people of massachusetts. \" politico has more details on his comments. The fbi took two men and a woman in for questioning from a house in new bedford, but it's not clear how serious it is. A police lieutenant says tsarnaev may have lived in the off-campus home at some point, reports ap. Authorities lifted the \" shelter in place \" advisory for residents of boston, with public transportation now open again. Dzhokhar ran over his wounded brother tamerlan in his haste to escape last night's shootout with police, reports the globe. Tamerlan was killed, as was one officer; another officer was wounded. One notable revision: authorities say neither of the brothers robbed a 7-11 store in cambridge as police previously reported. A 7-11 did get robbed, but not by them, a store exec tells usa today. \" the police or someone made a mistake. Someone was confused. \" tamerlan died wearing explosives and a triggering device, cnn reports. One local auto shop owner tells the wall street journal that dzhokhar, a regular customer, came to him on tuesday and said he needed his car \" right now. \" the mechanic protested that the bumper and tail lights weren't on it, but dzhokhar took it anyway. \" i think he probably knew something was going to happen. \"",

        "summary": "Apparently tinder's requirement that users swipe left to reject a profile and right to make a connection is just too demanding, prompting two 24-year-olds fresh out of the university of southern florida to unleash a new bot, called casanova, to do the heavy lifting for you. Users let casanova play pickup artist, connecting to one's tinder account, scanning profiles, and sending introductory messages to potential flings — sometimes using funny lines, sometimes romantic ones, all depending on the type of profile casanova judges the user to be, reports bay news 9. \" when we came up with this one, we were, like,'this one's ready to go, ' \" alex kessler tells the daily dot. \" this has to get done. I don't even care if it makes money, it's so awesome. \" he and his buddy paul terentev decided to arm their bot with the kind of unfettered enthusiasm they felt most tinder users lacked ( both men and women can use casanova, reports the tampa bay business journal ), casting a wide net to as many potential dates as possible in one's physical area over a 20-minute period and sending messages to any matches. Example: \" you're too pretty for tinder. What are you doing here? \" the goal? get as many phone numbers as quickly as possible, and then let the tinder user take the reins. Apparently tinder as a program cannot distinguish casanova from real users, and the bot's founders say they're hoping to eventually set it loose on other services, like match.com. ( check out the tinder ceo's painfully candid interview from earlier this year. )",

The twilight actress has just published a research paper on a machine learning technique called \" neural style transfer \" and its use in film, reports quartz. Style transfer is a \" fun technique, \" according to tech crunch, though it's a bit complicated to explain. Essentially, an algorithm is used to apply the style of one thing to something else. In this case, stewart — with help from starlight studios producer david shapiro and adobe research engineer bhautik j joshi — sought to transfer the look of one of her own paintings to scenes from her short film come swim. Using computer programs known as neural networks, the group was able to add \" blocks of color and texture \" to a test frame until it matched the look of the painting, which depicts \" a man rousing from sleep, \" reports the verge. Once they had achieved the look they wanted on the test frame, they applied the same technique to the opening and closing scenes of come swim, described as \" a poetic, impressionistic portrait of a heartbroken man underwater, \" which premiered at the sundance film festival on thursday, per the guardian.

As the fire reached higher elevations, climbing out of steep ravines, crews could take their stand on more level ground. Huge air tankers could finally drop retardant on accessible ridges. The fire has charred a swath of nearly 161,000 acres — including about 21,000 acres inside the park. It has destroyed at least 23 structures, and threatens two groves of giant sequoias and historical structures in the famed park. But about 25 miles away, the tourist magnet of yosemite valley remained safe, surrounded by its famed granite walls. The fire is burning hotter and faster than any in modern sierra nevada history, firefighters say. Officials say it is the california wildfire they have warned about for years, as modern firefighting techniques have snuffed out forest fires, allowing fuel to build up on the mountain floor. \" this is it. This is the big one, \" yosemite fire chief kelly martin said.

        "summary": "The latest issue of rolling stone hits the newsstands today, bearing the smiling face of barack obama. The interview within is exhaustive, though it mainly treads familiar ground — as the writer, historian douglas brinkley notes, \" excessive caution is a survival trait \" in today's gaffe-driven campaign culture. Some highlights came out yesterday, and the full interview is now available. Here's a taste of what the president said: in one answer that's already got people talking, obama was asked about paul ryan's \" obsession \" with ayn rand. Obama said he had read rand's work. \" ayn rand is one of those things that a lot of us, when we were 17 or 18 and feeling misunderstood, we'd pick up. Then, as we got older, we realize that a world in which we're only thinking about ourselves … that's a pretty narrow vision. \" asked if a romney win would doom roe v. Wade, obama replied, \" i don't think there's any doubt. \" on whether financial reform went far enough: \" i've looked at some of rolling stone's articles that say,'this didn't go far enough, we didn't institute glass-steagall ' and so forth, and i pushed my economic team very hard on some of those questions. \" but glass-steagall wouldn't have prevented the meltdown. \" the problem in today's financial sector can't be solved simply by reimposing models that were created­ in the 1930s. \" on romney's debate policy flips: \" what i think happened is that we won the battle of ideas during the course of the last year, \" forcing romney to \" fuzz up those positions. \" what did he think when he saw romney's 47 % video? \" it's an indication of a story that republicans have been telling themselves for a while, at least a sizable portion. \" obama often talks about giving people a \" fair shake. \" brinkley asked if that might become his \" new deal \" -esque legacy. \" i'd be comfortable with that, and hearing it from a historian, it sounds pretty good to me. \" for the full interview, click here.",

            "We arrived at the oval office for our 45-minute interview with president obama on the morning of october 11th. After our conversation ended, the president would board air force one for florida, where he was slated to hold a rally at the university of miami before watching vice president joe biden debate rep. Paul ryan. But now, before the tape recorders were turned on, the president and i chatted for a minute about \" the bronco buster, \" the frederic remington sculpture next to his desk that once belonged to theodore roosevelt. Then, as the small talk began to eat up too much time, obama took charge. \" all right, \" he said briskly. \" let's fire up. \" photos: president barack obama barack obama can no longer preach the bright 2008 certitudes of \" hope and change. \" he has a record to defend this time around. And, considering the lousy hand he was dealt by george w. Bush and an obstructionist congress, his record of achievement, from universal health care to equal pay for women, is astonishingly solid. His excessive caution is a survival trait; at a time when the ripple and fury provoked by one off-key quip can derail a campaign for days, self-editing is the price a virtuoso must pay to go the distance in the age of youtube. Viewed through the lens of history, obama represents a new type of 21st-century politician: the progressive firewall. Obama, simply put, is the curator-in-chief of the new deal, the fair deal, the new frontier and the great society."

In a history of eclipse predictions, buzzfeed reports two chinese astronomers were beheaded by the emperor after failing to predict a total solar eclipse in 2134 bce. Their failure could perhaps be forgiven — it would be nearly 4,000 years before astronomers were able to start making reliable ground maps of eclipses. Here's what else you need to know about the upcoming celestial show: 24/7 wall st. Is warning of massive traffic jams as up to 7 million people travel to the 70-mile-wide strip stretching from oregon to south carolina where the total eclipse will be visible. And that can mean headaches for some small towns in that strip, the guardian reports. \" why is god mad at us? \" asks the mayor of weiser, a tiny idaho town of 5,500 that is expecting up to 70,000 for the eclipse but was only able to procure 70 port-a-potties for their use. But human behavior researchers tell the new york times a total solar eclipse is worth braving the crowds to view alongside other people. It makes the experience more emotional and provides a way to connect with others, even for a few minutes. One thing that can make massive crowds more tolerable: alcohol. The daily beast provides a \" drinker's guide \" to the eclipse, including a distiller in oregon selling 97-proof eclipse whiskey and a winery in illinois that bottled 100 cases of eclipse wine for the 5,000 people it's expecting. Meanwhile, buzzfeed talks to a bunch of eclipse fanatics to find out what makes total solar eclipses so special. \"i feel as if i am in the presence of a deity, and i understand that in this vast universe, i am nothing, \" one such fanatic explains. Need a soundtrack for your eclipse viewing? time reports bonnie tyler will sing her 1983 hit \" total eclipse of the heart \" during royal caribbean's total eclipse cruise, which will be positioned in the eclipse's path off the east coast. At least one person in america isn't planning on viewing monday's eclipse. According to usa today, lou tomososki of oregon still has permanent eye damage — a permanent blurry spot in his vision — from staring at a partial eclipse in 1962 without eye protection. Don't be like lou tomososki. Npr has a video showing how to make your own eclipse viewer so you can watch the action without burning out your retinas.",

        "summary": "Irma moved into the southeast on monday as a tropical storm, not a hurricane, but it was still deadly: authorities say there were at least three storm-related deaths in georgia and one in south carolina, along with flooding in cities including jacksonville, fla., and charleston, sc. Police in georgia say the storm's victims include a man killed when a tree fell in his house, a man blown from his roof, and a woman who died when a tree fell on a vehicle, the ap reports. In south carolina, a falling tree limb killed a man. Irma has now weakened from a tropical storm to a tropical depression which is forecast to drop 5 inches to 8 inches of rain over south carolina, northern georgia, alabama, and mississippi in the coming days. The latest: irma, which put atlanta under a tropical storm warning for the first time, gave georgia a hammering that caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights and left at least 1.3 million people without power early tuesday, the atlanta journal-constitution reports. In florida, gov. Rick scott advised patience for evacuees anxious to return home, cnn reports. \" don't think just because this thing passed, you can run home. We've got downed power lines all across the state, \" he said monday. \" we've got roads that are impassible still across the state. We've got debris all over the state. \" the hard-hit florida keys will partially reopen on tuesday to allow residents to assess damage, reuters reports. Navy ships including the uss abraham lincoln have been sent to distribute food and evacuate some of the 10,000 residents who rode out the storm. Authorities say they aren't sure how many people were killed by the hurricane. The damage in most of florida was not as catastrophic as feared, but irma left an estimated 12 million people, or two-thirds of the state's population, without power, the washington post reports. Authorities warn that some customers could be without power for weeks if parts of the system need to be rebuilt. Miami and fort lauderdale airports will reopen tuesday with limited service, the miami herald reports. Public schools in miami, however, are closed until further notice, and miami-dade county is under a mandatory 7pm to 7am curfew. In orlando, the storm claimed another victim monday when a 51-year-old man was electrocuted by a downed power line in a park, the orlando sentinel reports. ( florida residents got their first look at the damage monday. )",

Dan brown introduced senate bill 75, which would require schools to use the eddie eagle gunsafe program or similar. The program was designed by the nra, and its website says it teaches kids \" important steps to take if they find a gun, \" as presented by mascot eddie eagle. But opponents of the bill say that exposing children to guns at all will get them interested in weapons. The bill assures that firearms would be prohibited while the program is being taught, and teachers can't make \" value judgements about firearms \" publicly, kait-8 reports. It would also require simulated active shooter drills, and for teachers and other school employees to receive training for how to deal with a school shooting situation.",

The prince's latest intervention comes soon after the release of 44 \"black spider \" letters he sent to government ministers between 2004 and 2009, in which he gave advice and requested action from government on environmental and other topics.

There seems to be a strategic chasm between where the world agrees it should be headed and the direction of the economy prince charles he said: \"yet if we are to limit climate change, conserve resources and keep ecosystems functioning, while at the same time improving the health and wellbeing of billions of people – including the several billion who are projected to be added later this century – then we will need to see profound changes. \" the prince also attacked what he characterised as the wastefulness of modern society. \"the challenge now is to go much further and much faster, progressively eliminating waste by developing a circular economy that mimics nature's loops and cycles, rather than perpetuating our largely unsustainable and linear way of doing things, \" he said. The prince's latest intervention comes soon after the release of 44 \"black spider \" letters he sent to government ministers between 2004 and 2009, in which he gave advice and requested action from government on environmental and other topics. In that correspondence, released following a 10-year legal battle fought by the guardian, the prince lobbied ministers for detailed and specific measures including a badger cull.. At the event, the prince unveiled a report from the cisl. It argued the world's current course revealed \"a monumental market failure \"",

        "summary": "If a university of kentucky junior had paid a little more attention during statistics lectures, he probably wouldn't have had to try to steal the exam — and he would have been better able to judge the odds of his scheme succeeding. Henry lynch ii, a 21-year-old majoring in biosystems engineering, planned to steal the final statistics exam by crawling through the ducts of a lexington university building and lowering himself into an instructor's office, the new york times reports. The university says lynch and accomplice troy kiphuth, who lynch let into the room after making his way through the ducts, were caught in the act around 1: 30am wednesday after instructor john cain unexpectedly returned from a late-night meal. A university spokesman says after cain found the door blocked, he \" yelled out that he was calling the police and then the door swung open and two young men ran down the hallway. \" but lynch, worried that cain had recognized him, returned after police got there and confessed, the lexington herald-leader reports. He admitted that he had made his way through the ducts to cain's office twice before: at 6pm the previous day in a failed attempt to find the final exam, and earlier in the semester, when he managed to make off with another exam. It's unclear how he was able to get into the air-duct system. Lynch and kiphuth, who is not in cain's class, have both been charged with felony burglary.

The national institutes of health reported the results today. \" whether it's a breakthrough depends on making sure that all the rest of data over the next few weeks and months is in line, \" says the chief executive of the drug-maker. \" but this certainly gives us very significant cause for optimism. \" one drawback: it took high doses of the drug to trigger an immune response, which could eventually complicate mass production. One plus: the vaccine contains no live ebola virus and can't cause the disease.

        "summary": "While investigators try to untangle the strange case of a 13-year-old boy found hidden behind a fake wall in a georgia home, the people accused of hiding him aren't going anywhere: gregory jean, the boy's father, and his partner, samantha joy davis, have been charged with false imprisonment and child cruelty and were denied bail at a hearing yesterday, wxia reports. Three juveniles at the home near jonesboro were also arrested after police found the boy, who was reported missing by his mother four years ago. According to the atlanta journal-constitution, davis is still on probation for a 2006 child abuse case in which she was accused of cutting her 6-year-old son's tongue with heated kitchen shears. She pleaded guilty to lesser charges in exchange for probation. Davis is accused of beating the 13-year-old boy, who police say was found early saturday morning after he managed to contact his mother. She alerted officers searching the home to his location in a hidden compartment. Neighbors tell wsb-tv that they had often seen the boy doing yardwork and are shocked to hear he was held captive. One neighbor, however, decided to take a video after seeing the boy doing dangerous work on the roof as the couple looked on. When the \" overjoyed \" boy was reunited with his mother, \" he just couldn't thank us enough, \" a police spokesman says. Police say it's not clear why she contacted child welfare authorities instead of police when the father refused to return the boy after a 2010 visit, but they speculate it may be because she's an immigrant unfamiliar with the system.",

        "summary": "In an especially nasty year for ticks, the us centers for disease control and prevention has issued a statement about a possible method for preventing the spread of diseases carried by their bites, live science reports. By spraying clothing with an insecticide called permethrin, experts believe you can cause the bugs to get so-called \" hot feet \" and fall off before transmitting germs that cause lyme and other tick-borne diseases like rocky mountain spotted fever. According to a study published in the entomological society of america's journal of medical entomology, permethrin caused ticks of multiple species to fall off clothing and, after prolonged exposure, caused their movements to become uncoordinated. The findings are more solid evidence that covering up with clothing and applying insecticide are two vital steps to preventing tick-borne illness. Meanwhile, the number of americans catching diseases from tiny bloodsucking creatures is going up at an alarming rate, federal authorities warn. According to the latest report from the cdc, the number of reported illnesses caused by ticks, mosquitoes, and fleas more than tripled between 2004 and 2016 — and since many illnesses go unreported, the true total is probably much higher than the 642,602 cases reported over the period. In the case of lyme disease, the number of illnesses may be up to 10 times the 36,429 cases the cdc recorded for 2016, the washington post reports. Analysts say other such diseases — including recently discovered ones like powassan virus — are on the rise in the northeast, california, and the upper midwest and partially blame warmer weather, which is causing longer tick seasons and expanded insect ranges.",

Also on the list: fired fbi agent peter strzok, fbi lawyer lisa page, and senior justice department official bruce ohr. At least two of the former officials, comey and mccabe, do not currently have security clearances. Former cia directors and other top national security officials are typically allowed to keep their clearances, at least for some period, so they can be in a position to advise their successors and to hold certain jobs. Experts have said that stripping a security clearance in response to public criticism would be an unprecedented politicization of the clearance process, and democrats were quick to decry trump's move.",

The indian police officers, who claimed to have been the first indian couple to climb everest, were banned from climbing any mountain in nepal for 10 years tuesday after authorities ruled they made the whole thing up, according to the guardian. The rathods claimed to have reached the top of everest on may 23, producing photos as evidence. Nepalese authorities verified their accomplishment based on those photos, but later rescinded that verification after complaints from other climbers. One of those climbers was satyarup siddhanta, an indian man who actually did reach the summit in may and whose photos from the peak the rathods apparently superimposed themselves over. The bbc reports other signs of fakery included the rathods getting from base camp to the summit too quickly and appearing in two different outfits in photos from the summit. \"the ban should serve as a warning for other mountaineers to follow ethics, \" nepal's chief of tourism tells pti. It's unclear why the rathods claimed to have conquered everest, as no one is quite sure where they or their two sherpas are. But the bbc points out people who make everest's summit can get good work writing or speaking about their accomplishment. ( a climber abandoned the everest peak to save a stranger. )",

The floating bales were first seen by a boater near the harbor around 12: 01 p.m., u.s. Coast guard petty officer seth johnson said. The bales were reportedly floating at least 15 miles off shore. The orange county sheriff's department sent three harbor patrol ships to aid in recovering the marijuana. A coast guard cutter was also sent to assist. Border patrol spokesman michael jimenez said his agency took possession of more than 7,000 pounds recovered by the sheriff's orange county harbor patrol and estimated the value at more than $ 3 million. That does not count the marijuana that the coast guard has recovered, jimenez said. Those details are expected on monday. The investigation into how the bales made it into the ocean is continuing. No suspects or vessel have been identified. Jimenez called sunday's incident unusual. In most scenarios when marijuana bales are found dumped in the water it is because a vessel is trying to flee from authorities. \" at other events, they've dumped the bales to get rid of weight if they're being chased, \" he said. \" generally in these cases we're aware they're being dumped. What's more unusual is that the bales were floating with no boat in sight. \" to report suspicious items in the ocean, call the border patrol's tip"

The floating bales were first seen by a boater near the harbor around 12: 01 p.m., u.s. Coast guard petty officer seth johnson said. The bales were reportedly floating at least 15 miles off shore. The orange county sheriff's department sent three harbor patrol ships to aid in recovering the marijuana. A coast guard cutter was also sent to assist. Border patrol spokesman michael jimenez said his agency took possession of more than 7,000 pounds recovered by the sheriff's orange county harbor patrol and estimated the value at more than $ 3 million. That does not count the marijuana that the coast guard has recovered, jimenez said. Those details are expected on monday. The investigation into how the bales made it into the ocean is continuing. No suspects or vessel have been identified. Jimenez called sunday's incident unusual. In most scenarios when marijuana bales are found dumped in the water it is because a vessel is trying to flee from authorities. \" at other events, they've dumped the bales to get rid of weight if they're being chased, \" he said. \" generally in these cases we're aware they're being dumped. What's more unusual is that the bales were floating with no boat in sight. \" to report suspicious items in the ocean, call the border patrol's tip"

So say loch ness monster hunters who have apparently detected the creature on apple maps'satellite imaging. A close look at the right spot in scotland's loch ness, pinpointed at appleinsider, reveals a blurred, whitish image of what might be an underwater nessie. \" it looks like a boat wake, but the boat is missing, \" gary campbell, president of the official loch ness monster fan club, tells the daily mail. \" whatever this is, it is under the water and heading south, so unless there have been secret submarine trials going on in the loch, the size of the object would make it likely to be nessie, \" says campbell. Two people noticed the image last year, the mail reports. \" it was a total fluke that i found it, \" says one. \" i was looking at satellite images of my town and then just thought i'd have a look at loch ness. The first thing that came into my head when i saw it was,'that's the loch ness monster. ' \"",
