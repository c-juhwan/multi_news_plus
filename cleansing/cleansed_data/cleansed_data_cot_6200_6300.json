        "summary": "Palestine's bid for statehood took one step forward yesterday as it gained initial approval for full membership in the united nations educational, scientific, and cultural organization. Membership in unesco would allow palestine to apply to protect its monuments and historical sites as world heritage sites, which would increase conflict with israel since some of those sites are in disputed territory. But if membership is granted, us law may require a cutoff of all contributions to the un and its agencies — a serious move, since 22 % of unesco's budget comes from the us. The 193-nation general conference, which meets later this month, would have to approve palestine's full membership in unesco, the new york times reports, which is part of palestine's campaign for full un membership and statehood. The afp reports that hillary clinton called the unesco decision \" confusing \" and \" inexplicable, \" noting that \" the decision about status must be made in the united nations and not in auxiliary groups. \" the us has promised to veto a statehood bid on the un security council, but no power has a veto on unesco.",

            "Ethan couch, the wealthy tarrant county teen who received probation for killing four people while driving drunk in 2013, is missing — and authorities fear he may have skipped the country. Two years ago, the public anger that welled up when couch's attorneys blamed his crimes on \"affluenza \" boiled into outrage when a fort worth judge didn't sentence him to jail. Now couch, who is 18 but is still a juvenile under the texas legal system, is wanted on suspicion of missing a check-in with his probation officer. Such a failure would be a probation violation. Couch's defense team said it has had no contact with him and declined to comment further. Authorities say they don't plan to go easy on couch. \"any mess-ups from now on, he's going to be over with us, \" said terry grisham, spokesman for the tarrant county sheriff's office. \"he's going to see what the big-boy jail is like. \" but couch is nowhere to be found, and authorities worry he may have fled the u.s. \"with the wealth and the wherewithal that his family has, it's going to be a tough assignment for us to find him, \" tarrant county sheriff dee anderson said wednesday.

Such is the case with farmer's cologne out of maine, which goes for $ 110 a bottle and has the unique selling point that cows seem to like it. That is, a chic farmer could wear it and not upset the sensitive noses of his bovine charges. Creator lisa brodar mixed natural oils and essences such as sandalwood, sage, and blue tansy to create a scent that has \" a woody, earthen musk, with only a hint of the pungency found in mainstream fragrance, \" writes jesse hirsch. His unscientific field test suggests that cows genuinely like it. In an earlier story in the la times, adam tschorn gives the cologne a favorable write-up and says it \" was redolent of the grain and hay smells of the cow barn from my vermont childhood... With an ever-so-slight medicinal note. \" if you can't picture an old-school farmer spritzing himself with a pricey cologne before milking, that might be because brodar doesn't see farmers like that as her key clientele. \" it's for the guy in brooklyn who wants to move back to the land, to become a homesteader … but who still likes going out at night. \" one green planet likes that the product is vegan and mostly organic.

Judicial officials acknowledged earlier in the day that the 51-year-old extremist preacher's release from long lartin jail was imminent, but declined to comment on the reports from the bbc and sky news, citing operational concerns. Both broadcasters aired photographs that appeared to show abu qatada in the backseat of a van as it left the high-security prison in central england. The palestinian-jordanian cleric has spent more than six years in prison, but a tribunal ruled last week he should be released on bail. British officials say he poses a serious threat to the country's security, but attempts to deport him to jordan to face terrorism charges was blocked by the european court of human rights. \" we are clear we want to remove abu qatada at the earliest opportunity, \" said a spokesman for prime minister david cameron.",

What he didn't expect was to lose most of his infant daughter's cremated remains. \" almost all her ashes are gone, \" butler tells the chicago tribune. \" i have nothing else to remember her. \" butler's story: he explains to fox 32 that during the traffic stop, the will county sheriff's deputy who detained him asked for consent to search the vehicle, and butler said yes. The officer found a vial containing the ashes of butler's infant daughter, mariah — who'd died less than two weeks after she was born in 2014 of a congenital heart defect — hanging from his chevy blazer's rearview mirror. Butler usually wears the mini-urn around his neck, but he'd placed it in the car earlier that evening to keep it from getting soiled while he did messy car repairs. Here the story gets murky. Will county deputy chief thomas budde says the officer asked butler if he could field-test a tiny amount of the contents for drugs, and that butler consented. Butler tells the tribune he doesn't recall being asked for permission to do so, though he mentions to fox 32 that the cop \" asked me if it was okay to test a small amount. \" either way, the deputy carried out the test, and butler says when he got back to his car, the vial's cap was missing and his daughter's ashes were spread all over the front console. \" i had to scrape up what was left, \" he tells the tribune. Budde says though the officer \" was careful not to spill anything, \" he was \" caught off-guard \" because he didn't expect to come across someone's ashes kept in that way. \" losing my daughter once was enough to kill most people, \" butler tells fox 32. \" losing my daughter twice — uncalled for. \" ( burglars demanded a ransom for a 6-year-old's ashes. )",

His father, having died two weeks before his birth, never got to meet the near-mythical figure. And now, reports the international business times, tourists are being denied a view of a 126-year-old statue of him outside lisbon's rossio station thanks to a man who attempted to climb it and snap a selfie. Instead, of course, he knocked it over. The historic piece shattered — it looks like this now — and its now barren perch serves as a visual reminder that dom sebastiao himself was never found after he perished in the epic battle of the three kings in morocco in 1578. The would-be selfie-taker, a 24-year-old man, allegedly fled the scene after last week's stunt, but he was quickly apprehended by local authorities and now awaits trial for the destruction of public property and presumably, as vanity fair reports, \" flagrant boneheadedness. \" he is, incidentally, the same age as the portuguese king was when he was last seen riding into a throng of enemy soldiers, notes death and taxes.

The exchange of fire follows a rise in tensions after two south korean soldiers were maimed by land mines near the demilitarized zone earlier this month, cnn reports. In response, seoul started blasting anti-pyongyang messages from loudspeakers near the border for the first time in 11 years, the ap reports, which led the north to restart its own propaganda loudspeakers — and to promise \" an all-out military action of justice \" if seoul didn't stop its broadcasts.

        "summary": "Just a month after starting at a silicon valley startup, a marketing professional from dallas has taken to medium to accuse her already former employer of fraud and more — and the startup is suddenly scrubbing its online presence clean. Penny kim detailed her life since a july 2016 job offer — which included promises of a $ 135,000 salary, equity, and a $ 10,000 signing bonus — with an initially anonymous firm that readers quickly sorted out is wrkriot. The details of kim's \" horrible nightmare \" are so dismal that business insider is calling it \" one of the ugliest start-up stories we've ever heard, \" though for his part wrkriot founder isaac choi tells the new york times that kim is just a \" disgruntled \" former employee with an ax to grind. Wrkriot, which promised to help people find the perfect job, has since gone offline. In the days since kim published her exposé, which she says she wrote \" so that others may know major red flags to look out for when choosing to work for a startup, \" people like daniel tunkelang, a data scientist who advised wrkriot as well as pinterest and etsy, have been publicly denouncing the startup. Meanwhile, the very resume of choi, including where he went to business school, is being called into question. Among other things, kim alleges that the company forged wire-transfer receipts from a bank to dupe employees into thinking the company had issued paychecks, when it actually hadn't. She also says the company had no clear vision and was repeatedly rejected by investors. Tech crunch calls the firm \" in meltdown mode \" as the wrkriot twitter, facebook, and business sites, as well as choi's linkedin page, have all been wiped clean.

( ap ) — the latest on a second rock fall in yosemite one day after a deadly slide ( all times local ): 7 p.m. Yosemite national park says another rock fall has injured one person in the park, one day after a huge chunk of granite killed a british tourist. An immense mass of granite plunged from the side of el capitan on thursday and filled the valley below with a cloud of dust. Park spokesman scott gediman says one injured person was airlifted to a hospital. There's no word on his condition. The fall came a day after tons of rock crashed down from el capitan, killing a tourist who had been on a hiking and climbing trip and injuring a british woman with him. Ryan sheridan, who saw thursday's rock fall from the top of el capitan, says the new slide occurred in the same location as wednesday's but was at least three times as large. ___ 5: 10 p.m. Yosemite national park officials say they have closed one of the exit routes from the park after a new rock fall from el capitan. The slide came thursday, a day after a similar slide on wednesday killed a british climber and injured his female companion. Climbers say thursday's rock slide was much larger than the one wednesday. Ryan sheridan had just reached the top of el capitan when thursday's slide let loose below him. Sheridan told the associated press that \" there was so much smoke and debris, \" and clouds of dust filled the entire valley below. He said thursday's rock slide happened in the same location as the one on wednesday at the el capitan rock formation. ___ 4: 40 p.m. A climber in yosemite national park says a second rock slide was easily \" three times the size \" of a massive rock fall a day earlier that killed a british climber.

        "summary": "The congressional budget office ( cbo ) released a report monday analyzing the senate republicans ' health care bill released last week in the party's latest efforts to repeal the affordable care act. Cnn has the full 50-page report, which estimates that 22 million will lose coverage under the new law. That estimate isn't far off from the proposed house republican plan, where 23 million were projected to lose their insurance, reports the washington post. If the bill passes, approximately 49 million people would be uninsured by 2026. The report also estimates that the federal deficit is expected to decrease significantly under the bill, but that's largely thanks to big cuts to medicaid, a major concern for senate republicans who have not committed to voting for the bill. According to the atlantic, senators including susan collins, lisa murkowski, ron johnson, and rob portman say the cbo report's findings will influence their decisions. \"you can't take over $ 800 billion out of the medicaid program and not expect that it's going to have an impact on a rural nursing home that relies on medicaid for 70 % of the costs of its patients, \" collins said on abc's this week, adding that seven or eight of her colleagues would be looking closely at the cbo report. Meanwhile, senators like rand paul are hoping to push the bill further to the right by eliminating pre-existing conditions clauses. The better care reconciliation act of 2017 was released just last thursday, but party leaders are rejecting pleas to delay a vote until after the july 4 recess.",

The toy was a christmas present given to a whatcom county 3-year-old. \" we put the batteries in and didn't get what we expected, \" said bjorn thorpe, the boy's uncle. \" i do respect other religions, but it's not the right situation to have it on a children's toy. \" \" this is a prayer you're supposed to say when you're performing hajj, \" said nadeem israr, president of the islamic society of whatcom county, who explained the sound is a prayer muslims say during their pilgrimage to mecca. The toy company, wolvol, blames its manufacturer, saying the manufacturer must have mistakenly shipped them a bad batch",

It became their summer house where they would host parties with famous guests, such as norman lear and lauren bacall.

The issue is that the pigs didn't have access to the outdoors or to barns with bedding that the company considers adequate. It's not clear how long the shortage will last. Observes bloomberg: \" chipotle is protecting its image as a socially responsible company, part of its appeal to younger customers who also seek healthier options and higher-quality ingredients. \" this is a first for chipotle, and roberto a. Ferdman at the washington post writes that it highlights a problem with the chain's grand plans to be an even bigger player in the fast-food industry. Its emphasis on sustainability is admirable, but it might not be practical if chipotle wants to keep expanding. Its success has been \" a lesson in how hard it is to scale the entirety of a business like chipotle, with its promise to sell ' food with integrity, ' \" writes ferdman.

On some occasions, those meetings produced hybrid offspring whose genetic signature lives on in polar bears today.the findings were made by analyzing the mitochondrial dna extracted from 242 bear lineages. Some of them were polar bears and some were brown bears. Some lived recently and others have been dead since the late pleistocene, which ended nearly 12,000 years ago.polar bears and brown bears are uniquely suited to their habitats. Polar bears have white coats to help them blend in and sneak up on prey, a carnivore's fearsome set of teeth, and they are superb swimmers. The smaller brown bear, which includes grizzly and kodiak bears, lives on land in warmer climes and eats plants and small animals.based on fossil evidence and genetic analysis, scientists had thought that polar bears ' closest relatives were the brown bears living on islands off the coast of alaska.although members of the two species can, and have, met and mated — as evidenced by",

            "All polar bears alive today are descended from a female brown bear that most likely hailed not from alaska, as widely presumed, but from ireland, scientists said.the discovery, reported online thursday in the journal current biology, suggests that polar bears and various species of brown bears probably encountered each other many times over the last 100,000 years or so as climate change forced them into each other's territory. On some occasions, those meetings produced hybrid offspring whose genetic signature lives on in polar bears today.the findings were made by analyzing the mitochondrial dna extracted from 242 bear lineages. Some of them were polar bears and some were brown bears. Some lived recently and others have been dead since the late pleistocene, which ended nearly 12,000 years ago.polar bears and brown bears are uniquely suited to their habitats. Polar bears have white coats to help them blend in and sneak up on prey, a carnivore's fearsome set of teeth, and they are superb swimmers. The smaller brown bear, which includes grizzly and kodiak bears, lives on land in warmer climes and eats plants and small animals.based on fossil evidence and genetic analysis, scientists had thought that polar bears ' closest relatives were the brown bears living on islands off the coast of alaska.although members of the two species can, and have, met and mated — as evidenced by",

        "summary": "Police have identified the man who this morning fatally shot two firefighters responding to the blaze he set in his own house as 62-year-old william h. Spengler jr., reports the rochester democrat and chronicle. Spengler was convicted of first-degree manslaughter in 1981 for beating his 92-year-old grandmother rose spengler to death with a hammer; he served 17 years in prison and had an \" uneventful \" parole that ended in 2006. Rose spengler was killed in the house next-door to the house where firefighters were responding today. Webster police chief gerald pickering said that because spengler was a convicted felon, he couldn't legally own guns; pickering said investigators found \" several different types of weapons, including a rifle used on first responders. \" he added that mental health issues were probably involved. After exchanging fire with officials, spengler was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound around 11am. He was reportedly living with his sister, who has not been found. Fire officials would not rule out that anyone had died in the blaze, which consumed seven homes. Two firefighters injured in the shooting are currently listed in guarded condition. A facebook page has been set up for the victims.",

At a friday night press conference in iowa, clinton told reporters that she wants the fbi to release the \" full and complete facts \" about its renewed probe, which centers on emails found on devices seized during the unrelated anthony weiner sexting investigation. Clinton — who was cleared by the fbi in july — told reporters that she is confident that whatever issue investigators found \" will not change the conclusion reached in july, \" making it \" imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay, \" cnn reports. A round-up of coverage: clinton campaign chairman john podesta used sterner words than clinton, saying fbi director james comey \" owes it to the american people \" to explain the move immediately, reports the washington post. \" it is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election, \" said podesta. He said that based on what little information the fbi has provided, it could be a mischaracterization even to say the investigation has been \" reopened. \" podesta suggested the move was politically motivated. \" in the months since, donald trump and his republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the fbi and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm hillary clinton's presidential campaign, \" he said.

Top republicans including paul ryan also welcomed the development, the new york times reports. \" hillary clinton has nobody but herself to blame, \" the house speaker said in a statement. \" she was entrusted with some of our nation's most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information. \" in a letter to fbi employees, comey explained his decision to break tradition and inform congress about a politically sensitive investigation so close to an election. \" i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed, \" comey said. \" i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record. \" politico reports",

Two months later, the 16-year-old was jogging with two black friends in salt lake city when they were gunned down by a white supremacist. \" after the shootings, i was like a ghost of a human being, \" mitchell, who became a key witness in the case, tells the guardian. But federal prosecutor richard roberts \" seemed like a superhero, \" she adds. \" i had thought he was going to be the person who made everything ok. \" instead, the 28-year-old called her to his office, drove her to his hotel when mitchell asked for a ride home, insisted she come into his room, locked the door, and raped her, a $ 25 million lawsuit alleges. He then continued to rape mitchell over the next few weeks as the trial progressed, telling her there would be a mistrial if anyone found out, per the suit. When roberts left utah after joseph paul franklin was convicted, mitchell says she was left battling depression, ptsd, anorexia, and night terrors. \" i was coping pretty well, considering, up until he came into my life, \" she says. \" then he derailed it. \" mitchell says she repressed all memories of the rapes until roberts — until recently the chief us district judge in washington, dc — sent her an email in 2013. He admitted to a sexual relationship in a phone call, which mitchell recorded and turned over to authorities. An attorney general's investigation found there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute roberts, who abruptly retired when the lawsuit was announced and says the sex occurred after the trial and was consensual. However, a chief deputy attorney says ethics violations mean \" something is going to happen [ to roberts ] and it is not going to be pleasant. \" mitchell hopes to see roberts impeached.

As national geographic explains, researchers discovered that recordings of tiger growls caused asian elephants to quickly retreat during night forages. This could be a big deal if it eventually helps keeps elephants away from crops and villages, because the confrontations that result are often deadly — an estimated 200 dead humans and 200 dead elephants per year. The researchers found that elephants had such a keen sense of hearing that they could distinguish the growls of different cats, the better to know when they were truly in danger. With tigers, they didn't mess around: they retreated quickly and silently, says the study in biology letters. With leopards, which pose less of a threat, the elephants made threatening noises and stomped around upon hearing the growls, although they still retreated eventually. The tricky part is making sure the elephants don't get so used to the growls that they start ignoring them. Another study will experiment with sounds from different places, to simulate a moving cat.

Hoping for some good press, the irs announced it would be sending capone's handgun to the mob museum in las vegas. And many newspapers ran with the story over the past few weeks, including the wall street journal — but there was just one problem: the capone handgun meant to showcase the irs'success was the wrong gun. It took an irs criminal agent and journal readers to notice, and museum visitors alerted the museum, the journal now reports. At first blush the guns look similar. The one that was meant to be on display is a smith &amp; wesson first confiscated in miami in 1928 when local police arrested capone. One of the arresting officers gave it to a tour bus operator, who gave it to a landlord in detroit, who gave it to a renter, who sold it to a gambler, who was the subject of a 2004 raid. The gun that had been sent to the museum is an iver johnson, and had been a gift to capone from his brother, who was in law enforcement, apparently to help heal the rift between them. Federal agents seized it from a bodyguard during the tax evasion trial in 1931. Now that their stories are \" matched up, \" as the museum's director of content puts it, both guns will be on display.

All airbnb users must sign off on this agreement; rally attendees would be violating the part noting they must \" accept people regardless of their race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age. \" the service adds it's able to determine who's in violation of the commitment via \" our background check processes or from input of our community. \" per buzzfeed, people started catching on over the weekend that those deemed by airbnb to be \" antithetical \" to its philosophy were seeing their accounts deactivated. Jason kessler, one of the so-called organizers of the rally, posted an eight-minute video on twitter monday railing against airbnb's actions, which he says was based on \" political ideology, \" along with the tweet: \" free speech and civil rights under attack by #charlottesville government &amp; airbnb. \" charlottesville officials have been trying to get kessler and his group to move the rally elsewhere, for \" safety and logistical reasons, \" per wvir, but kessler says they're staying put in emancipation park because that's where the statue of gen. Robert e. Lee is. The washington post notes the park has long been mired in controversy due to its confederate iconography.",

        "summary": "Without the lowly dung beetle, we'd be in deep doodoo, somewhat literally. As mother jones explains, 100 billion tons of dung are excreted by the planet's animals daily. Dung beetles eat dung ( and use it to \" woo girlfriends, \" among other things, as a zoologist explains at the conversation ), and the effect is profound. Dung beetles \" can potentially do in 48 hours what would take a couple years \" for nature to accomplish without them, mother jones quotes a missouri livestock researcher as saying. And that's what makes a \" little-noticed \" 2015 study in scientific reports extra troubling, the magazine reports. The spanish researchers looked at ivermectin, a human and veterinary drug that, on its face, does nothing but good: it effectively treats an infection that causes elephantiasis, prevents river blindness, and controls mites, roundworms, heartworms, and head lice. But previous research has found 62 % to 98 % of the doses given to mammals end up in their dung. The researchers set out to determine \" the direct effects of ivermectin on dung beetle physiology and behavior \" and found beetles who ingested it saw their ability to use their antennae to detect food and \" sexual or aggregation signals \" compromised; they also found ivermectin can remain active in animal dung for at least a month. The implications could be serious: the study found \" rates of decomposition of dung were... 30 % lower in the sites where ivermectin was used, \" per a press release. Countermeasures have been suggested — among them, injecting the drug and using it in cool months where the beetles aren't active — but they have limitations.

The heartwarming scene has already racked up more than 6 million views on youtube, and the churmans were on today; watch both videos in the gallery. \" i nearly didn't videotape it, if it wasn't for my mother saying, ' you're going to video this, we need to see this, ' \" husband sloan told today. \" i wouldn't have done it, because this was intimate for us; this was like getting married or having a child. \" churman, 29, says it has been \" pretty amazing \" to hear her two young daughters ' voices, and that it was surprising to learn she has a texas accent — but there is one sound she doesn't particularly like: her husband's snoring. \" yeah, that i didn't listen to very long! \" she says.",

The pocket-sized gadgets determine which stores shoppers are walking into, allowing electronic signs to offer targeted ads, mashable reports. Why would a customer agree to carry one around while shopping? because those targeted ads offer them shopping deals. The devices are the product of a collaboration between a realty investor and an advertising agency, and according to the makers, they're effective. The property investor, sponda, says that in a trial involving 14,000 people, those carrying physical cookies stayed in stores 21.7 % longer than those without them. Sponda also says its messages sent 14.5 % of customers from a mall's ground floor to its less-busy second floor. The goal, according to a promotional video, is to prevent the much-heralded death of brick-and-mortar stores. \" if e-stores are winning because of their efficient use of data, why not take their best practices and use them in the real world? \" the video asks. Sponda says that no personal information is needed to use physical cookies, and though the technology is currently in keychain form, it can be installed anywhere. Nor does it involve the \" spam \" the makers say similar technology like apple's ibeacon pushes on customers.

Publicist gwendolyn quinn tells the ap that franklin died thursday at 9: 50am at her home in detroit. Franklin, who'd battled undisclosed health issues in recent years, had in 2017 announced her retirement from touring. A professional singer and accomplished pianist by her late teens, and a superstar by her mid-20s, franklin had long ago settled any arguments over who was the greatest popular vocalist of her time. Her gifts were a multi-octave mezzo-soprano, gospel passion, and training worthy of a preacher's daughter. She recorded hundreds of tracks and had dozens of hits over the span of a half-century, including 20 that reached no. 1 on the r&b charts. But her reputation was defined by an extraordinary run of top 10 smashes in the late 1960s, from the morning-after bliss of \" ( you make me feel like ) a natural woman, \" to the wised-up \" chain of fools, \" to her unstoppable call for \" respect. \" her records sold millions of copies and the music industry couldn't honor her enough. Franklin won 18 grammy awards. In 1987, she became the first woman inducted into the rock &amp; roll hall of fame. In a 2004 interview, franklin was asked whether she sensed in the ' 60s that she was helping change popular music. \" somewhat, certainly with'respect,'that was a battle cry for freedom and many people of many ethnicities took pride in that word, \" she answered. \" it was meaningful to all of us. \"",

First off, it wasn't david wahlberg who issued that ruling; it was probate judge guy herman, writes bud kennedy in the fort worth star-telegram. On facebook, tinderholt continues, \" this judge deliberately violated statutory law that requires judges to notify the office of attorney general before ruling on constitutionality. \" and, in the complaint itself, tinderholt notes that \" constitutional challenge by a judge requires notice ( to the texas attorney general ) and must wait until 45 days after to enter final judgement. \" well, the judge he appears to have been referring to, guy herman, did in fact notify the attorney general, the houston chronicle reports. The ag's office decided to stay out of the matter. Tinderholt has said his concern was about activist judges and not gay marriage itself, kennedy writes.

Federal officials say there will now be a \" special enrollment \" period ending sunday for people who couldn't register because of technical problems or long wait times at call centers, reports politico, which notes that most state exchanges have also extended enrollment periods — for two months in the case of washington. Officials say the \" vast majority of consumers \" picked a plan without problem, and though they expect people to be truthful, they admit it will be hard to verify whether somebody really had a call center problem, usa today reports. With higher penalties this year and next year for uninsured people above the poverty line, three senior democrats in the house are seeking a longer extension period for the estimated 4 million people who will face penalties, the ap reports. The lawmakers — who helped steer obamacare through congress — say they worry that since the enrollment period ended before tax returns were filed, many people will only find out about the penalties for both 2014 and 2015 when it's too late. \" for the many families who may now be about to pay a penalty, there should be an opportunity to avoid both further penalties and to obtain affordable health insurance, \" says rep.

Not that you'd notice: the new research in the proceedings of the royal society a shows that it takes the earth a tiny bit longer these days to complete a single rotation than it did eons ago. It's the kind of stuff that's measured in milliseconds per century, but those milliseconds add up. Over the last 2,500 years or so, they'd total seven hours, which the los angeles times puts this way: \" if humanity had been measuring time with an atomic clock that started running back in 700 bc, today that clock would read 7 p.m. When the sun is directly overhead rather than noon. \" maybe more remarkable is that the work is the result of a tireless 40-year investigation into ancient timekeeping records dating back 2,700 years. Scientists led by richard stephenson of the uk's durham university have been poring over babylonian clay tablets, chinese observations made through the use of water clocks, and arab astronomical records ( \" superb \" ) that tracked solar and lunar eclipses. \" the most astounding thing about this paper is the fact that we have this information at all, \" a geophysicist not involved in the study tells the times. Researchers are still hoping to find observations from the incas and the maya, and to fill in their largest hole between 200 and 600 ad, but they've measured the earth's deceleration at 1.8 milliseconds per day per century. Given the moon's gravitational effect on our oceans, the revelation that earth is decelerating isn't a surprise, notes the christian science monitor, though astronomers had previously estimated a higher rate.

        "summary": "Police forces across america have become \" dangerously militarized \" and are using equipment and tactics taken straight from the army to do things like serve search warrants and search homes for drugs, a new american civil liberties union report finds. Among the findings of the report on police militarization, as per npr, the guardian, and the washington post: swat teams were designed for hostage situations, but almost 80 % of the raids studied were to serve a search warrant. Some 62 % of the total were for drug searches — and just 7 % were for \" hostage, barricade, or active shooter scenarios. \" almost two-thirds of swat raids resulted in forced entry into a private home, whether by battering ram, boot, or explosive device. No contraband at all was found in at least 36 % of raids, and the aclu says this figure could be as high as 65 %. In raids where the stated purpose of using a swat team was the possibility of a weapon being present, a weapon was found just 35 % of the time. Black people and other minorities were disproportionately targeted by the swat raids. With the help of federal funds, \" state and local law enforcement agencies have amassed military arsenals purportedly to wage the failed war on drugs, the battlegrounds of which have disproportionately been in communities of color, \" an aclu spokeswoman says. \" but these arsenals are by no means free of cost for communities. \" the pentagon has channeled huge amounts of equipment used in iraq and afghanistan to local police forces, including hundreds of armored personnel carriers. \" if the federal government gives the police a huge cache of military-style weaponry, they are highly likely to use it, even if they do not really need to, \" the aclu says. The report cited numerous incidents where the use of a swat team appears to have caused unnecessary injuries, including a 2010 case in detroit where a 7-year-old girl was shot dead after police threw a flash grenade into her home, burning her. More recently, a 19-month-old boy in georgia is still fighting for his life after police threw a flash grenade into his playpen during a drug raid last month.

Police sources tell nbc news that the iconic studio city home used for the sitcom's exterior shots was burglarized wednesday night — and that the elderly woman who currently lives there apparently scared the prowlers off. The suspects first tried to gain entrance to the home through the windows before shattering a sliding glass door. Once inside, the prowlers tore apart the den ( we can just pretend mike brady used to work at his drafting table there ) before moving upstairs, where they were frightened off when the resident septuagenarian heard the commotion and turned the lights on. Police tell people they responded to a call from the homeowner, who wasn't hurt, around 10: 30pm; they're not yet sure what, if anything, was taken.

Authorities say 21 st. Paul officers and six state troopers were hurt during the fracas late saturday and early sunday. St. Paul mayor chris coleman and police chief todd axtell are condemning the violence. Axtell calls the pelting of officers with rocks, bottles and other objects \" a disgrace. \" the star tribune reports about half the arrests came during a blockade of interstate 94 in st. Paul. About 50 arrests were made early sunday in another part of st. Paul. The interstate reopened early sunday. The protest was among several demonstrations nationwide following the deaths of 32-year-old philando castile in suburban st. Paul and 37-year-old alton sterling in baton rouge, la. Other news from overnight, via the ap: authorities in baton rouge say more than 100 people were jailed in connection with the black lives matter protests held in the louisiana city over the weekend. Among those arrested was deray mckesson, who rose to prominence with the black lives matter movement after the 2014 shooting death of michael brown in ferguson. San antonio police say shots fired overnight near the department headquarters hit the building, but nobody was hurt. Chief william mcmanus says investigators are trying to determine whether the building was targeted saturday night or if someone was randomly firing. Police detained one person for questioning after the man was seen running from the area. Mcmanus says several shell casings were found in a nearby alley. President obama says protesters who attack police officers are doing a disservice to their cause. Obama also cautions that if protesters paint police with a broad brush, they could lose allies for their cause. At the same time, he says that when police organizations acknowledge there is a problem stemming from bias, it will contribute to solutions. Obama is cutting his first visit to spain a day short.",

Georgia sisters jodie, sarah, and kaylee swales were already engaged, fox atlanta reported earlier this month, and when they found out their mother — who'd been fighting breast cancer for four years — had just months to live, they decided on a triple wedding. They picked oct. 26 as the date, giving them less than a month to plan. But, fox atlanta reports, they found out last week swales'time was running even shorter, so they pushed up the ceremony to sunday. Their mom watched from the front row, and then passed away early yesterday. Dad otis swales walked all three of his daughters down the aisle, and jodie called their wedding day \" bittersweet \" before the ceremony. \" we are happy that she's here, but this will probably be the last big thing that we do with her, \" she said. She posted this afterward on facebook: \" she was the most beautiful person i knew, and i bet she is the most beautiful angel. \" when the family's story first made headlines, donations poured in to help give the sisters a dream wedding. The reception they planned, at a donated venue, will still be held oct. 26. ( in ohio this weekend, a team of volunteer medical professionals helped a dying dad walk his daughter down the aisle. )",

The big day comes, the young fish are released, and they're... Immediately eaten by a hungry whale that's been waiting for this exact moment. A study published tuesday in royal society open science found humpback whales have learned they can gorge on waves of salmon if they hang out around hatcheries during the times fish are released. The study started after a humpback whale was caught on video feeding near a hatchery in 2008. \" this is a new source of prey, as far as we can tell, \" study author ellen chenoweth tells the new york times. New scientist reports alaskan hatcheries are acting like fast-food restaurants for the whales, who impressively navigate shallow water, the shore, docks, and holding pens to feed on the newly released salmon. So far the behavior doesn't seem to have spread to the humpback population at large but rather belongs to a handful of whales that have made it a key part of their annual feeding schedule. \" in some cases, they return year after year, \" chenoweth says. While humpback whales gobbling hatchery salmon isn't great for the economy of southeast alaska, it could be a sign the whales — which once bordered on extinction — can innovate to survive climate change. \" they will develop new tactics and do stuff you've never seen before, \" chenoweth tells the times.",

While making a good meal for the whales, the habit may prove harmful to the local fishing industry. Hatcheries aren't fish farms, but salmon nurseries. The idea is that the juvenile fish released into the ocean from the hatcheries increase the number of salmon available to catch without leading to overfishing of the wild stocks. Wild salmon spend the first part of their lives in streams where competition is fierce and many don't make it. Hatcheries make sure enough salmon survive this crucial life stage, breeding them in captivity for six to 18 months before releasing them into the wild.
