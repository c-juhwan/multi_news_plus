The head of the nypd's labor union wasn't impressed and responded by asking locals to boycott the director's films, including the upcoming hateful eight. \" it's no surprise that someone who makes a living glorifying crime and violence is a cop-hater, too, \" patrick lynch, president of the patrolmen's benevolent association, said in a statement, via the post. \" new yorkers need to send a message to this purveyor of degeneracy that he has no business coming to our city to peddle his slanderous ' cop fiction. ' \" about 300 people gathered for the rally, chanting and holding up signs that said things like \" rise up! stop police terror! \" and \" murder with a badge is still murder. \" tarantino concedes that the timing so soon after holder's killing was \" unfortunate, \" but he also says people had already traveled to attend, the post notes. \" i ' m a human being with a conscience, \" tarantino says, per the ap. \" and if you believe there's murder going on, then you need to rise up and stand up against it. … i ' m on the side of the murdered. \" not everyone sees it that way. \" the police officers that quentin tarantino calls ' murderers ' aren't living in one of his depraved big-screen fantasies — they're risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect communities from real crime, \" lynch continues in his statement. One of holder's cousins tells the post that the rally was \" very disrespectful. \" \" everyone forgets that behind the uniform is a person, \" she says.",

He has already been ticketed, and people have ripped down his flag at least five times. \" i have a warehouse on alert, and i ' ll put up a flag every time they tear one down, \" hornick says. Hornick — who says that if trump loses, he ' ll rip up his registration card and never vote again — could get 90 days ' jail time or a $ 2,000 fine if he doesn't take down the flag. Hornick says that he has a constitutional right to fly the flag, and the american civil liberties union is supporting him, reports ny 101.5. According to eugene volokh at the washington post, hornick is right: banning political signs or placing similar restrictions on the content of signs violates the first amendment, volokh writes, though the city would be within its rights to apply content-neutral restrictions that applied to all signs.

One of the girls knocked away a shotgun pointed at her throat and another seized the bat and hit the younger harrison with it, say police. The victims fled, as did the harrisons, but both suspects eventually surrendered separately in wyoming and now face charges of aggravated kidnapping and possession of a controlled substance. While dereck harrison was still on the loose, his mother, maryann dalrymple harrison, went to police in wyoming to obtain information about her son, but she, too, ended up under arrest.

Athena williams tells people and fox 17 that the michigan man she met at a party in middle school was vacationing on the island of eleuthera with her and her family when, on march 4, he secretly asked her family if he could marry her. Early the next day, brussow and williams ' brother went for a hike, and as they were resting on a cliff, a wave came out of nowhere and swept the two men into the water below. Williams ' brother was badly hurt but managed to get to shore, where he ran for help. Brussow, however, was nowhere to be found, and his family flew out from the us to help williams, her family, and the locals search for him. On march 9, an 8-foot-deep depression filled with water near where the men were swept away dried up, and brussow's body was found, mlive.com reports. The $ 21,000 raised on gofundme to help in the search for brussow — described as the \" most beloved kid \" on his high school swim team before he graduated in 2016, per wzzm — will now be put toward bringing his body home, offering funds to those who helped look for him, and putting warning signs and safety gear near where the wave took his life. In a statement, his family notes how brussow had been born in a wild storm on may 31, 1998, and that \" those that knew him well knew he lived his life with a storm of passion. \" as for williams, she tells people: \" i would give anything to be able to have him here and be able to marry him and spend the rest of my life with him. … i wish we had more time. \" ( a rogue wave killed twin sisters in cabo. )",

It's unclear what led nojay to kill himself, but the lawmaker had recently become embroiled in a number of controversies. According to the new york times, he was accused of embezzling $ 1.8 million from a legal client and was supposed to be in court on those charges friday. And federal investigators are looking into an agricultural business nojay started in cambodia after he allegedly took a $ 1 million donation from a cambodian dentist and had nothing to show for it. He was also being investigated for his role in a $ 1.3 billion deal to modernize schools, the albany times union reports. The 59-year-old father of three was first elected to the state assembly in 2012. Nojay was known for going against democrats and republicans alike and for his anti-gun control work. He hosted a local radio show and had been championing donald trump for president since 2013. He also worked on elections in afghanistan and ukraine. Nojay will remain on the primary ballot. If he ends up winning tuesday, party leaders will have to nominate a replacement for the general election. Nojay's republican challenger, richard milne, says he's \" devastated \" by the news and is \" suspending all political activity until further notice. \"",

U.s.

In an interview with munchies earlier this year, the chef said he would be \" hard-pressed to say no \" if a victorious hillary clinton asked him to return to the white house kitchen in 2016. \" if she wants me, she knows my phone number and i ' ll be of service. I don't care if it was a republican or democrat, if i knew them or didn't know them — if the president asked me to serve, i would do it. \"",

The supreme court decision that led to the creation of super pacs funded by unlimited donations is getting its first real-world test, and the results are hard to miss. Most notably: the super pac known as restore our future decimated newt gingrich with negative ads on behalf of mitt romney. As politico notes, gingrich called the decision at the time a \" great victory for free speech, \" and while he still supports it, he is also complaining about being \" romney-boated \" by his rival's \" millionaire friends. \" also: restrictions needed? the huffington post gives banner treatment ( \" we've created a monster \" ) to the issue, with sam stein writing that some prominent republicans think that restrictions on super pacs are in order. Among others, it quotes tom ridge, who thinks that donations to the groups should be disclosed almost immediately online. \" transparency now, it is the best antiseptic, \" says the jon huntsman ally. Full story here. Montana decision: at slate, dahlia lithwick gives a figurative high-five to the montana supreme court, which last week issued a \" stunning \" decision that the state could essentially ignore citizens united and continue to restrict corporate election spending. The court \" knows exactly what justice kennedy seems to have missed: that corruption is corruption regardless of its packaging, and that it rarely comes with a detailed disclosure label. \" full piece here. Overblown issue? the national journal rounds up conservative opinion and finds little \" buyer's remorse \" about the ruling. It quotes a gop consultant who thinks the issue is being exaggerated: \"every cycle there is a new vehicle as the law changed. Campaigns have always run negative ads. The vehicle may be different, but the ads certainly weren't. \" full story here.",

            "On wednesday night, actress jane fonda was asked about her controversial activism during the vietnam war. In opposition to the vietnam war, fonda visited the capital of hanoi and during her 1972 visit, she was photographed standing on top of an anti-aircraft gun used to kill american soldiers, causing decades of outrage from her critics, nicknaming the actress \"hanoi jane. \" during her appearance on the late show, stephen colbert took a moment to address that moment in her life. \"have what we've learned about that war in the decades since changed your attitude toward that war or changed your attitude about what you did at the time? \" colbert asked. \"no, i have- from the moment that i did the bad thing i did, which was i sat on an",

Almost 45 years after she climbed into the seat of a north vietnamese anti-aircraft gun vehicle and smiled for photographers, jane fonda, now 79, still finds herself targeted by u.s. Military veterans. The actress and activist, who took to the l.a.

        "summary": "A 2-year-old girl was recently given a 50/50 chance of surviving stage 4 neuroblastoma cancer, and dad adam koessler wants to do everything in his power to boost those chances. The australian man started putting cannabis oil in rumer's food and noticed \" extremely beneficial \" and even \" miraculous \" results, he says — but on jan. 2, he was arrested and charged with supplying dangerous drugs to a person under 16. While on the cannabis oil ( which does not contain the compound that gets marijuana users high ), rumer was in less pain, had more energy, and was able to eat, gain weight, and even go outside. \" her skin color came back, her eyes were sparkling again, \" her father says. \" her cancer-ridden little body was alive again. \" without the cannabis oil, her condition has declined and she's in intensive care on morphine, the newcastle herald reports. Medical marijuana advocates are standing behind koessler, who — as part of his bail conditions — is not allowed any contact with rumer. The nsw hemp party spokesman points out the fact that rumer was put on opiate painkillers after being forced off cannabis oil and says, \" the current legal position regarding the enforced medical treatment of an innocent child is unconscionable. \" the cairns community is also rallying behind rumer and her family, donating money toward rumer's treatment, the cairns post reported last month, shortly after rumer was diagnosed on christmas day. Two crowdfunding campaigns have raised more than $ 30,000, and a change.org petition for koessler to see his parental rights reinstated and medicinal cannabis oil to be decriminalized has more than 157,000 supporters. A facebook page apparently run by rumer's mother ( her parents are not together, according to her dad's gofundme page ) says her cancer was recently downgraded to stage 3. ( this dad credits his son's recovery from cancer to cannabis oil. )",

The large vans, which were transporting jewels for a planned sale in the eastern city of besançon, were found burnt and abandoned not far from the toll station. One of them was completely ripped apart. The jewels remain missing. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to be publicly named.

But butler high school in matthews, nc, also is drawing attention for its decision to resume classes less than two hours after the altercation. Police say two male students fought in a crowded hallway as students were arriving for the day, reports the ap. One student shot the other, who died at the hospital, and the alleged shooter is in custody, reports wral. A junior at the school tells the charlotte observer that students were ordered into the nearest classroom for about 90 minutes, then allowed to proceed to their scheduled class once the lockdown was lifted. \"they're changing classes during an active crime scene, \" says one parent critical of the decision to resume a normal school day. It appears to have been optional, however. After police gave the all-clear, the school district informed parents they could pick up their children at the high school, adding that \" classes will proceed on campus today for students remaining on campus. \" police are still investigating how the shooter was able to bring the gun into the school itself.

        "summary": "The house and senate's failure to reach a deal to resolve the budget brouhaha has left the us without a functioning federal government for the first time in 17 years — and the two sides seem so averse to compromise that it's anyone's guess when the shutdown will end. Federal agencies have been ordered to \" execute plans for an orderly shutdown, \" meaning around 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed immediately and another million or so, including border patrol agents and air traffic controllers, will be asked to work without pay, the new york times reports. In the past, federal workers — though not contractors — have been reimbursed for time missed, but it's unclear whether congress will approve a similar measure this time around, the washington post finds in its guide to the shutdown's impact on federal workers. Politico explains the process for furloughing workers: federal employees do have to go to work today; once there, they ' ll be handed an official notice outlining who is essential. Those who aren't will have until mid-day to wrap things up and set up those out-of-office auto-replies. Social security and medicare benefits, veterans'services, and the us postal service will not be affected, but national parks, monuments, and other government offices are closed, and transportation safety inspectors nationwide have been furloughed, the ap finds. The post reports that all but 549 of nasa's 18,250 employees will be furloughed... In a slightly cruel twist, on the agency's 55th birthday. Last-minute legislation ensures that members of the military will keep receiving their paychecks. Members of congress will also keep getting paid, but their employees will have to either work without pay or be furloughed, the federal times reports. Mother jones looks at some of the more quirky casualties: the national zoo's panda-cam, winery permits, national park service golf courses, bureau of land management's wild horse and burro adoption programs, and 45 fountains. John boehner has called for a special house-senate committee to resolve the two parties'differences, but some senior republicans believe the shutdown could last at least a week, the washington post reports. Democrats, meanwhile, believe that the funding battle could overlap with debt-limit talks that need to be resolved before october 17.",

Google vice president vint cerf expressed his concern last week at a conference of scientists in california: \" if we're thinking 1,000 years, 3,000 years ahead in the future, we have to ask ourselves, how do we preserve all the bits that we need in order to correctly interpret the digital objects we create? \" he says. \" we are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realizing it. \" cerf's worry is that future \" modern computers \" will have no way of reading content from today's software. Comparing future historians to doris kearns goodwin — who relied quite a bit on letters of the period when writing team of rivals about abraham lincoln's cabinet — cerf warns that today's email stash could vanish \" because nobody saved it \" or because it can't be read since it was created on century-old software, per the independent. And he discards the notion that \" important \" stuff will be stored, saying that \" sometimes documents and transactions images and so on may turn out to have an importance which is not understood for hundreds of years. \" his advice for us: print those photos. For big data savers: embrace the idea of \" digital vellum, \" which involves snapping a pic of every way a file can be opened, and storing it with the original file, reports engineering and technology magazine. \" we're going to have to build into our thinking the concept of preservation writ large, \" says cerf.

After referring to trump as \" a voice for unity and calm, \" it called on leaders and the media to \" join the president in trying to unite and heal our country rather than incite more division. \" censure followed, however, from almost all sides. From republicans, it was \" swifter and more widespread than perhaps at any point in his presidency, \" reports politico. A standout tweet from rubio: \" mr.

        "summary": "Isis has beheaded another hostage, but while the outcome is grimly familiar, analysts say the video revealing the death of peter kassig has differences that hint at serious problems for the militant group. Unlike four earlier videos showing the execution of western hostages, the quality is poor, kassig is not seen reading a statement, and no other hostage is displayed. Instead, only the american's severed head is shown. Analysts suspect that the threat of airstrikes stopped the militants from being able to film outside for long. \" the likeliest possibility is that something went wrong when they were beheading him, \" an expert at the foundation for defense of democracies tells the new york times. Another possibility, he says, is that kassig resisted and the \" media-savvy \" militants were unable to get the video they wanted. Other analysts speculate that the hostage — who converted to islam while in captivity — may have chosen to recite quotes from the koran instead of his captors'script. More: kassig, a former us army ranger, founded an organization to aid refugees from the syrian civil war. His parents say they are heartbroken by the killing but incredibly proud of his work, the ap reports. He \" lost his life as a result of his love for the syrian people and his desire to ease their suffering, \" his parents, who live in indianapolis, said in a statement. The latest isis video, which also shows the execution of 18 syrian captives in \" revolting, lingering detail, \" is also different because it shows the faces of many militants and gives a specific location in syria, notes bbc security correspondent frank gardner. He calls kassig's execution an \" act of desperation \" carried out by the group because it is unable to fight back against coalition airstrikes. With kassig dead, isis ' only remaining american hostage is a 26-year-old woman, security officials tell the daily beast. Like kassig, she was kidnapped while carrying out aid work. Her name has not been made public and officials say it is significant that she doesn't appear in the group's latest video — and while it's not clear what the militants have planned for her, even isis is likely to carefully consider the public reaction to killing a female western captive on camera.",

Some 28 other states have expanded medicaid under the law, but just kentucky, west virginia, and ohio did so without legislative consent. Walker, who calls the move a \" common-sense decision, \" says his bills seeking expansion approval were all blocked by republicans worried about the tab alaska would have to pick up in the future. \" regardless of federal funding, we cannot afford the medicaid system we have now, \" says republican state sen. Pete kelly. \" our current system is broken. \" walker hopes to begin enrollment in september and have 20,000 signed up within one year. The wall street journal observes that the move will \" bring the number of states opting into the law's expansion close to 30 and make it more likely other states would follow. \"",

            "Juneau, alaska alaska's governor said on thursday he would use his executive powers to expand the state's medicaid health program for the poor, in a bid to sidestep political opponents and bring coverage to more than 20,000 uninsured residents the first year. Governor bill walker said alaska would accept $ 146 million in federal funds made available under president barack obama's signature healthcare reform law, citing nearly 30 other states that have expanded medicaid coverage. \" ( they ) have already made the commonsense decision to accept medicaid expansion. Why? because it helps their residents, their economies and their budgets, \" walker told reporters in anchorage. Walker, an independent, has already had several expansion efforts blocked by the republican-led state legislature since he took office after winning the november 2014 election. On thursday, he said bypassing the legislature and accepting the funds was a final option. Obamacare envisions major expansions to the medicaid program, though about 20 u.s. States, many republican-controlled, have rejected that part of the law, according to kaiser family foundation figures. Political divides have stalled the expansion of medicaid coverage in states concentrated in the south and central west. In alaska, the legislative budget and audit committee has the authority to review requests for federal funds when the legislature is not in session. The committee has until sept. 1 to vote whether or not to support the state's request for money, or to recommend a special session of the legislature to review expansion options. After walker's announcement, the committee's chairman, representative mike hawker, said the panel's role is a formality and simply influences how quickly the money is made available.

The report from the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction, a us government watchdog agency, uncovered numerous examples of poor construction work: one base has no water supply, a second is experiencing sewage overflow, some are missing drainpipes, others have leaking fuel lines or broken doors. One even includes a well house being used as … a chicken coop. The us army corps of engineers says it is working on fixing the issues. The report also finds that the us plan to fund hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects in the country is extremely behind schedule — and that some of the ambitious plans may actually hurt the country, the washington post adds. The report raises concerns about the 2014 withdrawal of us troops from afghanistan and questions whether local forces are prepared to take over security duties — and whether this new infrastructure can be successfully maintained by a country with limited resources.

Yoshiki fujimoto spent his birthday lost on a japanese mountain, the subject of a frantic three-day search after he disappeared while with his grandfather. The south china morning post reports on the \" miracle \" of a volunteer finding yoshiki wednesday, perched with no shoes on a rock in the middle of a stream on yashiro island, almost 72 hours after he was reported missing. The asahi shimbun notes the boy had been headed to the beach on aug. 12 with his grandfather and 3-year-old brother when yoshiki decided he wanted to turn around and return to his great-grandfather's home about 300 feet away, which his grandfather didn't stop him from doing. Shortly afterward, it was discovered he never made it back. Nearly 400 cops and other rescuers — as well as drones and search dogs, per channel newsasia — were deployed to find yoshiki, who doctors feared would succumb to dehydration and japan's summer heat. Being credited with yoshiki's discovery: 78-year-old volunteer haruo obata, who correctly guessed the boy was more likely to have climbed up the mountain rather than down it. Obata tells the shimbun that as he called the boy's name around 6: 30am wednesday, he heard an \" i ' m here \" and found the child, who \" snatched a bag of candy \" from obata's hands as he held it out to him. Yoshiki was found to be dehydrated, with tick bites and scratches, but otherwise fine. \" i ' m so grateful my son returned safely, \" yoshiki's mother told local tv. The boy's grandfather tells the morning post, \" i apologize, as it was i who took my eyes off him. \"",

        "summary": "As thousands of people deal with treacherous flooding in southern louisiana, a new danger may enter into the mix: increased risk of a mosquito surge over the next few weeks, and with them, the potential spread of the zika virus, a tropical medicine expert tells usa today. Peter hotez of the baylor college of medicine says that mosquito eggs lying around in vessels such as tires and buckets may start hatching en masse once the floodwaters pull back, and if enough of those eggs come from zika-carrying aedes aegypti insects, it's going to be \" crunch time. \" hotez also warns the risk could similarly rise for other diseases linked to mosquitoes, including west nile. Louisiana so far hasn't had a documented case of zika contracted locally, though there have been around two dozen cases of travel-related zika reported there, per the shreveport times. But another expert isn't so sure about the zika risk. Ben beard, who helps run the cdc's zika outbreak initiative, concurs there may soon be a proliferation of the blood-hungry mosquitoes in louisiana due to the massive flooding, but not necessarily of the zika-carrying kind, as that variety is tinier and therefore more likely to be swept away with the floodwaters. Meanwhile, zika is already affecting the bayou state in another way: per kens, blood donors are desperately being sought there because locals who've recently traveled to zika-affected regions can't give blood for about a month after they've come back from their trip, a logistical issue that, along with other factors, has caused a blood shortage in the state.

            "Since film magnate harvey weinstein was accused of sexual harassment and assault in october, scores of women have come forward as part of the #metoo movement to say that they, too, have been victims of sexual misconduct. As more and more people come forward with allegations against powerful people and some of those powerful people lose their jobs, some have called the moment in history a tipping point; others have called it a reckoning. And while many are being taken to task for their alleged misconduct and there is potential for a cultural shift in the way we view sexual harassment and assault, this isn't the first time women have publicly spoken out against alleged harassers. In 1991, law professor anita hill sat before the senate judiciary committee, led by senator joe biden, and detailed the alleged harassment she experienced from her boss, clarence thomas, who was just about to be confirmed as a supreme court justice. Throughout hill's testimony, she weathered attacks on her character and her trustworthiness from those on the senate panel, and many have blamed biden for allowing those attacks and failing to do more. Nearly three decades after her testimony, and after thomas was seated on the court, biden wants anita hill to know that he's sorry.

The center lovell inn and restaurant, with spectacular views of the white mountains, was awarded june 6 to a us virgin islands couple who ran a caribbean-style restaurant on st. John.

Was illegally deceptive and violated consumer-rights regulations, intentionally coercing thousands of people to enter a contest that they never had an actual chance of winning, \" said kelley prass collins, who founded the group. \"in short, janice sage was advertising a contest for 'dreamers ' who would never have the chance to own an inn and restaurant, and then handed the prize to just such a business owner. \" neither sage nor the adamses could be reached for comment monday. Maine state police said their investigation is narrowly tailored to determine whether the contest violated state law on games of skill. Under the law, which is an older statute primarily written to cover carnival games, operators of such games are prohibited from partially or completely controlling the outcome. Entrants into the center lovell inn contest had been told the winner would be chosen by an independent, local panel of judges. \"we have received some complaints, so we are being responsive to that and are"

            "A paraplegic marine sent to a new planet, armed with a virtual body, to ingratiate himself with locals in order to gain their trust and subsequently destroy them? sounds like the plot of a bad sci-film film. But as it turns out, it's the plot of a highly entertaining sci-fi film – that being, of course, avatar, one of the most anticipated films of recent years. We know a lot about avatar – that it's james cameron first in fifteen years, that it's the first to use 3d in this way. But strip the hype aside and what anyone wants to know is – is it any good",
            "It has been one of the most hyped movies of the decade: the return of james cameron with a $ 230m-plus 3d inter-species action movie that will, some observers say, decide the future of the industry. Avatar production year: 2009 country: usa cert ( uk ): 12a runtime: 161 mins directors: james cameron cast: cch pounder, giovanni ribisi, michelle rodriguez, sam worthington, sigourney weaver, stephen lang, zoe saldana more on this film today it arrived with 20th century fox choosing london to launch avatar, cameron's sole movie in 12 years – the last being titanic. Cameron said he was just relieved the movie was finally",
            "London --- just left the ' world premiere ' of \" avatar, \" and while the standing ovation the film received at its conclusion is probably just the requisite politeness; i can report that this is another rare example where the quality of the movie does indeed exceed the hype and \" avatar \" will most certainly be among the 10 ' best picture ' nominees for the oscars; and james cameron will also be a best director nominee. I think it is also possible that actress zoe saldana, who has the most challenging of roles in the film, may rack up an additional acting nomination as well. The movie may owe more than a few plot points",
            "The last time james cameron directed a movie he broke all box office records. Now — 12 years after titanic — he has sunk £ 300million into avatar to produce the most dazzling film of the decade. See a trailer for the epic film, below...

Thus far, china has cited \" firm opposition \" to a test conducted \" heedless of widespread international opposition, \" the ap reports. According to south korea, seismic activity suggests the explosion measured some 6 to 7 kilotons — more than previous tests but less than the 20 kilotons detonated in hiroshima. Seismic tests by several countries suggested the test, which the north called \" safe and perfect, \" occurred near the location of its predecessors; the us geological survey says it was just a kilometer underground. Over at the washington post, the crack staff has found the exact test site — on google maps, just off \" nuclear test rd. \"",

Today's drop against the dollar was the second biggest since 1994, exceeded only by yesterday's, and the rapid fall has led some to believe that the country is trying to boost exports and create jobs at the expense of rivals like south korea, reuters notes. It's not clear how long the drop will continue: china has described the devaluation as a \" one-off, \" and the new york times notes that with $ 3.5 trillion in foreign currency reserves, china certainly has the ability to prevent any unwanted falls in the yuan. A change in the tightly controlled exchange-rate mechanism means the yuan could continue to drop 2 % a day, the ap reports. The imf has welcomed the move as a way to give market forces more control of a currency that china wants to play a bigger role globally, but us lawmakers are skeptical. \" for years, china has rigged the rules and played games with its currency, \" says sen. Chuck schumer, per the ap. \" rather than changing their ways, the chinese government seems to be doubling down. \" today's drop in the yuan led to sharp falls in world markets, which analysts believe were caused by fears that china's economy is in worse shape than previously thought, the guardian reports.",

Istat said that starting in september, its 2014 economic measurements will include those three areas of illegal activities, in line with methodology being applied in measuring national accounts within the european union. The move updates the previous system of national account measures implemented in 1995, istat said in a news release. Eurostat, the eu's statistical agency, has provided guidelines that will include an estimate of accounts for illegal activities including prostitution, contraband cigarettes and alcohol, and illegal drug trafficking. Istat said it will be difficult to measure the illegal activities. Expanding its measure of gdp to include these elements of the underground economy will likely add as much as 1 % to 2 % to italian gdp, the agency said.

Drugs, prostitution and smuggling will be part of gdp as of 2014 and prior-year figures will be adjusted to reflect the change in methodology, the istat national statistics office said today. The revision was made to comply with european union rules, it said. Renzi, 39, is committed to narrowing italy's deficit to 2.6 percent of gdp this year, a task that's easier if output is boosted by portions of the underground economy that previously went uncounted. Four recessions in the last 13 years left italy's gdp at 1.56 trillion euros ( $ 2.13 trillion ) last year, 2 percent lower than in 2001 after adjusting for inflation. \"even if the impact is hard to quantify, it's obvious it will have a positive impact on gdp, \" said giuseppe di taranto, economist and professor of financial history at rome's luiss university. \"therefore renzi will have a greater margin this year to spend \" without breaching the deficit limit, he said. A spokesman for the finance ministry declined to comment on the new system. The change in methodology will also bring research and development and arms into the gdp calculation.

            "Italy will include prostitution and illegal drug sales in the gross domestic product calculation this year, a boost for its chronically stagnant economy and prime minister matteo renzi's effort to meet deficit targets. Drugs, prostitution and smuggling will be part of gdp as of 2014 and prior-year figures will be adjusted to reflect the change in methodology, the istat national statistics office said today. The revision was made to comply with european union rules, it said. Renzi, 39, is committed to narrowing italy's deficit to 2.6 percent of gdp this year, a task that's easier if output is boosted by portions of the underground economy that previously went uncounted. Four recessions in the last 13 years left italy's gdp at 1.56 trillion euros ( $ 2.13 trillion ) last year, 2 percent lower than in 2001 after adjusting for inflation. \"even if the impact is hard to quantify, it's obvious it will have a positive impact on gdp, \" said giuseppe di taranto, economist and professor of financial history at rome's luiss university. \"therefore renzi will have a greater margin this year to spend \" without breaching the deficit limit, he said. A spokesman for the finance ministry declined to comment on the new system. The change in methodology will also bring research and development and arms into the gdp calculation. R&d, now considered investment spending, was previously excluded because it was classified as an intermediate cost. To contact the reporters on this story: andrew frye in"

How jezebel sums it up: 2015 oscar nominations snub basically everybody who isn't a white dude.

None won. Lawson looks beyond selma's best director snub, expanding it: \" that the movie's wonderful acting, directing, writing, editing, and cinematography were shut out is a real oversight, sad in the story it tells and troubling in how grimly predictable it was. \" ( its only nods were best picture and best original song. ) for a meaty rundown, check out huffington post's list of today's 29 biggest snubs.",

The lawsuit accuses nuala of controlling barton's earnings while only giving barton an occasional \" allowance, \" and even of lying about her earnings for one movie \" so that she could pocket the difference — on top of her hefty management fee — all without barton's knowledge. \" according to the los angeles times, barton's suit says she entered into a verbal contract with her mom when she was 8; her mom was to get 10 % of her gross earnings. In 2006, when barton was 20, she claims her mother convinced her to buy a $ 7.8 million home in beverly hills as an investment vehicle... But that nuala and barton's dad now live in the home, where barton is \" not welcome. \" there are myriad additional accusations surrounding forged signatures, a handbag line, a fashion boutique, and endorsement contracts, along with allegations of \" bullying and verbal abuse. \" as tmz notes, the lawsuit gets decidedly personal: barton says neither of her parents have had a job other than managing her for more than 10 years, and they both \" sit back expecting their daughter's hard work and dedication to her craft to support their lifestyle. \" nuala is, as you might expect, no longer barton's talent manager.

Police say eulalio tordil, wanted on suspicion of shooting and killing his estranged wife outside a maryland high school on thursday, may be responsible for one or both of friday's shootings. He was arrested friday afternoon, according to nbc news. Tordil allegedly followed his wife to the school, where she was picking up her children, and shot her. Police say he also shot and injured a person attempting to help his wife. Cnn reports the 62-year-old tordil is a law enforcement officer with the federal protective service who was put on administrative leave in march after a protective order was issued against him.",

Scientists at the noaa's space weather prediction center say that aurora lights, which are usually only seen in the extreme north and south of the globe, should be visible over much of canada and the northern united states late sunday and early monday, usa today reports. That includes northern new york state, much of new england, illinois, wisconsin, and the dakotas. The weather network, which has a map showing viewing areas, reports that the event was caused by a solar flare that exploded on the sun thursday night. That flare released a cloud of solar particles, a process known as a coronal mass ejection. When those particles reach the earth's atmosphere, they interact with atmospheric gases, creating the famed colors of the aurora. At the same time the flare was releasing that cloud of particles, it also emitted x-rays that caused a small radio blackout in asia. At about 10am eastern standard time sunday, the national weather service announced on twitter that \" geomagnetic storm conditions \" had begun. According to its latest forecast, the best viewing will come between sunset and 2am, \" clouds permitting. \"",

On monday night, 33-year-old james jordan allegedly locked the couple's 3-year-old son in a bedroom without food or water and started assaulting his wife. The victim says jordan beat her, put a gun to her head, and threatened to kill her. When she tried to leave the house, she says he dragged her back inside by the hair. She also says jordan forced her to take off her clothes then sexually assaulted her, according to cnn. A ups driver made a scheduled stop at the house tuesday to pick up a package — 15 hours after the alleged abuse started. Authorities say the victim handed the package to the driver while jordan stood behind her with a gun. She managed to write \" contact 911 \" on the package as the driver was leaving. Ktvi reports the driver called police, who arrived at the home and arrested jordan without incident. \" we are grateful this ups driver with more than a decade of service followed protocol when he saw a customer in distress, \" cnn quotes ups as saying in a statement. Jordan has been charged with domestic assault, sodomy, felonious restraint, unlawful use of a weapon, and endangering the welfare of a child.",

Robin dimaggio — a professional drummer who's worked with artists like david bowie, diana ross, tupac, and johnny cash — was arrested friday on a felony wire fraud charge after a promise to help a nonprofit put on a star-studded charity concert in the bulgarian capital of sofia, inspired by the 1985 live aid benefit concert, per ktla and nbc news. Per cbs los angeles, dimaggio, 47, was wired $ 750,000 in august 2016 to pay artists he agreed to recruit. But prosecutors say \" he took the money, deposited it into his own account, never put it in an escrow account, \" then spent it on cars, living expenses, and a $ 250,000 home in calabasas, calif. Dimaggio is also accused of paying off credit card debt and wiring $ 150,000 to his company, dimagic entertainment. The peace for you peace for me foundation demanded its money back when he suggested the concert scheduled for oct. 1, 2016 be postponed, but dimaggio said the artists had already been paid, reports fox news. While battling a lawsuit from the concert sponsor in december 2016, dimaggio instead claimed someone used his email to contact the foundation and withdraw funds, though he acknowledged buying the home as a partial settlement of his spousal support, per ktla. The foundation was awarded a $ 1.2 million summary judgment when dimaggio later filed for bankruptcy, per nbc. Released on $ 40,000 bond, the drummer must now wear a tracking device. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. ( this rocker is accused of defrauding 100,000. )",

Police burned banners and assaulted a field hospital in a raid beginning last night; protesters threw pieces of pavement at authorities; and in unconfirmed internet videos, protesters were beaten with sticks by police, who appeared to toss a body on a heap of trash. An apparent fire in a nearby apartment building left a woman calling for help, but police shot tear gas at those below, reuters reports. Though demonstrators were temporarily driven from the square yesterday, they soon returned ahead of another police raid, and the los angeles times reports their ranks grew to 20,000 by midnight. The unrest may complicate the country's plan to hold its first free parliamentary elections in decades; the staggered vote is due to begin next monday, though reuters notes that the army will retain its hold on presidential powers until a presidential poll is held, which may not happen until about a year from now; protesters object to that timeline.",

The michigan democrat, who's running for a state house seat, is fired up after a gop campaign mailer was sent out this week telling people in the city of portage to call him and \" tell him hard-working michiganders are being hurt by obamacare and the health care policies [ democrats ] support. \" which would've been fine, except the phone number on the mailer was the direct line to his mother's room at a local nursing home, where she's being given hospice care for congestive heart failure, fisher's campaign manager tells michigan live. Fisher didn't recognize the number when he got his hands on the mailer. \" when i dialed it, it came up on my cellphone, and it said, ' mom, ' \" he tells wwmt. Meanwhile, isabel kramb fielded her son's calls from her room, giving a stock answer of \" i ' m sorry, he's not here, i ' m his mother, \" she tells the station. The michigan gop says it discovered the number online under fisher's name and apologized \" for any distress that was caused \" by kramb receiving the phone calls. In a statement cited by michigan live, fisher railed on the campaign promo, noting that \" to direct people to call a suffering woman who deserves peace and comfort is beyond the pale. \" he also spoke about the mailer outside the nursing home — with his mother present. Wmmt asked him if that was perhaps also in poor taste. \" i don't know how it could be underhanded to try to remind people not to call my mom, \" fisher said.",
