        "summary": "After 27 years under the autocratic rule of president blaise compaoré, protesters in burkina faso have signaled their desire for change by storming the country's parliament and other government buildings and setting them ablaze. Violence erupted yesterday as lawmakers were set to vote on a bill that would have allowed compaoré, who seized power in a 1987 coup, to stay on for another three terms, reports the new york times. The african country's military says the government has been dissolved, according to cnn, but the president says he will stay in charge for a 12-month transitional period before stepping down. At least three people have been killed in the protests, and there have been reports of demonstrators toppling statues of compaoré and burning the homes of his relatives. In an address to the nation, the president declared a state of emergency, appealed for calm, and pledged to hold \" open talks with all the actors to end the crisis, \" reports the guardian. He added that the bill that would have allowed him to stay on has been withdrawn. Compaoré's current whereabouts are unknown, but there have been reports he has fled to senegal.",

The executive, jeff moody, is no longer affiliated with subway and has declined to discuss fogle. Mills says she didn't go to police because she feared fogle's \" money and influence \" and didn't want to lose her job. Business insider reports mills did request to remove all images of fogle from her restaurant, but subway denied that request. \" every time i would see him on tv in a commercial with his arms around these children, it would kill me, \" mills says. \" i couldn't stand it anymore. \" ( a talented police dog played a crucial role in fogle's arrest. )",

It was the first event of what promoters say will be a national, 10-city bull-running tour modeled on the annual pamplona event. \" i just didn't want to die, to get trampled by bulls and die, \" said cat jones, 22, who works in engineering and traveled from new york city for the run. \" it was a rush... A shot of adrenalin, \" she said. Jones had such a thrill dodging bulls and watching them race by at breakneck speed that she paid $ 30 to run again in the afternoon. The first six runs were conducted with about 500 runners each, chased by 12 bulls, and the last run featured 24 bulls chasing about 700 runners. About 8,000 people came to watch the runs, said rob dickens, co-founder and chief operating officer of the boston-based great bull run. Most of those who signed up were 18 to 40 years old, and about 40 percent were women. Two runners were taken to the hospital with concussion-like symptoms, according to great bull run."

        "summary": "That morning bagel, bowl of corn flakes, or packet of instant oatmeal could be increasing your risk of lung cancer, according to a study published this month. Nbc news reports researchers in texas found a link between foods with a high glycemic index and lung cancer, which kills more americans per year than any other cancer. After comparing the diets of more than 1,900 people with lung cancer and more than 2,400 without it, researchers found a 49 % increase in lung cancer risk for those who ate the most high glycemic foods versus those who ate the least, according to the telegraph. Forbes reports the glycemic index measures how quickly carbs raise blood sugar levels. Foods with a high glycemic index include white bread, many breakfast cereals, white rice, pineapple, melons, popcorn, and more. High glycemic foods have been linked to other cancers in the past, but doctors aren't sure why they would contribute to lung cancer. One possibility is that as foods with a high glycemic index increase insulin levels, they also increase insulin-like growth factors. Those igfs could play a role in growing small tumors. Another interesting result from the study: nonsmokers who ate a lot of high glycemic foods were more than twice as likely to have lung cancer than nonsmokers who ate the least amount of those foods. While the study isn't conclusive, the doctor who led it says eating foods with a low glycemic index may lower the risk of lung cancer. Those foods include stone-ground whole wheat bread, rolled oatmeal, non-starchy vegetables, and most fruits. ( these five states have the most cancer deaths. )",

In the journal that his new york girlfriend, genevieve cook, kept during their time together in the early 1980s, cook wrote, \"told me the other night of having pushed his mother away over past 2 years in an effort to extract himself from the role of supporting man in her life — she feels rejected and has withdrawn somewhat. \" ann once joked that she had children with a kenyan and an indonesian so that the kids would not have light skin",

Barack obama's mother died on nov. 7, 1995, a few weeks before her 53rd birthday. She was less than two years older than the president is now. Her death from uterine cancer came between two key events in her son's life. Four months earlier \"dreams from my father�? had been published; it seemed destined to drown unnoticed in the deep ocean of books. One year later obama won his first election, to the illinois state senate, the initial stop on his swift journey to the white house that, along the way, brought a mass audience to that forgotten memoir, which in its best-selling revival defined his political image and provided him with lifelong financial security. The title of the book was at once understandable and misleading. Obama barely knew his father except in dreams, or nightmares. He spent time with the old man only once, when he was 10, for an unsatisfying month. It is harsh to say but nonetheless likely that barack obama ii was lucky never to have lived with barack obama"

Trump has promised to build a wall along the border with mexico and make mexico pay for it, though mexico says the latter part of that promise isn't going to happen. In august, magal chief saar koursh made it clear he was hoping to get the trump contract. \" the border business was down, but then came isis and the syrian conflict, \" he told bloomberg. \" the world is changing and borders are coming back big-time. \" marketwatch reports that prison stocks were another big winner wednesday, with corrections corp. Of america up 43 %, possibly because investors believe trump will scrap obama's plan to phase out private federal prisons. Gun shares, however, were down, which analysts say was because trump isn't expected to tighten gun control laws, meaning nobody is in a big hurry to stock up on firearms.",

Associated press amazon.com ceo and founder jeff bezos amazon's subscription push is a challenge to rivals such as netflix inc. And google inc.

For the purposes of the study, they called one tablespoon of butter a daily serving. Researchers found that eating butter was in no way associated with a risk of stroke or heart disease and reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 4 %. \" hallelujah, \" gizmodo responds to the study, pointing out that warnings about the dangers of butter have been around since the 1970s. But that doesn't mean it's time to eat an entire butter sculpture. Researchers say that while butter may actually be healthier than sugars and starches, it's probably still worse for you than olive oil or some margarines. \" overall, our results suggest that butter should neither be demonized nor considered ' back ' as a route to good health, \" researcher dariush mozaffarian says in a press release. Researchers did find that eating butter led to a 1 % higher risk of death, though they chalk that up to the fact that \" people who eat more butter generally have worse diets and lifestyles. \" ( this guy found edible butter dating back to jesus. )",

That attack resulted in a pitched battle that left 10 soldiers and 23 militants dead, the new york times reports. The pakistani military is in the midst of an offensive into the khyber region, in an attempt to push lashkar-e-islam out of the bara subdistrict that is uncomfortably close to peshawar.

            "Islamabad, pakistan — the government here cemented its grip on power on friday with strong gains in senate elections that represented a psychological victory for the beleaguered president, asif ali zardari, and should ensure his party's influence for another three years. By late evening, the governing pakistan peoples party and its coalition allies had won 32 of 49 possible seats; another 5 seats were to be announced, but the result could not prevent the government from taking control of the upper house of parliament. It was an important milestone for mr. Zardari and his supporters, who only a few months ago were dogged by sporadic speculation of a military coup and threats from assertive judges and lurid political scandals. Those dangers have not entirely abated, but the senate victory showed that mr. Zardari's party — whose supporters not long ago warned of a \"soft coup \" — has greater staying power than its critics ever imagined. \"this is a huge boost for the p.p.p., \" said cyril almeida, a senior columnist with dawn, pakistan's biggest english-language newspaper. \"at a time when few people believed this government would survive, they have managed to pull it off. \" now mr. Zardari's party will dominate the upper house until march 2015, giving it the power to block legislation — even if it is defeated in general elections",

Like a pack of coyotes, the orcas tried separating the child from its mother — who fought back valiantly for more than two hours. The orcas \" came in waves, like attacking swarms of hockey players, \" said bart selby, who photographed the whole fight in monterey bay ( the chronicle has eleven pics ). When one orca group grew weary, it would move out and orbit \" while a new swarm of orcas pressed the attack, \" he said. The calf tried to survive by hiding behind her mom, hiding her tail on mom's spine, tucking in her flipper, and even lying on top of her. \" we could see a lot of struggling going on, \" a whale watcher told the daily news. Finally the orcas grabbed the baby and pulled it under the surface to drown it. \" i've been around enough to know that nature is cruel, but it was hard to watch, \" said selby. At feeding time, the orcas jumped from the water and slapped their tales in apparent celebration — as the mother gray quickly swam off, and gulls dived by the hundreds to feed on remains floating to the surface. Such attacks aren't uncommon, the chronicle notes — an orca group killed a baby whale and a curious sea lion a few days before. You can see the latest fight on youtube.",

He apparently got into the building by following someone who had authorization, reports ap. Before the arrest, a female worker in the office had called wsb-tv to report the incident and said the gunman himself had ordered her to do so. The gunman left the office briefly when police arrived, apparently to go outside and fire at officers, then returned to the office before eventually surrendering. Police have offered no clues as to a possible motive. Tv footage showed students fleeing the ronald e.

        "summary": "On tuesday, hurricane irma — currently the strongest atlantic hurricane ever recorded outside the caribbean sea or gulf of mexico — hit wind speeds of 185mph, the baltimore sun reports. And scientists are split on whether it's even possible for a hurricane to get much stronger. According to live science, warm water makes hurricanes stronger, and warming oceans due to climate change could theoretically create ever-stronger hurricanes. For example, noaa states human-caused global warming could increase hurricane strength by 2 % to 11 % by the end of the 21st century. And some scientists say wind speeds will increase by about 5 % for every degree celsius increase in ocean temperature. Others disagree; a meteorologist at the national hurricane center says hurricane winds are unlikely ever to top 200mph. In 1998, scientists calculated maximum hurricane wind speeds of 190mph based on current environmental conditions. But regardless of how strong their winds can or will get, no hurricane will ever be stronger than a category 5. That's because the saffir-simpson scale has no category 6. A category 5 hurricane is one that has wind speeds of 156mph or more. Robert simpson says he didn't go higher than category 5 when creating the scale because at that point potential damage is all the same. \"at 5...

The film currently sports an 81 % fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, though its positive reviews seem to be more three-star than four-star. Here's a taste of what they're saying: thor \"pulls off something i wouldn't have thought possible: it restores the innocence to big-budget superhero mythmaking, \" writes owen gleiberman in entertainment weekly. \"the movie, though it's often a very funny god-out-of-water origin comedy, has a stirring emotional core. \" girlfriends will enjoy this one too, writes peter travers in rolling stone: \"thor, for all its digital sound and 3d fury, is a guy movie unafraid of showing its feminine side. \" when romance gives way to fighting, branagh displays \"a class-act grasp of how action works best when it defines character instead of obliterating it. \" andrew o ' hehir of salon, however, wasn't totally won over. \"audiences aren't getting ripped off here, \" he writes, but the movie is slightly disappointing. \"saying that thor is half-assed would be too mean to everybody involved; it's three-quarter-assed. \" but that's kind compared to ao scott's reaction. \"as i stumbled out of the imax … i thought of seeking shelter: in a nearby bar; under a passing bus; in the velvet shadows of an art house, \" he writes in the new york times. It's so soul-crushing because \"nothing, at the level of execution, really has gone wrong. \" the movie set out for \"absolute and unbroken mediocrity, \" and achieved it. \"and that is depressing. \"",

Scott walker, former arkansas gov. Mike huckabee, neurosurgeon ben carson, texas sen. Ted cruz, florida sen. Marco rubio, kentucky sen. Rand paul, christie and kasich. Perry, the former governor of texas whose performance in the debates four years ago helped doom his campaign, finished in 11th place, eight-tenths of a point behind kasich. Former pennsylvania sen. Rick santorum, louisiana gov. Bobby jindal, former hewlett-packard ceo carly fiorina, south carolina sen. Lindsey graham, former virginia gov. Jim gilmore and former new york gov. George pataki are farther behind. The top 10 candidates will debate in a two-hour event at 9 p.m. Eastern time on thursday. The also-rans will be invited to appear at a separate, one-hour debate, which airs at 5 p.m. Eastern.

And when the network unveiled its criteria, it also raised the possibility of expanding beyond 10 participants in the event of a tie. Ultimately, the most controversial decision fox news made in choosing the polls that would be used was dismissing an nbc news/wall street journal poll conducted from july 26-30 and using a quinnipiac university survey conducted july 23-28. The change would not have altered the",

He's done little to leverage that into support. \" trump is making a lot of noise, but he's not necessarily doing the work \" that would be needed \" to turn that share of voice into actual votes, \" said lara brown, associate professor at george washington university's graduate school of political management, a co-author of the study. Hillary rodham clinton is a pro on social media, using it to bring in supporters.

As you might expect, the word \" unusual \" is involved. It turns out that the clintons paid a department staffer out of their own pocket to maintain the server, in addition to his official state department duties. A clinton campaign official depicts this is a good thing because it \" ensured that taxpayer dollars were not spent on a private server that was shared by clinton, her husband and their daughter as well as aides to the former president, \" in the words of the newspaper. The staffer, bryan pagliano, also got $ 5,000 from the clintons to set up the server, but that was before he joined the state department. He had previously worked as clinton's it chief during her 2008 run for president. State department employees at pagliano's level are allowed to take outside work, though they're supposed to report the income, which he does not appear to have done, reports the post. It's not clear how much maintenance work was required or how much additional income he got. \" bryan was hired by the clinton family as a consultant in order to help out periodically with the management of the system in chappaqua that hosted the family's emails, \" campaign spokesperson nick merrill said today, per cnn. At least three congressional panels are interested in having pagliano testify, though he's pledged to take the fifth if he appears.

Los angeles residents courtney wilson and taylor guerrero were holding hands while shopping at a foodland grocery store. When the couple stopped to hug and kiss, they were approached by officer bobby harrison, who was shopping while in uniform. Their lawsuit alleges harrison ordered them to \" take it somewhere else. \" it also states he tried to get the store's manager to issue trespass warnings to wilson and guerrero, according to reuters. The lawsuit claims harrison later grabbed wilson's wrist while she was in the checkout line. A scuffle ensued, and the women were arrested. Wilson and guerrero spent three days in jail, but the felony assault charges against them were eventually dismissed. The couple, who have since broken up, filed a lawsuit against the city of honolulu in october, the honolulu civil beat reports. The $ 80,000 settlement was announced friday and still must be approved by the honolulu city council. \" it's a pretty good outcome as far as we're concerned, \" an attorney for wilson and guerrero tells reuters. The women already settled with foodland for $ 10,000. The honolulu police department investigated harrison after the lawsuit was filed and found no wrongdoing. \"i ' m glad it's over, but at the same time we wanted the officer to suffer some sort of repercussion, \" wilson tells the ap.

        "summary": "Mammals tend to avoid incest as a rule, mainly due to the resulting health issues in offspring. There are exceptions, however, and a team of researchers has discovered — for the banded mongoose, at least — incest isn't always such a bad idea. The animals have an oddly high degree of incest as they tend to live in close-knit groups of about 18 throughout their lives, according to a study in biology letters. Researchers studied 14 such groups of the animals in a uganda park over 16 years and found about 64 % of newborns were born to members of the same natal group who mated with each other. Why? researchers say a mongoose would actually be risking its survival if it tried to mate with a member of another group, phys.org reports. Loners who attempt to join a new group can be violently rejected. Plus, new groups have three times the mortality rate of established units. In observing the groups, researchers reported 27 % of offspring came from mating between females and relatives like a half-sibling or grandparent, while more than 7 % of pups came from parent-child or sibling relationships, science reports. The conclusion? \" the costs of inbreeding avoidance may sometimes outweigh the benefits, \" researchers say. As david shultz at science points out, \" if you find yourself looking around the table over the holiday and thinking, ' i can't believe i ' m related to these people, ' just be glad you're not a mongoose. \" ( seals were recently spotted having sex with penguins. )",

If you were, you might be thinking, \"i can't believe i've mated with all of these people. \" for the cat-sized mammals, native to central and east africa, it's safer to have sex with a close relative than risk death by venturing out into the world to find a mate, according to a study published online today in biology letters. Newly formed mongoose groups have a mortality rate three times higher than that of established ones, and mongooses that encroach on neighboring groups are often met with violence. Perhaps consequently, an analysis of 14 packs of mongooses in uganda's queen elizabeth national park finds that inbreeding is the norm: 63.6 % of the pups were conceived between two members of the same natal group, the social group into which an individual is born. Twenty-seven percent of offspring were conceived by mothers that bred within their natal group and were related to their mates by a coefficient of relationship of 0.25 or higher — the equivalent genetic similarity between half siblings or a grandparent/grandchild. Additionally, 7.5 % of pups were conceived by parents related by 0.5 or more — full siblings or a parent/child. Father/daughter incest occurred eight times during the study, but interestingly, mother/son breeding was not observed — perhaps due to the fact that males take longer to reach sexual maturity and their mothers are dead by the time they're ready to mate. Researchers speculate that, at least for mongooses, the genetic problems caused by inbreeding are perceived to be less dangerous than leaving the pack in search of new mates."

The premise of the show, which began filming in march 2016 with 23 cast members, pits humans against the elements in a return to the basics. Without modern tools and technology, the group had to band together to sustain food and shelter in the west highlands region of scotland. Over the course of the year, 13 cast members left the project, though the exact reasons are unclear. Along with as many as four people absconding due to an epic season of scottish midges, pesky insects that leave irritating bites, the press and journal of aberdeen reports that food in the commune may have been become scarce. One local resident tells the newspaper that after leaving isolation, participants sought care from a dentist for damage sustained after eating chicken feed grit. A channel 4 spokesperson hasn't confirmed these rumors, but says more episodes of eden will air eventually. \"the story of their time, including the highs and the lows, will be shown later this year. \" no set date, however, has been announced.

        "summary": "Unfortunate news for flight attendants: a new study finds that they suffer from higher rates of many types of cancer than the general population. The researchers compared data from more than 5,300 flight attendants who completed a health survey to about 2,700 non-flight-attendants with similar income and educational status, livescience reports. Among their most striking findings: female flight attendants had rates of breast cancer about 50 % higher than women who weren't flight attendants; they also had melanoma rates more than two times higher and non-melanoma skin cancer rates about four times higher. And male flight attendants had melanoma rates of almost 50 % higher than the general population of males and non-melanoma skin cancer rates of about 10 % higher. Air cabin crew members were also found to have higher rates of cancers of the cervix, thyroid, and uterus, as well as gastrointestinal system cancers including colon, stomach, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic cancers. This despite the fact that the flight attendant group had, as a whole, indications of healthy behaviors including low levels of smoking and obesity. The researchers point out several possible reasons for the increased cancer risk: flight attendants are exposed to many known and potential carcinogens, including the us ' highest on-the-job dose of cosmic ionizing radiation, which is known to cause breast cancer and skin cancer. As time explains, cosmic radiation originates in space, but small amounts make it to earth and exposure is more likely at higher altitudes. Cabin crew members are also regularly exposed to uv radiation and chemical contaminants from engine leakages, flame retardants, and more. Their circadian rhythms can be disrupted by jet lag, and such disruptions have also been linked to an increased risk of cancer. Researchers say pilots and frequent flyers may be at similar risk for the same reasons. ( here are five things airline workers would tell you if they could. )",

Switzerland isn't taking chances, issuing a government decree that \" the practice of plunging live lobsters into boiling water, which is common in restaurants, is no longer permitted, \" the afp reports. The crustaceans will have to be \" stunned \" first, either via electric shock or the \" mechanical destruction \" of the lobster's brain, per radio television suisse. Transporters of live lobsters will also be required to carry them around \" in their natural environment, \" not on ice or in super-cold water. Reuters notes the new rules, adopted wednesday, will take effect in march. Animal rights activists have long argued that lobsters, crabs, and other shellfish are able to feel pain, and there's been some evidence to back that claim up. In a 2013 study in the journal of experimental biology cited by us news, for example, crabs stayed away from areas of their tanks that delivered electric shocks. The research is still deemed \" inconclusive, \" though many scientists say it's \" highly likely \" the creatures feel pain, even if it's yet to be conclusively proven. The new swiss lobster laws are part of an overall overhaul of the country's animal protection rules. Also included in the revamp are new regulations going after illegal puppy farms, detailing how to humanely euthanize sick or hurt animals, and putting the onus for animal welfare at public events on the event's organizers.

The issue is resonating particularly strongly in michigan, which already has accepted about 200 and is home to what the detroit free press calls one of the biggest mideast populations in the nation. \" michigan is a welcoming state and we are proud of our rich history of immigration, \" said gov. Rick snyder. \" but our first priority is protecting the safety of our residents. \" he said the state would suspend its push to bring in refugees until the homeland security department conducts a review of procedures in the wake of the paris attacks. In alabama, gov. Robert bentley said he intends to keep the number of syrian refugees to zero. \" after full consideration of this weekend's attacks of terror on innocent citizens in paris, i will oppose any attempt to relocate syrian refugees to alabama through the us refugee admissions program, \" he said. \" as your governor, i will not stand complicit to a policy that places the citizens of alabama in harm's way. \" one of the state department's refugee processing centers is in alabama, and it isn't clear how bentley plans to stop syrians from being resettled in the state, nbc news reports. Indeed, the post notes that states have \" limited power \" when it comes to the relocation of refugees, and president obama has said the us plans to take at least 10,000 from syria.",

The plan, which is being championed by senate majority leader dominic pileggi and already has the governor's support, would switch pennsylvania from a winner-take-all system to one that divvied the state's electoral votes up by district, the pittsburgh post-gazette reports. And those districts are set to be redrawn this year — by a republican legislature and governor. The likely result: instead of taking all the state's electoral votes, obama would take eight to the gop's 12. Maine and nebraska already have this system, but each is too small for the popular and electoral votes to split like that. \"it's something that no previous legislature in america since the civil war has ever had the audacity to impose, \" one constitutional law professor tells mother jones. And it might not stop there — the gop could try the same thing in michigan, ohio, and wisconsin, all traditional democratic states currently in its sway.",

        "summary": "Arkansas ' goal of executing seven inmates in 11 days before its supply of lethal injection drugs expires may be a dead plan walking after two court rulings friday. In the first ruling, the state supreme court temporarily stayed the execution of convicted killer bruce earl ward, npr reports. Attorneys for ward, who was due to be executed monday night, argued that he is a diagnosed schizophrenic who doesn't understand the punishment or the reason why. A second ruling, from pulaski county judge wendell griffen, put the remaining six executions on hold by blocking the state's use of its supply of the execution drug vercomium bromide, the ap reports. The drug's maker, mckesson medical surgical, said it had been misled by the state. In its lawsuit, mckesson said arkansas ordered the drug using a license that only allowed it to obtain drugs for legitimate medical purposes. The company said it asked for the drug back when it learned it would be used for executions, but though arkansas agreed to return its supply and was granted a refund, it never returned the drug, the arkansas democrat-gazette reports. The makers of the other two drugs in the state's three-drug lethal injection cocktail have also gone to court. On friday, johnny depp joined former death row inmate damien echols in a rally against the executions at the capitol in little rock, kthv reports. Echols was freed in 2011 after spending 18 years on death row,",

        "summary": "The chemical used in an attack this week that left at least 86 people — 27 of them children — dead in syria was sarin, a banned nerve agent, the new york times report. The turkish health ministry says it confirmed the chemical as sarin following an autopsy on three victims. Many of the victims of tuesday's attack in idlib province were taken to turkey afterward. President bashar al-assad, who is being blamed for the attack, signed a treaty banning the use of sarin less than four years ago following an earlier attack. The syrian government promised to get rid of its chemical weapons after signing the treaty. The syrian government is denying any responsibility for this week's assault. Rex tillerson says \" steps are underway \" to plan for assad's removal from power in response to the chemical attack, usa today reports. It's unclear what those steps are, but the secretary of state says assad has no future leading syria and that russia, which is standing behind the syrian government's claims of innocence in the attack, should rethink its support for the syrian president. According to the washington post, the trump administration is now considering potential military action against syria, with the pentagon presenting possible options to the white house. Those options could include strikes on syrian military targets or keeping the syrian air force from flying. However, there are concerns about how russia could react to us military action.",

The operation, which the trump administration authorized in retaliation for a chemical attack killing scores of civilians this week, dramatically expands u.s. Military involvement in syria and exposes the united states to heightened risk of direct confrontation with russia and iran, both backing assad in his attempt to crush his opposition.

Mr. Moallem repeated an explanation, which experts say is implausible, that the toxic substances were dispersed after the syrian army had conducted an 11: 30 a.m. Air raid on an insurgent depot that he said contained chemical weapons. His statement echoed a russian account of what had happened that witnesses and western leaders say is contradicted by the evidence. Mr. Moallem asserted that al qaeda's syria affiliate, commonly called al nusra front, and its main jihadist rival, the islamic state, harbor illicit chemical weapons in syria.

Dallas county criminal court judge lisa green ordered the jury to find jackson not guilty after ruling the state failed to present sufficient evidence to continue the case. Jackson said he took his 12-year-old daughter's cell phone as punishment after finding inappropriate texts in september 2013. A few hours later, officers from the grand prairie police department showed up at his front door, asking for the iphone 4 back. \" at that point, i decided the police don't interfere with my ability to parent my daughter, \" jackson said. Michelle steppe, the child's mother, sees it differently. \" as a mom, i ' m upset because — number one — the property belongs to me, \" she said. Steppe told jurors on monday she called police the day her daughter lost the use of her phone for disciplinary reasons. \" you can't take someone's property, regardless if you're a parent or not, \" steppe said.

        "summary": "Domestic violence is a troubling issue in kenya, and jackline mwende has recently become the very public face of it. The 27-year-old from machakos, a village not far from nairobi, says her husband came at her in a rage on july 23 with a machete and not only slashed her head and face, but also cut off her hands — all because their seven years together hadn't resulted in any kids, the los angeles times reports. Mwende says her marriage to stephen ngila, who's said to be either 34 or 35, started out well but soon soured after they were unable to conceive. Those ill feelings only worsened when the couple visited a fertility clinic in 2014 and discovered the reproductive problem rested with ngila, not mwende. It's then, mwende says, that ngila started drinking to excess and physically abusing her. Ngila, arrested the day after the attack and in police custody until his sept. 20 trial on attempted murder charges, per kenya's star, allegedly \" threatened to shut [ mwende's ] mouth for good \" right before attacking her, her father told cnn earlier this month. The times notes kenyan women in physically or sexually abusive relationships are often victims of impoverished lifestyles and an extreme traditional culture where everyone looks the other way if men get physical with their wives. Meanwhile, ngila's sister has rushed to his defense, insisting he was with her the day of the attack, while another relative says mwende may have been attacked by unhappy customers of her shop; local cops side with mwende. \" he thought he had killed me, but god is great, \" she says. ( this abused wife won a $ 21.5 million judgment against her husband. )",

Last may, joshua brown collided with a left-turning truck on a divided highway near williston, fla., while his tesla model s sedan was in autopilot. On monday, the national transportation safety board released 500 pages of findings about the accident, including a big one: during his trip, brown ignored seven visual warnings to put his hands on the wheel, six of which were followed by a chime, reports reuters. During a 37-minute stretch when he was supposed to be controlling the wheel, he did so for only 25 seconds. The report exonerated brown on one thing: it found that he didn't seem to be watching a movie when the crash happened, as some reports had suggested. \" unequivocally false, \" says the family lawyer, saying the movie theory should be laid to rest. At the time of the accident, tesla released a statement saying neither the autopilot system nor brown \"noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. \" according to the report, the truck should have been visible to brown for at least seven seconds, but the driver \" took no braking, steering or other actions to avoid the collision. \" less than two minutes before the accident, brown had set the cruise control to 74 mph, nine miles per hour over the speed limit. Since the accident, tesla has upgraded its autopilot feature, which will now shut down if a driver fails to respond to audible warnings.

According to the presentation, ricard created the system — which puts rainbows into 12 categories — because the classic roy g. Biv rainbow described by textbooks hardly ever exists in nature. Rainbows are actually more complex than that. Ricard and his team found that rainbows can have up to four characteristics: the main band, a fainter double rainbow, a dark space between the two, and any additional bands, live science reports. National geographic reports things get complicated because of all the variables — hence the 12 categories. For example, some rainbows exclude entire colors. Not to mention rainbows are constantly changing. \" they don't look alike because when we look at a rainbow, one second later, the drops which form the primary bow and the secondary bow are not the same, because they are falling, \" live science quotes ricard as saying. For decades scientists had been classifying rainbows based on raindrop size, according to the presentation. But after studying hundreds of pictures of rainbows, ricard found the height of the sun actually has a bigger effect. National geographic reports classifying rainbows might seem like a \" frivolous endeavor, \" but ricard says it can \" challenge our understanding of rainbows. \" ( did the grateful dead conjure a rainbow? )",

Us law enforcement is looking into a recent spate of women allegedly seeking to join the jihad, reuters reports. In the past six weeks, three families in the minneapolis-st. Paul area have reported missing female family members they suspect may be enlisting, one local muslim community leader says. On aug. 25, another 19-year-old from the area ran away from home, hopped a flight to turkey, and joined isis in syria. \" the nature of the recruitment of these crazy organizations is how they use the element of surprise. Now they have surprised us again by going for the girls, \" the community leader says. The twin cities are a hotbed for such recruiting because they boast america's largest somalian population, but the problem isn't entirely localized: in july, a 19-year-old colorado woman was arrested for allegedly trying to join up. In other isis news: state department officials tell the new york times that several arab countries have agreed to help with the us airstrike campaign against isis — though some will only be providing supplies rather than running strikes of their own. Iraqi officials say that france has agreed to carry out airstrikes of its own, and australia has announced that it will be as well. Australia will also be sending 200 troops to iraq to serve as military advisers. Meanwhile, isis has been enjoying a pr boon of sorts among extremists online thanks to its string of grisly beheading videos, the guardian reports. \" the wannabe foreign fighters are excited by these killings, \" the director of the international center for the study of radicalization explains. \" people in tunisia and libya are particularly interested in the prospect of fighting american and now british enemies. This is turning on people who were radicalized before this conflict started but weren't particularly excited by the sunni-shia battle. \"",

            "A year after hurricane maria swept across puerto rico, leaving some 2,975 people dead and knocking the economy on its back, it is becoming increasingly clear that the u.s. Territory may never fully recover from the storm. Puerto rico was already insolvent before the 2017 storm, with creditors and the island's government deep in negotiations about how to jumpstart the economy or strip it bare to pay off $ 70 billion owed to bondholders. And the island's government owes another $ 50 billion it doesn't have to cover current and future pensions. Even before maria, half a million people had left puerto rico and its economy had been steadily shrinking since 2005. After the hurricane, there's even less to work with. While power and water have finally been restored to more than 99 percent of the island's remaining 3.2 million residents, the economy is moribund. Economic output is projected to fall 13.3 percent this year, manufacturing jobs are drying up, tax receipts are down, small businesses are shuttering, and the reconstruction boom that follows many natural disasters is stymied by the slow pace of federal aid and the fact that most puerto ricans had little savings or insurance before the storm. Only 15 percent had homeowners insurance, and only 1 in 3 residents has a bank account. \" i am not hugely",

After three hours of terror at the shelbyville home, the inmates finally left in the couple's jeep cherokee, swing tells the tennessean. At that point, the \" traumatized \" couple were able to free their bonds of rope and belts and call police. Soon after, the inmates led an hours-long car chase down interstate 24 near murfreesboro, with speeds reaching 100mph, per wsb-tv. Authorities say they fired 20 shots at police. The shots hit police vehicles but caused no injuries. After several hours, the inmates wrecked their car when they crashed into a tree line. However, they failed to surrender, instead running six miles to a home, where they attempted to steal another vehicle. That's when the homeowner intervened. Hearing a commotion outside the home in christiana, he held dubose and rowe at gunpoint until authorities arrived, per the ap.
