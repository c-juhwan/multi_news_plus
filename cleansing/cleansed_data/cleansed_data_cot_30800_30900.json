Those who weren't married, hadn't gotten a college degree, or used drugs were especially likely to fall down the income ladder, the washington post observes. The report focused on people who were 39-44 years old between 2004 and 2006, meaning it doesn't take into account any post-financial crisis hardships. It defined middle-class as between the 30th and 70th percentile in income distribution. Looking along race and gender lines, researchers found that black men were twice as likely as white to be downwardly mobile, with nearly 40 % falling. There was no similar gap between white and hispanic men, or between women of different races.",

Halfway through his term, he served notice to his skeptics: \" i am persistent. \" the president who strode on stage for a news conference cut a remarkably different figure than the obama who, just seven weeks ago, held a similar event in which he somberly admitted he had taken a \" shellacking \" in the midterm elections and needed to re-evaluate. This time, obama was about to jet off to a hawaiian holiday vacation knowing he had secured the kind of legislative wins that rarely come so bundled as they just did, particularly in a postelection lawmaking session. Obama spoke on the same day that he found enough allies in both parties to get senate ratification of a nuclear arms treaty with russia, a vote watched around the world as a test of international security and presidential clout. He also signed landmark legislation to allow gays to serve openly in the military, calling himself overwhelmed by the enormity of the moment. And that was on top of other achievements, including a hard-fought deal to extend tax cuts and unemployment insurance even as it piled on more debt, a broad food security"

Their tale of survival is an improbable one: the new york times reports yivo was founded in what's now the lithuanian capital of vilna in 1925, and it served as \" the world's foremost library of jewish life in eastern europe. \" and the nazis wanted it destroyed — or most of it. It ordered some 40 yiddish speakers to sift through the documents and retain a third of the choicest ones, which would be sent to germany for study. But the \" paper brigade \" risked death to take and hide books and documents in six locations throughout the ghetto. Lithuanian librarian antanas ulpis similarly risked his life to hide the documents from the soviets who pushed out the germans, keeping them safe in the basement of st. George church. The soviet union's collapse brought some 250,000 pages kept there to light. But it turns out 170,000 pages had been stored elsewhere in the basement; they only surfaced as part of a 2016 move.

Credit: dr brian choo, flinders university it may not have been love as we know it, but around 385 million years ago, our very distant ancestors — armoured fish called placoderms — developed the art of intercourse. So suggest a team of evolutionary scientists, who point to the fossil of a placoderm species blessed with the name of microbrachius dicki. Measuring about eight centimetres ( four inches ) in length, m. Dicki lived in habitats in modern-day scotland — where the first specimen was found in 1888 — and in estonia and china. Placoderms have previously been found to be the most primitive jawed animal — the earliest known vertebrate forerunner of humans. But they now have an even more honoured place in the book of life. Microbrachius is the first known species to copulate in order to carry out internal fertilisation, according to a paper published on sunday in the journal nature. Male fish had bony, l-shaped genital limbs called claspers which transferred sperm into the female, a more effective way of reproduction compared to spawning in the water, the study says.

            "Artist's impression of microbrachius mating scene. Credit: dr brian choo, flinders university it may not have been love as we know it, but around 385 million years ago, our very distant ancestors — armoured fish called placoderms — developed the art of intercourse. So suggest a team of evolutionary scientists, who point to the fossil of a placoderm species blessed with the name of microbrachius dicki. Measuring about eight centimetres ( four inches ) in length, m. Dicki lived in habitats in modern-day scotland — where the first specimen was found in 1888 — and in estonia and china. Placoderms have previously been found to be the most primitive jawed animal — the earliest known vertebrate forerunner of humans. But they now have an even more honoured place in the book of life.

The trick is getting those metals. Japan throws away approximately 650,000 tons of electronics every year, but only about 100,000 tons of that is recycled. And most of the metals from recycled electronics go toward making new electronics, engadget reports. Japan is currently trying to figure out how to increase electronic recycling among its citizens.

The shark population on the east coast is at its highest since scientists began counting the animals 29 years ago, according to a federal study, and scientists are high-finning, er, fiving, over the news. In just three years, shark numbers have spiked 55 %: noaa surveyors counted and tagged 2,835 animals from florida to north carolina during this year's spring search, compared to 1,831 sharks in 2012, report newsweek and fox news. The most common of 13 species found were atlantic sharpnose, tiger, dusky, and sandbar sharks. The latter two species had been heavily depleted by fishers, so \" this is a positive sign, \" shark expert gregory skomal, who wasn't involved in the study, tells newsweek. But the mag notes the dusky shark population is still a long way from \" fully recovered. \" shark numbers slid from the late 1970s to the early 1990s due to overfishing. Though federal laws limiting commercial shark fishing were put on the books in 1993, sharks breed as little as once during their lifetimes, so they're slow to bounce back. Researchers also tagged three great whites and six bull sharks, which past surveys often haven't found. A bull shark hadn't been captured by the program since 2001. While the rising shark population could play a role in the record-setting eight shark bites in north carolina this year, skomal says there might have just been more swimmers in the water. \" oceanographic conditions might have brought more sharks closer to shore during their seasonal migration than have normally occurred, \" an expert adds.

A federal study of shark populations found significantly more sharks than when the survey was conducted three years ago, and the most since scientists began counting the animals in 1986.

Sharks are vulnerable to overfishing as they grow slowly and may only reproduce once or a few times during their long lives, so it takes population a long time to recover, natanson says. To understand the extent of the overfishing, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration's fisheries service, for whom natanson works, began conducting surveys of shark populations.

        "summary": "What's the likelihood your spouse will cheat on you? university of connecticut professor christin munsch attempts to answer that question through an economic lens in a study published today in american sociological review. Munsch looks at how likely it is a breadwinner will cheat — as well as how likely it is an economically dependent spouse will do the same. Her \" counterintuitive \" finding, per the guardian: men and women who are economically dependent on their partner are more likely to cheat, with men three times more inclined to do so. For women: those who are totally economically dependent have a 5.2 % probability of cheating, compared to 3.4 % for those who brought home equal income and just 1.5 % for total breadwinners. For completely financially dependent men, the probability of cheating was much higher: 15 %. As for how common that scenario may be, cnn points to a pew research center report that found that 15 % of married mothers outearned their husbands in 2011. Men were actually least likely to cheat ( 2.9 % ) when they brought home 70 % of the couple's pooled income. Infidelity increases from there, with men who are the sole breadwinners having a 4 % chance of cheating. \" these men are aware that their wives are truly dependent and may think that, as a result, their wives will not leave them even if they cheat, \" munsch tells the wall street journal. She arrived at her conclusions by crunching data of 2,757 straight people in the same relationship for at least a year as gathered by the national longitudinal survey of youth between 2001 and 2011. As the survey's name suggests, those considered were young: between the ages of 18 and 32. What munsch thinks her findings indicate: \" we don't really like inequity, and there's probably something about masculinity that means men really don't like it. \" ( why people discover an affair...

Researchers in australia studied golden orb weaver spiders and found that they grew bigger and reproduced more in urban environments. One reason might be that cities tend to be warmer given all that concrete and asphalt. \" we think by being in these areas with higher temperatures, the spiders have more energy to put toward reproduction and they're surviving longer as well, \" a lead researcher tells the sydney morning herald. Nor does it hurt that city lights attract more bugs to feast on in a concentrated area. What's more, when the spiders build their large webs in the country, other species tend to zip in and steal dinner. But that seems less pronounced in the city because the \" little kleptos \" have fewer places to hide, explains wired. One other nugget spotted by the la times: the more upscale the neighborhood, the more the spiders thrived. \"the increased expenditure and management of parks in wealthy suburbs could result in healthier vegetation patches, which would increase prey abundance and allow spiders to grow larger and build up fat reserves, \" write the researchers.

Scientists in australia say men simply aren't very empathetic when their partners are blue — and they have a national survey to prove it, reports the herald sun. Researchers interviewed 20,000 australians and asked them about \" negative shocks in their lives, such as the death of a friend, losing a job, or becoming ill, \" says researcher paul frijters.

Researchers can't explain this imbalance in empathy and don't know if nature versus nurture is at play. Frijters theorizes men may be more concerned about their \" own roles and image as partners, \" while co-researcher cindy mervin puts it thusly: \" it is not that men are unemotional or uncaring, since they are quite strongly affected by what happens to themselves, but they simply are not very emotional when it comes to the feelings of their partner. \" both men and women were found to be equally emotional when confronting their own woes.

For men, however, this \"spillover factor \" is just seven per cent. \"we looked at people who had negative shocks in their lives, such as the death of a friend, losing a job or becoming ill, \" said professor paul frijters of university of queensland, who conducted the study with dr cindy mervin of griffith university. \"men and women were almost equally affected by these things if it happened to themselves. \"it's not that men are cold, emotionless fish, but we found they were much less affected by what happened to their partner. \" while the research points to a major gender difference surrounding empathy, prof frijters said he can't give a definitive answer as to why this would be the case. \"it is possible that men are probably more affected by their own",

Dr cindy mervin from griffith health institute's centre for applied health economics and professor paul frijters from the university of queensland found that when partners were ill or experienced the death of a friend, women were noticeably affected, yet men were not significantly affected by the negative events in their partner's life. Female partner's levels of empathy could be measured as comparable ( 24 % ) to the event happening directly to themselves, whereas men's emotional lives were not linked to the experiences of their partner. \"it is not that men are unemotional or uncaring, since they are quite strongly affected by what happens to themselves, but they simply are not very emotional when it comes to the feelings of their partner, \" said dr mervin. \"it is possible that men are probably more affected by their own roles and image as partners, than by the actual feelings of their partner, \" said professor frijters. \"this research found there is a multiplier or spillover effect on events happening to one person from the pain or joy caused to others.

The warm, moist environment inside a glove is the perfect place to harbor bacteria — and, more disturbingly, gloves that are not changed often enough can lead to cross-contamination.

It was all a ruse, and the downstairs location he headed to wasn't in a building but on a ship, the naham 3, the tuna vessel where the journalist was being held. It was august 2012; somali pirates had captured him in january. And on this one night, moore decided to make a break for it. In a piece for gq, moore explains what precipitated his leap into the sea. The ship had been anchored off hobyo, somalia, when the anchor broke, possibly after a huge fish tried to feast on the ship's barnacle-clad hull. As the vessel began to move, a twin-engine plane flew overhead. And that got him thinking. He began to suspect drones were watching. \" someone with the power to launch a twin-engine aircraft had noticed the accident and reacted, quickly, so it was possible that even an aircraft carrier stood not far off. This ship was moving an american hostage to an unknown destination. The navy had to be watching. \" he put his led lighter in a plastic bag thinking he could signal to drones from the water, got led to the supposed toilet paper location, kicked off his sandals, and then ran and dove into the water 20 feet below. His first realizations after hitting the water: he floated more easily than he expected to due to the saltiness of the water, and he was really afraid. Oh, and that led light? didn't work, but the somalis'spotlights did. Read the full story here, which recounts how he ended up back on the ship; he would remain in captivity for a total 977 days.

Diablo canyon is california's last remaining nuclear plant after the closure of the san onofre nuclear generating station in 2012. The diablo canyon closure is part of a deal with labor and environmental organizations. The plant produces 9 % of california's in-state power, or enough to power more than 1.7 million homes, according to the los angeles times. The plan is to replace that lost electricity output through renewable power, increased efficiency, and electricity storage. The decision to close diablo canyon was made in part because of new renewable energy requirements, the increasing output of solar and wind power, and a loss of customers. But there had also been increasing debate about the future of diablo canyon, which sits near several fault lines, in the wake of the 2011 fukushima disaster in japan. Environmental groups worried about what would happen in the case of a quake along one of those faults. But the closure isn't all good news. The washington post reports some climate scientists actually wanted the power plant to stay open as it doesn't create greenhouse gasses. Diablo canyon employs nearly 1,500 people and has a $ 920 million impact on the local economy every year. It's the largest private employer in the county.",

The researchers dipped gloved hands in bacteria and then shook hands with, high-fived, or fist-bumped sterile-gloved counterparts, the los angeles times reports. They found that handshakes spread 20 times more bacteria than fist bumps, while high-fives passed along about half as many germs as handshakes. Part of the reasons handshakes spread so many more germs is because there's much more surface area meeting between hands, according to the researchers, who carried out their study after the journal of the american medical association called for handshakes to be banned in health care settings, cbs reports. \" for the sake of improving public health, we encourage further adoption of the fist bump as a simple, free, and more hygienic alternative to the handshake, \" especially during cold and flu season, the researchers concluded.",

Among \" the most disturbing allegations \" are reports of nine separate incidents in which females were \" burnt alive \" in their homes after being gang-raped, reports the afp. The report also describes how a woman was \" dragged out of her hut and gang-raped in front of her 3-year-old child, \" per the bbc. Another was forced to hold red-hot coals in an attempt to get her to disclose the location of rebels or cattle. A spokesman for president salva kiir tells the bbc that soldiers wouldn't commit such acts against their own people, but the government will review the allegations — based on accounts from 115 victims and eyewitnesses in the state of unity — because they are \" too serious to ignore. \" south sudan, where boys have also been abducted, has been embroiled in a civil war since 2013 when kiir accused his deputy, riek machar, of planning a coup. A rebel army led by machar was then formed to battle the government in a war that has claimed thousands of lives. Rebels say \" progress is being made \" during talks between machar and kiir, held in kenya, but the battle rages on, reports the new york times; as talks were under way on saturday, machar's forces moved in to capture the strategic city of malakal.",

            "Members of generation x, now in their late 30s to late 40s, were especially hard-hit by the recent recession, and are at risk for downward mobility in their retirement years, a new report finds. Generation xers, the group of americans following the baby boomers, lost nearly half of their overall net worth between 2007 and 2010, according to a report from the pew charitable trusts. Generation xers lost an average of about $ 33,000, reducing their \"already low \" relative levels of wealth, the report found. While gen-xers saw greater increases in wealth from home equity during the housing boom, they have lower overall rates of home ownership compared to earlier generations, which mutes the impact on the wealth of their group over all, the report found. The report defined generation x as those born between 1966 and 1975, so they now range in age from 38 to 47. By comparison, both early and late baby boomers also were hurt by the recession, but to a lesser extent, losing 28 percent and 25 percent of their median net worth, respectively. Gen-xers also have higher levels of debt than other age groups, the report found. The upshot is that based on the analysis, gen-xers will only have enough at retirement to replace about half of their pre-retirement income, if they retire at age 65. Financial planners typically suggest that retirees should be able to replace at least 70 percent of their annual income, through savings and accumulated wealth. Early baby boomers — those born between 1946 and 1955, who are currently 58 to 67 years old — appear on track to replace between 70 to 80 percent of their income, in contrast to the age groups that follow them. Late boomers, born between 1956 and 1965, are also less well-prepared for retirement than earlier generations, the report found. The report is based on data from 1989 through 2010 collected by the federal reserve board and the university of michigan. \"as policymakers focus on americans'retirement security, particular consideration should be paid to how younger generations of workers can make up for these losses and prepare for the future, \" said erin currier, director of pew's economic mobility project, in a prepared statement.

            "International negotiators assembled in austria have announced the final terms of the iranian nuclear deal. The purpose of the deal is to limit iran's nuclear program to something that is small, safe, and peaceful — and to impose lots of invasive inspections to make sure iran is keeping to its end of the deal. In exchange, iran gets relief from some of the economic sanctions that have crippled its economy. Both sides, the thinking goes, also get to avert a war. You can really see how that plays out, how the deal works, and what it means when you look into its details. But those details can get awfully technical. So what follows are the most important provisions of the deal, along with a simple translation of each into plain english and a brief description of why it matters: centrifuges term: iran will be allowed about 6,000 centrifuges in all: 5,060 that can enrich uranium at its natanz facility and another 1,000 at fordow, where they can be used for non-fissile research. It can only use first-generation ir-1 centrifuges, and has to give up other models, although several years down the line will be allowed to develop slightly more advanced models. Plain english: centrifuges are pieces of equipment you use to enrich uranium, a natural ore, into nuclear fuel. If you enrich"

        "summary": "The virtues of noshing on dark chocolate have long been extolled, but its more milquetoast cousin may now be able to capitalize on its health benefits — and it's all thanks to peanuts, the independent reports. In a study published in the journal food science, scientists from north carolina state university took samples of milk chocolate, infused them with a powder made out of phenolic compounds — substances that boast antioxidant abilities and can fend off cell damage from cancer, heart disease, and other conditions — from peanut skins, and found they were able to boost the milk chocolate's own levels of antioxidants. Not only that, but by mixing in maltodextrin powder ( an artificial sweetener ), they were able to tamp down the bitterness often found in dark chocolate and keep the milk chocolate satisfyingly sweet. Their findings were based on a taste test administered to 80 people given samples of both regular milk chocolate and the peanut-skin-altered confections; the subjects liked both samples more or less equally. This research is also good news on the \" one man's trash, another man's treasure \" front: peanut skins are currently nothing more than waste left behind after peanuts undergo the blanching process. \" if applied to commercial products, peanut skin extracts would allow consumers to enjoy mild tasting products and have exposure to compounds that have proven health benefits, \" says lead author lisa dean, per a press release. One thing that still has to be researched, per science blog: whether the addition of the peanut skin compounds would be harmful to those with peanut allergies.

Why the link? it's not clear, but people with alzheimer's have a shortage of acetylcholine, the transmitter these drugs block, and the researchers also note that in animals, anticholinergic effects are known to increase beta-amyloid protein levels, another characteristic of alzheimer's. But, experts caution, it is still not known whether these drugs actually cause dementia, and the lead author of the study notes, \" no one should stop taking any therapy without consulting their healthcare provider, \" though there are alternative therapies available that do not have anticholinergic effects, such as ssri antidepressants and antihistamines like claritin. Medical daily notes that other common drugs, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal medications, also have anticholinergic effects.

Officers had gone to the wollstonecraft apartment after receiving calls from neighbors concerned about an apparent domestic violence incident occurring in the unit, cnn reports. When police asked the \" out-of-breath... Flushed \" 32-year-old man who answered the door where the victim was, he said, \" i live alone. \" then, \" it was spider. \" unconvinced, police searched the scene. Sure enough, they ultimately discovered, it was a spider. Police spokesman dean lindley tells abc news: \" after a can of mortein [ insecticide ], i ' m not so sad to report the spider did not make it. \" the species of spider was not disclosed. Still, there were some questions that needed to be answered. After all, according to reports, the apartment was trashed and the man was heard yelling, \" i ' m going to kill you … die, die! \" and a woman was reportedly heard screaming. Per the police's facebook post: police: \" what about the woman screaming? \" male: \" yeah, sorry, that was me; i really, really hate spiders. \" the man's aversion to arachnids may be understandable: some 10,000 species of venomous spiders, including the infamous funnel-web spider, creep around australia.

The earth spins slightly faster or slower on a regular cycle, adding or subtracting milliseconds to our 24-hour day; livescience uses the analogy of a figure skater opening or closing her arms to explain the phenomenon. While it might seem like a miniscule change — especially when earthquakes can basically do the same thing — scientists are stumped as to the cause. The study looked at decades ' worth of data to find the changes occurring in regular intervals, which rules out the sun's energy flux as the source. While the true cause is still a mystery, it must come from inside the earth's core, reports science news. Researchers also found a correlation between the changes and abrupt alterations in our planet's magnetic field known as \" geomagnetic jerks, \" which could help explain that mysterious behavior, too. For now, the findings will help improve the geomagnetic forecasts for mining and drilling.",

        "summary": "For parents of kids with peanut allergies, a new study holds \" lifesaving \" hope. The wall street journal and new york times report on ar101, an experimental drug from aimmune therapeutics that's been shown to ease reactions in kids with peanut allergies. In the oral immunotherapy study published in the new england journal of medicine, researchers gave either ar101 — a powder made of peanut flour — or a placebo to 496 kids with peanut allergies between the ages of 4 and 17. The kids, who initially had allergic reactions to peanut protein in amounts no larger than 100mg, were given increasing doses of ar101 over six months, followed by six months of a \" maintenance \" dose. At the end, when they consumed peanut protein, nearly 70 % of the kids who'd had the ar101 were able to eat at least 600mg of peanut protein without major symptoms; only 4 % in the placebo group could do so. The drug didn't work for everyone, and it's not meant to \" cure \" allergies, just tamp down reactions so kids aren't blindsided by a severe attack. And an nejm editorial notes that \" desensitization was not easy on the patients, \" with 4.3 % of subjects who took ar101 experiencing severe reactions, and 11.6 % withdrawing from the study due to side effects. Also worth noting, per the times: five of the study's authors work for aimmune therapeutics, which sponsored the study; the rest are in paid roles on the firm's scientific advisory board. Still, outside experts are calling ar101 \" potentially lifesaving. \" \" this is not the cure, but it is a good first step, \" the chief medical officer of the food allergy research &amp; education nonprofit says. The company hopes to file for fda approval for ar101 by year's end; a rep says it could come to market by the end of 2019. ( at's peanut powder first made headlines in february. )",

Those who drank two to three cups a day were 18 % less likely to die of those causes, says veronica setiawan, lead author of the study published tuesday in the journal annals of internal medicine. While the study backs up previous research, setiawan notes it's one of the few that shows the association between coffee and a lower mortality risk applies to people of varying ethnicities ( whites, african-americans, latinos, and asians ) and \" gives stronger biological backing to the argument that coffee is good for you. \" a second study of 521,000 people from 10 european countries published tuesday also found the top 25 % of coffee drinkers had a reduced mortality risk of 12 % for men and 7 % for women. This suggests the manner in which coffee is prepared is not key to its benefits, a researcher tells cnn.

In the essay, he takes issue with city officials ' \" well-intended \" pleas for non-violence, given that they come in a city where he says police violence against citizens is the norm. The mayor and police chief still haven't fully explained what happened to freddie gray, which he doesn't think is surprising. They and others demanding non-violence are \" charged with enforcing the very policies that led to gray's death, and yet they can offer no rational justification for gray's death and so they appeal for calm. \" the problem, he writes, is that \" when nonviolence is preached as an attempt to evade the repercussions of political brutality, it betrays itself. \" and \" when nonviolence is preached by the representatives of the state, while the state doles out heaps of violence to its citizens, it reveals itself to be a con. \" he likens the rioting to a forest fire and says it's all about \" disrespect for the hollow law and failed order that so regularly disrespects the community. \" opposing view: at hot air, noah rothman thinks coates is being dangerously irresponsible. \" couched in ersatz-intellectual terms is the justification for nearly all senseless gang-related street violence: subjectively defined violations of an arcane code of respect. \" in agreement: but at the week, marc ambinder thinks coates nailed it. The state's preaching of non-violence \" is a con when state-sanctioned force is not applied with rigorous fairness, without bias, proportionately, and transparently. \" click to read coates ' full essay.",

The 41-year-old queens man was initially jailed on $ 25,000 bail for allegedly attacking an officer who arrested him on suspicion of theft at a retail store on nov. 21, 2014, reports the new york daily news. A week later, prosecutors couldn't get an indictment, and salem was ordered released. First, though, he needed to pay $ 1 bail for each of two other charges of tampering and mischief — and he would have, had he been informed of the change. The algerian native says his lawyer at the time, a legal aid defender, never told him that a $ 2 bill would be enough to set him free — the equivalent of a slice of pizza in new york city, notes the washington post. Salem \" was shocked and dismayed and frustrated that his case was unconscionably mishandled, \" his new lawyers told a hearing. He was finally released in the spring of 2015, but he missed the police assault arraignment in may of that year — and salem blames that on another communication foul-up by his original attorney involving an errant address. Still, the mix-up led to charges of bail jumping, and salem was sent back to jail with bail set at $ 30,000. He remains locked up.

He had been disturbed by the 9/11 attacks, his father explained; he was an \" active participant \" in rescue efforts in new york. Alexis had been getting treatment for these issues from the veterans administration, but the navy hadn't declared him mentally unfit. Had it done so, he'd have lost his security clearance. Other details trickling out include: alexis was kicked out of the navy reserve for a \" pattern of misbehavior, \" one navy official tells the washington post. He was given a \" general discharge, \" which is seen as a reprimand. That misconduct included a 2010 incident in which he fired a gun into his floor. His downstairs neighbor told police she felt threatened, because alexis had previously complained about the noise. Alexis said the gun went off accidentally. The incident got him evicted. Alexis was also arrested in 2008 on a disorderly conduct charge and spent two nights in jail. None of his arrests ever led to a conviction. Authorities say there's no evidence alexis had any ideological motive, or any personal grudge against anyone at the navy yard. A friend does tell cnn that alexis was upset about his pay in his contracting job, believing he hadn't been compensated properly for a months-long assignment in japan. Alexis \" had a gun at all times, \" according to oui suthamtewakul, the owner of the thai restaurant where alexis worked in exchange for free rent. Suthamtewakul considered alexis a friend, and described him as \" a 13-year-old stuck in a 34-year-old's body. \" he was a heavy drinker, and was forward with women. Suthamtewakul also reveals that alexis shot a bullet through the wall of his room last summer. \" you're gonna kill me, \" the landlord told him. Alexis apologized. For more on alexis, click here.",

For about 25 years, they've known that a serum protein is responsible for that immunity. Now scientists have harnessed that protein and hope to save some of the 20,000 people who die from snakebites each year, gizmodo reports. Experts have synthetically manufactured a peptide — a chain of amino acids from the opossum protein, known as the lethal toxin neutralizing factor — that has neutralized bites on mice from diamondback rattlesnakes and the russell's viper of pakistan. \" it appears that the venom protein may bind to the peptide, rendering it no longer toxic, \" lead researcher claire komives explains, per phys.org. What's even more impressive: the antivenom may also offset toxins from other venomous snakes, scorpions, plants, and bacteria, komives adds. Researchers were able to cheaply produce the peptide in e. Coli bacteria, then purify it. Because it was so inexpensive and easy to mass-produce, researchers say the antivenom could be easily distributed to remote areas of india, south america, southeast asia, and africa, where most fatal snakebites occur. Not only that, the antidote doesn't carry the same side effects as other treatments. \" the patient often has some kind of adverse reaction, such as a rash, itching, wheezing, rapid heart rate, fever, or body aches, \" komives says. Not so with the peptide, at least on mice. As such, the antivenom could likely be given in a single dose, rather than several smaller doses, komives says. Cnet reports the antivenom will undergo further testing on mice; it isn't clear when human trials might begin. ( a new antivenom for black widow bites is in the works. )",

        "summary": "Chelsea manning will be released from prison on wednesday, thanks to former president obama's decision to commute the bulk of her 35-year sentence for leaking government secrets. If you were surprised by that decision, you're not alone: as a story in mother jones explains, her legal team was, too. \" we didn't really think it would work, \" says nancy hollander, one of her lawyers. The team, however, felt it had no choice but to try, casting it quite literally as a matter of life or death. The push for commutation came after manning, who has been in prison about six years, attempted suicide in july. \" i was feeling that her life was in jeopardy and she wasn't going to survive much longer, \" says another attorney, chase strangio of the aclu. \" the years of trauma that were building up was such that another year seemed difficult to imagine. \" the story runs through that trauma, detailing manning's ongoing fight to transition to a female while behind bars. She won the right for hormone therapy, along with a promise of sex-reassignment surgery ( which she hasn't had yet ), but lost other battles such as the right to grow her hair long. A un investigator, meanwhile, called her solitary confinement \" cruel, inhuman, and degrading, \" and manning went on a hunger strike. \" i am living through a cycle of anxiety, anger, hopelessness, loss, and depression, \" she wrote obama in her commutation plea. Much to everyone's surprise, it worked. ( a white house spokesman noted that she had apologized, unlike edward snowden. ) when manning is out, she ' ll move to maryland and is expected to be an activist for transgender rights. A crowdfunding campaign has raised more than $ 130,000 for her. ( read the full story. )",

Up to a third of restaurant and grocery-store seafood is labeled incorrectly, the washington post reports. Looking at specific varieties, the figures get even starker: some 94 % of so-called tuna in new york wasn't, the new york times reports, while 87 % of snapper is mislabeled. \"even a relatively educated consumer couldn't look at a whole fish and say, 'i ' m sure that's a red snapper and not lane snapper, ' \" says the study's lead author. The study follows up on a smaller one released in december by activist group oceana. Overall, southern california had the worst labeling record, with 52 % of its fish marked wrong. And the worst venue for wrong labels: sushi restaurants, the study found, at a 95 % rate. In many cases, sushi joints called escolar — or albacore canned tuna — \" white tuna. \" too much of it can cause diarrhea. Odds for consumers are best at grocery stores, where 27 % of the products are mislabeled. In many cases, cheaper fish took the place of more expensive ones.

        "summary": "Social media may make managing friendships logistically easier, but perhaps unsurprisingly, facebook and the like aren't actually helping you grow your circle of true friends. So reports evolutionary psychologist robin dunbar this month in the journal royal society open science, after analyzing research conducted in april and may of 2015 involving 3,375 people ages 18 to 65. While women typically have larger social circles than men, the average number of facebook friends among this sample was 150, reports cnet. But the average number of friends one can truly count on in a crisis is just four — which reflects one's offline numbers, and is remarkably consistent across backgrounds, gender, and age. Dunbar defines several friendship levels, each panning out from the four or five closest friends the average person maintains, reports the washington post. From there, most of us widen the circle of \" sympathy \" friends we feel we can confide in to 15, and widen it again to 50 friends who are \" close. \" most of us can't seem to maintain much more than 150 \" casual \" friends, though, and the typical realm of total acquaintances tops out at 500. Even those with thousands of facebook friends aren't necessarily more social, dunbar concludes: \" respondents who had unusually large networks did not increase the numbers of close friendships they had, but rather added more loosely defined acquaintances into their friendship circle. \" and while social media can help slow the natural rate of \" decay \" that occurs over time, \" that alone may not be sufficient to prevent friendships eventually dying naturally if they are not occasionally reinforced by face-to-face interaction, \" he adds. ( meanwhile, here's why facebook was touting 46-year friendships recently. )",

And for the latter question, robin dunbar found that the answer is largely no, even for social media users who friend others freely. Dunbar, who gave his name to \"dunbar's number \" ( which refers to that 150-person limit on casual friendships for any given individual ) published his findings from a study of 3,000 adults in royal society open science this month. Distribution of network size for the two different samples in this study. ( credit: royal society open science ) \"given the extensive use of social media, the question as to whether internet-based social networking sites have a positive or negative impact on social relationships has been much debated, \" dunbar wrote. \"cyberpessimists have argued that the internet has detrimental effects on our social life. In contrast, cyberoptimists have insisted that the effects have been beneficial in many different ways. \" [ from the archives: an unmanageable circle"

        "summary": "A mexican prosecutor says dna tests on alondra diaz match the us mother who has been searching for her for eight years. Jose martin godoy castro said late yesterday that tests show alondra is the daughter of houston woman dorotea garcia, who has searched for the girl since alondra's father took her to mexico after she was awarded custody of the then 5-year-old. Garcia's search gained international attention last month after judge cinthia elodia mercado ruled that another teenager, 14-year-old alondra luna, was the missing girl and ordered her released to garcia ( the bbc notes the girls share a first name and have a somewhat similar facial scar ). That reunion didn't go well: video recordings circulated widely of alondra luna screaming and desperately resisting police after the court decision. Alondra luna had asked for dna tests in mexico before she was sent to the united states, and her parents presented more than a dozen documents including her baptismal records, family photographs, and a copy of her birth certificate. Elodia mercado said in late april that it was not within her authority to order dna testing. Garcia reunited with her real daughter late tuesday in a courtroom in the western state of michoacan. This bbc reports the real alondra had appeared at the court with her aunt and grandmother a day prior; they said that after her father realized how much media attention was swirling around the case he decided she should go to court. The teen says she's been \" happy with my dad, but at the same time i felt there was something missing. \" ( these moms are also hoping reunions might be possible. )",
