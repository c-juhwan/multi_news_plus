        "summary": "The us in 2009 started work on a thoroughly 21st-century way to attempt to stir unrest in cuba: it concocted a \" cuban twitter \" that it hoped would draw young people that it could prod toward dissent, an ap investigation has found. The text messaging platform, zunzuneo — slang for a cuban hummingbird's tweet — ran until funding ran out in 2012 and amassed 40,000 users during that time. It also collected personal data of users, who were unaware they were using a program funded and created — perhaps illegally, unless the president oked it and congress was notified about it — by the us agency for international development with the intention of getting \" the transition process going again toward democratic change, \" documents show. At the very least, the project contradicts usaid's claims that it doesn't carry out secret operations, and its reputation among foreign governments, to which it delivers aid, could suffer as a result, the ap adds. A memo from one of the creators notes, \" there will be absolutely no mention of united states government involvement... To ensure the success of the mission. \" an estimated $ 1.6 million was spent on the project, though public data showed that money was set aside for a project in pakistan. To further cloak things, creators established a corporation in spain and an operating company in the cayman islands to pay the company's bills so the \" money trail will not trace back to america, \" per a strategy memo; additionally, users ' messages never touched american-based computer servers.

Louis on tuesday night: protesters gathered around a car at an intersection, and the driver eventually pushed through the pack, reports the st. Louis post-dispatch. Police say three people had minor injuries, though all declined medical attention. This tweeted image shows one person on the hood of the vehicle at one point, along with a woman directly in front of the car with her hands on the hood. Another woman at the protest recorded video of the altercation. Police later arrested the driver about a block from the scene because they say he initially refused to stop for a pursuing patrol car. He was charged with felony fleeing, reports abc news. Two different versions of the event have emerged, per the post-dispatch. Police say the driver honked his horn, stopped, and tried to avoid the protesters, who were hitting his vehicle with their hands and a flag pole. Witnesses, however, portray the driver as aggressive and say he raised his middle fingers before pushing through them. The incident is drawing attention given the fatal incident in charlottesville in which a driver plowed into a crowd of protesters and killed heather heyer. The st. Louis protesters had gathered after police fatally shot transgender woman kenny \" kiwi \" herring. Police say herring came at officers with a knife.",

The resolution adopted by a unanimous vote on friday says syria must hold elections within 18 months of the beginning of peace talks, though it doesn't say whether assad will be eligible to run, reports the new york times. Us secretary of state john kerry said there are obviously \" sharp differences within the international community, especially about the future of president assad, \" and it is now clear that failure to allow any compromise on the issue was, \" in fact, prolonging the war, \" the ap reports.

The resolution calls for representatives of the syrian government and the opposition — not including isis and other groups deemed \" terrorist \" — to begin talks in early january, reports the ap. The times notes that resolution says all syrians \" including members of the diaspora, \" should be able to vote, which is a requirement kerry added in the hope that syrians worldwide will vote against the assad regime.",

On friday, she spent her annual news conference dealing with increasing concerns that the us has been spying on german citizens, the new york times reports. \" we are examining what happened, whether this is the tip of the iceberg, or less serious, or something else — what is true, \" she said. But a new report from der spiegel says germany should have some idea of what's true, because it is running nsa spying programs and has actually been increasing its cooperation with us intelligence recently. Der spiegel says it has seen secret us documents showing german intelligence is employing the nsa's xkeyscore program. Xkeyscore allows the agencies to gather all unfiltered data coming from a target's computer for several days, including things like what they have typed into search engines and the content of communications. The nsa accesses up to 500 million data connections from germany a month. In december 2012 alone, 180 million of those came from xkeyscore. The documents also report that germany's foreign intelligence service has recently \" been working to influence the german government to relax interpretation of the privacy laws to provide greater opportunities of intelligence sharing \" and has become the nsa's \" most prolific partner \" for intelligence gathering in afghanistan.",

The painting of fertility god priapus, which survived the eruption of mount vesuvius, depicts a man whose phallus extends nearly to his knees and the fruit basket sitting beside him. But this symbol of procreative energy and male power also contains evidence of a medical condition that can curb fertility and hinder sexual relations, medical doctor francesco maria galassi tells discovery. \" the disproportionate virile member is distinctively characterized by a patent phimosis, more specifically a shut phimosis, \" he says. In other words, priapus ' member seems to have a foreskin that couldn't fully retract: \" it is a condition that causes pain, infection, and problems during sexual intercourse, \" galassi adds, per the local. So why would such a condition be shown in a fertility god? galassi, who describes his theory in urology, says the first-century painter may have wanted to report \" a high prevalence of that anatomic defect in pompeii. \" that could also explain why so many anatomical votive artifacts ( showing a penis with closed foreskin at the top ) were used in pompeii between the second and fourth centuries bc to seek removal of that very condition, according to an expert who writes about votive offerings. This isn't the first time priapus has attracted medical interest, either: one doctor pointed out back in 2007 that priapus was reportedly impotent, so what looks like an erection in the fresco may really be evidence of proteus syndrome, or local gigantism of the penis, forbes reports.

Priapus was a roman god of livestock, fruit, plants, gardens and male genitalia. But according to research by dr francesco galassi, in the fresco, priapus was suffering from a debilitating condition known as phimosis. Phimosis is a medical condition where the foreskin fails to retract from the head of the penis, and its depiction in the fresco could suggest it was a problem that blighted the men of ancient pompeii.

The fresco in question is found in the entrance to the house of the vettii in pompeii, which survived mount vesuvius's eruption in ad 79, and depicts minor roman god priapus and his famously large, erect penis. Priapus was a roman god of livestock, fruit, plants, gardens and male genitalia. But according to research by dr francesco galassi, in the fresco, priapus was suffering from a debilitating condition known as phimosis. Phimosis is a medical condition where the foreskin fails to retract from the head of the penis, and its depiction in the fresco could suggest it was a problem that blighted the men of ancient pompeii. The vettii fresco is notable because in other surviving depictions",
            "According to pompeii's archaeological superintendent, the vases are direct evidence that the workshop was fully active at the moment of the eruption. \" they represent a key element in the study of craft activities in the roman town, \" the superintendent said in a statement. Decorated with small carvings, the vases were used to pour wine or water. The 10 raw clay vases represent a unique finding as they reveal a frozen-in-time picture of the exact moment panicked potters realized they were facing an impending catastrophe. Archaeologists found 10 raw clay vases sealed under a layer of ash and pumice from mount vesuvius'devastating eruption of 79 ad. The vases were dropped and abandoned. Here, a kiln ( left ) and the vases appear ready to be fired ( right ). This fresco of priapus shows the god of fertility suffered from a penis defect. One of pompeii's most",
            "Anyone with a casual knowledge of the romans knows about the various erotic art found at pompeii. From the paintings of sexual acts performed in each room of the brothel to a \" flying phallus \" amulet to a statue of pan copulating with a goat, there is a veritable buffet of images that speak to a culture that used sexuality in a different way than we do. One of those frescoes, of minor god priapus from the house of the vettii, is getting a new interpretation by a medical doctor who has diagnosed a shut phimosis, a condition in which the foreskin cannot be fully retracted over the penis. The fresco in question has an interesting history. It was discovered at the end of the 19th century by archaeologists working in the house of the vettii, a large villa owned by two successful freedmen.

Her parents took her to the doctor when the bleeding wouldn't stop, which led to the diagnosis of a serious kidney disease called juvenile nephronophthisis. \" this kidney disease doesn't get better, \" one of crystal's doctors tells abc news. \" in mid- to late adolescence you either have... To put her on dialysis or you have to [ get her a ] kidney transplant. \" the family opted for the transplant, and mom cristy stepped up first — but screening turned up a spot on her kidney that turned out to be cancer. Then dad mark volunteered, but, incredibly, his screening turned up kidney cancer as well. Both were caught early enough for effective treatment, something that never would have happened if not for their daughter's illness. \" the idea is that we're going to go in and do something that can be lifesaving for our daughter, only to be told,'this may have saved your life, ' because i would never have been tested otherwise, \" says mark. And there's good news about crystal, too: her aunt turned out to be a perfect match, and after successful surgery in april of this year, the now 17-year-old is headed back to high school with a healthy prognosis. The kicker to all this: it turns out that the original nosebleed had nothing to do with crystal's kidney disease, reports cbs news. \" it happened to be a red herring that allowed us to figure this out because of other symptoms at that time, \" says her doctor.

Police say a 48-year-old man was arrested after the vehicle ran into people that had left finsbury park mosque just after midnight, the bbc reports. Witnesses say it was clear that the man was deliberately trying to run people over. \" there were loads of people coming out and the van took a left and went straight into them, \" a worshipper tells the evening standard. \" the crowd caught a guy. He tried to do a london bridge thing. \" at least eight people were injured. Some witnesses said the driver attempted to stab people after the attack, though local hospitals say they are not treating anybody with stab wounds. The van is believed to have been rented in wales. London mayor sadiq khan condemned the attack as an assault on \" innocent londoners, many of whom were finishing prayers during the holy month of ramadan \" — and on \" all our shared values of tolerance, freedom, and respect, \" the guardian reports. Khan said extra police have been deployed to protect communities celebrating ramadan. The new york city police department says it has also sent additional police officers to protect mosques.",

The suicide bombers were actually accompanied by a third female who balked at the last minute for a very personal reason. \" there were three female bombers who entered the camp around 6: 30am disguised as displaced persons, \" the head of the borno state emergency management agency said, per cnn. \" two of them set off their explosives... While the third refused after realizing her parents and siblings were in the camp. \" the third suspect informed military officials that they were sent by boko haram, which was planning on using more females to carry out future attacks. Boko haram has indeed been tapping more women and girls for missions, as well as other methods: the times documents an instance in which a bomb was hid in okra, and attackers have been told to pretend they're mentally ill. Tuesday's bombing is said to be retribution for an attack on a boko haram market by nigerian soldiers, who killed more than 100 boko haram members and liberated up to 1,000 women and girls being held as sex slaves, per the times; those freed were brought to the dikwa camp. Thanks to the efforts of new president muhammadu buhari, forces have driven boko haram out of many outposts, though that hasn't stopped the group from hitting well-populated soft targets. Meanwhile, in neighboring cameroon, a pair of suicide bombers reportedly from nigeria killed 10 and injured 40 at a wake wednesday, per the ap. ( boko haram isn't showing signs of slowing. )",

        "summary": "There's some disagreement about what went down when the washington redskins cheerleading squad traveled to costa rica in 2013. According to the five unnamed women juliet macur spoke to for the new york times, the trip ended up feeling exploitative. They were at the occidental grand papagayo resort for a calendar photo shoot; some of the 36 women were required to take off their tops at times to facilitate the shots, others wore body paint. And the women say they weren't able to model in privacy, but that male redskins suite holders and sponsors were invited to watch. And they allege that one evening, nine of the women were told they had been selected to accompany the men to a club. The women describe their evening as escorts ( no sex was involved ) as \" mandatory \" and said they felt as if the team was \" pimping us out. \" some reportedly cried at the news they had to participate. Macur writes the trip \" provides a vivid illustration of how nfl teams have used cheerleaders for far more than sideline dancers during games, \" particularly as the allegations of discrimination and mistreatment mount. But the women's account is contradicted by both the squad's director and choreographer, stephanie jojokian, and two women who were then squad captains and described the night at the club as unforced and \" just a night of relaxation. \" jojokian tells the times she \" would never put a woman in a situation like that. I actually mentor these women to be strong and to speak up, and it kills me to hear that. \" read the full story here.",

One evening, at the end of a 14-hour day that included posing and dance practices, the squad's director told nine of the 36 cheerleaders that their work was not done.

The men didn't remain on the bus, however, so the driver evacuated her 10 or so passengers, then drove with the bomb alone for about a mile to a less populated area and called police. \" the driver showed immense courage under very difficult circumstances, \" says the regional transportation chief, while a local politician praised her as a \" selfless heroine. \" police were able to deactivate the device before it exploded, describing it as small but viable, reports the bbc. Though no group has claimed responsibility, the ap says ira splinter groups unhappy with the 1998 peace accord continue to wage occasional attacks.

George's school in middletown have said they were abused — raped, in some cases — by seven former staffers and four students between 1974 and 2004, lawyers say. The scandal came to light in december, when st. George's announced it was investigating reports of sex abuse in the ' 70s and ' 80s. The rhode island state police is also investigating the accusations forwarded to the department by the school and the lawyers of the alleged victims, the new york times reports. No one has yet been criminally charged. The school's investigation was prompted by a former student who says she was molested by the school's athletic trainer in 1977 and who finally pushed st. George's to investigate her accusations last year, the boston globe reports. When the school announced its investigation, other alleged victims started coming forward. Four of the accused staff members are still living, and at least two of them may still be working around young people. Lawyers and three of the victims said at a recent news conference that the school downplayed the abuse for years, and st. George's admitted that though it did fire some of the accused, it did not report suspects to the police or relay the accusations to their next employers. Some victims are calling for eric peterson, the head of the school, to step down, accusing him of not taking the reports from alumni seriously. \" eric peterson has been covering this up since 2004, my issue as well as others, \" says one 1982 grad. The alleged victim who finally successfully demanded that the school investigate first tried to sue decades ago, but says she was pressured into dropping the case by the school.

( ap photo/seth wenig ) ( associated press ) the national rifle association broke its silence friday on last week's shooting rampage at a connecticut elementary school that left 26 children and staff dead. The group's top lobbyist, wayne lapierre, said at a washington news conference that \" the next adam lanza, \" the man responsible for last week's mayhem, is planning an attack on another school. \" the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, \" lapierre said. He blamed video games, movies and music videos for exposing children to a violent culture day in and day out. \" in a race to the bottom, many conglomerates compete with one another to shock, violate, and offend every standard of civilized society, by bringing an even more toxic mix of reckless behavior and criminal cruelty right into our homes, \" lapierre said. He refused to take any questions after speaking. Still, though security was tight"

Christie used $ 4.7 million of the federal funds allotted to tourism marketing to produce advertisements. The problem? those ads featured christie and his family — and this during an election year — and cost $ 2.2 million more than the next lowest bidder, whose ads would not have included the christie family. New jersey democratic rep. Frank pallone asked the feds to review, and he tells cnn the audit will take several months. \" this was money that could have directly been used for sandy recovery, \" pallone says. \" and, as you know, many of my constituents still haven't gotten the money that is owed them to rebuild their homes or raze their homes or to help. \" meanwhile, the george washington bridge traffic scandal continues: fort lee mayor mark sokolich initially said he didn't recall christie even asking for an endorsement before the lane closure; but now he tells the new york times he does remember a staffer from christie's re-election campaign making the request; he says he was noncommittal in his response. The wall street journal ( whose source says the staffer was regional political director matt mowers ) adds that another democratic mayor, jersey city's steve fulop, claims he was also \" punished \" for refusing to endorse christie. Fulop says he saw his meetings with several state commissioners suddenly canceled, and has had a hard time scheduling meetings with them since.",

Sokolich, a democrat, would endorse the governor, a republican. There was scant doubt that mr. Christie would win. But his ambition was to win big. He joked that he wanted to eclipse the landslide record held by his mentor, former gov. Thomas h. Kean, who prevailed by 40 points in 1985. His advisers hoped to demonstrate such broad support that mr. Christie would become his party's logical presidential candidate in 2016.

But alaska natives had long called it denali ( which means \" the great one \" or \" the high one \" ) and revered it in the creation story of koyukon athabascans, who have lived in alaska long before the us existed. For decades, alaska has filed a bill every year to change the peak's name to denali and saw the move blocked by legislators in ohio, mckinley's home state.

Mcdonnell and his wife, maureen, are charged in a 14-count indictment with accepting more than $ 165,000 in gifts and loans from williams in exchange for their help promoting his company's products. Williams testified under immunity as the prosecution's star witness, starting late last wednesday and finishing monday. Block will be back on the stand for cross-examination by defense lawyers tuesday."

Per al jazeera, evelyn beatriz hernandez cruz was convicted of \" aggravated homicide, \" accused by prosecutors of not seeking proper prenatal care. Hernandez says she hadn't known she was pregnant until, at the age of 18, she went into labor in a bathroom in april 2016 after severe stomach and back pain; her pregnancy reportedly came about after she'd been raped repeatedly by a gang member. Per the bbc, hernandez's lawyers say she'd been too scared to ever report the rapes to police. She gave birth into a toilet, and prosecutors scoffed at her claims of ignorance, saying she knew about the pregnancy, didn't want the baby, and tried to kill him by tossing him into the toilet after he was born. Medical experts couldn't say for sure if the baby had been born deceased or died just after delivery. El salvador is one of just six countries in the world that don't allow abortions under any circumstances. ( the others are chile, the dominican republic, malta, nicaragua, and vatican city, per the pew research center. ) a parliamentary bill is now in circulation to ease the nation's abortion restrictions, but the bill is currently stuck in a legislative committee. The case is \" a terrifying example of the need for el salvador to urgently repeal its retrograde anti-abortion law, \" says amnesty international in a release.

Ceo rob segal and president james millership have been at the helm of avid life media for three months, notes a tuesday press release, trying to rebrand and rescue the site after the privacy debacle and the resignation of ex-ceo and self-proclaimed \" king of infidelity \" noel biderman, who graham cluley's security site says has \" been busy trying to clean the internet \" of his past association with ashley madison. \" a year ago, avid life media was silenced by a devastating, criminal hack that affected our company and some of our members, \" segal says. \" the company is truly sorry for how people's lives and relationships may have been affected by the criminal theft of personal information. \" some of the \" big changes \" segal notes include a partnership with a deloitte cybersecurity team — whose leader tells reuters they found \" simple backdoors \" into the site's servers — to add privacy and security safeguards, as well as discreet ways to pay. And the ashley madison site itself has seen subtle changes, including an assertion that the site \" today is about so much more than infidelity, it's about all kinds of adult dating. \" as for the ftc probe, avid says it doesn't yet know the specifics, but they're likely to partly revolve around multiple suits for the security breach, as well as for allegations of using \" fembots \" to interact with male users — something security blogger cluley calls the \" greatest irony of all. \" \" some men have had their lives ruined and privacy invaded, when their chances of having an affair were close to zero, because they were speaking to a computer program rather than a flirting female, \" he writes.

Though firefighters put out the blaze, the incident has only added fuel to the fire already burning between the region's israelis and palestinians, the bbc reports. The attack in nablus on joseph's tomb, said to be the burial site of the bible's joseph, 11th son of jacob, involved gas bombs and occurred just hours after benjamin netanyahu implored palestinian leader mahmoud abbas to call for a stop to local violence — and a day before a planned palestinian \" day of rage, \" per usa today. Peter lerner, spokesman for the israel defense forces, called it \" a blatant violation of the basic value of freedom of worship \" in a tweet; israel's agriculture minister called the tomb arson \" unforgivable. \" tensions had already descended into a death spiral, with dozens of deaths from stabbings and shootings in israel over the past month, cnn and the bbc report; at least seven israelis and at least 30 palestinians have been killed. The tomb itself has also been attacked before, including when it was almost decimated by palestinians in 2000. Cnn cites a palestinian official who says the tomb is still standing but part of the compound has burned. Abbas spoke out against \" these kind of acts or any other acts that violate the law and order and offends our culture, religion, and morals, \" per the palestinians ' wafa news group, but israel doesn't plan on letting things lie: lerner tweeted that the \" #idf will bring perpetrators to justice. \"",

        "summary": "Kimberly colt is only 13 years old, but she's already had sexual contact with her uncle dwayne — who is 9 — while her aunt carmen, 8, watched. She can't read or write, because she can barely see or hear, and she doesn't know how to clean her teeth, use toilet paper, or comb her hair. Kimberly is one of 12 children who has been seized in new south wales, australia, in one of the most startling cases of incest and depravity ever reported anywhere. The children range from age 5 to 15, the afp reports, and genetic testing reveals that in 11 cases, their parents are related. They were found with roughly 30 adults, a multi-generational incestuous family — or, as the new zealand herald characterizes it, a \" family cult \" — tracing back to one pair of great-great grandparents, who were brother and sister. Police found the clan last year, after getting reports of children who weren't in school, and the case was so insane that the children's court made the rare move this week of publishing its findings, using the false family name \" colt \" to keep the children anonymous. The story was first reported by news.com.au in excruciating detail. Here are some of those excruciating details, if you can stomach them: the family lived in tents and temporary sheds, moving around frequently to avoid detection. They had no running water, toilets, or showers. The area was littered with exposed electrical wires, chainsaws, and garbage. The children were filthy, diseased, and covered in sores. Most had fungal infections on their feet. In most cases their speech was unintelligible. They were uneducated, and many could not read or count; one 15-year-old had a kindergarten-level learning ability. They had no concept of hygiene, either personal or dental — one boy's teeth were described as \" extensively decayed. \" the inbreeding left many with deformities and disabilities. One girl was described as having dysmorphic features, another boy had misaligned eyes. Children frequently had sex with each other, and with adults. Other specific examples in the report include two sisters sexually touching their three brothers, and in another instance three brothers tying their 8-year-old sister naked to a tree. When girls became pregnant, they would often miscarry on the farm rather than visit a hospital or doctor who might ask questions. A kangaroo was found sleeping on one child's bed. The children apparently habitually mutilated the genitalia of animals. There's far too much to list. For more of the details, see the original",

But rosolie's encounter with the giant snake didn't exactly go down as planned. According to the hollywood reporter, rosolie spent most of the two-hour special searching for an anaconda he first saw years ago, one he believes to be the biggest on earth at at least 25 feet. In his first on-camera encounter with the snake, he jumped on its back but had to jump off when he was dragged into the water. After another encounter during which rosolie grabbed its tail but couldn't hang on, he determined it would be safer to settle for a smaller anaconda. He put on his pig-blood-soaked protective suit, and the snake ( a 20-footer that was already in captivity, according to people ) coiled around him. Then, just as the snake opened its jaws onto rosolie's helmet, he called the whole thing off and was rescued. \" i felt her jaws lock onto my helmet, \" he explained afterward. \" i felt her gurgling and wheezing but then i felt her let go. She got my arm into a position where her force was fully on my exposed arm. I started to feel the blood drain out of my hand and i felt the bone flex, and when i got to the point where i felt like it was going to snap i had to tap out. \" he says he couldn't move and, at one point, couldn't feel his arms; his heart rate went higher than 180. Twitter exploded with complaints after rosolie called off the stunt, us reports, with one viewer noting, \" calling it #eatenalive is like having a show on the food network about cooking a turkey and all they do after 2 hours is preheat the oven. \" but rosolie says he accomplished what he set out to — being eaten alive was just the hook, he explains. \" i wanted to do something to grab people's attention to the plight of the disappearing rainforests, \" he explained earlier this month. \" something completely crazy. \" and, yes, the snake is fine; as for rosolie, he was \" pretty beaten up, \" he tells discovery.

Marcel lehel lazar, better known as \" guccifer, \" says he broke into hillary clinton's \" completely unsecured \" server and it was like \" an open orchid on the internet, \" reports nbc news, which interviewed him in a bucharest jail before his extradition last month. It's not clear why nbc, which notes that lazar didn't provide any evidence to back up his claim, waited so long to disclose the interview. Lazar, who was the first to expose clinton's private email account, is accused of hacking the accounts of political figures such as colin powell and clinton confidant sidney blumenthal, whose aol account he says led him to the clinton server. In a jailhouse interview in virginia, lazar tells fox news that it was easy to access clinton's server — and he detected up to 10 other users on there. He says he didn't have much interest in the content. \" i was not paying attention, \" he says. \" for me, it was not like the hillary clinton server, it was like an email server she and others were using with political voting stuff. \" he says he wants to cooperate with american prosecutors, and he has hidden two gigabytes of information from other hacks that are \" too hot. \" the clinton campaign issued a statement saying his descriptions of the clinton server are inaccurate, and \" it is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims. \" ( those other victims are believed to include \" everyone from high-level military officials to c-list actresses. \" )",

Those cities — chattanooga, tn, and wilson, nc — are already providing unusually fast 1gb-per-second service to residents. Chattanooga's broadband helped trigger a tech boom, and wilson's reached people who were complaining about the quality and cost of time warner service. Now each city wants to expand service into a wider area, the wall street journal reports. Us telecom's lobbyists are urging the fcc not to let cities work around laws designed to protect private broadband companies ( 20 states have such laws, the verge notes ). Us telecom is also arguing in a blog that public broadband has \" a mixed record, with numerous examples of failures \" — and it's true that a group of utah towns had to sell its service to google for $ 1 after failing to make enough money. So, is municipal broadband anti-competitive? cable companies say subsidies give cities an unfair leg up, while cities argue that they are improving competition in their areas.

Insiders say former army soldier omar gonzalez overpowered a secret service officer and ran inside, passing a stairway that leads up a half-flight to the obamas ' home. Gonzalez then ran into the east room, which is used for presidential addresses or receptions, and got taken down by a counter-assault agent. The secret service had said that gonzalez was apprehended at the main entry. Why the security lapse? apparently the white house usher's office had asked that the alarm box near the front entrance be muted, because the boxes were noisy, malfunctioning, and regularly going off. So the secret service officer inside the front door had no time to prepare for gonzalez and was overpowered. Rep. Jason chaffetz, a utah republican, says he plans to grill secret service director julia pierson about the incident at a house committee meeting tomorrow. \" have there been some other serious breaches? absolutely, \" chaffetz tells the new york times — and not all are publicly known, he adds. It's more bad news for the secret service, which apparently bungled its reaction to a white house shooter in 2011.",

Poison has long been named as his possible killer ( along with pancreatitis, a deadly river styx bacterium, typhoid fever... ), but new zealand toxicologist and study co-author dr. Leo schep easily ruled out speedy killers like arsenic, strychnine, and \" other botanical poisons \" like hemlock, discovery news reports, based on what's known about alexander's death: that it came in 323 bc after a 12-day illness, in which he had a fever and eventually lost the ability to speak and walk. Schep now believes veratrum album, a member of the lily family, was the culprit, writing in the journal clinical toxicology that \" veratrum poisoning... May also be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, followed by bradycardia [ a heart-rate below 60 bpm ] and hypotension with severe muscular weakness. Alexander suffered similar features for the duration of his illness. \" the determination also jibes with one written account of his death, with greek historian diodorus noting that pain set in after alexander consumed a large bowl of wine in hercules ' honor. Schep notes the wine would have been \" very bitter, \" but could have been mixed with sweeter wine, reports the herald. But a stanford research scholar sees a problem with the theory: the lack of a mention of intense diarrhea, which is always present with veratrum album poisoning. Even schep admits \" we ' ll never know really \" what killed alexander ( unless, perhaps, his long-lost tomb and remains are discovered. )",

The mystery of why the greek king of macedon, ruler of the largest empire in the ancient world, died at just 32 has baffled historians and scientists for over 2000 years. Some argue that he passed due to natural causes while others believe he was secretly murdered using poison at a celebratory banquet. His death in 323bce came at the palace of nebuchadnezzar ii in babylon after he developed a fever and soon became unable to speak and walk. He was ill for 12 days. Dr leo schep, a toxicologist from new zealand's national poisons centre says it is impossible that poisons such as arsenic were to blame - as cited in some theories - as death would have come too fast. Instead, in his new research, dr schep argues that the most likely culprit was veratrum album, a poisonous plant from the lily family also known as white or false hellebore. Often fermented by the greeks as a herbal treatment for inducing vomiting, importantly, it could account for the 12 days it took for the leader to die.

Measuring 55 feet long and 16 feet wide, the small trade vessel was stocked with 600 amphorae, or vases, packed with sardines and other fish. Further study of the shipwreck revealed that the ancient roman engineers also had built in a hydraulic system that allowed the ship to carry an aquarium with live fish.

But the quiet appears to be over, with israel reporting three rockets fired from gaza, reports ap. Just before the ceasefire expired at 8pm local time ( 1pm edt ), israel agreed to extend it for another four hours, but hamas rejected the idea, reports the jerusalem post. Earlier today, families in gaza emerged from shelters during the 12-hour lull to survey damage, bury their dead, and stock up on supplies. Palestinian authorities announced that the death toll there had exceeded 1,000 in 19 days of bombing, reports the new york times. Among the new victims were at least 18 members of a single family killed in an airstrike just before the truce got underway, reports reuters. Five more israeli soldiers also were killed, bring the army's death to 37, in addition to two civilians and a laborer from thailand killed by bombs launched from gaza. In paris, meanwhile, john kerry and other diplomats worked on a longer-term fix. In a statement, french foreign minister laurent fabius said, \" all of us want to obtain, as quickly as possible, a durable, negotiated ceasefire that responds both to israeli needs in terms of security and to palestinian needs in terms of the social-economic development ( of gaza ) and access to the territory of gaza. \"",

According to courthouse news, kerry earnhardt, the eldest child of racing legend dale earnhardt sr., received a setback in court after his stepmother teresa earnhardt successfully challenged a trademark decision that allowed him to use the family name for his custom home design service. Partnering with schumacher homes, kerry initially licensed the business as \"earnhardt collection \" in 2011, reports espn, and was eventually granted the right to use the name in 2016. But following an appeal by teresa, who has owned the trademark to dale earnhardt's name since his death in 2001 and uses it to market her own merchandise, the us court of appeals ruled that the use of the word \"collection \" must be clarified for kerry to move forward. The judge who issued the ruling said that the trademark board's \"opinion is certainly not a model of clarity \" and believed the board \"did not adequately explain whether ' collection ' was merely descriptive of kei's goods and services. \" but kerry's attorney expressed optimism despite the ruling. In a statement, he wrote that they understood the \"federal circuit's desire to have more clarity \" and said they're \"confident \" the board will determine the name is registrable. Dale earnhardt jr., who has also been to court with teresa over the use of the family name, has publicly come out in support of his half-brother. After the decision, he tweeted, \"this s --- again? damn i hate this for my brother.

Four takes on the speech: only the clintons could give america \" a former president who wants to be first man extolling the virtues of a former first lady who wants to be president, \" writes david maraniss at the washington post. He describes the speech as a \" quiet, rambling, at times touching, at times prosaic love letter, the likes of which no modern convention has ever quite seen or heard. \" libby nelson at vox looks at bill's decision to skip 1998 when recounting their history year by year. Referring to impeachment and the monica lewinsky scandal — which must have been \" one of the more humiliating periods \" of hillary's life — could have seemed \" jarring and graceless \" on a night where she made history, writes nelson. Bill's speech had a lot in common with ann romney's 2012 address, she writes, and it may have contained one allusion to 1998 after all: \" you should elect her because she will never quit when the going gets tough, \" he said. \" she will never quit on you. \" the speech was a \" weedy rambler \" by bill clinton standards, and it suggests he could be an \" awkward surrogate \" on the campaign trail, according to glenn thrush at politico. The speech \" did no damage — and fired up the faithful — but it was a shadow of michelle obama's deeply moving address to the convention the night before, \" he writes, adding that it raised the question of whether bill will \" ever really be comfortable ceding the spotlight to his wife. \" with this speech, \" one of the most liked presidents was charged with humanizing one of the least liked presidential candidates, \" and he \" poured on the estrogen, \" writes maureen dowd at the new york times. \" this was a night a long time coming for the former moot court partners, a night celebrating the promise that animates the clinton partnership: she helped him. She moved to arkansas for him, \" dowd writes, predicting that this speech marks the start of bill \" trying to conjure the halcyon days of clinton peace and prosperity \" as he tries to win over older voters in the south and the rust belt.",

The prize committee applauded the eu's efforts toward peace in europe after world war ii, and called leaders to work together amid the economic crisis, the ap notes. This year's ceremony was more austere than usual, with prize money cut 20 % and fewer chauffeured cars for winners, reuters reports. Protesters in oslo and worldwide voiced opposition to the award. Previous winners, including archbishop desmond tutu, northern ireland's mairead maguire, and argentina's adolfo perez esquivel, said the $ 1.2 million in prize money shouldn't be paid out this year; the eu, they said, uses military power for security, which isn't in keeping with the prize's ideals. Yesterday, hundreds of protesters took to the streets in oslo, chanting, \" the eu is not a worthy winner, \" the new york times reports. Peace activists argued that a prize initially aimed at disarmament shouldn't go to the bloc, while a greek mp said the eu had \" pushed my country and the whole of southern europe back to the middle ages. \"",

        "summary": "Could reporters covering white house goings-on soon be relegated to standing in front of the fence, much like the new york times describes reporters in the 1890s? a report published saturday night by esquire suggested a move of some sort, with three senior transition team officials telling the magazine discussions have been had to move the press corps out of the 49-seat west wing press room and to one of two other nearby locations: the white house conference center, which was used as a temporary press center during a previous press-room revamp, or the executive office building just west of the white house. The announcement surprised those in the journalism arena, fresh off a contentious press conference the president-elect held earlier in the week. Trump's incoming press secretary sean spicer told esquire the topic had been broached but not decided on. \" there's been so much interest in covering a president donald trump, \" he said, attributing a possible move to, among other things, not enough seats to accommodate a growing number of reporters. Another senior official offered a different take, calling the press \" the opposition party \" and noting, \" i want ' em out of the building. We are taking back the press room. \" reince priebus, trump's incoming chief of staff, tried to assuage jittery feelings sunday on this week with george stephanopoulos, noting a move to the eob — \" which, by the way, is the white house \" — had been discussed, and that such a move would offer more access, per abc news. White house correspondents ' association president jeff mason said in a statement that the whca \" [ objects ] strenuously to any move that would shield the president and his advisers from the scrutiny of an on-site white house press corps. \"",

A eurotunnel rep tells cnn that some of the migrants were injured in the monday night incident, and mass attempts to storm the area in calais, northern france, are becoming an almost nightly occurrence. Calais is a key port for sea and land crossings to britain. In recent months, thousands of migrants from eritrea, sudan, and beyond have camped out around the city. Some try to sneak across the english channel by getting on trucks and freight trains. The encampments have soured relations between britain and france, which blame each other for failing to cope with the crisis.

And there's a chance you have been exposed, too, according to a report released tuesday. The environmental working group analyzed epa-ordered samples taken by local water utilities from 2013 to 2015 and found that americans — an estimated 218 million of them — in every single state are being exposed to what the study's authors say are unsafe levels of the probable carcinogen. The unsafe level isn't one that's federally defined, reports the guardian. California scientists want to see 0.02 parts per billion ( ppb ) become the benchmark, but the limit the state ultimately established ( it's the only state to have such a limit, reports cnn ) is 10 ppb. For comparison, new jersey and north carolina scientists think 0.06 ppb is a safe upper limit. The analysis showed that 75 % of the 60,000 water samples had a chromium-6 level of at least 0.03 ppb; it was above 10 ppb in water used by an estimated 7 million americans. The news is gloomiest for phoenix, ariz., where all but one of the 80 water samples taken had an average concentration of 7.853 ppb. Co-author dr. David andrews says exposing the \" broken \" nature of our regulatory system was a motivating factor in conducting the analysis. Of the 81 unregulated contaminants the epa has tested for since 1996, just one, the rocket fuel ingredient perchlorate, has been designated for regulation, though that effort is two years behind schedule. Brockovich's advice: \" superman's not coming. Band together with your community and fight at the local level. \"",

There's so much to unpack that even the myth-busting site snopes has weighed in to set some things straight. A look at the controversy: the story: it says that while prenatal screenings have led to a reduction in down syndrome births in the us and europe, \" few countries have come as close to eradicating down syndrome births as iceland. \" a tweet promoting the story read, \" iceland is on pace to virtually eliminate down syndrome through abortion. \" the screening: the story explains that doctors must inform pregnant women that such screening is available, but it makes clear that women can choose not to have the screening. Roughly 80 % to 85 % of women agree to it, however, and, of those, \" close to 100 % \" choose to have an abortion if they get a positive test for down syndrome, per the story. The outrage: sarah palin, whose son, trig, has down syndrome, likened iceland to nazi germany in an interview with fox news. \" this intolerance for people who may not look like you is so wrong, \" she says.

The deep dive starts with the story of lisandro vega, an ex-worker in an arkansas butterball plant, and through him and others, tidbits are noted about the \" relentless \" pace and how workers in the state — cargill and tyson foods also have an arkansas presence — suffer constant injuries. Workers ice their hands, for example, or even resort to carpal tunnel surgery after their hands harden from \" clawlike \" grips on deboning knives or from pushing around heavy turkey racks. The beginning of the end for vega: when he saw a notice at his huntsville plant in which butterball bragged about how workers in that facility had put in more than 8 million hours without a \" lost-time injury. \" not buying that: the northwest arkansas workers ' justice center, an advocacy group pushing for better working conditions and pay for the 28,000 workers in arkansas ' poultry industry. The nawjc estimates 60 % of arkansas poultry workers have suffered an illness or injury at work. \" if you get hurt, they fire you. If you complain, they fire you, \" the group's organizing director says. Slate also explores how injuries at the plants are underreported to the feds and how insurance companies give workers a hard time on their claims. Meanwhile, a joint statement from the national turkey federation, the national chicken council, and the us poultry and egg association earlier this year stated: \" perhaps more than any other industry, the poultry industry has focused its energies on the prevention of workplace injuries. \" as for vega, he eventually quit because a back injury he'd suffered at work became too painful.

The harley davidson edition truck has 23-inch chrome wheels, a \" crease \" of damage on the passenger side panel, and texas license plate bc50945.

Tonya couch, 48, has now officially been reported missing, cbs news reports. That means she's in a national database for missing persons, and authorities added a note saying she might be with a fugitive, which police will see if they look her up. Anderson said couch did not appear to have any sympathy after killing the victims: \" i said then, we're not through with ethan couch — he's not the kind of person who rehabilitates, who learns his lesson. \" couch missed a probation meeting after a video surfaced that appeared to show him drinking alcohol, and authorities have been looking for him ever since. Anderson said couch was prohibited from drinking as part of his probation, and likely wanted to escape the jail time he could have faced over the video. Couch's mother is divorced from his father, and authorities say couch's father has been cooperating with investigators and told them he hadn't heard from his son or his ex, who lived together, in about two weeks.

But the highest increase was seen in minority children: rates rose almost 70 % in black children ( and 90 % for black girls ) and 60 % in hispanic kids. Overall, almost three-quarters of children diagnosed with adhd live in families earning more than $ 50,000 a year, nbc news reports. \" higher rates of adhd observed in affluent, white families likely represent an effort by these highly educated parents to seek help for their children who may not be fulfilling their expectations for schoolwork, \" notes the study. The lead author says the large jump could be due to parents, teachers, and doctors being more aware of adhd, which is a positive for children who need treatment.

            "In just 10 years the number of children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or adhd, rose dramatically, a large new study suggests. Overall, about 5 percent of nearly 843,000 kids ages 5 to 11 were diagnosed between 2001 and 2010 with the condition that can cause impulsive behavior and trouble concentrating. But during that time, rates of new adhd diagnoses skyrocketed 24 percent – jumping from 2.5 percent in 2001 to 3.1 percent in 2010. That's according to a comprehensive review of medical records for children who were covered by the kaiser permanente southern california health plan. Rates rose most among minority kids during the study period, climbing nearly 70 percent overall in black children, and 60 percent among hispanic youngsters, according the study published in jama pediatrics. Among black girls, adhd rates jumped 90 percent. Rates remained highest in white children, climbing from 4.7 percent to 5.6 percent during the study period. The biggest factor driving this increase may be the heightened awareness of adhd among parents, teachers, and pediatricians, says the study's lead author dr. Darios getahun, a scientist with kaiser permanente. For kids who need help, that's a good thing, getahun says. \"the earlier a diagnosis is made, the earlier we can initiate treatment which leads to a better outcome for the child, \" he",

The apparent rise in diagnoses is likely caused by growing awareness of the condition among parents and doctors, he and other specialists say.

            "In just 10 years the number of children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or adhd, rose dramatically, a large new study suggests. Overall, about 5 percent of nearly 843,000 kids ages 5 to 11 were diagnosed between 2001 and 2010 with the condition that can cause impulsive behavior and trouble concentrating. But during that time, rates of new adhd diagnoses skyrocketed 24 percent – jumping from 2.5 percent in 2001 to 3.1 percent in 2010. That's according to a comprehensive review of medical records for children who were covered by the kaiser permanente southern california health plan. Rates rose most among minority kids during the study period, climbing nearly 70 percent overall in black children, and 60 percent among hispanic youngsters, according the study published in jama pediatrics. Among black girls, adhd rates jumped 90 percent. Rates remained highest in white children, climbing from 4.7 percent to 5.6 percent during the study period. The biggest factor driving this increase may be the heightened awareness of adhd among parents, teachers, and pediatricians, says the study's lead author dr. Darios getahun, a scientist with kaiser permanente. For kids who need help, that's a good thing, getahun says. \"the earlier a diagnosis is made, the earlier we can initiate treatment which leads to a better outcome for the child, \" he",

        "summary": "Ted cruz has plenty of fervent supporters in the tea party movement, but he seems to be emerging as the ultimate villain on capitol hill, even among his own party. The latest wave of criticism stems from earlier this week, when cruz forced a procedural vote on the debt-ceiling hike that required mitch mcconnell, john cornyn, and other republicans to cast votes that could haunt them in the primaries. ( afterward, the wall street journal's editorial page called out cruz's stunt as \"needless drama that helps to explain why republicans remain a minority. \" ) in the washington post, dana milbank blasts cruz for an \" ego trip \" that put his own interests ahead of his party and even the \" nation's solvency. \" cruz, though, seems to revel in it, writes milbank, who describes the scene during the senate vote: \" watching the chaos from the side of the chamber was the man who caused it: cruz, his hands in his pants pockets and a satisfied grin on his face. \" his move drew support, of course, from rand paul and marco rubio, and all three members of this trio \" are mucking up the gears of government in ways that will earn them favorable attention in the primaries, \" writes milbank. But won't cruz and company face payback from party leaders? don't hold your breath, writes kathleen hunter at bloomberg. The old rules and the old modes of punishment — lost committee posts, for example — don't apply anymore, not \" in a political era in which campaign cash flows freely from outside the party machinery and cable outlets offer many ways to grab attention and influence. \"",

        "summary": "A team of investigators who pored over evidence in the jonbenet ramsey murder 20 years after the fact presented its conclusion monday night: brother burke ramsay did it. The scenario laid out by the panel: burke, who was just a shade under 10 at the time, hit his sister in a rage with a flashlight when she stole a piece of his pineapple from a bowl he was snacking on before bed. ( a bowl on the kitchen table and the contents of jonbenet's stomach helped lead to that theory. ) panelists do not think he killed her intentionally, but they were unanimous in asserting that parents john and patsy ramsey then took over and concocted an elaborate fake kidnapping story as a cover-up, reports e! online. The show includes an interview with a former neighbor who said burke had a temper and once hit jonbenet in the face with a golf club. \"if you really, really use your free time to think about this case, you cannot come to a different conclusion, \" renowned forensic pathologist dr. Werner spitz, a member of the panel, tells cbs local. \"it's the boy who did it. \" among other things, the panel is sure that patsy ramsey wrote the unusually long three-page ransom note found in the home. And the supposed stun gun marks on jonbenet? investigators say they more likely came from a piece of track from burke's railroad set, perhaps as he was poking his sister in an attempt to revive her. In part one of the show, the panel replayed the original 911 call, which keeps recording after patsy thinks she has hung up. With enhanced audio, the panel makes the case that burke can be heard speaking to his parents, though he was supposed to have been sleeping. ( burke, meanwhile, tells dr. Phil that it was \" probably some pedophile \" from a beauty pageant who killed his sister, reports people. ( he was seen as \" socially awkward \" in the first part of the interview. )",

Goodwin says he asked trump if he still has confidence in bannon, who is reportedly feuding with trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, jared kushner. And trump didn't exactly disabuse goodwin of the idea that bannon is embattled. In fact, he did quite the opposite. \"i like steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late, \" trump said. \"i had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and i didn't know steve. I ' m my own strategist"

The unusual part? the suspect is his own son. \" words can barely describe how embarrassed, dejected, and hurt my wife, daughters, and i feel right now, \" wrote union city police chief darryl mcallister on facebook after his estranged 18-year-old son, tyrone, was arrested. As the modesto bee reports, surveillance video shows that sahib singh natt was confronted by two young men as he walked at a local park about 6am monday. Natt doesn't speak english and couldn't understand them, notes the washington post, and he attempts to walk around the youths into the street. They follow him, however, and one kicks him to the ground, twice, and spits on him. After the youths walk away, one returns and repeatedly kicks natt, still on the ground. Chief mcallister writes that he helped authorities track down his son, who was arrested with a 16-year-old. Both face charges of attempted robbery, elder abuse, and assault with a deadly weapon, and police are investigating whether hate-crime charges will be added. Natt, meanwhile, was treated and released at a hospital. The attack comes less than a week after another high-profile assault on a sikh man in california's stanislaus county, reports cbs sacramento. Chief mcallister writes that his son began getting into trouble years ago as a juvenile and had \" divorced \" his family. \" violence and hatred is not what we have taught our children, \" he writes, contrasting his son with his two successful grown daughters. \" my stomach has been churning from the moment i learned this news. \"",

The company's lawyers called the ruling \" arbitrary, \" noting that the two miles around the ranch contain more than 100 natural gas wells. \" how do you determine which well caused what, if any, damages? \" but environmentalists called the case a victory: the jury of \" six regular people who knew nothing about fracking were presented with the facts and awarded the victims $ 3 million. It's going to be hard to spin that. \" aruba hasn't decided whether to appeal. ( $ 3 million? better than a pizza. )",

There are sites grouped by religion, such as christianmingle and the jewish-oriented jdate, or time-pressed casual users can swipe to find a match on apps like tinder. ( even disney fans have mousemingle.com. ) but as the new york times reports, the business model behind these sites is rarely a happy marriage. With the exception of companies like match group, which has 51 sites, most of the 4,500 online dating outfits are tiny. While it is cheap to start a dating site, it has \" never been more expensive to grow one, \" says consultant mark brooks. Most traffic is now going to mobile apps that suffer from low advertising revenue, and subscribers who time balk at paying for the service. Take the case of spark networks, owner of 30 sites including jdate. With revenue down 22 % and 55,000 fewer subscribers than in 2012, the company last summer closed its israel office, scaled down, and sold off 16 % of its stock to an investment firm. All the while, the company estimates that 70 % of american jews ( 1 million registered users ) have some contact with jdate or its spinoff, jswipe. \" every jew knows someone who knows someone who met on jdate, \" says one former exec. Online dating execs are split over the industry's future. While spark's brad goldberg thinks users, tired of swiping apps, will want \" deeper interactions, \" a chief strategist at match group foresees tapping users ' accounts on instagram and the like to find their perfect mate. Then again, if match acquires spark, as some predict, the distinction could be moot. \" i bet the world of online dating in 18 months to two years will look completely different than it does today, \" says goldberg.

        "summary": "The number of hearts available to thousands of americans requiring a transplant every year could increase by up to 30 % if a new piece of medical technology developed in massachusetts is approved for use in the us, the mit technology review reports. Transmedics ' organ care system — known as \" heart in a box \" — is a sterile chamber with oxygen, blood, and nutrient supplies that keeps a heart pumping outside the body until it's ready for transplant. Donor hearts typically come from patients who are brain dead but whose circulatory systems are still functioning, explains the review. The problem has always been the shortage of brain-dead patients. The ocs changes that, allowing surgeons to remove hearts from the recently deceased and \" reanimate \" them for transplant — thus opening up a much larger pool of potential donors, notes popular mechanics. In fact, doctors say this could increase the number of donated hearts by 15 % to 30 %. \" cold is the old thing, and warm is the new thing, \" says a transplant surgeon at massachusetts general hospital, referring to the standard practice of cooling a heart once it's taken from a brain-dead donor. The ocs has already been used for 15 successful transplants in australia and the uk, including this 26-year-old's in britain, as highlighted in the huffington post. The device remains under \" critical investigation \" in the us, says the company. A post at smithsonian points to two drawbacks: the devices are expensive for now at $ 250,000 apiece, and they ' ll likely raise ethical questions about when patients should be declared dead. A medical ethicist tell the review it's all the more important for patients and families to have their plans spelled out in advance. ( next up: head transplants? )",
