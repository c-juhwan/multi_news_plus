        "summary": "A \" true legend \" in filmmaking has died at 87. William goldman, who won screenwriting oscars for all the president's men and butch cassidy and the sundance kid, died thursday night at his manhattan home due to complications from colon cancer and pneumonia, per the washington post. Referring to goldman as \" one of the greats, a true legend, \" deadline reports he'd been in ill health for some time, with his condition worsening over the summer. Starting his career as a novelist, goldman wrote his first movie script in the 1960s before adding the princess bride — hard to forget these lines — marathon man, flowers for algernon, a bridge too far, the stepford wives, and many other films to his resume. He also worked on several films without taking a screen credit, per deadline, which relays how he advised silence of the lambs director jonathan demme to cut a huge 8-minute scene from the nearly completed movie. \" it was just an extraordinary difference, an immeasurable improvement, \" demme later said. \" that is william goldman. \" the post calls attention to several other examples of goldman's mastery, including the opening scene of 1966's harper — \" widely considered a masterpiece of screenwriting, revealing depths of character without a single word. \" in addition to writing more than 16 novels, goldman also penned memoirs, including 1983's adventures in the screen trade. ( another legend died this week. )",

            "Updated: i have been informed by friends of the family that william goldman died last night. He was 87. Goldman, who twice won screenwriting oscars for all the president's men and butch cassidy and the sundance kid, passed away last night in his manhattan home, surrounded by family and friends. His health had been failing for some time, and over the summer his condition deteriorated. We will be following this and building out the story today, but i wanted to let deadline readers know straight away. From his scripting work to his books like adventures in the screen trade, goldman is one of the greats, a true legend. Goldman began as a novelist and transitioned to writing scripts with masquerade in 1965. While his greatest hits were the indelible pairing of robert redford with paul newman in the george roy hill-directed butch cassidy and the sundance kid, and redford and dustin hoffman in the alan pakula-directed toppling of president richard nixon drama all the president's men, he wrote the scripts for many other great movies. The list includes the hoffman-starrer marathon man ( goldman also wrote the novel, which made dentist visits even more undesirable ), as well as the princess bride, the stepford wives, the great waldo pepper, a bridge too far, chaplin and misery. He also did a lot of behind the scenes script doctoring without taking a screen credit, as on films that included a few good men and indecent proposal. Beyond that, goldman was a renowned memoirist. His travelogue through the movie business, adventures in the screen trade, was a primer for wannabe screenwriters and for journalists covering them. When i first got to variety about 30 years ago, veteran reporters there told me adventures was the best book to understand the chaos, randomness, the headaches, futility and joy of the movie business. Goldman is probably best known for his apt description of hollywood: \"nobody knows anything. \" i still have the book on my shelf. Fox there will be people better versed to describe the fact that goldman knew more than many, but i will recount an anecdote that the late jonathan demme told me when i did a look back on the 25th anniversary of the making of the silence of the lambs. Demme had the picture locked, and had a friends and family screening of the film before he turned in the cut. One of the attendees was goldman, whom demme didn't know all that well. The following day, goldman called. Well, better to let demme tell it",

The couple had set up sensors and cameras around their garage, whose door they left open; kaarma's wife, janelle pflager, left her purse there \" so they would take it, \" she said, per court documents.

        "summary": "The jerry sandusky trial kicked off today, with, notably, the defense addressing the love letters abc news claims sandusky sent to \" victim four. \" the patriot-news reports that his team has filed a motion to \" provide a fair explanation \" for the alleged letters. The motion states that a psychologist will vouch for the fact that \" the content and nature \" of the letters are in line with what someone with histrionic personality disorder would produce. In other trial news: judge john cleland spent 25 minutes instructing the jury, and addressed concerns about the penn state-heavy pool, describing the jury as \" a cross-section of the citizens of centre county... A jury of the defendant's peers. \" the prosecution showed jurors the photos and first names of eight of the 10 alleged victims — the ones who will, at some point, take the stand. Prosecutor joe mcgettigan called sandusky a \" predatory pedophile \" who did not \" select \" but \" discovered \" his victims via his second mile charity. Mcgettigan gave one example of what is to come: testimony regarding a hotel encounter on a bowl trip in which sandusky allegedly \" began to coerce oral sex \" from an alleged victim. The defense's approach: it told the jury it plans to break down each case individually, revealing that the accusers started singing a new tune after being questioned, changing initial stories of no abuse or \" groping \" to tales of \" all-out sex. \" he also said the accusers \" had a financial interest in pursuing this case. \"",

            "What is histrionic personality disorder? histrionic personality disorder is one of a group of conditions called dramatic personality disorders. People with these disorders have intense, unstable emotions and distorted self-images. For people with histrionic personality disorder, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth. They have an overwhelming desire to be noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention. The word histrionic means \"dramatic or theatrical. \" this disorder is more common in women than in men and usually is evident by early adulthood. What are the symptoms of histrionic personality disorder? in many cases, people with histrionic personality disorder have good social skills; however, they tend to use these skills to manipulate others so that they can be the center of attention.

Souter wrote an unpublished draft dissent against citizens united, the case that opened the door to super pacs; it was an issue dear to his heart, notes richard hasen at slate. The dissent was likely a scathing one: according to a new yorker piece by jeffrey toobin, it \" aired some of the court's dirty laundry. \" toobin writes that \" souter accused the chief justice of violating the court's own procedures to engineer the result he wanted. \" the retired justice may well have been suggesting that the court was breaking a rule prohibiting justices from settling matters neither raised by the parties nor inquired about by the justices. A decision in the case was postponed at the time, perhaps for fear souter's dissent would \" damage the court's credibility, \" according to toobin. There's no rule against releasing souter's papers now that he's retired — and this dissent could provide an excellent weapon against super pacs in an upcoming case on montana's campaign finance laws.

One reviewer claims the filling is the same one used in the marshmallow crispy oreos, but with one major difference: it's bright pink and appears to turn your mouth — and even your dung — bright pink, too. \" my spit looks like pepto-bismol \" hours after eating the cookies, one twitter user complains, per delish. Adds another, \" my roommate ate a whole pack of oreo peeps and left a pink stain in the toilet. \" indeed, some who ate a lot of cookies say the dye turned their feces various shades of pink, from \" bright pink \" to \" reddish-pink, \" reports buzzfeed; buzzfeed employees who ate only one cookie say their bowel movements were no more colorful than usual. While oreo has yet to comment, usa today previously reported that stuffing your face with foods heavy in dyes can produce \" a greater spectrum in your rectal rainbow. \" in 2015, for example, people who ate a halloween-themed burger king whopper with a black bun complained its concentrated dye made their excrement \" as green as the irish countryside. \" a doctor at the time suggested it was nothing to worry about.

We're told he was in the room for 2 hours signing a variety of items, including usc and buffalo bills helmets. The gear will most likely be sold to auctioneers. Now here's the rub. O.j. Owes a whopping $ 100 million to the goldman and brown families -- the original judgment was $ 33.5 mil, but 22 years of interest really adds up. If simpson makes money, it",

We're told the owner of the home is simpson's longtime friend -- a person who even testified for o.j. In the vegas robbery trial. The home is 5 bedrooms, 5.5 baths -- and includes a pool, hot tub and a private putting green area. It's roughly 20 minutes from the vegas strip.

        "summary": "For such an age-old problem, it's gotten surprisingly little scientific study. But now physicists at berkeley think they've figured out why the knots of our shoelaces come untied, reports the bbc. Through slow-motion video, they found that it's a complex combination of stomping ( your foot hitting the ground ) and swinging ( your leg gearing up for the next step ). The forces exerted on the laces are surprisingly high, \" more than twice the g-force astronauts feel during a typical rocket launch, \" in the words of the christian science monitor. And the unraveling happens in two stages: a slow, gradual weakening followed by sudden failure. The scientists say the work has grand implications, but ordinary folks may be more interested in a takeaway noted at science: the research confirms that square knots are better than the familiar \" granny \" knots many people use. \" i've been tying it a new way for about two years now, \" grad student christine gregg, whose running was captured in the video, tells nbc news of her switch to square knots. ( a slew of websites explain how to tie one, and science also directs people to this ted talk. ) the study is published in the proceedings of the royal society a, and researchers say it's \" far from exhaustive \" in that it doesn't take into account factors such as shoelace material. But as for those grand implications: \" when you talk about knotted structures, if you can start to understand the shoelace, then you can apply it to other things, like dna or microstructures, \" says co-author christopher daily-diamond. The study is the \" first step toward understanding why certain knots are better than others, which no one has really done. \" ( another study found that running might actually make knees healthier. )",

            "When it comes down to it, volcanoes spend most of their existence not erupting. If you look at almost any volcano, it might have a bout of eruption for days to months at a time, then go quiet for decades, centuries or more. So when you think about the activity at any given volcano, you should not only concern yourself with what might be happening when the volcano is actually coughing stuff up ( erupting ), but also when, at the surface, things look perfectly calm. There are a number of ways to examine what a volcano was/is doing during these periods of repose. My research is like that of a historian, trying to understand what was going on before eruptions that have already happened. I do this by looking at the evidence of changes in the magmatic system recorded in the crystals that are brought up during an eruption. There",

        "summary": "A new court filing reveals that paul manafort's life in prison apparently isn't all that awful. Federal prosecutors argued wednesday that the financial crimes trial of president trump's former campaign chairman should not be delayed, as manafort's lawyers have argued for. Despite his lawyers saying he spends nearly all of his time in solitary confinement, prosecutors described manafort's living situation as a \" private, self-contained living unit, which is larger than other inmates ' units \" and has its own bathroom and shower, the ap reports. They also revealed that in monitored phone calls from prison, manafort has said he is able to visit with his lawyers every day, has \" all my files like i would at home, \" and is treated like a \" vip, \" politico reports. He also is not required to wear a prison uniform, the washington post reports. Prosecutors were refuting manafort's lawyers ' argument that they can't properly prepare for a trial with their client jailed at the northern neck regional jail in warsaw, virginia, two hours outside washington, dc. Manafort has access to a personal telephone, a personal laptop, and his own workspace where he can meet with his legal team; he's had more than 100 phone calls with his lawyers over the past three weeks and 200 phone calls with other people, they said, and has developed a workaround so he is able to send emails, which prisoners typically are not allowed to do. The judge has ordered manafort moved from his current jail to the city jail closer to the courthouse in alexandria, virginia, but his lawyers argued against that, citing concerns for his safety as well as his ability to adjust to a new jail. On wednesday, the judge upheld the order for manafort to be moved. His trial is scheduled to begin july 25.",

A missing person report for lee bo, a 65-year-old shareholder of causeway bay books, was filed on thursday, just a few months after four of his associates disappeared in china or thailand, per the bbc. All of the missing were involved in publishing or selling literature critical of china, reports reuters. But some say their disappearances are tied to a book purporting to detail the marital affairs of president xi jinping. The book is believed to have been commissioned and perhaps written by swedish national gui minhai, the owner of the publishing house that owns causeway bay books, who was last heard from on oct. 15. \" i can tell you i am really afraid, \" says lee's wife, choi ka-ping, adding her husband appeared to call her from the mainland chinese city of shenzhen after his disappearance. \" he asked me not to make a fuss. That he would get himself out of the situation somehow. He was not able to say more about his circumstances. \" she added lee's return home permit was still at the couple's home. Late monday, hong kong police said choi canceled lee's missing person report after a letter apparently written by him surfaced. \" i have made ( my ) own way back to the mainland in order to cooperate with the investigation, \" it reads, per nbc news. \" it might take a bit of time.

        "summary": "Stories of bowe bergdahl's brutal captivity by the taliban are already well-documented, but it's what was reportedly going through his head before his 2009 disappearance from his afghanistan base that emerged at a hearing last week at joint base san antonio in texas. Specifically, that he didn't feel fellow soldiers were being aggressive enough in going after the taliban and that he had hoped to reach another larger base nearly 20 miles away and \" demand to air his grievances with a general, \" the washington post reports. These revelations came to light based on a senior officer's investigation and extensive interviews with bergdahl, charged with desertion and \" misbehaving before the enemy \" — with maj. Gen. Kenneth dahl concluding jail for bergdahl would be \" inappropriate, \" per the los angeles times. Part of the reason for dahl's assessment: bergdahl was an \" unrealistically idealistic \" soldier who was \" naive \" when he was captured and \" remorseful \" when asked about the soldiers forced to look for him, the los angeles times notes; dahl added that no soldiers died during that search. Dahl said bergdahl — who was raised \" at the edge of the grid \" in idaho — was enamored by things like the \" samurai code, \" which holds that one acts immediately, whatever the consequences, when presented with a \" moral wrong. \" the post has details on a few things about the army that allegedly bothered bergdahl, like the fact that he was told to lock his wall locker to deter thieves. A hearing officer will soon recommend whether bergdahl will be court-martialed.",

He and his fellow soldiers weren't going after the taliban as aggressively as he wanted, and his sense of disillusion added to the disgust for the army that he had begun developing while still in basic training. Looking to make a stand, bergdahl hatched a plan: he would run away from his platoon's tiny outpost in paktika province late on june 29, 2009. He would stay away from the army a day, maybe two, and then reappear about 19 miles away at a larger installation and demand to air his grievances with a general. He knew that the region was crawling with insurgents, but he had \"outsize impressions of his own capabilities, \" according to an investigating officer, and was determined to create enough chaos to get the attention of senior commanders. Those were among the details that emerged in a preliminary hearing here late last week. The soldier, carrying just a disguise, a knife and some provisions, was captured by insurgents by 10 a.m. The following morning, beginning four years and 11 months of captivity and torture by the haqqani network, a group affiliated with the taliban, according to maj.

On friday, an expert who debriefed him described the conditions as the worst endured by any captive since the vietnam war. Bergdahl was freed last year after president obama agreed to release five taliban prisoners, a controversial swap he defended even after the military announced bergdahl would be charged.

Bergdahl was freed last year after president obama agreed to release five taliban prisoners, a controversial swap he defended even after the military announced bergdahl would be charged. Dahl said bergdahl, whom he interviewed for a day and a half as part of his investigation, admitted during the interview that he had been \"young, naive and inexperienced \" at the time of his capture, and was \"truthful \" and \"remorseful \" about endangering fellow soldiers forced to search for him.

Now, the last surviving member of that family has emerged from the wilderness using an emergency satellite phone to ask for help with leg pain. Agafia lykova, 70, was airlifted to a hospital in tashtagol, reports the guardian. The youngest of four, lykova was born in 1945 to parents who were old believers, a sect that broke from the russian orthodox church in the 17th century, reports rt.com. Her father, karp, fled with his wife and then two children in 1936, and they built an existence that radio free europe reports sat a two-week trek from the nearest hamlet, using what little was available — mushrooms, potatoes, a spinning wheel they'd lugged all the way there. Geologists stumbled upon the family's outpost when lykova was in her 30s, and people began to send provisions she'd never seen, such as bread and milk. While she has chosen not to relocate — \" it's scary out there; you can't breathe, \" she's said of the pollution, which she experienced when touring the nation a few years after her discovery — she doesn't resent outside contact. \" i don't know if we would have survived [ without it ], \" she told vice in a 2013 interview. \" we were running out of tools and food. I no longer had any scarves. \" in hard times she survived on tree bark and reportedly ate her own shoes, and her mother, akulina, starved to death in 1961 to allow her children to live. Lykova has been alone since her father died in 1988. She's expected to stay in the hospital for roughly a week, having suffered from cartilage deterioration, reports komsomolskaya pravda.

        "summary": "\" when your dog is staring at you, she may not just be after your sandwich. \" that's how evolutionary anthropologists frame a new study that describes just how powerful a bond humans and dogs share. In two experiments, described in science, both dogs and their owners saw an increase in oxytocin, also known as the \" love hormone, \" just by staring into each other's eyes — the same reaction that occurs when a mother looks at her newborn baby. It's a surprising find considering that domesticated dogs and wolves usually only make eye contact amongst themselves to establish dominance, and the researchers believe it may explain how humans managed to domesticate dogs in the first place. It's possible, they say, that a group of friendly canines looked into the eyes of humans and \" unwittingly tapped into the natural human system designed for parent-child bonding, \" as livescience puts it. Researchers first observed 30 dog owners and their pets and found that after 30 minutes of play, more eye contact between the two during that interaction translated into higher oxytocin levels in both human and canine urine, the los angeles times reports. Such a response was missing in a similar experiment involving wolves and the handlers who'd raised and played with them. In another experiment, researchers sprayed oxytocin into dogs ' noses before a play session. Though there wasn't much response in male dogs, female dogs afterward made more eye contact with their owners, whose own oxytocin levels spiked. \" these results suggest that humans may feel affection for their companion dogs similar to that felt toward human family members, \" a researcher explains, per the telegraph.

Birna brjansdottir had been missing for 8 days, and the afp notes the country reported on little else during that time. Officials are treating it as murder, and a murder most rare: iceland has averaged just 1.8 murders per year ( among a population of 330,000 ) since 2001. Brjansdottir was last seen early on jan. 14, after a night of bar-hopping in reykjavik. Surveillance footage showed her buying a kebab around 5am, and two sailors from greenland, ages 25 and 30, were on wednesday arrested. Police believe she was murdered by the sailors and tossed into the water, reports iceland magazine, which flags two pieces of evidence. Brjansdottir's shoes were found in the port of hafnarfjordur near where the greenlandic trawler polar nanoq had been moored at the time she disappeared. Traces of her blood were found in a kia rio rented by the two sailors from the ship and parked near the dock. The car matched one spotted on surveillance footage near the last known sighting of brjansdottir, per afp. Members of the elite viking squad intercepted the trawler at sea and interrogated the crew. The ship returned to reykjavik and the men were arrested. A third man was released and a fourth remains in custody after cops found a cache of drugs aboard, per maritime executive. Some 725 people participated in the search for brjansdottir, whose cause of death has not been determined.

In his reddit post, axani says he's not looking for anything in return beyond the woman enjoying the trip — not \" companionship, romance, drugs, a trade, or to take selfies with you in front the christmas market in prague. \" elizabeth gallagher wouldn't have to be involved with axani's itinerary ( which includes stops in milan, prague, paris, bangkok, and new delhi ) in any way beyond the flights themselves. But he does stipulate that this elizabeth be \" sane, smart, and ( hopefully ) interesting. \" his story's gone viral and he's already had a few hundred hopeful responses, including from women with similar names or a willingness to change their names. He also leaves the door open to at least some level of companionship by offering to buy \" the first round of vino at jfk. \" \" ultimately, the ticket will literally go to waste if i can't find someone, \" he says in an interview with vice. \" i'd like to think this is my own way of putting some good karma out in the world. \" ( meanwhile, a cop who found $ 120,000 on her drive home from work returned the cash to its rightful owner. )",

The private christian college in missouri announced thursday that its athletic teams will no longer buy nike uniforms and any it has now will be removed, the kansas city star reports. In a statement, college president jerry c. Davis accused nike execs of \" promoting an attitude of division and disrespect toward america \" with the kaepernick campaign. \" if nike is ashamed of america, we are ashamed of them, \" davis said. \" we also believe that those who know what sacrifice is all about are more likely to be wearing a military uniform than an athletic uniform. \" nike, which aired a kaepernick-narrated ad during the nfl season opener, is \" free to campaign as it sees fit, \" just as the college is free \" to ensure that it respects our country and those who truly served and sacrificed, \" says marci linson, the school's vice-president for patriotic activities. President trump also criticized nike and nfl anthem protests thursday. \" i don't like what nike did. I don't think it's appropriate what they did, \" he said before a rally in montana. The ap reports that there were no \" clear-cut protests \" during the season opener, in which the philadelphia eagles beat the atlanta falcons 18-12.

        "summary": "Peter jackson's first hobbit film didn't exactly wow critics. They're not gushing about desolation of smaug either, but most seem to agree that it's an improvement, with more action than its predecessor, and it's boasting a healthy 75 % as of this writing on rotten tomatoes. Here's a taste of what they're saying: \" jackson gets the drama in gear here from the outset with a sense of storytelling that possesses palpable energy and purpose, \" writes todd mccarthy at the hollywood reporter, although \" with prolonged exposure to this tale comes awareness of some of the premise's limitations. \" suspense, for example \" cannot be a factor \" because the elves are immortal, and the dwarves seemingly so. \" you'd think a few dwarves might be sacrificed, but nope, they're all charmed. \" if the first hobbit was a little boring and a lot long, \" the desolation of smaug is a little less long and a little less boring, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone. \" but, oh, that dragon. \" it's all worth it for smaug; jackson works the same wizardry he did on gollum, making the dragon \" a bloody wonder of slithering fright. And benedict cumberbatch gives him a voice to match. \" his scenes \" imbue this bloated 3d movie with a sense of character and purpose. \" \" jrr tolkein would be outraged beyond belief \" at the liberties jackson has taken, writes alex o ' hehir at salon. But \" i ' m kind of ok with it. I mean, introducing a love affair between a rebel elf chick and a hot dwarf dude is so far beyond anything tolkien would ever have countenanced that it amounts to a declaration of independence. This trilogy has become its own thing, \" and that thing is \" a rip-snorting, barrel-riding adventure \" that's pretty fun. But mick lasalle is, um, a little more negative. The movie \" should never have been made, \" he writes at the san francisco chronicle. It \" fails in almost every way, as a story, as an adventure, as a piece of art direction, and as a visual spectacle. \" its colors are drab, its character development missing in action. \" the story is just sitting there waiting while orlando bloom goes through the motions of stabbing various monsters in the head. \"",

After the company announced that it expects to have 1 million fewer us subscribers than projected at the end of the third quarter — 24 million, instead of 25 million — its shares slid about 15 %, reports marketwatch. The big hit is in dvd-only customers: the company now expects to have 2.2 million of those, down from the projected 3 million. It also revised its projection for streaming-only customers down from 22 million to 21.8 million. Considering that netflix had 24.59 million us customers at the end of the second quarter, this means that the pricing changes will result in a net loss of customers of about 500,000, notes tim carmody at wired. \" netflix may have been premature here, \" he adds. \" it doesn't own the streaming business, even in the us.

Netflix also lowered its estimates on video-streaming subscribers to 21.8 million from 22 million, and its dvd-only subscribers to 2.2 million from 3 million.

Following the shooting, a dakota superintendent found chapman's copy of the record in a flower container outside the building. The record was used as evidence against chapman and then returned to the superintendent by the district attorney after it was no longer needed.

The album was sold a second time in 2010 for $ 850,000. The record cover features lennon's signature, chapman's forensically enhanced fingerprints, and a police evidence marker. A spokesman for moments in time who's also an agent for the seller says, \" i have never come across a piece with such provenance; police reports, fingerprint documentation, letters from the district attorney, it goes on and on. \" chapman is serving 20 years to life for second-degree murder and has been denied parole nine times.

        "summary": "Listerine claimed way back in 1879 that its mouthwash could \" cure \" gonorrhea, live science reports. Now a new study published tuesday in sexually transmitted infections gives credence to that claim. Or at least that's what the overly excitable media would have you believe. \" a good gargle before engaging in oral sex may reduce the risk of transmitting the infection to the recipient, \" states forbes ( which notes more research is needed to get rid of that pesky \" may \" ). Researchers had 58 men with gonorrhea in their throats gargle with listerine or saltwater. The men who gargled with mouthwash for a minute were 80 % less likely to test positive for gonorrhea-causing bacteria afterward. But don't get too excited, jezebel warns. Listerine was shown to be far more effective at getting rid of the bacteria around the tonsils than further back in the throat. And because the men were tested after only five minutes, it's unclear how long the effect lasts. It's also unclear if getting rid of gonorrhea-causing bacteria in the throat would do anything to prevent infections elsewhere on the body. While the study concludes that daily gargling may be an important preventative step, lead author eric chow says they \"do not recommend it at any site and certainly not anywhere other than the throat \" as a treatment for gonorrhea. That leaves jezebel with its own conclusion: \" use condoms. \" ( terrifying further reading: gonorrhea may beat all known drugs by 2021. )",

( ap ) — a woman who was stranded in the rugged sierra nevada for nine days while suffering from some broken bones survived by using a water filter to drink from a creek, authorities said. Miyuki harwood, 62, was found saturday morning in a remote area of the sierra national forest after she used a whistle to get the attention of a search and rescue team who were looking for her, fresno county sheriff margaret mims said at a news conference. Harwood was airlifted to a hospital to treat an unspecified injury sustained on aug. 20 when she got separated from a group of hikers near horsehead lake, about 100 miles northwest of fresno. She was listed in stable condition, the sheriff said after meeting harwood at her hospital bed. \" her voice was strong. She was extremely thankful that people were looking for her, \" mims said. Harwood, of folsom, calif., was the focus of an intense search involving several law enforcement agencies after she got lost in the mountains. She broke some bones and couldn't hike back to her base camp, mims said. She also had very little food and supplies because she was carrying just enough for a day trip. To survive, harwood crawled for about two days from where she was injured to a creek where she could scoop",

One example involves reproduction, because inflammation is behind multiple issues — such as pelvic inflammatory disease and polycystic ovary syndrome — that increase a woman's risk of infertility. So can managing inflammation improve those women's chances of getting pregnant? researchers at the national institutes of health set out to find out, and though they say more research is required to confirm their findings, the early answer appears to be yes, at least in certain women. Reporting in the journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism, researchers studied more than 1,200 women between 18 and 40 who'd suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth. They were assigned at random to take either a low dose of aspirin ( 81mg ) every day or a placebo for six menstrual cycles as they tried to conceive; if they became pregnant, they kept taking it through week 36, reports live science. Measuring inflammation by looking at a key marker, c-reactive protein ( crp ), they found that aspirin lowered inflammation in the women with the highest crp levels, and their live-birth rate was 59 %, compared to 44 % of women taking the placebo who had the highest levels — that's a 34 % increase.

Authorities say the robbers entered the mcdonald's and one fired a shotgun into the air before demanding money. The afp reports the special forces soldiers didn't do anything during the robbery so as not to endanger civilians. But as the robbers were leaving with nearly $ 2,300, one of them tripped. The soldiers took the opportunity to restrain him then shot his partner who allegedly refused to drop the gun he was pointing at the soldiers. Both men were arrested on suspicion of armed robbery and violence. No one but the suspects was harmed during the incident.",

During the hearings, democrats called for price to be investigated for health care stock trades he made while serving in congress and worked on health care legislation that could have affected the companies involved, though price insisted that the trades were lawful and many of them had been made by his broker without his knowledge. Bharara's office is also investigating allegations involving fox news and, since the district includes trump tower, has been urged to look into payments president trump received from foreign government, propublica notes. Bharara's firing raised more eyebrows than the dismissal of scores of other us attorneys because trump had asked him to stay on, the new york daily news reports. After his firing, bharara hinted at corruption, tweeting that he now knows \" what the moreland commission must have felt like. \" he was referring to an anti-corruption commission launched by gov.

On the topic of bin laden, mohammed blames obama — \" the head of the snake \" — for throwing the former al qaeda leader's body into the ocean instead of burying it or returning it to his family. Mohammed also attacks drone strikes, cnn, fox, \" the jewish community of brooklyn, \" the cia, the fbi, \" the followers of jerry falwell, \" and more. Mohammed was captured in pakistan in 2003 and is currently being held at guantanamo, cbs news reports. He confessed to plotting 9/11 while under interrogation in 2007.",

The feb. 13 protest was organized by several conservative activist groups and attended by two us congressmen, ed royce and gary miller, according to jezebel. The \"terrorist \" event they were protesting? a fundraiser for women's shelters and the homeless. As families, many containing small children, filed into the fundraiser, protesters screamed insults at them. Here are some of the harshest, picked out by good: \" you beat your women and you rape your children! \" \" why don't you go beat up your wife like you do every night? maybe you ought to go have sex with a nine-year-old, and marry her! \" \" muhammad was a child molester! muhammad was a pervert! muhammad was a fraud! muhammad was a false prophet! \" \" what's going on over there right now — make no bones about it — that is pure, unadulterated evil. \" \" i know quite a few marines who would be very happy to help these terrorists to an early meeting in paradise. \" the orange county register covered the event when it first occurred. Protesters told the paper that the group organizing the fundraiser, the islamic circle of north america, supported hezbollah and hamas — something the icna vigorously denied. Many in the crowd expressed concerns about two keynote speakers: imam siraj wahhaj, who was named as one of 169 co-conspirators in the 1993 world trade center bombing but never charged; and amir abdel malik ali, who once said he supported hezbollah.",

Why? perhaps because when a lot of people see you making your commitment, you're more likely to work to keep it, say researchers. Their new study finds that couples who had at least 150 guests were 52 % more likely to have a high-quality marriage than those who had 50 or fewer guests. \" note, however, this finding is not about spending lots of money on a wedding party — it's about having a good number of friends and family in your corner, \" a sociology professor from the university of virginia tells the christian post. Researchers based their work on a survey of 418 people aged under 40 at the study's start, the los angeles times reports. The study used questions on \" marital happiness, confiding in one another, believing things are going well in the relationship, and thoughts of divorce \" to define high-quality marriages. Some findings: history matters: those with fewer sexual partners prior to marriage had higher survey scores than did those with more partners. \" more experience may increase one's awareness of alternative partners, \" the researchers say. \" a strong sense of alternatives is believed to make it harder to maintain commitment to, and satisfaction with, what one already has. \" don't slide: \" sliding \" into big transitions \" like having sex, moving in together, having a child, and, of course, getting married \" was linked to weaker relationships, researcher scott stanley explains on youtube. \" sliding, \" he says, refers to simply \" letting ( an event ) happen, \" whereas \" deciding \" refers to making a conscious choice about the transition, the study explains. Those who casually decide to move in together may find it more difficult to get out of a so-so relationship down the road and wind up \" sliding \" into a so-so marriage, the study says.

The report makes three key points: 1 – what happens in vegas doesn't always stay in vegas. In other words, past relationship experiences — and their consequences — are linked to future marital quality. For instance, men and women who had a child before marriage are less likely to enjoy a high-quality marriage. 2 – sliding versus deciding. Couples who make intentional decisions regarding \"major relationship transitions \" are more likely to flourish than those who slide through transitions. For instance, among those who"

He's \" fully convincing and frightening. \" overall, it's \" one of his best \" performances. You certainly can't fault the acting, writes moira macdonald at the seattle times. Benedict cumberbatch and dakota johnson each deliver alongside depp. But the film \" never quite seems to build to a peak, \" she says. \" it's one of those movies that you don't exactly enjoy ( so many guns, so many deaths ), but you appreciate for its craft and tension, and for its cast's willingness to lose themselves in the darkness. \" scott foundas agrees with mccarthy.

Itasca county sheriff's office volunteer divers followed up on a long-running rumor last month, plunging 238 feet into an underwater mine pit near grand rapids seeking the stolen shoes, which were said to be in a sealed and weighted tupperware container. No slippers were surfaced, though the duluth news tribune reported a duffel bag and tin can were found and turned over to police. The pair is one of four known sets of slippers designed for the 1939 film, including one acquired for a planned academy of motion pictures arts &amp; sciences museum, and one being shown at the smithsonian institute, vanity fair reports. Neat factoid: silver in l. Frank baum's original oz books, the shoes were written red in the script to benefit from a cool new thing called technicolor.

            "Audio: palin considering senate run in alaska in 2014? posted at 8: 01 pm on july 9, 2013 by allahpundit via sarahnet, something newsy from today's hannity radio show. The key bit comes from 9: 34 to 11: 19, or, if you prefer, newsbusters has a partial transcript. My sense after listening to this is that she's giving an answer similar to the one allen west gave when he was asked recently if he'd primary rubio in 2016. If you're a young former officeholder with a base of loyal supporters, you have no incentive to rule out running for something when someone asks if you might, whatever your true feelings about it are. The prospect of west or palin or anyone else jumping back in to restart their political career by challenging an incumbent adds extra media weight to their thoughts of the day. They have every reason to keep hope alive, even if they're reluctant to the point of ( almost ) ruling it out. E.g., at one point here she refers to running for senate as something one might have to do to help the cause \"even if perhaps it's something that doesn't look necessarily"

Counterterrorism police are investigating the unexplained death \" as a precaution because of associations that the man is believed to have had. \" the telegraph calls berezovsky, who opposed putin and also died in unexplained circumstances in the uk in 2013, putin's \" arch enemy \"; glushkov and other friends insisted putin ordered his murder. The paper calls glushkov berezovsky's \" closest aide \"; in the ' 90s he was a director at berezovsky's car company as well as the state airline aeroflot. Glushkov, variously reported as 68 or 69, left russia for the uk, where he was ultimately granted political asylum, after berezovsky fell out with putin and left for the uk himself. After berezovsky's exit, glushkov was charged with money laundering and fraud and spent five years in jail. He left for the uk out of fear he'd be arrested again; he denied all the charges against him. The guardian has much more on that period of his life. Glushkov's death comes eight days after the poisoning of russian double agent sergei skripal, but authorities say there is no evidence the two incidents are connected. In the skripal case, reuters reports britain gave russia a deadline of midnight tuesday to explain how a russian nerve agent was used against him, but russia has pledged not to do so until samples of the nerve agent are handed over. President trump tuesday expressed support for britain, saying if the us \" agrees \" with the facts, \" we will condemn russia or whoever it may be. \"",

He was rushed to massachusetts general, where a crack medical team saved his life by performing an emergency tracheotomy ( he couldn't breathe with a hemorrhage pressing on his windpipe ) and restarting his heart three times. When he came to — plugged into machines, unable to speak or breath well — he began 11 days at the hospital's top-notch intensive care unit and a month at the so-so spaulding rehabilitation hospital. Through a haze of pain, sleepless nights, and his family's comforting presence, relman, a senior harvard physician, witnessed \" the current state of medical care in the us \": anonymous doctors come and go, giving cursory exams and walking off to fiddle on computers — when you really need a primary physician to take charge, preferably your own. The us has a growing lack of primary care physicians, which makes hospitalization fragmented and scary for patients. What personal care you get comes mostly from nurses. \" i had never before understood how much good nursing care contributes to patients'safety and comfort, especially when they are very sick or disabled. \" health care is — surprise, surprise — expensive. The two hospitals charged his harvard-faculty insurer $ 478,000, much of which wasn't itemized. The insurer balked and paid only $ 332,000. Now he's back home with his wife, walking gingerly on a cane but feeling better — and living up to a note he scrawled his wife in the hospital: \" i intend to hang around for a while longer, to love and bother you. \" ( and he's not alone: people are recovering even from broken-neck paralysis, an expert tells the union leader, and the guardian reports on a top world swimmer who continued to thrive after breaking her neck ).

Even on nights when \" windowless \" workers hadn't been at the office, they still got less sleep. Another odd finding: workers with windows actually got more light exposure even when they weren't at work.
