        "summary": "New zealand just joined a very exclusive club, shared by only 10 others. According to the deccan chronicle, private company rocket lab's 56-foot test craft, electron, blasted off from its facility on the mahia peninsula, located on the east coast of the north island, adding new zealand to the small list of countries capable of launching rockets into space. Cnet reports that due to less-than-ideal weather conditions, the launch took place halfway through a 10-day launch window. The country's economic development minister celebrated the news, noting that new zealand, which recently added $ 10.5 million to its newly formed space program, is \" now one of 11 countries able to launch satellites into space from their own territory and the first to launch from a fully private orbital launch range. \" partnering with a private company adds an interesting component to the future of space travel. \" in the past, it's been countries that go to space, not companies, \" says rocket lab founder peter beck, per the chronicle, which notes the move opens the way to space for private businesses in a way not possible before. Rocket lab designed the nimble, disposable electron in just four years to carry small satellites that can provide services like affordable internet. Features include an engine built with 3d-printed and battery-juiced components, and a smaller size that allows for faster, more frequent flights, reports wired. The company plans to analyze the data from electron's flight to learn more about the launch and how future flights from its new zealand base can be improved.",

It alerted the country's rescue co-ordination centre, but three sub-zero nights passed before anyone was able to reach 29-year-old terry harch, a lieutenant with the australian army who was on leave. Radio new zealand explains that fierce winds and low cloud cover prevented a rescue from being staged on mount aspiring, where harch ended up spending nearly a week amidst snow and winds in excess of 35mph, reports the bbc. The mission coordinator said it was \" extraordinary \" that harch was able to stand and wave at the helicopter that sighted him; doubly so, he suffered only \" slight frostbite. \" harch's sleeping bag and food had been found at a lower elevation, so rescuers used skis to bring him a tent, clothes, and food on thursday, reports news.com.au. He was taken off the mountain friday during a break in the weather, in what a rep for the rescue center calls an operation \" bigger than ben-hur. \" rescue officer geoff lunt says officials believe harch \" dug himself a snow dug-out shelter and that's helped in his survivability over these last few days.... He has clearly made some good decisions, \" lunt tells the otago daily times. Though attempting to climb aspiring at all may not have been one of them. A professional guide tells the paper \" the ways to climb mt aspiring in winter all involve steep slopes which can be dangerous avalanche slopes. Typically, the avalanche danger is too high so most people don't climb at this time of year. \"",

The findings are based on an analysis of the dna of 450 people from geographically diverse locations. Researchers compared y-chromosome dna, which is inherited only from our male forebearers, with mitochondrial dna, which comes from women, pacific standard reports. Such analysis can show experts our numbers of male and female ancestors, and the mystery here is why these ancient numbers are so out of whack. \" it wasn't like there was a mass death of males, \" says melissa wilson sayres of arizona state university. \" they were there, so what were they doing? \" her team has suggested that perhaps a few males accumulated a great deal of wealth, pushing out others when it came to reproduction. As danielle paquette puts it at the washington post, \" survival of the fittest might have actually been survival of the richest. \" this would have occurred after the dawn of agriculture, suggesting that the top male reproducers were essentially the best farmers. Amanda marcotte writes at slate that the findings would seem to run counter to the thinking of evolutionary biologists who believe our nature was defined during the earlier hunter-gatherer period of cavemen. She's also glad that an age in which a few men got all the women is long gone. \" that sounds terrible for both men and women. \" ( other recent evolutionary research examines why men like curvy women. )",

( jan. 29 ) ap a growing number of democrats say they plan to boycott president trump's first state of the union address. The members are citing objections to trump's rhetoric and politics, with several pointing specifically to reports this month that trump questioned why the u.s. Accepts so many immigrants from \"s --- hole countries \" in africa and said the u.s. Didn't need more people from haiti. While more than 60 democrats skipped trump's inauguration, most will attend the address on tuesday, using the event and their guest selections to highlight concerns about immigration, health, gun violence prevention and sexual misconduct.

        "summary": "Lots of stories of late have reported that the fbi was investigating ties between \" trump associates \" and russia, and now there's a definitive name: carter page. He served as a foreign policy adviser to the campaign, and the washington post reports that the fbi obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor his communications. The warrant came from the foreign intelligence surveillance court, which handles the most sensitive intelligence cases. The newspaper's takeaway: \" this is the clearest evidence so far that the fbi had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a trump campaign adviser was in touch with russian agents. \" carter, who used to work as an investment banker in moscow, has not been charged with or even accused of any crimes, and he ridiculed the warrant. \"this confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance, \" he said. \"i have nothing to hide. \" the atlantic notes that while the warrant could buttress trump's claims that the obama administration spied on his campaign, it carries a big downside for trump, too. Because in order to get the warrant, the fbi and the justice department would have had to make a decent case that page was acting as an agent for a foreign power. Page's name is a familiar one in regard to the trump-russia stories, but he first came to the attention of the feds in 2013, before the campaign, because of his contacts with a russian spy suspect. Buzzfeed has details of the transcripts that surfaced from that case. At one point, the russian tells one of his counterparts, \" you promise a favor for a favor. You get the documents from him and tell him to go f --- himself. \"",

The adviser, carter page, met with a russian intelligence operative named victor podobnyy, who was later charged by the us government alongside two others for acting as unregistered agents of a foreign government. The charges, filed in january 2015, came after federal investigators busted a russian spy ring that was seeking information on us sanctions as well as efforts to develop alternative energy.

Live science reports a german bus driver suffered permanent eye damage when a child bounced a toy laser off his rearview mirror and directly into his right eye from approximately 50 feet away. It must have been a one-in-a-million shot, as it's the first-ever reported case of someone being injured by the laser from a child's toy, say doctors in a report published in bmj case reports. \" the safety of laser pointers is a major public health issue, \" the report states, adding that they should be off limits to kids. The driver had blurry vision for six months before finally going to an eye doctor, who discovered he had a \" subtle \" injury to his retina. The injury affects the center of the driver's field of vision, and not much can be done to fix it. If hit at the right angle, lasers can cause small burns when they are absorbed by \" pigmented structures \" in the retina, according to live science. The bus driver apparently increased his likelihood of injury by looking in the rearview mirror multiple times to figure out who was shining a laser around. The incident left the authors of the report with one conclusion: \" laser pointers of any class should not be made available to children because they are unlikely to understand the risks of such lasers when using them in play. \" ( someone in new jersey just can't stop shining lasers at airplanes. )",

For one thing, lara is subjected to a beating and attempted rape, the latter generally a \" lazy shorthand that allows a writer to paint a bad guy as particularly bad, and a woman as particularly vulnerable. \" it's a shame, writes hamilton, because lara — despite her gravity-defying bosom — has evolved into an interesting, tough female character and the new story line demeans her. She needs this history to explain her actions? one executive producer explains that game designers want players to \" root for her in a way that you might not root for a male character. \" they want players to protect lara, instead of just playing the game via her avatar. \" it's hard to see that as anything other than a sexist approach, an assumption that men can't lose themselves in stories with female protagonists and/or that female gamers simply don't exist, \" writes hamilton. Adds tom mendelsohn at the independent: \" this is weak storytelling; women, being people too, can have their personalities and motivations shaped through avenues other than their genitals. \"",

By putting his head on mount rushmore, a dollar bill, and a horse, the defendants labeled mosslmani a \" ridiculous person \" and \" hideously ugly, \" his lawyers say, per the sydney morning herald. In a preliminary judgment, however, judge judith gibson says there's no evidence the outlets implied mosslmani was ugly. The news articles \" make the point that the plaintiff's striking mullet haircut has generated a great deal of interest on the internet, most of it humorous, and some of it in the form of clever observations, \" gibson says, specifically pointing to one meme in particular, per mashable. \" the closest any such picture gets to suggesting there is anything unattractive … in the plaintiff's appearance is the photograph where a skunk has been added to the plaintiff's head. \" she adds that thousands of people liked the memes, suggesting viewers were actually fans, reports the guardian.

This month, the vivid substance — called yinmn, after the elements yttrium, indium and manganese that compose it — is finally commercially available as paint. Some artists and conservators have already started experimenting with it. Yinmn was created by oregon state university chemistry professor mas subramanian and his students in 2009, the byproduct of heating mixed manganese oxide and other substances in a 2,000 ° f furnace. They were testing materials for applications in circuit boards and semiconductors when one of their samples came out a vivid blue. \"it was serendipity, actually; a happy, accidental discovery, \" subramanian said in a blog post that november. \"we were exploring manganese oxides for some interesting electronic properties they have, something that can be both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic at the same time. Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment. \" but after stumbling upon yinmn, subramanian quickly recognized its potential value. Mas subramanian ( karl massdam/oregon state university ) described by new york magazine as \"part neon-blue and two parts cookie monster, \" yinmn recalls artist yves klein's signature cobalt hue and numerous shades of indigo, ultramarine and royal blue on the spectrum. While the same shade could be created in other ways,"

The gop nominee, in an interview conducted wednesday while he kept one eye on convention goings-on, told the new york times that in the case of an event like russia attacking a baltic state, the alliance would only be honored once he had determined whether nations under attack have \" fulfilled their obligations to us. \" he said that until we \" fix our own mess \" in the us, there's no way he would lecture allies like turkey about human rights issues like the post-coup purges. \" look at what is happening in our country, \" he said. \" how are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood? \" in what the times sees as a preview of thursday's convention speech, trump used the \" america first \" slogan when he spoke of withdrawing from nafta if better terms can't be negotiated with canada and mexico and of bringing american troops home from around the world. \" we are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $ 800 billion, \" he said, citing his figures for us trade losses. The us has been pressuring its european allies to spend more on defense, but \" never has there been a suggestion that the us would renege on its responsibilities, \" notes jonathan marcus at the bbc, who predicts that america's nato allies will see trump's remarks as \" at best eccentric and at worst alarming. \" trump also spoke to the times about the rnc, saying he's glad that the melania plagiarism controversy is dying down and that he hopes the big takeaway from the convention will be \" the fact that i ' m very well liked. \"",

Many republicans already fear a loss in the general election, which will \" unleash a gop apocalypse on november 7 — followed by an epic struggle between the regulars and red-hots to refashion the party. \" how that plays out will depend on who wins the nomination, and right now it boils down to mitt romney or rick santorum. If romney gets the nod and loses to obama, expect the party to shift even more to the populist right — think a resurgent sarah palin. But if santorum wins the nomination and then gets trounced by obama, the \" populist, culture-warrior \" movement would be repudiated. The gop might return to its senses under leaders such as mitch daniels or jeb bush, and the nation would be better served with \" two credible governing parties \" instead of the current mess, writes heilemann. \" which is why all people of common sense and goodwill might consider, in the days ahead, adopting a slogan that may strike them as odd, perverse, or even demented: go, rick, go. \" read his full column here.",

Last year, south korean soldiers shot and killed a man with a south korean passport who officials said ignored warnings to return the south after trying to go to north korea via a river that runs through the border.

Kimbal musk ( yes, he's elon's brother ) wants to give people a fast food joint that's both affordable and healthy. This august, he ' ll open a restaurant in memphis, tennessee where food costs $ 5 or less, he tells tech insider. Called the kitchenette, the grab-and-go restaurant will serve mainly sandwiches, soups, and salads. The menu is still being finalized, but musk hopes to offer options at a truly affordable price. The first kitchenette location will live in the visitor's center at shelby farms park, a 4,500-acre urban park and conservancy. Inside, the kitchenette will look similar to a coffee shop, with a counter and a few tables. After people grab their grub, they can eat it on the patio or the park's giant lawn in front.

But these places are still pretty expensive: depending on where you live, meals can cost upwards of $ 10. Kimbal musk ( yes, he's elon's brother ) wants to give people a fast food joint that's both affordable and healthy. This august, he ' ll open a restaurant in memphis, tennessee where food costs $ 5 or less, he tells tech insider. Called the kitchenette, the grab-and-go restaurant will serve mainly sandwiches, soups, and salads. The menu is still being finalized, but musk hopes to offer options at a truly affordable price. The first kitchenette location will live in the visitor's center at shelby farms park, a 4,500-acre urban park and conservancy. Inside, the kitchenette will look similar to a coffee shop, with a counter and a few tables. After people grab their grub, they can eat it on the patio or the park's giant lawn in front. Musk hopes to launch more locations within memphis and eventually nationwide, though there are no firm plans yet. Before musk worked in food, he worked in silicon valley",

' \" quartz rounds up various explanations, including this one from an aficionado: \"it's like a cappuccino, except that instead of a top layer of flavorless, airy, milky foam, it's a velvety, dense foam that is mixed evenly through the drink. \" flat whites have been popular overseas for years, with both australia and new zealand claiming credit for inventing the drink.

That would be enough to give obama missouri and arizona, which he lost in 2008, and to hang on to several must-win states such as florida, ohio, and michigan. \" at a minimum, a paul candidacy would force the republican nominee to spend time and money in places he otherwise might be able to economize both. \" ( will is not the only one who thinks paul could make a third-party run — brett budowsky says in the hill that most people are underestimating paul's support and organization, and he thinks speculation will begin hitting the front pages soon. )",

And truman won despite two splinter candidacies from his party — those of former vice president henry wallace on the left and south carolina gov. Strom thurmond on the right.

The daily published a picture of kun kun watching his grandfather sign the petition before the child \" raced home, climbed into bed, and laid there wordlessly. \" local authorities who got wind of the petition say they want to \" conduct ideological education \" to get kun kun's community to respect and accept him; they also are trying to find a group to take kun kun in, as his grandparents say they are elderly and in poor health.

According to a university of michigan cs mott children's hospital survey, more than half of mothers and a third of fathers share plenty of information about their children on social media, as well as seeking parenting advice. The researchers say online support networks can be very helpful for parents, but most parents say they know people guilty of \" over-sharenting \" by posting inappropriate photos and other items that could embarrass their children later in life, or information that could reveal their child's location to online predators, the washington post reports. The researchers, who surveyed more than 500 parents, warn that putting too much information online can provide fodder for cyberbullies and \" digital kidnappers \" who pull photos of children from the internet and pretend they are their own. \" there's potential for the line between sharing and oversharing to get blurred, \" the lead researcher says in a press release. \" parents may share information that their child finds embarrassing or too personal when they're older but once it's out there, it's hard to undo. The child won't have much control over where it ends up or who sees it. \" ( facebook released guidelines this week on which nude photos are ok. )",

Some arby's locations had as few as 70 venison sandwiches on hand, and an executive blames \" the pr storm \" ahead of the sandwich's release for how quickly supplies went, despite a limit of two per customer, the minneapolis star tribune reports. It's unclear if more venison sandwiches are on the way, as there may not be a venison supply big enough to meet arby's needs. So did the chain's foray into deer meat warrant the ridiculous demand? not exactly, according to the star tribune's rick nelson, who was lucky enough to nab one of the sandwiches. \" the predominant flavor... Was the peppery/sweet punch of arby's sauce.

Kissinger shared the 1973 nobel peace prize with then-north vietnamese communist leader le duc tho for negotiating a cease-fire during the vietnam war. The cease-fire later collapsed, and le rejected his share of the award, which was so controversial that two members of the nobel board quit in protest. He is also remembered as the architect of the policy of détente with the then-soviet union, leading to the first strategic arms limitation treaty, and for negotiating nixon's historic visit to communist china in 1972. But he was also reviled by many anti-war activists for u.s.

            "Donald trump, the presumptive republican presidential nominee whose controversial foreign policy pronouncements have alarmed some in his own party, is scheduled to meet this week with former secretary of state henry kissinger, a senior campaign aide told nbc news on monday. Trump and kissinger have spoken many times by telephone, the aide said. But the aide didn't know whether wednesday's meeting in new york, which was first reported by the washington post, would be their first face-to-face meeting. Play facebook twitter embed kissinger on what ' world order ' looks like 13: 49 kissinger, who served as national security adviser and secretary of state for presidents richard nixon and gerald r. Ford, remains a divisive figure in american politics, even at the age of 92. Kissinger shared the 1973 nobel peace prize with then-north vietnamese communist leader le duc tho for negotiating a cease-fire during the vietnam war. The cease-fire later collapsed, and le rejected his share of the award, which was so controversial that two members of the nobel board quit in protest. He is also remembered as the architect of the policy of détente with the then-soviet union, leading to the first strategic arms limitation treaty, and for negotiating nixon's historic visit to communist china in 1972. But he was also reviled by many anti-war activists for u.s. Policies supporting repressive regimes in indochina, south asia and latin america that happened to share washington's opposition to moscow and beijing. Those policies are widely regarded to have led or contributed to bloody wars in cambodia, bangladesh and east timor and to have propped up anti-democratic military leaders in chile and argentina. At least two unsuccessful lawsuits have sought his prosecution for alleged war crimes",

But maybe not for long: the wall street journal reports that apple is toying with the idea of offering bigger screens down the road — ranging from 4.8 inches to 6 inches high. The story says it's by no means a certainty, but the company already has test models out. This wouldn't be a huge surprise, writes mark rogowsky at forbes, who explains that the \" phablet \" market is growing quickly. For the uninitiated, \" phablet \" refers to the hybrid of phones and tablets — with the phones getting bigger and the tablets getting smaller. Samsung, for example, just unveiled its galaxy note 3 with a 5.7-inch screen. \" next week's iphone isn't slated to address the hole in the product lineup, but with some of apple's most loyal customers jumping ship for android and its big-screen phones ( in fact, that's probably the main reason people do ), it increasingly has no choice, \" writes rogowsky.",

David bowie has already been cremated in new york city, and the only public services or memorials for the beloved singer will be those that fans organize for themselves, sources tell the mirror. A source in new york tells the paper that bowie wanted to \" go without any fuss \" and intended his music to be his farewell to the world. The guardian reports that a long-planned march 31 concert at carnegie hall will now be a memorial concert instead of a tribute, with many big stars expected to join previously announced headliners the roots and cyndi lauper. Bowie, who died after an 18-month struggle with cancer, kept his illness very quiet, and producer tony visconti says he was making plans for a new album just a week before his death. Visconti tells rolling stone that he knew of bowie's illness a year ago, when he started work on blackstar. He says bowie knew in november that the disease was terminal, but he was still writing new songs and hoped to get into the studio for a follow-up. After a phone call last week, \" i was thrilled, and i thought, and he thought, that he'd have a few months, at least, \" the producer says.

The patient would recover during a four-month drug-induced coma. As for the supposedly successful monkey head transplant, new scientist reports details are few. Canavero provided a photo of the monkey post-surgery and claims it \" fully survived the procedure without any neurological injury. \" but his team says it only reattached the blood supply to the head — not the spinal cord — and euthanized the monkey after 20 hours for ethical reasons.

Some readers may find it upsetting the head transplant juggernaut rolls on. Last year, maverick surgeon sergio canavero caused a worldwide storm when he revealed his plan to attempt a human head transplant to new scientist. He claimed that the surgical protocol would be ready within two years and said he intended to offer the surgery as a treatment for complete paralysis. Now, working with other scientists in china and south korea, he claims to have moved closer to that goal with a series of experiments in animals and human cadavers. \"i would say we have plenty of data to go on, \" says canavero. \"it's important that people stop thinking this is impossible. This is absolutely possible and we're working towards it. \" advertisement \"science through pr \" the work is described in seven papers set to be published in the journals surgery and cns neuroscience &amp; therapeutics over the next few months. New scientist has not seen the papers and has not been able verify the latest claims. The issue of cns neuroscience &amp; therapeutics will be guest-edited by one of canavero's collaborators. \"6 things you're dying to ask about head transplants \" the fact that canavero",

This is absolutely possible and we're working towards it. \" head transplants and other ethical dilemmas from 2015 canavero, of the turin advanced neuromodulation group in italy, first raised eyebrows about the procedure as far back as 2013 when he first started considering it. Early last year he told new scientist about the plan, and then last september, he announced he had a volunteer: valery spiridonov, 30, who has been diagnosed with a genetic muscle-wasting condition called werdnig-hoffmann disease. The procedure spiridonov would have to endure sounds horrifying. First, his body and the body of his donor would be cooled to a very low temperature. Next, the neck and spinal cord would be cut with an exceptionally sharp knife to reduce any tissue damage. After being treated with a substance called polyethylene glycol, a chemical that preserves nerve cell membranes, spiridonov's head would then be fused to the donor body.

        "summary": "It probably won't ever become the focus of a hit sports movie — not even if they call it poosiers — but \" poop doping \" is a real thing and could possibly give competitive cyclists an edge. That's according to microbiologist and mountain biker lauren petersen, who tells bicycling magazine that after being sick for more than a decade with lyme disease, in 2014 she gave herself an at-home fecal transplant from somebody who happened to be another racer. Petersen says she not only felt much better after the stool transplant, she upped her training to five days a week and was winning races within months, though her experience proves correlation, not causation. \" i wondered if i had gotten my microbiome from a couch potato, not a racer, if i would i be doing so well, \" says petersen. Petersen — who says the procedure was \" not fun \" but \" pretty basic \" — says she started collecting stool samples from top racers and found that a microorganism called prevotella was found in almost all top racers but less than 10 % of the general population. She is now doing more research into prevotella, which is believed to help muscle recovery. Other experts, however, are skeptical, telling the washington post that it is far too early to draw conclusions — and warning that \" bacterial doping \" at home could be very dangerous. ( petersen herself acknowledges the risk and isn't endorsing it. ) at the big lead blog, tully corcoran argues that if poop doping is what cyclists really want to do, we should \" all just go ahead and let them, for crying out loud. \" ( researchers believe fecal transplants could also help with weight loss. )",

The country is said to be laying the groundwork for refugee camps for thousands of prospective migrants along jilin province's border with north korea, reports the new york times, citing a document produced by a state-owned telecom company. The china mobile document describes recent inspections of five planned refugee camps — in the cities of tumen and hunchun and three villages in changbai county — for the purposes of verifying internet access there. Though china's government hasn't confirmed the plan, a local businessman tells the times that temporary housing is already under construction on state-owned land. The camps were ordered \" because the situation on the china-north korea border has intensified lately, \" according to the china mobile document, which was shared last week on microblogging site weibo before it was deleted, per the telegraph. In an exchange erased from the official transcript of a press briefing on monday, a rep for china's foreign ministry said he was unaware of any such plan, per the guardian. But analysts say china would be foolish not to anticipate such future needs, particularly in an area that lies just 60 miles from north korea's main nuclear test site. The korean peninsula is \" on the brink of war, \" a beijing specialist on north korea tells the guardian. \" as a major power and a neighboring country, china should make plans for all eventualities. \"",

Earlier in october, three girls aged 12 to 14 from stanley mission, sask., and la ronge also killed themselves in the span of four days. A week later, a 10-year-old girl in deschambault lake, sask., took her own life. Then last friday, a 13-year-old girl killed herself on the makwa sahgaiehcan first nation in saskatchewan. \" they're not just statistics, \" said jonathan. \" our little girls are dying. It isn't about this being no. 6. \" jonathan said she had been talking to a number of indigenous and non-indigenous leaders from across the country monday.

Five other girls between the ages of 10 and 14 from the communities of la ronge, stanley mission, deschambault lake and loon lake also committed suicide in october. \"this is unspeakably tragic, \" wall told media. \"each one of these losses — and to have them one after the other — it has the undivided attention of northern leaders, it has the undivided attention of our northern health region, of government offices in social services and in justice and every elected person in the house on either side. \" wall told the legislature many initiatives are underway in the north to assist people struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts. Most recently, regional emergency operations centres were established in la ronge and stanley mission in mid-october.

The semi-automatic gun was not locked up, payson police say, and there were other weapons in the home. \" the apartment that this occurred in was a family friend of the mother and two children, \" who \" had slipped into another room unobserved by the mother and the 78-year-old occupant of the apartment, \" the police chief says, according to kpho. A police press release noted they all live in the same apartment complex, and that the shooting occurred in a back bedroom. Police have served a search warrant, and are not ruling out charges against the mother or the friend. ( a similar tragedy happened in kansas about a month ago. )",

According to the payson police department, the boys were playing in an apartment at 303 s. Ash street at around noon when they discovered a gun. The 3-year-old shot the 18-month-old in the head. The victim was rushed to payson regional medical center where he was pronounced dead. The mother and the two children were visiting a 78-year-old friend at his apartment which is in the same complex where they live. They had only been there 10 or 15 minutes when the boys got into another room where they found the gun. Police said, the mother was looking for the boys and just as she walked through the door of that room the 3-year-old boy fired the gun. There were several 911 calls about a child with a head injury. Police questioned witnesses and neighbors and the child's mother to figure out how the children got access to the gun. The semi-automatic gun was not locked up, according to payson police chief don engler. \" we still intend to serve a search warrant at that location and gather further information, \" said chief engler.

        "summary": "Scientists scratched their heads this week over a massive sunspot, partly because it posed no threat to human civilization. The burst of solar magnetic activity, one of the biggest on record, whipped up powerful flares but didn't spew coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) that can bring down earth's power grids or damage satellites, space.com reports. \" it tends to be the case that when you have a big flare, you generally get a big cme, \" says nasa scientist c. Alex young. The national oceanic and atmospheric administration monitored the sunspot ( called active region 12192 ) for \" geoeffective \" cmes just in case, tech times reports, and there's a chance that ar 12192 will still be active after its two-week trip on the sun's far side. \" some have gone around a couple times, \" says young. Another head-scratcher: scientists still don't know how sunspots grow as big as ar 12192, which was almost 80,000 miles wide or about the size of jupiter — the largest sunspot in 24 years, the 33rd largest since 1874, and, the sun today notes, 14 times bigger than earth's surface. Scientists do know that the sun is near its solar maximum — the apex of its solar cycle, which comes every 11 years — so magnetic energy is bubbling up. But why in one place rather than another? \" i guess a good analogy is when you twist a rubber band or piece of string, \" says young. \" why do, say, three knots or bunches form instead of two or four? the physics is probably too complicated for us at this point. \" if ar 12192 does come back around, you should only observe it with eclipse glasses; space.com helps out with a \" sun observation guide. \" ( did sunspots have anything to do with the sinking of the titanic? )",

Attorney general loretta lynch said the \" lawful, responsive, and transparent \" policing every american is entitled to was sorely lacking in chicago. Mayor rahm emanuel used the word \" sobering \" to describe the report's findings, which coincided with an agreement from the doj and city of chicago to get policing back on the right track. The investigation into the city's police force began in december 2015, after 17-year-old laquan mcdonald was gunned down by a white cop. Among the findings in the 164-page report were instances of cops shooting at individuals who weren't deemed threatening and using stun guns when people simply didn't follow verbal instructions. The city's police academy also came under fire for graduating candidates who mostly didn't seem to know how \" to properly [ articulate ] the legal standard for use of force. \" the report also comes under the shadow of an incoming attorney general ( jeff sessions, if he's confirmed ) who isn't a fan of the type of consent decree the city is working on with the doj to ensure reforms are carried out.

Genest, who got his first tattoo at 16, died six days before his 33rd birthday.

Gaga tweeted that the suicide was \" beyond devastating. \" \" we have to work harder to change the culture, bring mental health to the forefront and erase the stigma that we can't talk about it, \" she said, posting a photo of herself with genest. \" if you are suffering, call a friend or family today.

Fahrenheit 451 has been the frequent subject of parental challenges on the flimsiest of grounds, as when fundamentalist christian alton verne, of conroe, texas, demanded to have the book removed from the curriculum because the characters occasionally blaspheme and say \" damn \" ( \" if they can't find a book that uses clean words, they shouldn't have a book at all \" ). Radosh responded to the permission slip -- which mentioned these parental challenges -- with a wry note congratulating the teacher for using permission slips to convey the awfulness of heavy-handed attempts to control peoples ' access to information.

The first three messages of \" kryptos \" were decoded by nsa cryptographers in 1993, then by fans in 1999. The 97-character fourth message, however, has stumped code breakers for 24 years, reports the new york times. Sanborn, 69, threw fans a bone in 2010 when he revealed the 64th to 69th characters spell out \" berlin, \" but no one cracked the puzzle. Now, he's offering another clue: the next part of the sequence — characters 70 through 74, which read \" mzfpk \" — spells out \" clock. \" when asked if his sculpture's message relates to the famed \" berlin clock, \" itself a puzzle that tells time using colored blocks of light, he tells the times, \" you'd better delve into that particular clock. \" but wired points out his comments may only serve to throw fans off track. Instead, \" clock \" may refer to a method created to crack the nazi's enigma ciphers. Alan turing built upon the method to eventually crack enigma; wired suggests it's perhaps \" no coincidence \" that the imitation game, a movie about turing and enigma, hits theaters in one week.

Next in line, they suggested in the video, is steven sotloff, a freelance journalist for time also being held for ransom. But while several european countries have paid millions to terrorist groups to free its citizens, the us refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Ditto britain.

Robert e. Lee to george washington — stunned his critics and quite a few of his allies, with some fox news hosts expressing as much disbelief as anchors on less trump-friendly networks. A roundup of reactions: twitter exploded with reactions within minutes, raw story reports. \" trump just told america there are good people on both sides, \" tweeted tony posnanski. \" so he thinks there are good nazis... I ' m speechless. \" fox news host kat timpf said she could barely believe what she saw was real life, mediaite reports. She described the press conference, and trump's defense of rally participants, as one of the biggest messes she had ever seen. \" i have too much eye makeup on to start crying right now, \" she said. \" it's disgusting. \" cnn lists its 14 most shocking lines from the press conference. Cnn was among the other networks where hosts expressed disbelief, the new york times reports. Jake tapper told viewers: \" to anybody out there watching today who is confused and thinks, ' i thought that the klan and neo-nazis and white supremacists, i thought there was no debate about this thing among civilized people ' — there isn't a debate about it. \" trump's remarks were condemned by many of his fellow republicans, including reps. Paul ryan and steve scalise, the hill reports. \" i don't understand what's so hard about this. White supremacists and neo-nazis are evil and shouldn't be defended, \" tweeted rep. Steve stivers, head of the national republican congressional committee. One of the most powerful denunciations from the democratic side came from hawaii's sen. Brian schatz. \" as a jew, as an american, as a human, words cannot express my disgust and disappointment, \" he tweeted. \" this is not my president. \" trump made it clear that he sides with the alt-right charlottesville protesters, according to philip bump at the washington post. \" the looming question was whether trump felt that nazis and people protesting those nazis were otherwise equivalent, \" he writes. \" such equivalence would suggest that racism and an embrace of adolf hitler have a place in america's political conversation.

The ap quotes patricia wells, who authored a book on robuchon, as putting it like so: \" to describe joel robuchon as a cook is a bit like calling pablo picasso a painter, luciano pavarotti a singer, frederic chopin a pianist. Joel robuchon will undoubtedly go down as the artist who most influenced the 20th-century world of cuisine. \" as for why, the ap explains that while the chef counted delicacies like truffles and caviar among his favorite things, he embraced recipes made from just a few ingredients and was famous for his mashed potatoes. At grub street, alan sytsma describes them as \" made impossibly smooth and elevated through robuchon's use of small fingerling potatoes and a quantity of butter that still seems astounding. \" robuchon retired at age 50, citing the physical effort it took to be a top chef, but emerged more than 15 years later, in 2003 to launch his atelier ( french for workshop ) concept in paris and then cities across the world.

James driggers, 33, and crystal driggers, 36, of dalzell, sc, were arrested friday and have been charged with unlawful neglect for their treatment of the teen, nbc news reports. Investigators say the couple sent the girl to wild, hog-infested woods more than a quarter of a mile away from their home, telling her to appear at a fence at certain times to get food ( a can of spaghettios was apparently delivered at one point ). She was left to fend for herself even when violent thunderstorms rolled through the area thursday night, reports the state. The girl's grandmother intervened, and police got involved — only to find the girl back in the tent the next day, according to an arrest report seen by the daily beast. A police spokesman tells the daily beast that the tent exile appears to be part of a pattern of \" excessive punishment for small household offenses, \" and that the 14-year-old girl had recently been ordered to stay outside from 8am to 6am doing yardwork in a heat wave and told not to enter the house even to use the bathroom or drink water. The daily beast reports the teen also told law enforcement that she was forced to go to a salon to have her hair cut short after she ate a protein bar. The girl is now in the custody of the state department of social services, while four siblings who lived at the home are now with their grandparents, nbc reports.

            "Extreme a south carolina couple allegedly forced their 14-year-old daughter to live in the woods for a week after they caught her sneaking a sugary snack. A couple of wannabe bodybuilders in south carolina forced their teen daughter to live in the woods as punishment for eating a pop-tart, authorities say. Crystal and james driggers were arrested friday and charged with neglect after police say they found the couple's 14-year-old in a tent about a quarter-mile from their rural dalzell home. The girl's grandmother had called police, according to the arrest report. The driggers, who were released after a bond hearing on monday, did not respond to requests for comment. \"they were upset because the child ate a pop-tart, \" braden bunch of the sumter county sheriff's office told the daily beast. On thursday morning, according to the sheriff's office, the iron-pumping parents banished the girl to the nearby woods, which are stomping grounds for wild hogs. They allegedly provided her only with a roll of toilet paper, a flashlight, a whistle and a watch for her outdoor sentence, which was supposed to last a week. \"she was out there for two days and was expected by her parents to stay out there for another five, \" bunch told the daily beast. \"the parents have confirmed to us exactly what they were planning. \" the girl was told if she wanted food, she'd have to come to a fence on the family's property at certain times, police said. At one point, a member of the drigger household delivered a cold can of spaghettios to the girl, police said. Handout the tough punishment was intended to \"make her feel how it would be to be homeless, \" the concerned grandma told cops, according to the police report. But when the weather turned stormy thursday night, the grandmother brought the girl to her house.

            "Extreme a south carolina couple allegedly forced their 14-year-old daughter to live in the woods for a week after they caught her sneaking a sugary snack. A couple of wannabe bodybuilders in south carolina forced their teen daughter to live in the woods as punishment for eating a pop-tart, authorities say. Crystal and james driggers were arrested friday and charged with neglect after police say they found the couple's 14-year-old in a tent about a quarter-mile from their rural dalzell home. The girl's grandmother had called police, according to the arrest report. The driggers, who were released after a bond hearing on monday, did not respond to requests for comment. \"they were upset because the child ate a pop-tart, \" braden bunch of the sumter county sheriff's office told the daily beast. On thursday morning, according to the sheriff's office, the iron-pumping parents banished the girl to the nearby woods, which are stomping grounds for wild hogs. They allegedly provided her only with a roll of toilet paper, a flashlight, a whistle and a watch for her outdoor sentence, which was supposed to last a week. \"she was out there for two days and was expected by her parents to stay out there for another five, \" bunch told the daily beast. \"the parents have confirmed to us exactly what they were planning. \" the girl was told if she wanted food, she'd have to come to a fence on the family's property at certain times, police said. At one point, a member of the drigger household delivered a cold can of spaghettios to the girl, police said. Handout the tough punishment was intended to \"make her feel how it would be to be homeless, \" the concerned grandma told cops, according to the police report. But when the weather turned stormy thursday night, the grandmother brought the girl to her house. She then texted her son, 33-year-old james driggers, who became upset with her for interfering, the report says. When sheriff's deputies arrived, they say james assured them that the girl would return home that night.

Thirty-year-old valery spiridonov, who suffers from the progressive and incurable werdnig-hoffmann wasting disease, has volunteered to be the guinea pig, though it remains to be seen who will be the donor. Afp reports that china, with 1.37 billion people, many of whom do not donate organs due to a belief in reincarnation, has reached something of an impasse with its simultaneously high demand for and chronic shortage of organs — a void that death row inmates have controversially filled. The $ 11 million procedure is likely to take 36 hours, reports rt, and will require that the donor's and the patient's heads be severed at the same time with, if it needs saying, an extra sharp blade. \" china wants to do it because they want to win the nobel prize, \" canavero says. \" they want to prove themselves [ as ] a scientific powerhouse. So it's the new space race. \" to the many critics who say it cannot yet be done, largely because of the problem of spinal cord fusion and organ rejection, canavero does not mince his words: \" all the critics who spoke are ignorant. \" the marathon procedure is set to take place with chinese surgeon ren xiaoping at harbin medical university in china's northeast heilongjiang province, and if and when spiridonov awakes from a month-long medically-induced coma, he will take powerful immuno-suppressants to prevent the donated body from rejecting his head.

        "summary": "The age-old practice of mothers holding their naked newborns to their skin and nursing them appears to benefit children — specifically those who were born premature or small — two decades later. Researchers at the kangaroo foundation in bogota, colombia, revisited a group of preemies who were studied in the mid-1990s and found that 228 young adults who'd received so-called kangaroo care as infants fared better in pretty much every way measured compared to 213 young adults who hadn't had the same level of physical closeness, reports reuters health. While the study, published in pediatrics, builds on a wealth of previous research showing the benefits of physical contact at birth, the researchers say these findings show \" a significant, long lasting social and behavioral protective effect 20 years [ later ], \" the lead author says. Those held skin-to-skin at birth were more likely to be breastfed and much less likely to die young. By 20, they were less aggressive, hyperactive, and anti-social. Researchers note their study did not prove causation: it's still unclear, for instance, whether the care itself has a biological effect on children's brains or whether those children are snuggling with parents who are, well, more nurturing. Nbc news also reports that kangaroo care doesn't beget \" miracles \": children with cerebral palsy, for instance, saw no change in their symptoms. But considering about one in 12 babies born in the us are preemie or weigh less than 5.5 pounds at birth, according to the march of dimes, kangaroo care may be beneficial for millions. ( this dying baby is now 5 after his parents cuddled him. )",

The banner sets out the principle according to which russian president vladimir putin is establishing that it is his right to intervene on behalf of russians anywhere, anytime, and thereby determine the fates and policies of other ex-soviet states.

Jalopnik reports mayer had an appointment this week with volkswagen to buy back the diesel golf he bought just weeks before the company's massive diesel scandal broke. But before he took his golf in for the court-ordered buyback, he decided to strip it for parts. \"why not make a bit of extra money? \" he says. Mayer, equipped with pizza and beer, had a \" surprising amount of fun \" removing doors, bumpers, airbags, fenders, seats, trim, and more. But in a followup piece, jalopnik reports that just hours before mayer's appointment, a volkswagen representative — who must have seen the earlier story — called and postponed it indefinitely. Mayer says he was told that stripping his golf \" wasn't in the spirit of the buyback. \" he thinks volkswagen wants time to consult its lawyers and figure out how to get out of paying him for the car. He plans to also talk to lawyers. The ftc consent order for the buyback only requires the car be \" operable, \" defined in the documents as a car that \" can be driven under its own 2.0-liter tdi engine power. \" mayer says his husk of a golf still drives. Furthermore, the condition of the car isn't supposed to impact the buyback price. But it remains to be seen who ' ll get the last laugh.",
