        "summary": "Donald trump jr. Has revealed the real reason for his meeting with a russian lawyer last year: he says natalia veselnitskaya told him she had information that could help his father's campaign. In a statement sunday, trump jr. Said during the june 2016 meeting, the lawyer told him \" she had information that individuals connected to russia were funding the democratic national committee and supporting ms. Clinton, \" but failed to provide any details. Multiple sources tell the new york times that trump jr. Only agreed to the meeting — which was also attended by jared kushner and paul manafort, trump's campaign manager at the time — because he had been promised damaging information on clinton. Trump jr. Earlier said the meeting with veselnitskaya, which was set up by an acquaintance, was about a russian adoption program. In his statement sunday, he said the lawyer, who had no \" meaningful information \" about clinton, soon switched focus to the adoption program and it became clear \" that this was the true agenda all along. \" but his attempt to gain information on clinton from a kremlin-linked lawyer is certain to attract the attention of the russia investigation, reports the washington post, which calls trump jr.'s statement \" stunningly incriminating. \" according to the election law blog, trump jr. May have violated the law on campaigns soliciting \" anything of value \" from foreign nationals.",

        "summary": "Just a month after toyota's largest-ever recall for a single part, the company is recalling 2.77 million more vehicles worldwide. Most of the vehicles involved — 2.76 million in 10 models made between 2000 and 2011 — require a fix for the shaft that connects the steering wheel to the gearbox. An additional 630,000 in five models built last year need a repair to the hybrid system's water pump. A small number require both fixes, the wall street journal reports. No accidents or injuries have occurred as a result of the two problems. The recall is a further embarrassment for toyota considering it comes two years after massive recalls in 2009 and 2010, during which the automaker was criticized for a slow response, the journal notes.

            "× close important takata airbag safety recall information update - 3/2016, expanded to include 2008 model year corolla/corolla matrix and 2008-2010 model year lexus sc 430 vehicles toyota has initiated safety recalls for certain toyota and lexus vehicles equipped with takata front passenger airbag inflators and one toyota model equipped with a takata driver's airbag inflator. The subject vehicles are equipped with airbag inflators which may have been manufactured in such a way as to have a potential for the intrusion of moisture over time. Depending on the circumstances, this could create excessive internal pressure when the airbag is deployed and cause the inflator to rupture. In the event of an inflator rupture, metal fragments could pass through the airbag cushion material, striking the vehicle occupants and potentially resulting in serious injury or death. If you have questions or concerns related to this important safety recall, please contact your toyota/lexus dealer or the customer assistance team whose contact information is noted in the frequently asked questions links below. These links will also provide the most up-to-date information about this important safety recall. Parts are currently available for repairs. We request that you contact your local dealer for the remedy as soon as possible. Driver airbag inflator toyota has initiated a nationwide safety recall action related to the driver's dual-stage airbag inflators in 2004 – 2005 model year rav4 vehicles. This is the only toyota model in the united states and united states territories involving driver's airbag inflators. If your vehicle is involved, the driver's airbag inflator will be replaced at no charge to you at an authorized toyota dealer. Nationwide safety recall f0l: 2004 - 2005 rav4 front passenger airbag inflator toyota has initiated two separate safety recall actions related to takata front passenger airbag inflators on various toyota models and one lexus model.

Per the ap, luke aikins won't be wearing a wingsuit, either, when he takes the 120mph plunge just north of la, landing in a 10,000-square-foot net that's 20 stories high. That's high enough so he won't hit the ground, but also designed so he ( hopefully ) won't bounce back out. Still, \" if i wasn't nervous, i would be stupid, \" he says. Six months of prepping seem to have gone generally well, the independent notes, though one test run with a 200-pound dummy didn't end as expected: the dummy crashed right through the net. The washington state resident initially turned down the parachute-less idea when it was pitched to him by hollywood pr man jimmy smith and partner bobby ware two years ago. \" like any normal, sane person i said,'thank you but no thank you. I have a wife and a son and i've got a life to live, \" he tells people. \" then, two weeks went by and i kept waking up in the middle of the night thinking, if somebody said you had to do this, how could it be done? \" the 42-year-old definitely has experience under his skydiving harness: he's made more than 18,000 jumps since his first tandem at age 12, has trained other top skydivers ( including daredevil felix baumgartner ), and served as a stuntman for iron man 3.

        "summary": "In the past three decades, wild pigs have been spreading across america like crazy — to the tune of 5 million of the porkers in 39 states. The pigs have been part of the landscape since the 1600s, when early settlers allowed them to roam; some escaped, though their numbers have long been relatively few and largely limited to the south. It's unclear what's behind the recent surge, but experts are working hard to find a way to contain them, scientific american reports. Between the damage they cause and efforts to control them, wild pigs cost some $ 1.5 billion per year. In addition to eating crops, they can ruin fields by digging, threaten local species, and contaminate streams with their feces. \" i've never seen any one species that can affect so many livelihoods and resources, \" says a texas official. The federal government is directing $ 20 million toward thinning their ranks. The usda program involves destroying the wild pig population in two states every few years, starting with the states that have the fewest pigs. Among techniques for doing so are trapping, shooting pigs from helicopters, and sending a radio-collared \" judas pig \" to reveal the whereabouts of his group. Meanwhile, some experts are calling for poisoning the animals. In addition to the government program, locals are taking on the task: a church recently sought crossbow hunters to protect pumpkins in texas, the houston chronicle reports, while a hunter in nebraska recently killed a 400-pound pig; the omaha world-herald has a rather alarming picture. ( on the bright side, at least the pigs here aren't radioactive. )",

        "summary": "Guys may unknowingly be leaving their mark on the world: scientists from the university of new south wales in australia have taken on what was widely considered to be the discredited theory of telegony — the idea that a woman's children might resemble not just her current sexual partner, but a previous one as well — and shown evidence of it in flies, phys.org reports. The study, published in the ecology letters journal, first mated male flies whose diets had been specially engineered with female flies that weren't yet able to reproduce; in the second round, researchers waited for the females to mature, then mated them with a new guy. The results: offspring size was determined by the mother's first partner, not by the father. The telegony concept goes back to aristotle, notes the telegraph, and may have had an impact on greek mythology ( many heroes feature a godlike dad and a regular human dad ). While modern genetics studies seemed to have put the kibosh on that idea, according to the telegraph, scientists in the unsw study believe that some of the original male partner's semen may absorb into the female's immature eggs and hang out until she's mature enough to be fertilized by another male. So what does this mean for humans who didn't, er, stay with their first love? \" things that were thought impossible previously might indeed turn out to be not so far-fetched after all, [ though ] i think it's impossible to say … without further studies in a more related species like a mouse, \" a cellular and molecular pharmacology professor at oxford tells the telegraph.

        "summary": "\" crowdfunded vibrator \" is a term absolutely no one would have predicted 20 years ago — and yet here we are, 2016. The dame fin is that vibrator, the first sex toy ever to premiere on kickstarter, and it surpassed its $ 50,000 funding goal in its first two days, the daily dot reports ( nearly $ 70,000 had been raised as of press time ). Vibrators have sneaked onto other crowdfunding sites before, per motherboard, and other devices that can be appropriated for vibratory use have made their way onto kickstarter, but the dame fin — a small silicone vibrator that can be worn between a user's fingers for clitoral stimulation — is the first one on the site to explicitly announce its intended usage. The product is packaged as \" small and mighty \" and boasts three speeds, a usb cable for easy recharging, and discreet operation ( translation: not noisy ). Kickstarter used to have a payment platform that banned \" adult-oriented products and services, \" but even after it switched to one that didn't, the company still seemed leery of the sex toy market. It turns out a neighborhood connection changed all that. \" kickstarter is literally around the block from us [ in brooklyn ], \" dame products co-founder alexandra fine tells motherboard. \" our review process is always evolving, \" justin kazmark, kickstarter's vp of communications, tells the daily dot, adding that the fin is \" new and innovative \" and that similar products will be reviewed on a \" case-by-case basis. \" ( an illinois woman says a \" smart \" vibrator invaded her privacy. )",

Nearly five decades later, an iraq veteran went to the vietnam veterans memorial wall to take a rubbing of johnson's name so rivera could hang it on his wall, next to johnson's picture — only to discover johnson's name wasn't there. With the help of other veterans, johnson was found, alive and living in michigan, courthouse news service reports. But the good news wasn't over yet: rivera, who wrote about the experience of having his best friend die in his arms in his novel, raw man, was dismayed to discover johnson hadn't gotten a purple heart, the award given to those wounded or killed in service. He started a campaign to get him one — and was met with much resistance along the way, per cns. His request was denied multiple times due to a lack of paperwork, even though rivera went to much trouble to track down all the evidence he could. Finally, rivera got a retired three-star general to advocate for johnson, and the army approved the purple heart request. During a ceremony at the wall on july 10, herman and rivera will see each other for the first time in 47 years.

Weather.com reports that a winter storm warning has been issued for peaks including mauna kea and mauna loa on the big island, which could get up to 30 inches of snow. The national weather service warns that conditions will be especially dangerous above 12,000 feet, with strong winds causing drifting snow. Mauna kea's summit is at almost 14,000 feet. \" typically when we get these snow events, it does get a lot of attention, \" national weather service matthew foster tells the ap. \" we do have very high mountains here. \" meteorologists say there has been around 36 inches of snow at the highest elevations during recent winters, though the weather service doesn't go out and measure it. Weather.com notes that there is a hawaii ski club, which tells would-be hawaiian skiiers that \" there are no lifts, no grooming, no resort, but a road goes to the summit to serve the dozen or so world-class observatories located at the summit. You must have a 4-wheel drive vehicle to get to the summit. \" the rest of hawaii has been told to expect a lot of rain over the weekend. ( this hiker almost died in a hawaiian snowstorm. )",

They changed clothes and were reportedly spotted soon after at a nearby family dollar store, reports the ap. But with no more recent sighting, the pair could be just about anywhere by now, putnam county sheriff howard sills tells wsb-tv. Hoping for a quick resolution, multiple law enforcement agencies have provided a $ 70,000 reward for information leading to the capture of 43-year-old donnie russell rowe and 24-year-old ricky dubose, whom sills says are armed and \" dangerous beyond description. \" authorities say rowe and dubose somehow escaped a locked compartment in the bus around 6: 45am tuesday as 33 inmates were being moved between prisons. \" i can't tell you how the gate got open, \" says sills, who notes the bus was equipped with a camera. \" it should have been locked.

( see the anonymous blog mcmansion hell for examples. ) they were pricier to build than the average starter ranch-style house, and they also sell for more, but as bloomberg reports using trulia stats, their investment value has \" dropped like a stone. \" in 85 % of the largest us markets, that extra amount people are willing to pay for mcmansions is shrinking. Case in point: a typical mcmansion in fort lauderdale was valued at $ 477,000 in 2012, a 274 % premium over all other area homes. Now they're worth $ 611,000, which is just 190 % more. The move away from the mcmansion trend of 10 years ago appears to be widespread across age groups as well, with baby boomers looking to downsize, gen xers licking their wounds from post-bubble foreclosures, and millennials not marrying and starting families at the same rate previous generations did. Plus, builders have been more cautious in the intervening years, with more new construction being smaller ( though still sizeable, with 2,500-square-footers being the median ). And it's not just mcmansions, as the chicago tribune reports. Luxury homes built long before mcmansions came along are also slow to sell, and prices for any homes and condos listed above $ 1 million have dropped 9 % during the first three months of 2016.

The bbc reports the water likely didn't begin its ancient life 1.5 miles beneath the surface: it would have seeped from above ground through the earth, eventually becoming trapped. As a geochemist involved in the study explains, \" the fluids that we see now are actually preservations of ancient oceans. \" but that may not be the most interesting part: the water, which contains a good deal of hydrogen, could hold ancient life, too, and the scientists are currently testing samples to see if that's the case.

So they looked at the decay of radioactive atoms found in the water and calculated that it had been bottled up for a long time — at least 1.5 billion years. \" that is the lower limit for the age, \" holland says.

True to banksy form, the \" park \" features exhibits that combine black humor and politics: there's a model village with 3,000 riot police after an episode of civil unrest, a shop offering kids \" pocket money loans \" at a 5,000 % interest rate, a fire pit where a \" lord \" burns books daily, and boats crammed with people seeking asylum. There are some frivolous exhibits, too, including balloons that say \" i am an imbecile \" and a caricaturist who draws the back of customers ' heads. The park, open to the public tomorrow, was shrouded in secrecy, with locals thinking it was a hollywood film set. Even the staff didn't know: they answered an ad looking for extras for the film. Tickets ( up to 4,000 sold daily ) cost less than $ 5, so the guardian isn't sure banksy, who funded the show himself, is making a profit or even breaking even based on the money that surely went into the show, which runs through sept. 27. It seems there's interest in the park: nbc news reports people were having trouble this morning buying tickets online because too many were refreshing the dismaland website, per a spokeswoman.

Today, johnson will finally be recognized for his valor — almost a century after he joined an all-black national guard unit and helped fight off german attackers while on loan to french forces during world war i. One of two soldiers to be posthumously awarded the medal of honor today at the white house, johnson and a fellow soldier were ambushed while on night sentry duty under a french army colonial unit in the champagne region on may 15, 1918, the new york times reports. With his compatriot seriously wounded, johnson held off at least a dozen enemy soldiers. An army account has this to say of his bravery: \" wielding only a knife and being seriously wounded, johnson continued fighting, took his bolo knife, and stabbed it through an enemy soldier's head. \" he sustained 21 combat injuries in the war and died in 1929. \" his act of heroism was amazing, \" says sen. Chuck schumer, who has for years fought for the recognition for johnson, and who in 2011 submitted a 1,258-page document in support of it. ( much credit goes to former schumer staffer caroline wekselbaum, 32, who in 2011 discovered two documents attesting to johnson's valor; more here. ) sgt. William shemin will also receive the medal of honor for having recovered wounded american soldiers during a three-day battle on france's vesle river in august 1918. He \" dashed out across the open in full sight of the germans, who opened and maintained a furious burst of machine-gun and rifle fire, \" the army says. A bullet sliced through his helmet and wedged behind his left ear, but he survived, dying in 1973. \" i felt an enormous sense of pride as an american jew, and for him, and for our family, and for the entire jewish community, \" his daughter, 86, says of learning of the honor, per the washington post.",

Beyond pope francis: 10 conservatives who have gone liberal up close, pope francis, the 266th vicar of jesus christ on earth, a man whose obvious humility, empathy and, above all, devotion to the economically disenfranchised has come to feel perfectly suited to our times, looks stouter than on television. Having famously dispensed with the more flamboyant pontifical accessories, he's also surprisingly stylish, today wearing a double-breasted white overcoat, white scarf and slightly creamier cassock, all impeccably tailored. The topic of francis ' catechesis, or teaching, is judgment day, though, true to form, he does not try to conjure images of fire and brimstone. His predecessor, benedict xvi, speaking on the topic, once said, \"",

The research out of italy suggests that this \" mental number line, \" considered fundamental to math, might be hard-wired into the brains of living creatures rather than something that's taught, reports the bbc. As livescience puts it, the results mean that animals don't necessarily need \" words for numbers to have a sense of their relative sizes. \" in the first step of the study, scientists trained the chicks to find food behind a panel with five dots. Then they added a panel to the left and one to the right, each with an equal number of dots. If that number was lower than five, the chicks generally went to the left to get their food. If the number was higher than five, they went right. The researchers then repeated the experiment with a completely different set of numbered dots, and the results were the same: the chicks associated the left with lower numbers and the right with higher numbers. \"we cannot think of any other, and simpler, explanation for the behavior of the chicks than assuming the training number is 1 ) remembered and 2 ) compared with the number seen at test, \" the lead researcher tells the new york times. An expert in the spatial concept of numbers who was not involved with the study tells the newspaper that the findings are \" very cool, \" adding that he hopes it leads to more insights about the \" building blocks \" of our brains.

She is co-author of a new study on the dogs in the journal the proceedings of the royal society b. The team didn't set out to study sneezing, but quickly became intrigued by what looked like a quorum. Following five packs, they were able to document that when an alpha dog sneezed during a \" rally, \" or gathering, a total of three sneezes among the group resulted in a hunt. When a lesser dog sneezed, that number rose to 10, but still ultimately resulted in the decision to hunt. African wild dogs are among the world's most endangered species, per the bbc, and are considered opportunistic predators who hunt animals such as gazelles. Quorums, by the way, are also used by meerkats and other social carnivores, another researcher says, though sneezing seems to be unique to the dogs. ( check out what this guy sneezed out. )",

In what cosmopolitan calls a \" spectacular takedown, \" grande stepped in after her mother criticized tweets from morgan in which he accused the band little mix of plagiarizing a dixie chicks cover and said ellen degeneres was a hypocrite for admiring men's bodies. Morgan slammed little mix for posing nude with insults written on them for a video. He also attacked member jesy nelson for posing in her underwear, saying she should \" put some clothes on \" because \" she looks ridiculous, \" variety reports. He told joan grande he would \" prefer they use their talent to sell records rather than their nudity... As your own daughter does! \" morgan is \" known for being a provocateur \" on these issues, the bbc notes. Ariana grande then entered the fray, tweeting: \" i use my talent and my sexuality all the time because i choose to. Women can be sexual and talented. Naked and dignified. It's our choice. \" in a follow-up tweet, she told the 53-year-old morgan she looks forward \" to the day you realize there are other ways to go about making yourself relevant than to criticize young, beautiful, successful women for everything they do. I think that ' ll be a beautiful thing for you and your career or what's left of it. \" she also tweeted a photo of morgan posing topless by a fire, saying: \" when you do it, it's ok though, right? \" morgan later invited grande to appear on his good morning britain show and was rejected, usa today reports.

It's not clear which cruise line he sailed, but the ships stopped in spain, italy, greece, jordan, and the united arab emirates, among other places.

Paddock called himself a self-ordained minister and actually incorporated holy life congregation, but it never quite took off. \"he wanted ( to locate the church ) in nevada because he liked to go there and gamble, \" says a woman who was friends with him at the time. Police twins: one of the police officers wounded in the attack was 33-year-old casey clarkson, who was at the scene trying to usher people to safety and help the wounded. Meanwhile, his identical twin, sgt. Branden clarkson, was back at the station helping coordinate the police response when he learned the news.

But there are conflicting views on what his grip on the reins means for israel and, by extension, the rest of the world. What some are saying: not optimistic: dan perry, who writes for the ap that netanyahu's history and recent rhetoric about not allowing a palestinian state doesn't \" bode well for prospects of peace with the palestinians or a rapprochement between israel and the region. \" he mentions that israel is headed \" on a course toward ever deeper confrontation with the world, \" and that the continuing expected fight between israel's hard-liners and left-leaners is \" israel's existential dilemma, \" a situation in which \" israelis have despaired of peace and politicians increasingly address the palestinian matter with evasion, mendacity, or doubletalk. \" \" maybe from [ the us ] perspective, the newly honest netanyahu government isn't such a bad thing, \" paul waldman writes at the washington post. \" american governments can give up the endlessly frustrating task of trying to negotiate a palestinian-israeli settlement, because the israeli leader is now on record saying he wants the occupation to be permanent. \" waldman notes this election was a game-changer, showing americans that the israeli issue is indeed partisan and that \" blindly supporting whatever position the israeli government takes on any issue isn't good enough anymore. \" \" the reign of ' king bibi ' \" carries on, herb keinon writes for the jerusalem post — but not because he's a beloved leader in touch with the average israeli's issues: he won \" because most of the country agrees with his basic message: the region is dangerous; iran is a threat; the palestinians are not really interested in peace; israel needs a leader who will stand his ground. \" also, the first call keinon thinks netanyahu should make: one to president obama to thaw the chill that's only worsened since the pm's speech to congress about iran. Michael shear isn't so sure that kind of reset is even possible in \" one of [ obama's ] trickiest, most fraught relationships with any world leader, \" he writes for the new york times. Although the us and israel are publicly still standing shoulder-to-shoulder, aides say the two leaders \" have never become close, \" and shear believes obama is faced with one of two choices: try one more time to get their relationship back on track, or \" write off the israeli prime minister \" as he has vladimir putin.

        "summary": "The research had been borne out in rats, and so the next step was humans: some 93 pregnant dutch women whose placentas weren't operating optimally were given sildenafil, the drug better known as viagra. The condition sharply limits a fetus ' growth, and the hope was that the drug's blood-dilating effects would promote better blood flow through the placenta, boosting the fetus'development. That trial was halted last week in the face of gloomy initial results: 17 babies born with lung issues, only six of whom survived. Among a control group of roughly an equal size, there were only three babies with lung issues and no deaths. The guardian reports some in the test group have anxious days ahead: as many as 15 women have yet to know what their child's outcome will be. As for what went wrong, the theory is that the drug may have elevated blood pressure in the lungs, reducing the amount of oxygen the growing babies received. \" i am shocked, \" says the study leader, who noted that a similar canadian study has been paused after his team alerted those researchers about their findings. They're two of four global trials. Stuff.co.nz reported in march on the results of a study that involved 122 australian and new zealand women, half of whom received sildenafil. Their results suggested a slightly better outcome among mothers who took the drug but the findings were framed as statistically insignificant due to the size of the pool. That report cited a study that wrapped up in 2017 in england that found no positive impacts on fetuses who received the drug.",

Why? it's thanks to a phenomenon known as parabiosis, in which two beings are sewn together, their veins conjoined. Researchers who did this to mice in a 2013 study found that certain aspects of aging were reversed in older mice who got blood from younger ones, but the results haven't been replicated by other researchers. There's also the fact that any similar benefits in humans are only hypothetical at this point, but that doesn't make the idea any less tantalizing to some, cnbc reports. Paypal co-founder peter thiel, for example, told inc. Magazine last year he was \" looking into parabiosis stuff. \" ( karmazin says thiel isn't an ambrosia client, and it's not clear whether thiel has actually started getting transfusions. ) despite the fact that benefits of parabiosis in humans haven't yet been scientifically documented, karmazin ( who gets his company's supply of young blood from blood banks ) claims some of ambrosia's 100 or so clients have seen blood biomarkers for heart disease, cancer, and alzheimer's disease lessen, and that at least two clients have seen their actual alzheimer's symptoms decrease. \" whatever is in young blood is causing changes that appear to make the aging process reverse, \" he tells new scientist.

            "Great news today news from our astronaut relations team at virgin galactic: our 500th future astronaut customer has just signed up! even better news is that number 500 is ashton kutcher. I gave ashton a quick call to congratulate and welcome him. He is as thrilled as we are at the prospect of being among the first to cross the final frontier ( and back! ) with us and to experience the magic of space for himself. As you can see from the video, our spaceships are not only very beautiful but are built and flying in the final stages of our exhaustive test flight program. We are guided by safety and so will ensure that everything is just as safe as it can possibly be before we start commercial services – particularly as i will be on the first commercial flight with my kids! virgin galactic is the most exciting business that we've ever launched and i still sometimes have to pinch myself that it's for real. Ashton is joining a fast expanding group of true pioneers who are on their way to a life changing experience and a place in the history books. It's great to have him on board.

The military, though, says extreme measures were necessary because it feared manning was going to kill himself.

It tells the harrowing tale of victor frankenstein, a single-minded student of science driven to ruin by his obsession with bestowing life on inanimate matter. In the 1990 documentary robocop 2, director irvin kershner leads us on an exploration of the science of transferring human consciousness into deadly law enforcement robots. We quickly discover the dangers of such a procedure, as multiple test subjects commit suicide after finding themselves forever trapped in their mechanical bodies. In 1994's jurassic park, noted chaotician dr.

The new york times notes that these same voters opted for barack obama in 2008, making saturday's vote a key test in whether clinton has won them back. Polling suggests she has, and politico observes that in south carolina, \" clinton is finally the candidate she always wanted to be. \" it collects this quote to illustrate why her candidacy is resonating among black women in particular: \"she's dealt with african-americans, \" says one retiree working as a campaign volunteer. \"she knows the struggle.

        "summary": "Animals don't seem to be harmed by the world's most widely used weedkiller, but bees apparently don't fall under that protective umbrella. \" this is really critical, \" one entomologist tells science of a new study showing the digestive system of honeybees ( and possibly other bees as well ) may be adversely affected by glyphosate, the main ingredient in monsanto's roundup. Until now, the herbicide had been thought \" innocuous \" to animals because it targets an enzyme only plants and microorganisms produce. Now, however, it seems glyphosate also messes with the gut microbiome — the bacteria found in creatures ' intestines that protects against \" opportunistic pathogens \" — which can ultimately make bees more vulnerable to infection, per the study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences journal. To test the herbicide's effects, biologist nancy moran's team fed 2,000 bees a sugar syrup, some laced with glyphosate. The bees that ingested the glyphosate mixture ended up with significantly lower levels of the gut bacteria snodgrassella alvi. In later tests, just 12 % of the glyphosate bees survived infection by an invasive bacteria; 47 % of the non-herbicide-eating bees lived. The guardian, meanwhile, cites previous research that found glyphosate seemed to have detrimental effects on honeybee larvae survival and on bees ' cognitive functioning. Moran notes the s. Alvi bacteria spits out a chemical that may be a fighter against other, invasive bacteria; it may also offer a protective shield by lining the gut wall. Per the guardian, a monsanto rep insists: \" claims that glyphosate has a negative impact on honeybees are simply not true. \" ( small signs of hope on the honeybee front. )",

The patent filing states the software would have been able to identify terms like \" rickrolled \" and \" blogger \" before they became commonplace.

        "summary": "Introduced by paul ryan as a \" man of solid character, \" mike pence accepted the \" awesome privilege \" of being the vice presidential nominee in front of an enthusiastic crowd at the rnc wednesday night. Pence, who described himself as \" a christian, a conservative, and a republican, in that order, \" joked that donald trump \" is a man known for a large personality, colorful style, and lots of charisma, so i guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket. \" in what was his first big speech since trump confirmed him as his vp pick, the indiana governor recounted his all-american life story, slammed hillary clinton on issues such as benghazi, and warned that this year's election could shape the supreme court for the next 40 years, the ap reports. Pence piled praise on trump, saying opponents and the media simply don't understand why he keeps winning. \" they keep thinking they've done him in, only to wake up the next morning to find that donald trump is still standing and running stronger than ever before. The man does not quit, \" said pence. Trump \" gets it, \" he added. \" he's the genuine article. He's a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers. \" soon after wrapping up, with the words \" together we will make america great again, \" pence was briefly joined on stage by trump himself, who gave him an air kiss and stood with him briefly before pence's family came out. Earlier speakers included newt gingrich and eric trump, trump's third child with first wife ivana trump. Eric delivered what the guardian calls \" the rich man's burden argument for picking trump. \" trump made the \" courageous decision to set aside a company to which he has dedicated his entire life, \" eric said, telling teachers, laborers, and other struggling workers that his father is running for them and they should vote \" for the one candidate who does not need this job. \"",

        "summary": "It's d-day in iowa in exactly one week, and with just seven days to go, things aren't exactly firming up among republican voters. Most media reports use words like \" fluid, \" \" unsettled, \" and \" muddled \" to describe the situation there. Highlights of today's iowa caucuses-centric news and analysis. It's still anyone's game — and how. The sioux city journal points to a recent iowa state university/gazette/kcrg poll that describes things as \" remarkably fluid. \" a sizable 37.8 % said they were still trying to make up their minds, and 34.1 % were learning toward a candidate. Just 28.1 % have made their pick. That indecision doesn't come cheap. The des moines register reports that december campaign and pac spending on tv and radio ads in the state has clocked in at more than $ 10 million for the month ( the figure excludes spending by michele bachmann and rick santorum ). Among the biggest spenders: rick perry has forked over $ 2.86 million for tv ads; a super pac pushing mitt romney has spent $ 2.85 million. One of the lighter spenders? newt gingrich, at $ 476,000. And all the gingrich-centered negative ads may just be too much for him. The washington post talks to an iowa strategist who calls them \" effective \" and says that \" there's not going to be any singular moment where he can regain the footing. Nothing will allow him to pull the break in these polls. \" romney is looking like a more likely winner, notes the new york times. He debuted a new commercial yesterday, and the slow rise of santorum could help. \"if the evangelical vote is splintered and ron paul's people aren't going anywhere, mitt romney could end up winning the iowa caucuses, \" says mike huckabee. \" it would not put me on the floor if that happened. \" so with iowa looming, everyone must be there, right? not exactly. The post notes that santorum was the only candidate in the state yesterday. He engaged in a little bird hunting with rep. Steve king, whose endorsement he was seeking. He didn't bag it. The other candidates will return today.",

But is his first win too little, too late for the governor, who called himself \" the little engine that could \" after the victory? a roundup of reactions: it's now mathematically impossible for kasich to clinch the nomination before the republican national convention, reports politico, which notes that he would have to secure more than 100 % of the remaining delegates for this to happen. But if he wins more states after ohio, a contested convention becomes more likely, as does the possibility that kasich could prevail as a consensus candidate. \" popular sitting republican governor wins home state. This should change the tide, \" quips nicholas confessore at the new york times. Kasich has a chance, but it will depend on him keeping momentum going and the gop establishment executing \" a near-flawless strategy in the coming weeks and months, \" according to cleveland.com. Two things in his favor: his positive attitude and the fact that the gop convention will be held on his home turf. Kasich's campaign claims that he will enter the convention in the best position to become the nominee, though in reality he \" now seems likely to hang around at the periphery of the trump-cruz race for the next few months, hoping to collect delegates and lead a revivifying of the gop establishment in the event the convention deadlocks and he emerges as a consensus candidate, \" predicts chris cillizza at the washington post. The nomination is still very much a long shot for the governor, but he has managed to slow down trump's rise and give the gop establishment a boost, according to the wall street journal, which calls the ohio vote a test of whether gop voters could be \" persuaded to support an experienced, accomplished politician despite widespread disgust with party-establishment leaders. \" is kasich really the moderate he appears to be? fivethirtyeight analyzes his record and finds that he is indeed more moderate than the average republican in today's congress, though he would have been more conservative than average in 1980 and is still very conservative on issues such as abortion.",

She was mocked, reports deadspin, but the snack was probably worth the scorn. Like sports drinks, bananas are packed with sugars — 14.43 grams in a medium-size one — proven to fuel muscles during exercise, allowing for longer, more intense workouts and faster recovery times, reports the new york times. Indeed, when consumed during exercise, bananas replace nutrients and prevent inflammation just as effectively as sports drinks, which are man-made, cost quite a bit more, and may lack the additional benefits of fiber and vitamins c and b6, according to research out of appalachian state university. Sports drinks also apparently lack another benefit of bananas not fully understood. Researchers — partially funded by dole foods, which had no involvement in the study's design or execution — analyzed the blood of 20 cyclists who were given water, plus either half a banana or 8 ounces of sports drink every 30 minutes during a 47-mile bike ride. Unlike the sports drinks, bananas were found to contain \" unique metabolites \" that \" knock down \" a gene promoting pain and inflammation after exercise, the same gene targeted by painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs, study author david nieman tells men's health. \" to our pleasant surprise, we found something natural in bananas is working like [ painkillers ] but without the risks \" of cell damage that promotes inflammation, nieman says, noting it's not yet clear how this works. There was one downside to snacking on bananas, though: \" quite a bit of bloating, \" nieman tells the times. ( gatorade has gone organic. )",

It found that a banana, with its all-natural package, provides comparable or greater anti-inflammatory and other benefits for athletes than sports drinks. But there may be a downside, and it involves bloating. For decades, athletes and their advisers have believed, and studies have confirmed, that eating or drinking carbohydrates during prolonged exertion can enable someone to continue for longer or at higher intensities and recover more quickly afterward than if he or she does not eat during the workout."

The yongbyon reactor was shut down as part of a 2007 aid-for-disarmament deal, and experts believe it will take north korea at least a year to get its only source of plutonium operational again, the wall street journal reports. Ap notes that the reactor can make one bomb's worth of plutonium a year. In a weekend speech whose transcript was published today, kim jong un referred to nukes as a necessary element in the country's quest to improve its economy, notes the new york times: \" now that we have become a proud nuclear state, we have gained a favorable ground from which we can concentrate all our finance and efforts in building the economy and improving the people's lives based on the strong deterrent against war, \" he said. But war is exactly what un secretary-general ban ki-moon fears, reports the ap; he today expressed concerns that north korea is \" on a collision course with the international community \" and that \" the current crisis has already gone too far. \" he pushed for international negotiations.",

        "summary": "\" i want to sincerely apologize to each and every one of our users, \" reuters quotes former yahoo ceo marissa mayer as saying. Mayer testified in front of the senate commerce committee wednesday regarding two massive data breaches at yahoo. In 2013, all 3 billion yahoo accounts were hacked in what cnn reports was the largest data breach in history. Mayer says yahoo, which originally said only 1 billion accounts were affected, didn't find out about the hack until it got data from the government in 2016 and still hasn't figured out how it happened, though she says russian intelligence officers have launched attacks on yahoo systems. A breach in 2014 affected 500 million yahoo accounts and, in a first, led to the us government criminally charging two russian spies for cyber crimes. One senator calls wednesday's testimony, which also featured equifax executives, \" discouraging \" because the companies don't appear to believe there's anything they can do to truly protect their users, cnbc reports. \" the threat from state-sponsored attacks has changed the playing field so dramatically that today i believe all companies, even the most well defended ones, could fall victim to these crimes, \" mayer says. Sen. Richard blumenthal of connecticut says enforcing punishments for data breaches on executives like mayer could motivate companies to protect users'data. Mayer left yahoo over the summer with nearly $ 260 million in stock and severance. \" you harm consumers and you walk away with the amount of money that a small city or county uses for their annual operating budget, \" sen. Brian schatz of hawaii says, calling it \" unfathomable. \"",

At least one man in the extended video clip is shown holding a weapon, but one other appears to be clutching a bottle of booze, reports the new york times; several others look like they're videotaping the entire scene on their cellphones.

        "summary": "The world's biggest refugee camp has more people than some countries — and kenya has decided it is time for them to go back where they came from, war or no war. The country's government announced wednesday that it plans to shut down the dadaab camp, which holds around 330,000 somali refugees, as part of a plan to send all 600,000 refugees in the country elsewhere, the ap reports. The government claims the sprawling camp complex in the country's northeast harbors al-shabab militants who have launched at least three attacks from dadaab. In other developments: interior minister joseph nkaissery says weapons were smuggled through the camp and it is being closed for \" pressing national security \" reasons, the guardian reports. \" the refugees will be repatriated to their countries of origin or to third-party countries for resettlement, \" the minister told reporters in nairobi. They have been given until may 2017 to leave dadaab. John kerry says he is worried about the decision to close the camp, and he wants kenya to continue its \" leadership role in protecting and sheltering victims of violence and trauma, consistent with its international obligations. \" the government had spoken earlier of also closing the kakuma camp, which mostly houses refugees from south sudan, but it appears to have been given a reprieve because it is not considered a security risk, reports the guardian. Close to a dozen international organizations, including amnesty international, have urged kenya to reconsider. \" this reckless decision by the kenyan government is an abdication of its duty to protect the vulnerable and will put thousands of lives at risk, \" amnesty regional director muthoni wanyeki tells the independent. Foreign affairs secretary karanja kibicho admits the move will \" have adverse effects on the lives of refugees \" and says \" the international community must collectively take responsibility on humanitarian needs that will arise out of this action. \" human rights watch rep leslie leftow tells the los angeles times that the government is scapegoating somali refugees, who fled war and famine for the camps, which are mostly tents and huts that lack indoor plumbing. \" it's a miserable existence, and no one would seek to extend people's lives there indefinitely unless the alternative is worse, \" leftow says. At south africa's daily maverick, simon allison calls the move \" cynical electioneering \" from president uhuru kenya, and predicts that logistics alone will make it impossible. \" how would kenya go about transporting nearly 600,000 people into active war zones like somalia without their co-operation? \" he wonders.

A study published in the journal of the royal society of medicine warns that consumers who buy breast milk online not only have to worry about unpasteurized, untested milk that could breed bacteria, but also that they could be putting themselves at risk for catching contagious diseases, per the independent. Study author sarah steele warns that these potentially dangerous viruses — either contracted before a lactating mother gives birth or even from her sexual activity afterward — \" could unwittingly \" be transmitted to consumers. Women pumping for profit may not use sterilized equipment or sanitize correctly, steele writes, and the milk might not be stored or transported properly, per sky. And the supposedly protein-rich drink ( which steele contends actually has less protein than cow's milk ) increasingly craved by athletes such as bodybuilders can be chock-full of other contaminants as well: \" alcohol, drugs ( both prescription and illicit ), tobacco, and caffeine pass into the milk alongside other environmental contaminants, meaning chemicals and toxins … that those seeking'to eat clean ' are themselves shunning, \" she writes. If all this fails to convince, steele notes there's been nothing proving the benefits, stating that \" no scientific study evidences that direct adult consumption of human milk for medicinal properties offers anything more than a placebo effect. \" ( there is breast milk jewelry, though, if you're interested. )",

The number of new jobs added in march was revised way down, from an already-disappointing initial estimate of 126,000 to 85,000, which is the worst number we've seen since june 2012, the wall street journal reports. As for february, its number was revised from 264,000 to 266,000 — \" a minor improvement that in no way makes up for the march mess, \" writes erik holm. So far this year, the average number of jobs added each month is sitting at 193,000 — compared to 2014's average of 260,000. The ap notes that the 5.4 % unemployment rate is a seven-year low, but as paul vigna points out at the journal, the labor force participation rate remained largely unchanged at 62.8 %, about where it's sat for the past year — meaning that \" there are millions of people out there, still, years after the official end of the recession, who aren't working or looking for work. \" if we had a higher participation rate, say, what it was in 2006, \" the unemployment rate would be a couple of full percentage points higher. \"",

The post's article — apparently based on documents, radio transmissions, and interviews with key white house players — reports that the secret service didn't even realize bullets had hit windows near the obama residence until a housekeeper found broken glass four days later. By then, the gunman had nearly gotten away. It started on the evening of nov. 11, 2011, when oscar ortega-hernandez, 21, parked on constitution avenue and hit the upstairs residence of the white house with at least seven bullets. Witnesses say he frantically drove off, smashed his car, and fled on foot, while secret service supervisors believed the gunfire had come from a washington gang fight. Among the post's findings: witnesses saw the attack happen. \" driver in front of my cab, stopped and fired 5 gun shots at the white house, \" tweeted a woman in a cab. \" it took the police a while to respond. \" two secret service officers near constitution avenue ran to the shooting area and smelled fresh gunpowder, but received a call from a supervising agent telling them to stand down. \" shots fired, \" one of the officers radioed back, to no avail. Secret service officer carrie johnson heard shots from her position under the truman balcony but didn't challenge superior officers \" for fear of being criticized, \" she later admitted. The president and michelle obama were outraged when they heard about bullet holes in the white house four days later. Michelle gave then-secret service director dan sullivan a tongue-lashing that could be heard from the next room, sources say, although sullivan \" disputed this account of the meeting, \" the post reports.

But less well-known are those against his 2012 mayoral opponent, carl demaio. When both men were serving on the san diego city council, the council's then-president ben hueso says demaio would often leave meetings to masturbate in the men's room, according to the voice of oc. Hueso, now a democratic state senator, says he personally walked in on demaio, a republican, twice. \" he jumped, caught by surprise. He jumped to the sink... Saying ' i ' m sorry, i ' m sorry ' about six times. Then washed his hands, darted out, \" says hueso. Hueso didn't file a complaint at the time, and though others claim they suspected something was going on, they had not witnessed anything. Demaio, who is openly gay, is planning on running for a us congress seat in 2014, but there is speculation he might instead run for mayor again, now that filner is going. A spokesperson for demaio denies the allegations. \" there is no other way to respond to this than to call it what it is: a lie, \" he says, per the daily caller. \" ben hueso and his union allies ignored bob filner's serial sexual harassment to keep carl from winning the mayor's race and now he's manufacturing a lie to stop carl's momentum. \" demaio is expected to announce whether he will run for mayor sometime this week, reports cbs 8.",

Former assemblyman nathan fletcher and tobiah pettus both ran last year in a campaign that filner ultimately won. Fletcher, now an executive at qualcomm, gained nearly 24 percent of the vote in the june 2012 primary election, but that was not enough to make the runoff. He made a splash during the campaign when, after he failed to secure an endorsement by the republican party of san diego county, he turned independent. Later, he reregistered as a democrat. Pettus gained 0.71 percent of the primary votes. Earlier friday, city attorney jan goldsmith said he did not plan to run for mayor in the special election. He was just reelected",

Cannes organizers did not mention the weinstein scandal or blanchett's commitment to the fight against sexual harassment. \" i have been to cannes in many guises over the years; as an actress, producer, in the marketplace, the gala-sphere, and in competition, \" blanchett said. \" but never solely for the sheer pleasure of watching the cornucopia of films this great festival harbors.

Some 85 firefighters spent hours early monday morning battling the fire at the 16,000-square-foot castle-like home, using tanker trucks and a fire boat because there were no hydrants near the secluded property, cnn reports. Firefighters who tried to enter unburned areas had to retreat as both the floor and roof collapsed, officials say. The pyles and their grandchildren are unaccounted for and if \" you look at the damage, you know, it would not be a stretch to think that if there were occupants that they did not survive the fire, \" a fire department spokesman says. The cause of the blaze is unknown, and because of the size of it, up to 20 atf agents will be assisting the county fire department — which says foul play is not suspected — in its investigation, reports the baltimore sun. Pyle, 55, was coo at sciencelogic, a cybersecurity firm that monitors networks for clients, including the pentagon, the washington post reports.

Wedding experts run down the costs for the new york daily news, from $ 600,000 air-conditioned tents to the $ 150-a-pop invitations and $ 100 place settings for each of the 500 guests. At the more conservative $ 3 million estimate, the total cost comes to $ 6,000 per guest. But it's not all designer dresses, fancy food, and $ 15,000 port-a-potties ( yes, $ 15,000 for \"outhouses \" that are much nicer than your bathroom at home — tmz has pictures ). Because of the high-profile nature of the event, security will probably run at least $ 200,000 ( even though the white house confirms president obama won't attend ) — or more if they opt to shut down air space or pay police to monitor traffic.

One day before president obama gives a speech related to us drone strategy, attorney general eric holder sent a letter to congress acknowledging that the us has killed four americans in such strikes. That includes the highly publicized killing of us-born cleric anwar al-awlaki in yemen in 2011. He was the only one of the four directly targeted, and holder said the move was justified because awlaki had planned — and was continuing to plan — specific attacks on the us. In particular, holder cited the failed plot to blow up an airliner on christmas eve in 2009. ( you can read the letter via the new york times. ) the other three were samir khan, who was killed in the awlaki attack; awlaki's 16-year-old son, who was killed in a subsequent strike on another target; and jude kennan mohammad, a native of florida who later lived in north carolina. Mohammad was apparently killed in pakistan in 2011, and his death had been the subject of unconfirmed rumors since, reports the times.

In effect, this appears to be a step away from the less restricted use of force allowed in war zones and toward the more limited use of force for self-defense allowed outside of armed conflict. In the speech he will give on thursday at the national defense university, mr. Obama will also renew his long-stalled effort to close the prison at guantánamo bay, cuba. Officials said they would make a fresh push to transfer detainees to home countries and lift the ban on sending some back to yemen. The president plans to reappoint a high-level state department official to oversee the effort to reduce the prison population.

The staten island republican — who is a former member of the fbi himself — has faced an ongoing federal investigation into his campaign finances. The expected indictment, however, deals with his restaurant, which has links to a celebrity rabbi whose backers gave grimm's 2010 campaign more than $ 500,000, the post reports; the restaurant has also been fined over worker pay. Employees have sued the upper east side's healthalicious, saying it failed to pay them fairly and dodged rules by paying in cash. The campaign finance question centers on the restaurant's ties to israeli fundraiser ofer biton, who acted as an intermediary for grimm and celeb rabbi yoshiyahu yosef pinto. Pinto's many followers were key to grimm's success in 2010. There are also allegations of a straw-donor scheme run by a houston businesswoman. Cbs 2 reports that grimm — who made headlines not long ago for threatening a reporter — will be charged with fraud.

But in their letter, critics ( listed here ) say reporters have: ignored \" extensive previous research \" in the area. Sensationalized the find by focusing on the \" white city \" legend.

Another professor calls it \" a colonialist discourse which disrespects \" indigenous people. But national geographic defends its coverage, and the expedition's top us archaeologist maintains that the site was \" relatively undisturbed \" when they found it. Meanwhile, a cornell professor says the colonialist-rhetoric charge \" strikes me as political correctness. \" what bothers him, he says, \" is that there's an awful lot that's known that national geographic left out \" — namely that the area is likely littered with similar sites.

Finally, on two consecutive days last week, he succeeded — and, on the second day, happened to have his camera rolling, reports the local. \" everything fell into place: the location, the light, and the calmness, \" nilsson says of friday's encounter in the varmland region. The resulting footage, which has since gone viral, shows a white moose crossing a small river and munching on foliage. According to the bbc, the animal is believed to be one of just 100 white moose in sweden. While some are albino, the one nilsson recorded is piebald, meaning its coloration is the result of a genetic mutation, per national geographic. Though clearly rare, one expert believes white moose may be increasing in number in sweden because hunters, apparently stunned by their beauty, tend to leave them in peace. Moose face few other predators in the country. But a local resident — whose apple tree is frequently visited by a white moose — says the animals are \" constantly chased and disturbed \" by non-hunters hoping for a glimpse of their white fur, per the local. That's bad news for both the moose and humans since moose \" can get aggressive, \" she says. Two white moose calves were spotted earlier this summer in norway, per nat geo. White moose have also been seen in alaska and in canada, where hunters are banned from killing moose that are more than 50 % white. ( pandas are piebald, too. )",

        "summary": "George zimmerman's parents are taking roseanne barr to court, accusing her of trying to get \" a lynch mob \" to their home by tweeting their address weeks after their son shot and killed trayvon martin. Barr soon deleted the tweet but later tweeted \" if zimmerman isn't arrested i ' ll rt his address again — maybe go 2 his house myself, \" reports usa today. Robert and gladys zimmerman, who are seeking unspecified damages, say the tweets forced them to go into hiding, even though george hadn't lived with them for years. Barr, however, tweeted the address on march 29, 2012, and the couple told the orlando sentinel on march 15 that they had already gone into hiding after receiving death threats, the paper notes. Their son, meanwhile, released an interview yesterday in which he denies being racist and says he is trying to be a good person, the ap reports. He says the interview is an attempt to \" show america who i truly am \" and speaks of someday becoming a defense attorney or civil rights lawyer. \" on a grand scale, i would like to make enough of an impact on the judicial system so that what happens to me never happens to anybody, \" he says.",
