Under cambodian law, it's now illegal for the country's women to marry foreigners who are age 50 and up, or who make less than $ 30,960 a year. Officials say the intention is to stamp out \" fake marriages and human trafficking. \" there is one loophole: said couples can bypass the law by getting married outside the country. Over-50 foreign women are free to snag a young cambodian hubby, adds the afp. Writing for global post, patrick winn notes that cambodia has made attempts to diminish its reputation as a hub for child brides before; in 2008, authorities briefly banned all foreign marriages.",

Schumacher is currently recovering \" slowly \" at his swiss estate with medical care that's estimated to cost about $ 185,000 a month, 9 news reports. The possibility that schumacher's helmet-mounted gopro could have been responsible for his injuries was floated as far back as february by the telegraph, which said that investigators suspected \" the presence of a solid object between a helmet colliding with a rock would weaken the structure \" ( schumacher hit his head on a rock after falling and the helmet reportedly split in two ). Whether moncet's assertion is based on actual confirmation from investigators or simply on the son's own beliefs has yet to be officially determined, but either way, gopro can't be happy about the news: business insider notes that gopro shares were down as much as 10 % in early trading today.",

He also went on the ellen degeneres show today to make his case, reports people. \" i don't know if any of you noticed, but there is some racial tension here and there, \" he said. \" i felt like when we were writing this song it wasn't necessarily up to the media … or talk radio or anything like that to deal with that anymore. I think it's music's turn to have the conversation. \" sample lyrics: \" [ i ' m ] just a proud rebel son with an ol ' can of worms/lookin ' like i got a lot to learn. \" to which ll cool j replies: \" if you don't judge my do-rag … i won't judge your red flag/if you don't judge my gold chains … i ' ll forget the iron chains. \" and a sample of the back and forth: it's racist, writes ta-nehisi coates at the atlantic. For one thing, paisley picked ll cool j for this? lots of rappers ( chuck d, krs-one, etc. ) have spent their careers trying to have a conversation about racism, but ll isn't one of them. \" the only real reason to call up ll is that he is black and thus must have something insightful to say about the confederate flag, \" writes coates. \" the assumption that there is no real difference among black people is exactly what racism is. \" click for the full post. It means well but is awful, writes james poniewozik at time. \" the major problem of ' accidental racist ' is also the major problem of a lot of well-intentioned punditry and journalism. To avoid alienating its audience — here, country-music fans — it sets up a string of false equivalencies. If one side has to bear some burden or confess some bad history, an equivalent must be found on the other side, because, well, it's only fair, even if it's not actually equivalent. \" click for the full post. Not so fast, argues erik nelson salon. \" paisley is doing something different here, and attention must be paid.

Deputy darren goforth was killed last night, in uniform, as he was pumping gas into his vehicle near houston. \" the male suspect came up behind him and shot the deputy multiple times, \" says deputy thomas gilliland, per the houston chronicle. The gunman continued to fire repeatedly after goforth fell to the ground, then fled in a pickup. Ktrk reports that police have taken a suspect into custody after converging on a home in copperfield. The 47-year-old goforth, who had a wife and two children, had investigated a car accident about a half-hour before the shooting, but authorities don't know if that had anything to do with his killing. Police describe the gunman as a dark-complexioned man in his 20s, based on surveillance video. \" in my 45 years in law enforcement, i can't recall another incident so cold-blooded and cowardly, \" says sheriff ron hickman.",

Ppp's numbers barely budged this week, with paul leading romney 24 % to 20 % and both comfortably ahead of the rest of the pack — gingrich is at 13 %, michele bachmann at 11 %, ricks perry and santorum tied at 10 %, and jon huntsman lagging with 4 %. What's more, voters actually believe the serial gadfly can win, with 29 % predicting a paul victory, compared to 15 % for romney. That roughly tracks with intrade, where betters are currently giving paul a 57.8 % chance of victory in the state, to 32.4 % for romney. Of course, iowa isn't everything; intrade still pegs romney's chances of winning the nomination at 74 %, to just 7.2 % for paul. And romney sure seems unconcerned about the prospect of losing iowa. \"i ' m not exactly sure how all this is going to work, but i think i ' m going to get the nomination if we do our job right, \" romney told new hampshire volunteers yesterday, according to the wall street journal. Another interesting tidbit from the poll: romney has apparently solved his fox news problem, leading amongst regular viewers with 27 %, ahead of gingrich at 16 %, bachmann at 15 %, and paul at 12 %.",

He retired several years later. A towering man with impeccable manners, he forged close friendships with his famous clients, among them liz taylor, jackie kennedy, and princess grace of monaco.

According to the pittsburgh post-gazette, the sixth grader was unresponsive but still breathing when paramedics arrived and administered narcan, an opioid-blocking drug. The girl was then sedated after becoming combative, and rushed to a nearby children's hospital in critical condition. The girl is now in stable condition, reports trib live. Multiple bags of heroin were found in the girl's bedroom, where the overdose occurred, and at least one was open. The child's 20-year-old sister says the family did not know the girl was using drugs or where she got them, and hadn't noticed unusual behavior. She described her sister as outgoing and social at school, where she received good grades. A neighbor echoed the family's shock over the incident, stating, \"this little girl has played play-doh down here with my granddaughter. She's not that kind of kid. That's not that kind of family. \" while opioid overdoses are rising in allegheny county, penn., with 74 deaths recorded so far this year in pittsburgh ( compared to 130 total in 2016 ), experts say this incident is an outlier and that the us is not in the midst of a childhood epidemic. \"opioid use in teens is still up from where it was 10 years ago, \" says dr.

Neil capretto, medical director of gateway rehabilitation. \"it's not uncommon for us to, on a regular basis, treat 17 or 18 year olds. \" but he said the 11-year-old beechview girl who was revived with an overdose-reversal drug wednesday is still an outlier. \"we get some younger than that — 15, 16 years old, \" he said. \"i can think of at least three 14-year-olds over the years who were doing ( intravenous ) heroin. But that's more the exception. \" police and paramedics responded to the home on palm beach avenue shortly before 6 p.m. Wednesday, according to public safety spokeswoman emily schaffer.

            "Sign up for one of our email newsletters. The story of an 11-year-old pittsburgh girl who overdosed on heroin this week drew shock and outrage nationally, but the takeaway from one local addiction expert is twofold: it's not as uncommon as one might think, but there is no epidemic of childhood heroin addicts. \"it's still up — opioid use in teens is still up from where it was 10 years ago, \" said dr. Neil capretto, medical director of gateway rehabilitation. \"it's not uncommon for us to, on a regular basis, treat 17 or 18 year olds. \" but he said the 11-year-old beechview girl who was revived with an overdose-reversal drug wednesday is still an outlier. \"we get some younger than that — 15, 16 years old, \" he said. \"i can think of at least three 14-year-olds over the years who were doing ( intravenous ) heroin. But that's more the exception. \" police and paramedics responded to the home on palm beach avenue shortly before 6 p.m. Wednesday, according to public safety spokeswoman emily schaffer. Paramedics administered narcan. The girl initially was taken to children's hospital of pittsburgh of upmc in critical condition, though she has since been upgraded to stable condition, schaffer said friday afternoon.

He was among several engineers who tried to stop the launch of the space shuttle challenger, saying the booster rockets ' rubber seals wouldn't seal correctly in cold weather.

You picked a loser. ' \" soon after the shuttle disaster, ebeling quit his job, daughter kathy ebeling tells the washington post. He spent the rest of his career working on a bird refuge, \" helping people and not destroying people, \" she says. But ebeling's burden has lightened lately thanks to support from fellow engineers and vindication from some of those involved in launching the challenger, npr writes in a follow-up. \" your efforts show that your care for people comes first for you, \" writes engineer jim sides. \" god didn't pick a loser. He picked bob ebeling. \" robert lund, a thiokol vp who approved the launch, called ebeling and said, \" you did all that you could do. \" george hardy, a former nasa official involved in the launch, sent ebeling a letter: \" you and your colleagues did everything that was expected of you, \" he writes. \" you should not torture yourself with any assumed blame. \" ebeling, who suffers from prostate cancer and has home hospice care, says he \" know[ s ] that is the truth that my burden has been reduced. \" kathy ebeling says the letters have helped her father find peace. \" he doesn't have to die with this nagging guilt, \" she tells the post. \" he can die free. \"",

The virginia woman wrote it after signing her bolognese puppy up for a $ 175 basic obedience class with burke, va., business dog tranquility. After starting the class in january, ujimori was upset her then-4-pound dog, who she was trying to socialize, was in the same class with older, bigger dogs and was kept in a separate area, the washington post reports. She asked for a pro-rated refund but never got one, posted the aforementioned review plus a similarly negative one on angie's list, and was hit with the defamation lawsuit from dog tranquility owner colleen dermott. In the yelp section listing dog tranquility reviews removed for violating \" content guidelines or terms of service, \" there are three from a \" j u. \"; one was made jan. 28, the other two march 14. The bad reviews hurt, says dermott, a 31-year-old mother and military wife: \" i have to rely on these review sites as a major source of advertising. \" dermott says ujimori was told in advance about the makeup of the class and the gated-off area, signed a contract that specifies there are no refunds, and didn't accept her offer of a credit for a future class. Ujimori is publicly fighting the suit because she believes legislators should pass laws against such suits, which she says have \" a chilling effect on first amendment rights. \" as for dermott, her attempt to bolster her yelp score appears to have had the opposite effect: her business's page is now inundated with reviews like \" this business sues it's [ sic ] customers if they write bad reviews. \" ( a similar lawsuit was filed over a hotel review. )",

And that's bad news for cotton producers and investors alike. According to fibre2fashion, government intervention over the past few years caused production of cotton to skyrocket. This year will see the second largest inventory of cotton ever, with 35 % more of the product than its 10-year average, bloomberg reports. Coupled with increased production is a shrinking demand for cotton, partly due to more consumers choosing synthetic fibers. China — which had been the world's biggest user of cotton — cut its import of the product by 30 % this has all added up to cotton being at its lowest price in five years, the ap reports. At that price, most north american farmers will lose money. It's gotten so bad that alabama's governor applied for disaster assistance to help cotton farmers last month. \" cotton's an interesting animal, \" one farmer says. \" it's been in a particular sort of slump the last couple of years. It will rebound. \" others aren't so sure. \" to get excited about the cotton market, we will need to see either a weather event or something else that really changes the northern hemisphere producers ' mind about growing cotton, \" one commodities expert tells bloomberg.

Notwithstanding a slew of support measures by governments across the world that touched a record $ 10.4 billion in 2014-2-15, production of cotton was below demand, icac said in a statement released at the conclusion of its 4-day 74th plenary meeting in mumbai. Large stocks accumulated as a result of governments ' intervention from 2011-12 to 2014-15 would remain the key factor in determining the fundamentals of the cotton market for the foreseeable future, it said observing that demand for cotton continues to expand at a slow rate as a result of sluggish world economic growth and strong competition from synthetic fibers, especially polyester. In order to improve the prospects for cotton, the icac endorsed the recommendations of its private sector advisory panel, foremost being to ensure that fiber-content labels on textile products were more visible so that consumers could make informed choices, and also promote transparency in the supply chain. The committee also favoured conducting a study on the economic factors underlying the growth of polyester production and demand, to enable members to better understand the dynamics of competition among fibers. It also advised members to encourage an increased diversification of the uses of cotton, including composites and technical textiles, and a wider use of cotton by-products throughout the value chain, to add value to the sector. The committee endorsed the recommendation received from the private sector advisory panel ( psap ) regarding the need to standardize phytosanitary certificates and recommended that the secretariat work with members to raise awareness of this issue within the world trade organization. The icac was informed that although contractual disputes had decreased in the last year, improvements were required in the enforcement of arbitration awards. All members of the committee are signatories of the 1958 convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards ( commonly known as the new york convention ), but claimants were often unable to get their awards enforced, which was impacting the cotton trade and consumption.

It abandons the previous films ' conceits, but \" by playing things completely chronologically — and worse, soberly — this film's shenanigans feel witlessly arbitrary. \" \" i beg of you, don't ask me to choose between hangover ii and iii, \" writes kyle smith at the new york post. \" that would be like asking a mother to choose between her children, assuming she hated her children, never wanted to see them again and wished they'd never been born in the first place. \" half the characters in this one \" stand around being boring, \" and zach galifianakis \" hasn't made me laugh since 2007. \" \" the movie is so aggressively nasty and barely funny \" that it comes across as \" self-loathing and self-destructive, \" writes mary pols at time. Animals are variously shot, smothered, and drugged, and the thing's drenched in homophobia and racism against asians. \" the hangover part iii is such a misery that when mr. Chow directs the wolfpack to'stay low, like dog ' it might as well be the film's motto. \" but bill goodykoontz at the arizona republic is willing to at least give it this much: unlike the horrendous second movie, \" this time, it seems like they're trying. A little, at least. \" the plot's a mess, but \" seriously, does it matter? no, it does not.

According to the dea, osorio de serna, who is believed to be around 65 years old, is wanted on suspicion of money laundering and cocaine conspiracy. The chronicle reports she is \" believed to be a major player in colombia's former medellin cartel. \" and that's about all anyone knows about her. \" she is practically a ghost, \" the chronicle quotes bbc mundo. So how did osorio de serna find herself as the dea's most wanted fugitive? well... She probably didn't, according to insight crime. Bbc mundo based its story entirely on osorio de serna's spot on the dea's sparsely populated list of wanted international fugitives. In fact, the list contains only one other person: a man who goes by \" coach \" and is wanted in connection with heroin distribution. The dea admits the list is incomplete, and insight crime found a number of other fugitive lists that contradict each other or are noticeably out of date. On top of that, osorio de serna has no criminal record in colombia, isn't apparently wanted by colombian authorities, and has no reward issued for her by the us government. \" ultimately, the bbc mundo story tells us less about about a shadowy figure in colombia's underworld than it does about the organizational weaknesses of us anti-drug authorities, \" writes insight crime's david gagne.",

London researchers have identified a gene that causes hair to lose its natural color, reports the bbc. The culprit is called irf4, and the revelation comes from the most comprehensive study of its kind involving more than 6,000 people from five different countries and different backgrounds. \" we already know several genes involved in balding and hair color but this is the first time a gene for graying has been identified in humans, \" says lead author kaustubh adhikari of university college london. Don't look for a magic pill anytime soon, but the discovery at least points scientists in the right direction. As cnn explains: \" if more studies can confirm the role of this cellular pathway in graying, researchers could look for proteins or enzymes that might be lacking in the pathway among those salt-and-pepper cases and perhaps find a way to supplement them with a pill or cream. \" the study in nature communications also identified genes related to curly hair, beard thickness, eyebrow thickness, and, yes, the monobrow, reports medical daily. The findings might have more serious uses beyond cosmetics, notes popular science.

The move was based on tests showing the epa-registered pesticide, which mimics extracts from the chrysanthemum flower, prevented tick and other insect bites. Three decades later, it still holds up to scrutiny, according to cdc researchers. They let black-legged, lone star, and american dog ticks loose on 10 types of permethrin-treated clothing and saw speedy effects, as described in a recent issue of the journal of medical entomology. Juvenile black-legged ticks died in less than a minute, while others started \" rolling \" away, researcher lars eisen tells npr. Per american veterinarian, all ticks saw \" loss of normal movement, \" meaning they were unable to bite, when left in contact with the clothing for up to five minutes. Though some seem concerned about the safety of permethrin-treated clothing, the epa says it is \" unlikely to pose any significant immediate or long-term hazard to people wearing it. \" getting the pesticide on your skin results in only minor irritation, per the national pesticide information center. In a wired article headlined, \" we have no idea how bad the us tick problem is, \" megan molteni argues that \" protective clothing, repellants, and daily partner tick-checks \" are \" better than nothing \" at preventing the spread of tick-borne illnesses like lyme disease and rocky mountain spotted fever. \" but with more and more people getting sick, the us will need better solutions soon, \" molteni writes, pointing to a nationwide tick surveillance program being organized by the cdc.

Birds have been found dead of unnatural causes in 16 chicken houses at six farms that grow chickens for pilgrims pride corp, the largest poultry producer in the united states, which laid off some 60 people right before the killings began, clarendon county sheriff randy garrett said. The company has a processing plant in sumter, south carolina. About 325,000 chickens have been found dead at the farms since mid-february, garrett said. One farmer, w.l. Coker, lost the birds in eight chicken houses, or about 160,000 birds, he said. Authorities are searching for killers with a deep working knowledge of raising chickens, garrett said, adding that he believed the deaths of the chickens are related to the layoffs. Vandals bypassed alarms systems and raised or lowered temperature in the chicken houses, killing them, garrett said. \" depending on the age of the birds, they knew whether to jack the heat up or jack the heat off, \" garrett said. Young birds need more heat, and older ones need less, he said. \" they had all that knowledge of the farms and how many weeks growth the chickens were, \" garrett said. Garrett said his office has contacted u.s. Department of agriculture authorities and state police. Pilgrim's pride said in a statement that it was fully cooperating with authorities. \" these unfortunate, yet apparently deliberate acts show a blatant disregard for the welfare of the chickens and the livelihood of the family farmers involved, \" the statement said.

        "summary": "Researchers in brazil say they've found a way to curb shark attacks without culling sharks — which, if true, is good news for conservationists who oppose lethal means of controlling sharks in south africa and australia, livescience reports. The brazilian program was tried off and on for nearly 10 years after shark attacks spiked in 1992, possibly because a newly constructed port complex upset their habitat. Instead of following the south african and australian method of using gill nets — which often suffocate sharks to death and ensnare other marine animals — state officials opted to capture sharks, take them to deep waters, and let them go. They did this by deploying fishing lines that hooked sharks ( and other sea life ) along a 12-mile sweep of shoreline in northeastern brazil, science reports. A crew often checked the lines for possibly dangerous sharks like black tips, tiger sharks, and bull sharks, and motored them away in saltwater tanks on a boat. Over 73 months, they caught 1,121 animals, 7 % of which were shark species worth relocating; 60 % of them survived the process, as did 78 % of other marine life that was caught and released. The tactic may not work everywhere, researchers admit, but it did reduce shark attacks around the city of recife, brazil, from 0.289 per month to 0.014 per month. What's more, reports mother nature network, the study authors write that relocated sharks \" did not move back to nearshore waters off recife... And did not experience post-release mortality. \" ( read about a surge of great whites near a cape cod town. )",

No recording could be released and the paper could not characterize its conversation with the president. Editor rick green is concerned: just four days before the register's presidential endorsement is released, laura hollingsworth and i received a phone call from the president. He was calling from florida, on the heels of a morning campaign appearance and about 14 hours after his debate with gop nominee mitt romney at lynn university in boca raton, fla. The conference call lasted nearly 30 minutes and was an incredibly informative exchange of questions, answers and an insightful glimpse into the president's vision for a second term"

The drones, dubbed the \" shooting stars, \" did not communicate with each other but were controlled by a person using a single computer with technology that maker intel says can be used to operate fleets of more than 10,000 drones, techcrunch reports. The basketball-sized intel drones are a new, simple type of drone \" designed for entertainment purposes such as festivals and entertainment events \" and are capable of creating up to 4 billion color combinations, intel says in a press release. Because of faa and super bowl restrictions, as well as the unpredictability of the weather, the stunning drone show was pre-recorded earlier in the week. The drones were also used to create a pepsi logo. Federal regulations, including one that states drone operators must be in sight of the aircraft at all times, limit the applications of drone fleet technology for now, but its creators say they can see a future that goes far beyond entertainment. \" i see them searching for a lost hiker with multiple drones at night with the right payloads looking for them, \" the leader of intel's drone team tells wired. \" or search and rescue efforts after a landslide, when it's hard to get people on the ground. \"",

            "The best super bowl halftime shows leave indelible memories, be it a notorious wardrobe malfunction, that goofy left shark, or every last second of beyoncé's two appearances. It's too soon to say whether anything lady gaga did tonight will resonate, but at least she offered something new: an army of dancing drones, ducking and dodging over the houston skyline, transforming from stars to a fluttering flag. It's probably the first time you've seen 300 drones flying in formation, but it's almost certainly not the last. The technology underpinning the intel shooting star drone system is fascinating in and of itself, but its potential applications are even more so. The same drones that accompanied lady gaga will one day revolutionize search-and-rescue, agriculture, halftime shows, and more. First, though, let's focus on the fun stuff. Drone show performing for a global audience of about 160 million or so people represents this drone platform's biggest stage, but intel has done this before. The company's shooting star drone squad recently finished a three-week run at disney world, and last year 500 synchronized drones flew in sydney, setting the highly specific world record for \" most unmanned aerial vehicles airborne simultaneously. \" each drone is about a foot long square, weighs just over",
            "There were 300 drones dancing behind lady gaga during the super bowl halftime show. They're called shooting stars and were previously used in a holiday show at disney world. These hundreds of shooting star drones flash, fall and flock in unison and are all controlled by one person — or rather one computer.

            "The best super bowl halftime shows leave indelible memories, be it a notorious wardrobe malfunction, that goofy left shark, or every last second of beyoncé's two appearances. It's too soon to say whether anything lady gaga did tonight will resonate, but at least she offered something new: an army of dancing drones, ducking and dodging over the houston skyline, transforming from stars to a fluttering flag. It's probably the first time you've seen 300 drones flying in formation, but it's almost certainly not the last. The technology underpinning the intel shooting star drone system is fascinating in and of itself, but its potential applications are even more so. The same drones that accompanied lady gaga will one day revolutionize search-and-rescue, agriculture, halftime shows, and more. First, though, let's focus on the fun stuff. Drone show performing for a global audience of about 160 million or so people represents this drone platform's biggest stage, but intel has done this before. The company's shooting star drone squad recently finished a three-week run at disney world, and last year 500 synchronized drones flew in sydney, setting the highly specific world record for \" most unmanned aerial vehicles airborne simultaneously. \" each drone is about a foot long square, weighs just over",
            "There were 300 drones dancing behind lady gaga during the super bowl halftime show. They're called shooting stars and were previously used in a holiday show at disney world. These hundreds of shooting star drones flash, fall and flock in unison and are all controlled by one person — or rather one computer. This is the latest project in intel's quest to take drones from individuals to fleets. This is ender's game brought to life.

        "summary": "A 22-year-old colombia woman who went to the doctor with abdominal pains turned out to have a potato growing in her vagina — because she'd put it there as contraception, says colombia reports via metro. \" my mom told me that if i didn't want to get pregnant, i should put a potato up there, and i believed her, \" the woman was quoted as telling a local website. The embarrassed patient, from the central colombian town of honda, says she had inserted the potato about two weeks before the pain struck in her lower abdomen. Upon closer inspection, attending nurse carolina rojas found potato roots sticking out of the woman's vagina and even growing inside her. Luckily the potato was removed without surgery, and medical staff predicted no long-term physical effects, but rojas blamed the mother for giving her daughter such bad advice. The story is part of an ongoing battle over birth control and sex education in colombia, where activists say a macho culture and disinterest in common birth control methods have led to high teen pregnancy rates. Indeed, sex ed classes introduced in the 1990s inspired some parents to start groups opposing the lessons. But colombia isn't alone in trying odd birth-control methods, the huffington post reports: a survey of young british woman found that some used plastic wrap, latex gloves, and sandwich bags.

While \" lawrence exerts her usual magnetism \" and is able \" to infuse real warmth and feisty humor \" into the film, hornaday couldn't get over the plot that \" hinges on a morally dubious act that the filmmakers gloss over in a series of creepy justifications. \" the whole thing \" feels alternately dreary and patently derivative. \" stephanie zacharek thinks the movie leaves \" a sicker, darker, more truthful one crying to get out. \" but there's plenty to appreciate, she writes at time, calling it \" two-thirds of an amazing movie. \" john wenzel applauds the \" sleek imagery \" and \" cutting commentary on technology's role in alienating people in a crowded society \" at the denver post.

        "summary": "Think your child's picky eating is just a phase? there might be more going on than what isn't meeting his or her mouth. In a new duke university study, scientists who analyzed 917 children aged 2 to 6, then interviewed parents about kids ' eating habits and signs of psychiatric issues, found about 20 % were picky eaters. Of those, nearly 18 % were moderately picky and 3 % were considered severely selective, reports smithsonian. Moderately picky eaters showed a spike in symptoms of adhd and separation anxiety and were more likely to show signs of social anxiety and depression. But severely selective eaters were seven times more likely to have social anxiety, twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression, and twice as likely to have behavior problems, report the new york times and guardian. When researchers followed up with 187 participants after two years, they found picky eaters were twice as likely to show increased symptoms of anxiety. This means \" selective eating isn't something that should just be disregarded, \" a researcher says, noting picky eaters could be diagnosed with an eating disorder known as avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Still, most parents don't need to panic. \" the children we're talking about are not just misbehaving kids who refuse to eat their broccoli, \" a researcher notes in a press release. Instead, they require separate meals or are unable to eat outside the home, like at birthday parties or a cafeteria. She adds there's no proof that picky eating actually causes psychological issues, only that there's a link between the two. Researchers say some children's fussy eating may stem from heightened senses and warn that parents forcing kids to eat certain foods or worrying too much about what they eat can be harmful. It's important to create positive experiences around food, they say. If parents have \" tried everything, \" professional help could be an option. ( you might want to avoid midnight snacks. )",

        "summary": "A german man in court on tuesday essentially admitted being \" one of the world's most prolific serial killers, \" as the bbc puts it. That he was a killer was already known: niels hoegel, a 41-year-old former nurse, is currently serving a life sentence in connection with the murders and attempted murders of six of his patients. During that trial, he mentioned intentionally using drugs to cause cardiac arrests in scores of patients in order to then revive them; that led authorities to exhume 130 bodies. He's now accused of killing 36 in oldenburg — where his current trial opened tuesday — and 64 in delmenhorst over the years 1999 and 2005. When asked by the judge in oldenburg if the charges that he murdered 100 people were largely true, hoegel answered \" yes, \" per the ap, which reports german defendants don't formally plead their guilt or innocence. \" what i have admitted took place, \" he said, per the afp. The ap reports on the implications of this trial and hoegel's hope for freedom: sentences in germany aren't served consecutively, and those serving life are generally up for parole after 15 years. More convictions could impact his chance of parole. \" the aim is for hoegel to stay in custody as long as possible, \" says a rep from the patients ' families, who added \" we... Expect hoegel to be convicted of another 100 killings. \" the afp notes officials think the true toll could be closer to 200, but because many patients were cremated, the true count will never be known. The trial isn't expected to wrap up until may. ( another nurse allegedly hurt infants in a wisconsin intensive care unit. )",

Authorities in los angeles say they've arrested a man believed to have raped and killed two women, then dumped their bodies near freeways in 2011, reports the los angeles times. Michelle lozano, 17, disappeared on easter of that year before her naked body was found stuffed in a plastic container off a freeway. She had been raped and strangled, reports the times. Then a day after christmas, 22-year-old bree ' anna guzman — who lived less than a mile away from lozano in lincoln heights — left family members to go to a drugstore and never returned. Her body turned up a month later off a freeway. She had died of blunt force trauma to the head. In 2014, police announced the killings were related, but the biggest break in the case came thursday, when authorities said they'd arrested geovanni borjas, 32, per fox 11. Police say a search of a statewide dna database showed borjas ' father was a relative of the killer. Officers soon eyed borjas — who has a domestic violence restraining order against him — and collected his dna when he spit on a sidewalk. Police say the sample was an exact match to dna collected in both the case of lozano, who was acquainted with borjas, and guzman, who visited a medical clinic where he worked. At a hearing tuesday, borjas pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder, two counts of rape, and one count of kidnapping. He is being held without bail. ( familial dna solved this murder. )",

Geovanni borjas was arrested thursday at his home in torrance, los angeles police chief charlie beck said. Borjas was charged tuesday with two counts each of murder and forcible rape, along with a single count of kidnapping. The charges include the special circumstance allegations of multiple murders and murder during commission of a rape and a kidnapping. The allegations make borjas eligible for the death penalty, but prosecutors have not yet decided if they will seek a death sentence. Borjas pleaded not guilty, and is due back in court june 22, when a date will be set for a hearing to determine if there is enough evidence for him to stand trial. He remains jailed without bail.

Geovanni borjas was arrested thursday at his home in torrance, los angeles police chief charlie beck said. Borjas was charged tuesday with two counts each of murder and forcible rape, along with a single count of kidnapping.

There were no fatal attacks recorded before 1967, when, in events that became the subject of the book and documentary night of the grizzlies, two young women were killed in separate attacks on the same night.

While maduro guerra's threats against the white house are unlikely to come to fruition, reuters reports that trump's words could serve to further empower maduro. Maduro has often invoked the threat of an american invasion to justify unpopular economic policies. His predecessor, hugo chavez, did the same thing: claiming the us was threatening to steal venezuela's oil as a way to gin up popular support. Now, maduro's opponents and critics are afraid trump's talk will give weight to maduro's tactics as a time when their country's democracy is at risk.",

Bowe bergdahl faces an army court-martial on charges of desertion and misbehavior for allegedly walking out on his post in afghanistan in 2009, and now that donald trump is president, the 30-year-old says he won't get a fair trial. His attorneys filed a motion to dismiss shortly after trump's inauguration, in which they document 156 times trump has used the word \" traitor \" to describe bergdahl; the president has also referred to bergdahl as a \" son of a bitch \" and said he should have been executed. According to courthouse news, trump has even said he would be willing to execute bergdahl himself. Bergdahl's attorneys argue in their filing that trump has violated their client's right to due process as well as a military law against the unlawful influence of command by publicly deciding that bergdahl is guilty, before he's faced trial, and calling for unauthorized cruel and unusual punishment. They believe a potential military jury panel could be unfairly prejudiced by trump's comments, military.com reports. Bergdahl, who was captured after leaving his post and held as a taliban prisoner for five years before five guantanamo detainees were freed in exchange for his freedom, sought a pardon from barack obama before he left office, but the white house did not respond. Should bergdahl's charges not be dismissed, politico reports that his lawyers are considering calling trump as a witness during the court-martial, which is scheduled to start in april.",

But, per usa today, limbaugh added that trump — or any president — shouldn't wield \" dictatorial power over individual behavior \" and make businesses comply to his or her demands on how their employees should act. He added he didn't find it \" useful or helpful for any employee anywhere to be forced to do something because the government says they must. That scares [ the ] hell out of me. … we don't want the president being able to demand anybody that he's unhappy with behave in a way he requires. \" still, limbaugh chalks the nfl's reaction to it all as a \" win \" for trump, citing the fact that goodell sent a memo to all 32 teams saying he thinks everyone \" should stand \" and that the league is working on a plan to \" promote positive change in this country \" and \" move past this controversy. \" \" i ' m not so sure that if trump had not applied pressure, that they would have changed, \" limbaugh noted.",

More than 350 people, many refugees from eritrea, drowned, and european leaders promised action, reports the new york times. But when 243 passengers, again largely refugees from eritrea, were supposed to be aboard an italy-bound boat and disappeared without a trace less than a year later, on june 28, 2014, the press, and the world, turned a blind eye, reports eric reidy on medium. Reidy tries to follow the story of one eritrean woman named segen who was supposed to be on the \" ghost boat, \" which was to depart from libya. She survived the perilous journey across the country with her baby abigail in her arms; the last time her husband spoke with her was the day she was supposed to board the boat — if the refugees ever boarded it. Reidy notes that \"?experts say there would almost certainly be evidence \" of a maritime disaster so large, and there are no records of such a boat arriving in europe, sinking, or being aided. One activist heard word that the 243 were potentially being held in a tunisian jail; \" her findings were inconclusive. \" says segen's husband, who stayed in neighboring sudan with their now 4-year-old girl shalom: \" if you remember charlie hebdo in paris... The world stopped for 14 people, but white people, europeans, \" he says. \" but in our case, nothing …. Because we are black? i don't know why. It's really hard.

The assailant apparently shouted \" i am not a thief! \" or thought terral-calmes had called her 5-year-old daughter a thief, the bbc and the ap report. According to officials, the mother had undergone psychiatric counseling for \" serious \" problems and been accused by police of abandoning her teenage son. She'd also had little contact with school staff before today; her daughter has attended for only six weeks. The assailant was arrested at home not long after the attack. President hollande and the country's education minister condemned the killing, which rekindled a debate over school safety in france. While murders of french teachers are very rare, nearly half of 4,000 principals questioned in a study said they had endured insults, threats, or harassment last school year, often by parents who considered a child's punishment unfair. Some teachers say they're left unprotected, but one of them argues that closer parent-teacher bonds are the answer, and worsening economic conditions the cause, especially for poor immigrant families. Meanwhile, students who saw the attack are receiving counseling, and the attacker's daughter has been sent to social services. \" this is something that will stay with her forever, \" an official said. The slain teacher left behind two young daughters. ( read about a us student who was \" scared and depressed \" after going on a stabbing spree. )",

        "summary": "The endangered whooping crane population currently stands at only about 600 in all of north america — and shootings are cutting into that number. In the past few months, three of the continent's tallest birds, at some five feet, have been killed: two were apparently killed in november in kentucky, and one was found shot dead in southwestern louisiana on friday. The identities of the birds make a \" senseless act \" all the more \" devastating, \" says robert love of the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries. The kentucky pair were lifelong mates believed to be shot together but discovered five miles apart, the los angeles times reports. They may have been mistaken for sandhill cranes, legal to shoot at certain times of year in the state. In louisiana, two were actually shot, likely on thursday; the male is expected to survive and was due for surgery yesterday, though he may never fly again. He and the dead female had also developed a mating bond, love tells the ap, but they weren't old enough to produce an egg. That was expected to happen within a few years, and the two were the oldest pair among the state's 33 cranes. At least 19 cranes have been intentionally killed since 2001, activists tell the times; just 13 cranes are released into the wild per year. The deaths mark \" a huge loss in terms of finances, safeguarding the species, breeding potential, and emotion for the teams who have been working with the birds, \" says an activist. Love puts it bluntly: \" don't shoot big white birds. It's that simple. \" doing so can have big consequences: up to a $ 100,000 fine and a year behind bars.

        "summary": "\" what if the young murder victim no one has ever been able to identify has been seen by hundreds of millions of people in a beloved summer classic? \" it's a wild idea, but one joe hill just can't shake since seeing jaws on the big screen in 2015. Some 54 minutes in, a woman with a blue bandana over her auburn hair is briefly seen waiting to board a ferry in a non-frightening scene, per the washington post. Stephen king's son nonetheless got goosebumps. The comic book and horror writer had only recently been reading about the lady in the dunes, an unknown woman found brutally murdered in the sandy dunes of provincetown, mass., in late july 1974, while jaws was being filmed 100 miles away in martha's vineyard. The female extra in jaws was \" almost a twin of the figure \" presented in a composite sketch of the victim, hill tells esquire. The lady in the dunes was believed to be in her mid-20s to 30s when she was killed in late june or early july.

Better known by his pen name joe hill, the comic book and horror-thriller writer — and son of stephen king — watched with rapture. But 54 minutes in, he leapt out of his seat, his arms prickled with goosebumps and his heart pounding, at a scene that startled him for the first time despite the many times he had watched the movie.

Russia's investigative committee says alexander protopopov directed the deconstruction of a concrete highway in the sparsely populated komi region, where he was serving as prison service chief, between 2014 and 2015, reports afp. Some 7,000 slabs of reinforced concrete were \" dismantled and driven away \" over more than a year, delivered to a commercial company, and then sold, police allege, per the new york times. The road theft cost the government about $ 79,000. Protopopov, who won awards as prison chief for promoting \" spiritual unity \" — though the times notes it's not clear \" whether the unity was with the crews doing the illicit road work \" — was promoted to acting deputy chief of the national prison service last year. He faces up to 10 years in jail on charges of stealing state property. At least one other prison service official has been arrested, prosecutors say, noting more are believed to have participated. The head of a penal colony and a businessman are under investigation, reports the bbc. Corruption is known to riddle road construction in russia, where a 30-mile road built for the sochi olympics cost $ 8 billion.

        "summary": "It's official: lindsay lohan is back in rehab. Her lawyer says she's checked in, but, because apparently nothing can be simple in lohan's life, it's not clear the judge will actually accept the placement. Prosecutors need to sign off on the facility and didn't have time to investigate it and do so, so the judge gave them until next friday to make a decision. Until then, the judge said, lohan should stay at the facility, the ap reports. Oh, and this could be a problem: the facility's license has been revoked, tmz reports. Lohan was supposed to check in to a new york facility, but got upset when she learned it has a no-smoking policy, tmz reports. That's apparently what prompted her to switch to the as-yet-unapproved california facility, although making things even more complicated, there was also a florida facility in the mix at one point. And — what else would you expect — she missed her first flight to california and was very late for her second, last-minute flight, according to e!. But she ended up there, though father of the century michael lohan tells radar she was \" crying hysterically \" as she was boarding her plane because she wanted to go to the aforementioned florida facility instead.",

Today the district canceled the plan and promised to strike \" any reference to the holocaust ' not occurring ' \" from school assignments.

Michael fortney describes what happened before dawn in versailles, ky., on monday: an intruder entered a family's home, wandered about, then stabbed a sleeping kindergartner in the head a number of times \" with a large kitchen knife that he obtained in the house, \" per court documents. Those documents go on to state that logan tipton's 11-year-old sister woke up, saw the intruder, and tried to go after him. The children's father fought and ultimately held the man until police arrived; some of logan's siblings suffered minor cuts. The intruder has been identified as ronald exantus, 32, and police say he confessed to the crime. More mind-boggling still: exantus lives some 200 miles away, in indianapolis, and has no known connection to either the town or the family, reports the ap. The lexington-herald leader reports that the home's front door had been left unlocked and there was no sign of forced entry. Exantus is being held on $ 1 million bond on charges of murder and first-degree burglary following a monday hearing, after which his public defender told reporters, \" i feel certain he is mentally ill. \" she had previously told a judge that he was incoherent, reports wthr, which identifies exantus as a dialysis nurse who lived with his girlfriend and her three kids. Last night, a crowd that numbered into the hundreds met at the woodford county high school football field for a memorial, and joined in singing \" silent night. \" \" my son was terrified of the dark, \" says mom heather tipton, who often sang that song to 6-year-old logan, who would then \" go right to sleep. \" exantus will next be in court on monday. A gofundme campaign has been started to, among other things, cover \" moving expenses as logan's young brother and sisters do not want to go back into the home. \" ( another senseless killing just days before: a man hugged a 7-year-old at soccer practice, then killed her. )",

Six moderate republican senators voted with democrats to renew the recently expired benefits: kelly ayotte, susan collins, dan coats, dean heller, lisa murkowski, and rob portman. But even those senators want the extension to be paid for by spending cuts before the final vote later this week, the new york times reports. \" i voted to proceed with the debate, \" portman said, while collins revealed that she'd had a talk yesterday morning with president obama about paying for the bills. Harry reid almost held the vote last night, before john cornyn accused him of playing political games by holding the vote with 17 senators missing, in part because of weather delays.

        "summary": "Chris christie's personal jam continues today — take a gander at the newspaper covers he woke up to — in light of the traffic-jam scandal that emerged yesterday. One of the more damaging revelations: the sept. 9-13 lane closures on the george washington bridge, apparently ordered by christie aides, caused major delays to rescuers dealing with medical emergencies, according to a letter obtained by cnn. The day after the first huge jams in fort lee, nj, the ems director penned a letter to the town's mayor asking for help in altering the \" new traffic pattern, \" which had made minutes-long trips three times longer; forced an ambulance to jump a curb to evade traffic while trying to get to a car accident with multiple injuries; impeded the search for a missing 4-year-old girl; and delayed responders en route to an unconscious 91-year-old woman who later died in the hospital. More fallout: christie says he knew nothing about the scheme, but we should find out more about what he did and didn't know today: he has a press conference scheduled for 11am est, reports nbc news. This could end up being a legal mess. The record believes christie's office may not have complied with a public records request it filed dec. 17 — and it's now weighing its legal options. The record specifically requested any documents tied to the september lane closures, including those between david wildstein of the port authority ( he's a christie appointee, and ordered the lanes closed ) and governor's office officials. Ten days later, the record was told the office \" has not identified any records that are responsive to your request. \" one of the emails released yesterday ( obtained by assembly democrats via a subpoena ) between wildstein and senior aide bridget anne kelly ( more on that email here ) clearly qualified as responsive, says the record. Nj state sen. Ray lesniak yesterday called on the us attorney for his state to convene a federal grand jury to review whether any criminal acts had occurred. When the democrat was asked by the star-ledger what might make the list, he replied, \" abusing governmental authority for political purposes, for political gain. \" on a lighter note, nj.com notes that the scandal broke in time for jon stewart to cover it last night... And he's pretty ashamed of his home state, he admitted. \" political payback through traffic congestion? to see new jersey sink to such a piss-poor, third-rate quality of corruption.

The house — valued around $ 6 million, according to several real estate websites, with an estimated monthly rent of $ 22,000 on zillow — is owned by joe lockhart, a former press secretary and senior adviser to bill clinton. Mr. Lockhart was until this year the managing director of a communications and political consulting practice he founded, the glover park group, but has moved to manhattan to become executive vice president for communications for the national football league. Mr. Lockhart and his wife, giovanna gray lockhart, an editor at glamour magazine, would not comment on the matter, referring queries to the white house. Jennifer friedman, the deputy white house press secretary, also declined to comment on the president's plans, first reported on wednesday by politico."

        "summary": "If you're worried about your kids not getting enough shut-eye because of the time they spend on their smartphones and computers, playing xbox, or watching netflix, new research may ease that parental guilt — somewhat. The bbc reports on a new study out of oxford university that found any ties between screen time and children's sleep were \" extremely modest, \" and researchers were even able to put a number on how much sleep was lost at night with each daily hour of screen time: three to eight minutes. \" digital screen time, on its own, has little practical effect on pediatric sleep, \" the study published in the journal of pediatrics notes, adding that \" contextual factors surrounding screen time exert a more pronounced influence on pediatric sleep compared to screen time itself. \" the scientists used data from a 2016 us survey of parents that contained questions on the electronic-device habits of more than 50,000 kids between 6 months and 17 years. Teens who stared at a screen for eight hours a day, for example, got only a half-hour or so less sleep a day ( an average of 8 hours, 21 minutes ) than teens who didn't have any screen time. Critics of the study say self-reporting from parents may not be the most reliable assessment — the study's lead author, andrew przybylski, himself notes the data used is \" imperfect \" — and there are still concerns about kids sneaking phones into bed ( i.e., staying up later ) and the effects of late-night blue light. Still, przybylski and his team think other variables, such as consistent bedtime routines, are \" much more effective \" in ensuring kids sleep better at night, per a release.
