The city could get 10 inches of rain starting sunday, reports cnn. Complicating things is that new orleans is still repairing its drainage system after it was overwhelmed by recent storms. Mayor mitch landrieu thinks the system should be able to handle the coming deluge, but if harvey changes track and dumps more rain than expected, the situation could be dicey. As for harvey's current progress, the national hurricane center downgraded it as of 5am saturday to a category 1 as it delivers winds of up to 90mph and heavy rain to southeast texas, reports the ap. The city of victoria, for instance, got more than 9 inches of rain, and more than 200,000 people were without power in the region. President trump tweeted saturday morning that federal authorities are keeping a close eye on it. \" closely monitoring #hurricaneharvey from camp david, \" he wrote. \" we are leaving nothing to chance.

        "summary": "From britain to spain to denmark, rubbery blocks have recently washed up on beaches, all bearing the same word: tjipetir. It's still not certain where each block comes from, but a woman who found one while walking her dog in england has a pretty good idea, the bbc reports. After tracey williams posted on a facebook page about her investigation into the matter, two individuals who haven't been publicly identified told her about a japanese ship sunk 150 miles west of britain's scilly isles during world war i. The miyazaki maru carried the blocks, and it has recently been subject to salvage work, resulting in their release, the sources explained. The blocks have their origins in indonesia, where they get their name from a 19th- and 20th-century rubber plantation in west java. The rubber-like stuff — likely a tree gum called gutta-percha — was once used for such diverse purposes as insulating cables and making golf balls. Williams'theory is supported by a british official in charge of the country's wreck laws — the receiver of wreck, as she's known. But \" many ships would have been carrying gutta-percha, so it's possible that the cargo is coming from more than one source, \" williams notes. One of those sources could be the titanic, which listed such blocks among its cargo, the daily mail reports. Interesting pieces of history, but not so appealing to conservationists: \" the thing we find most worrying is that this is biodegradable rubber and here it is, 100 years later, in near-perfect condition, \" says one.

            "London/washington ( reuters ) - bp plc promised improved drilling practices on friday as the company balances twin aims of rebuilding investor and public confidence after the gulf of mexico oil spill while not admitting flaws in its own procedures. Bp said it would more closely oversee the work of its contractors, echoing its position that the rig blast, which killed 11 men and led to the spill, was the fault of its contractors, including driller transocean and halliburton. The companies have filed lawsuits worth tens of billions of dollars blaming each other for the blast, and any admission by bp that its existing drilling procedures needed improvements could weaken its legal position. Bp said it would also establish centers for monitoring its drilling wells in real time -- something some rivals already do and which might have prevented the well blow-out that caused the disaster. The london-based company declined to comment on whether it was addressing shortcomings in its internal procedures that were highlighted in government investigations, such as its reliance on a single barrier to keep oil and gas in the well. Bp's rivals including exxon mobil, royal dutch shell and bg group have criticized its design for the macondo well, saying it contributed to the disaster. Going beyond what's required bp said its plans go beyond regulatory requirements. \" bp clearly understands that they have to win back",

The reason is a tense feud with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei — one that doesn't bode well for ahmadinejad's political future, explains ap. The trouble began when ahmadinejad pressured iran's spy chief, heidar moslehi, into resigning on april 17. Hours later, khamenei pulled rank and reinstated him. More than 200 members of iran's 300-seat parliament have signed a letter calling on ahmadinejad to accept moslehi's reinstatement and return to work. \" you are expected to follow the supreme leader, \" they wrote. If he continues to refuse, it opens the possibility of impeachment, though ap thinks that's an unlikely outcome. Still, ahmadinejad has two years left in his term as president, and they could be a long two years if he's lost the support of khamenei.",

Jonathan denver was wearing dodgers gear when his group encountered a group of giants fans on a street outside the giants'stadium, reports the los angeles times. \" there was a back-and-forth about the giants-dodgers rivalry, which deteriorated into a physical fight, \" says san fran's police chief. The groups actually broke apart after that first fight, but met up again a short time later and fought again. Denver got stabbed during the second fight, and police have two suspects in custody, ages 18 and 21. Denver had been at that night's dodgers-giants game with his father, who works as a security guard for the dodgers, and a few other people, reports the san francisco chronicle. His death follows the beating in 2011 of giants fan bryan stow at dodger stadium. Stow survived but has severe brain injuries.",

A bill that seeks to have dysmenorrhea, the medical term for painful menstrual cramps, added to the list of conditions ( which include multiple sclerosis and cancer ) passed the new york assembly's health committee late last month and will now head to the assembly floor. Assemblywoman linda rosenthal, a democrat who introduced the bill, says dysmenorrhea can be \" debilitating, \" per live science, but the condition has long been ignored because it's not in the \" everyday consciousness \" of men who dominate government. The american academy of family physicians notes 20 % of women who experience cramps find it hard to get out of bed or go to work. But \" for years women have suffered in silence. There's midol. You can take advil, but really nothing more, \" rosenthal says. \" medical marijuana can alleviate many of the painful effects, \" the bill adds. There haven't actually been any modern studies that show marijuana eases menstrual pain. However, a doctor tells live science that the uterus and uterine lining have an \" abundance \" of endocannabinoid receptors, which cannabinoids bind to, so \" it's not out of the realm of the possible. \" whoopi goldberg certainly thinks pot can help.

He's charged with statutory rape, production of child pornography, and transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. Schroeder also forced his captive — whose case drew the attention of nicolas cage — to clean his house, cut her hair, and lose weight, according to an affidavit. Police allege schroeder, who kept several guns at home, also destroyed her cellphone and banned her from using the internet without his permission. Two cameras pointed at schroeder's bed were seized from the home, along with footage of the teen, police add.

But her enthusiasm was short-lived: soon after she started the live weather report, a hand appeared from off-camera holding a gray cardigan sweater. \" what's going on? why? because it's cold? \" she asked, to which anchor chris burrous replied: \" we're getting emails. \" chan smiled and put on the sweater, lamenting, \" i look like a librarian now. \" online reaction was swift, with commenters debating whether it was sexist and inappropriate to call out chan on the air, even if her attire hadn't been typical newscaster garb, the san francisco chronicle reports. Chan reposted the video herself on her facebook page later that morning, first apologizing to librarians for her librarian comment, then asking viewers for their take on what us refers to as \" #sweatergate. \" some said she may have been dressed too casually for work but that the sweater handoff wasn't necessary. \" the morning [ newscasters ] on this channel have made raunchy innuendos numerous times that i can recall and there's been news stories shown with women wearing less but this dress is a problem? \" one wrote. Burrous offered his own apology, tweeting, \" meant in jest but i see how it seemed. I am sorry. \" chan tweeted a link sunday night to her blog, where she expounded on the incident. She explained the dress had been a backup ( the first one she had on didn't work with the studio's greenscreen ) and that she was never ordered to put on the sweater. \" i was simply playing along with my co-anchor's joke, and if you've ever watched the morning show, you know we poke fun at each other all the time, \" she writes.

        "summary": "Neil gorsuch is now officially a member of the us supreme court, and the 49-year-old's impact is expected to be both immediate and long-lasting. Gorsuch officially gets to work on monday, in time to hear important cases for the current term and to help weigh in on which cases will be heard in the next one. Here's a look: the court will hear a case april 19 that may be the most significant of the term, writes lyle denniston at constitution daily. In trinity lutheran church v. Comer, a missouri church is suing for the right to use state funds to improve a kids ' playground. It's seen as one of the biggest church-state cases in a while. Also on the court's radar are various challenges to president trump's travel ban, reports abc news in its gorsuch primer. A preview at the bbc includes an upcoming gun rights case ( peruta v. San diego ) about people's rights to carry concealed weapons in public places. Gorsuch cannot vote on any cases argued before he became a justice, but if any of those cases end up 4-4, the court could order them re-argued before the full, nine-member panel, notes nbc news. At the hill, lydia wheeler writes that gorsuch may actually be more conservative than the late antonin scalia in some areas, particularly on what's known as the chevron deference. It stems from a 1984 ruling in which the high court ordered lower courts \" to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes, \" per an explainer at scotusblog. In layman's terms, liberal groups fear that public health and safety laws enacted in the obama era are at risk. The gorsuch confirmation fight is destined to replayed again and again. This op-ed in the washington post thinks one thing that would help is a constitutional amendment limiting justices'terms to 18 years. See a video of trump, gorsuch, and justice anthony kennedy ( gorsuch used to clerk for him ) here via pbs. As the low man on the court's totem pole, gorsuch has some kitchen responsibilities.",

Three reasons why this is a big deal: the 70-foot tree was planted by john muir, who had a heavy hand in the founding of yosemite and sequoia national parks; the tree is being ravaged by an airborne fungus; and critics didn't think a tree of this species could be cloned after its 80th birthday, reports the los angeles times. This tree is about 130 years old. The credit for the feat goes to the archangel ancient tree archive, which has other feathers in its cap: it has also cloned trees planted by george washington at mount vernon. The clone was born in a michigan lab from one of two dozen cuttings from the tree, which were divided into much smaller pieces and subjected to what archangel's co-founder describes to michigan radio as a \" hormone cocktail. \" roots have formed, indicating that the cloning worked; the clone needs to grow to a foot-and-a-half in height before it can leave the lab. Once that happens, it ' ll be put in the ground at muir's san francisco-area homestead, hopefully within a year. ( another famed tree that will live on: the one anne frank watched from the secret annex. )",

        "summary": "World, can you help us decipher a medieval sword inscription? that sums up the british library's announcement about a blade discovered in an english river in 1825, livescience reports. The so-called river witham sword — a 13th-century object now on display at the library — bears a message along its 38-inch steel blade: \" +ndxoxchwdrghdxorvi+. \" the \" indecipherable inscription \" is \" along one of its edges and inlaid in gold wire, \" writes curator julian harrison on the library blog. \" it has been speculated that this is a religious invocation, since the language is unknown. \" indeed, marc van hasselt, one of the blog's many commenters, sees religious-themed latin short forms in the message and notes that latin was the \" international language of choice \" among 13th-century europeans. Van hasselt, a medieval-studies student in the netherlands, says the opening \" nd \" may be \" nostrum dominus ( our lord ) or nomine domini ( name of the lord ) \" and the \" xox \" may refer to the holy trinity. He references work done by thomas wagner and john worley, whose fyris swords project examines such inscribed medieval swords and tries to give them historical context.

The order from tiny jewel box, dc's \" premier destination for fine jewelry and watches, \" was signed off on by millan hupp, whom pruitt referred to as a \" longtime friend \" in congressional testimony last year, per cnn. That's significant because pruitt has attempted to distance himself from pricey epa purchases, blaming it on \" career staff, \" but in this case it was a close aide rather than a career staffer who signed off on the purchase. The dozen pens, at $ 130 a pop, were engraved with pruitt's signature and an epa seal; a spokesperson says they are similar to purchases pruitt's predecessors made \" for the purpose of serving as gifts to the administrator's foreign counterparts and dignitaries upon his meeting with them. \" indeed, a $ 2,952 purchase was made from the same shop during the obama administration. The epa is also, of course, under fire for a $ 43,000 phone booth.

Pruitt has denied that hart lobbied his agency in 2017, most recently during congressional testimony last month. The firm amended its required federal lobbying disclosures after an extensive review of hart's emails, calendar entries and other materials.

        "summary": "The capture of two isis fighters who may know the whereabouts of kayla mueller's body has raised hope that her parents might finally be able to put their daughter to rest. Isis said the aid worker kidnapped in syria in 2013 was killed in 2015 when a jordanian airstrike hit the building housing her in raqqa, and while her death was confirmed, her body was never recovered. Marsha and carl mueller hope el shafee elsheikh and alexanda amon kotey — two of four british jihadists dubbed \" the beatles \" — will now lead authorities to her remains, and perhaps to the remains of other americans, reports the arizona republic. The men have been described as guards under mohammed emwazi, or jihadi john, who carried out the executions of james foley, steven sotloff, and peter kassig before his reported death in 2016. Since their capture in eastern syria early last month, the two fighters held by syrian kurdish forces have been pointing out burial locations, the muellers say they've been told. Early last week, a counterterrorism official told abc news that ground searches had begun. \" i am grateful for all these efforts but bringing these two jihadists to justice gives us more hope and solace than the return of jim's remains, \" said diane foley, foley's mother. The parents of foley and mueller joined the parents of sotloff and kassig in calling for life in prison for the captives in a new york times op-ed a week ago. \" execution could be misconstrued as martyrdom, perpetuating violence and diminishing america's stature as a defender of human rights, \" they wrote, requesting a trial in the us or an international court.",

When such hate-filled perpetrators are captured, brought to a public trial and held accountable for their evil deeds, we hope their contagious hatred will begin to abate. It is a necessary first step. As the heartbroken parents of jim, steven, peter and kayla, we beseech our government to insist that mr. Kotey and mr. Elsheikh receive a fair and public trial either in the federal criminal courts of the united states or the international criminal court in the hague. When crimes like these are made public, victims like us can be heard and begin to heal. The accused will hear how their crimes have destroyed others, and perhaps even begin to repent. And we can hope that justice will put an end to such crimes against humanity. These men should face justice in a public courtroom because they are criminals, not soldiers. They imprisoned unarmed civilians, then sadistically abused and murdered them. They are cowards, not warriors. The islamic state is a delusional and exploitative cult, not a state.

The unnamed teen's parents were concerned about his behavior before school thursday and headed for meuller park junior high in bountiful when they realized two family guns were missing. Police aren't giving the shooter's identity, why his parents were concerned about him, or what he had planned.

        "summary": "Advances in dna testing have helped investigators identify the remains of one more victim of the 9/11 attacks — the 1,642nd to be identified, and the first in almost a year. A bone fragment that investigators had attempted to identify several times over the years has been confirmed as belonging to scott michael johnson, a 26-year-old financial analyst who worked on the 89th floor of the world trade center's south tower, the new york daily news reports. He was one of 67 keefe bruyette &amp; woods employees to die that day. The bone fragment was identified with the help of new dna technology that can identify samples that have degraded in the almost 17 years since the attacks. Mother ann johnson, 71, is glad the medical examiner's office kept its promise to never stop trying to identify all 2,753 victims. \" having said that, it's also made me cry and when i told our daughter, we sat there and both cried, \" she tells the new york times. \" you get pulled right back into it and it also means there's a finality. Somehow i always thought he would just walk up and say, ' here i am. I had amnesia. ' \" ( another victim was identified in august last year, but the man's family chose to withhold his name. )",

            "\"we feel a sacred obligation to continue our work, \" she said. However, the remains that have yet to be identified are the most challenging. Most of the samples are bones, which are some of the most difficult materials to generate dna profiles from, mr. Desire said. Compounding the effort is the fact that much of the dna of sept. 11 victims was destroyed or degraded because of exposure to fire, heat and jet fuel. Though the steps for dna identification have remained mostly the same over the years, the techniques for extracting and identifying dna samples have improved. First, the bone must be pulverized though recently, mr. Desire's team has been able to apply new technology — ultrasonic ball bearings — to this process, which has resulted in a finer powder. The finer the powder, the more dna that can be extracted, mr. Desire said. Then, scientists extract dna, but because the dna is often so limited, they try to make copies of it by triggering a polymerase chain reaction using an enzyme. In the case of mr. Johnson, the scientists performed the process three times before they had enough dna to create a profile. Once the dna profile is generated, the team then compares it to dna samples. The medical examiner's office has a databank of more than 17,000 reference samples from victims and family members. Mr. Johnson's dna sample was compared to a sample from his toothbrush and then confirmed with samples from his parents. Mr. Desire said the dna testing techniques have improved in response to the difficulties in identifying 9/11 victims. The dna crime lab, part of the medical examiner's office, also conducts research and development, which has been instrumental in technological advancement, mr. Desire said. \"we are far ahead of where we would have been if not for the necessity of making these identifications, \" he said. For mr. Johnson's father, who is a member of the board of the national september 11 memorial museum, the identification of his son provides little comfort, he said. Though he said he was grateful that the city had been sensitive and diligent in its work, the news was just another reminder of the pain he and his family have felt for 17 years. \"his friends reported at his memorial service on the incredible love and support that he gave to them that in a sense went",

Carlos reyes, 46, allegedly entered the manchester convenience store just after noon on tuesday, armed with a sharp rock, per the ap. A witness says the suspect said he was sorry while demanding the loot, explaining he needed the cash. Reyes then reportedly took off, but a few hours later, according to a stop-n-go clerk, reyes trudged back into the store weeping and gave the money back. The cops were called once again, and after they reviewed the surveillance tape, reyes was arrested on charges of armed robbery. He's due in court wednesday.

Pistorius described waking and moving fans in the bedroom, and moving to put a pair of jeans over a light shining from an amplifier. That's when he heard the bathroom window \" sliding \" open and slamming, he said. He never heard steenkamp get out of bed, but a window slamming is much louder, he added. Prosecutor gerrie nel asked, \" did you not say to reeva,'reeva did you hear that? ' \" to which pistorius responded, per the bbc, \" i was sure there was somebody in my house, \" indicating he didn't need confirmation from steenkamp. Instead, pistorius grabbed his gun. \" i told reeva to get down and phone the police, \" but says he did not wait for a response. Why did steenkamp not speak from the bathroom? \" i wish she had let me know she was there, \" pistorius said through tears, per the telegraph. Nel also noted pistorius might've thought it strange that an intruder would climb into the bathroom, then close the door to the toilet; pistorius previously said it was usually left open. And why was pistorius so afraid when he had a burglar system? \" i turned the alarm off, \" pistorius said, according to the bbc, but later said he didn't remember doing it but \" must have \" as it was a habit to turn it on when he entered the bedroom and off when he left. Plus, he wasn't confident the alarm would work and there was no burglar proofing on windows. Nel, however, pointed out that pistorius must not have been too concerned about his safety if he left cars outside and a broken window unfixed — though pistorius said he was in the process of getting it repaired.",

The pentagon is acknowledging for the first time just how much of a problem the simple devices have caused aircrews, predominantly in syria, iraq, and afghanistan, where the bulk of some 350 laser-related incidents have occurred in the last seven months alone. That nearly matches the roughly 400 reported laser-beam attacks in 2017. By this year's end, the tally should at least equal the peak of 700 recorded attacks in 2015. The problem is that pointers give users an affordable and effective way to distract pilots, putting their lives at risk. While the wsj report is the first public disclosure by us officials of laser-attack numbers, they've made the news before. Earlier this year, the pentagon said a formal complaint was issued to china over the use of lasers near a us military base in djibouti. Those lasers were directed at aircraft and resulted in minor injuries to two american pilots. Pentagon spokeswoman dana white said the us was confident that chinese nationals from a nearby chinese base were responsible for the laser attacks, the ap reported.

        "summary": "Interior secretary ryan zinke has completed his president trump-ordered review of 27 national monuments declared by trump's three predecessors — and while he hasn't recommended abolishing any of them, he tells the ap he has proposed shrinking a \" handful \" of them. Insiders tell the new york times that zinke's report recommends trump shrink at least four monuments, including the 1.35-million-acre bears ears national monument in utah. Ranchers, loggers, fishing groups, and others opposed to the designations welcomed the proposals in a summary of the report released thursday, though details of what monuments might be affected are being kept under wraps for now. Tribal groups and environmentalists have vowed to fight attempts to shrink the monuments, the washington post reports. It will be the first time such a move has been contested in court, and experts say the legal battles are likely to be the toughest test the antiquities act has faced in its 111-year history. Democrats have spoken out against the proposals, which are supported by many republicans in western states. Utah state rep. Mike noel says shrinking bears ears will be \" a victory for our state \" against federal attempts to restrict grazing, drilling, and mining. \" when you turn the management over to the tree-huggers, the bird and bunny lovers, and the rock lickers, you turn your heritage over, \" he says.",

Environmentalists, ranchers, tribal governments and western lawmakers had been watching closely to see if mr. Zinke would propose changing the borders of the bears ears national monument, which president barack obama established at the end of his term, and other scenic and historic areas under federal protection.

Monica douglas said former controller judith slater, who was fired on feb. 28, frequently expressed an unwillingness to be near black people. Douglas is black, as are colleagues tichaona brown and tabrese wright, who filed suit against fox last week. Douglas, who is panamanian, said in the lawsuit that slater told her she wouldn't let her dogs eat food panamanians eat. She said slater frequently referred to her status as a breast cancer survivor, calling her the \" one-boobed girl \" and the like. Douglas said she complained about slater's comments in 2014 and nothing was done. Fox, in a statement, said it takes complaints like this very seriously. \" there is no place for conduct like this at fox news, which is why ms. Slater was fired, \" the network said."

Now scientists in jingchuan county, china, say they've found a box with thousands of pieces of his \" sarira \" ( cremated remains, including teeth and bones ) with a message inscribed from a pair of monks who'd embarked on a 20-year-plus mission to collect as much of the famous ascetic's remnants as they could find, live science reports. Those two holy men, yunjiang and zhiming, apparently buried the box more than 1,000 years ago, in june 1013. The translated inscription on the container explained whose remains they believed they'd found and how they'd \" buried them in the manjusri hall of this temple. \" also found at the same site: pieces of a structure that scientists speculate could have been from the aforementioned manjusri hall, as well as 260 statues that depict the buddha, various gods, people who'd sought enlightenment ( and those who'd found it ), and carved stone slabs known as steles — a \" discovery that's of cultural and historical significance regardless of the origins of the bones themselves, \" per a release. All were originally found in 2012 by villagers fixing roads in the area, but the discovery was just this year translated into english in the chinese cultural relics journal. Scientists aren't sure if the statues were buried at the same time as the box. They also note other remains marked as being the buddha have been found previously in china; they don't indicate whether they believe these are the real deal.

        "summary": "Five months into the era of president trump, the world's perception of the us and its leader has sunk to the level it was at late in george w. Bush's presidency, according to a new pew research center poll of people in 37 countries. The poll was conducted among more than 40,000 people between february and may. Among the findings: there has been a massive decline in confidence in the us in its nearest neighbors, pew says. The proportion of people saying they have at least some confidence in the american president has dived from 83 % to 22 % in canada, and from 49 % to just 5 % in mexico. Some 55 % rated trump as a strong leader, though 75 % said he was arrogant, 65 % intolerant, and 62 % dangerous. Only 23 % said he cared about ordinary people. Overall, just 22 % of people polled worldwide had confidence in the us president to do the right thing — and only 49 % had a favorable view of the us, down from 64 % two years ago. The guardian notes that this is the first time in pew polling history that a majority of canadians have not seen the us as a force for good in the world. Chinese president xi jinping and russian president vladimir putin also had low marks worldwide, though not as low as trump. The decline was especially steep in western europe and latin america, but the fall in confidence was widespread, reports reuters. \" the share of the public with a positive view of the us has plummeted in a diverse set of countries from latin america, north america, europe, asia, and africa, \" pew says. Poll respondents disapproved of all five trump policies they were asked about, including the us-mexico border wall and withdrawal from trade agreements. There are two bright spots for trump: russia and israel. Confidence in the us president is up in both countries and favorable views of the us are up to 41 % in russia from 15 % two years ago. Former diplomat frank wisner links the fall in confidence in the us to trump's lack of commitment to principles including free markets and the rule of law. \" america's image has taken hits in recent years, from the decision to invade iraq to the events of 2007 and 2008, when the american financial model took a huge hit, \" he tells the washington post. \" but the most consequential is the ascent of mr.

For adults 18 to 64, us guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week ( half that if working out vigorously ) and muscle-strengthening exercise at least twice a week. Although the findings beat the government's healthy people 2020 initiative, which set a goal of 20.1 % by 2020, success has been uneven, reports usa today. For example, although 27.2 % of men hit the target goal, only 18.7 % of women did. Results also varied by region. Colorado scored highest, with 32.5 % hitting exercise targets, while mississippi brought up the rear, at 13.5 %. In general, states in the southeast scored below the national average, and states in the west were above average. Cold-weather states, like colorado, new hampshire, and massachusetts, fared well, which was a little surprising, says tainya clarke, a statistician and one of the report's authors. \" usually, we would think the warmer states would have more people outside running or biking or cycling because that's what we see on tv, \" she told cnn. As the report notes, research has consistently found that regular exercise lowers the risk of a host of conditions, improves mental health, and extends life. The bottom line? in virtually all regions, there's room for improvement. \" we have to pause and ask ourselves, are we doing great as a nation? \" asks clarke. \"is it really good that only 23 % of our population is engaged in enough aerobic activity and muscle strength training, or do we need to do better? \" ( these 10 cities have the highest exercise rates, and three are in colorado. )",

Per the york news-times, an elderly couple claims the 60 pounds of high-grade marijuana stashed in the topper of their toyota tacoma pickup was meant for holiday presents. Patrick jiron, 80, and barbara jiron, 70, were en route to vermont from california when they were pulled over for failing to signal while driving over the center line of an interstate highway. Deputies immediately noticed the pungent scent of marijuana. After the county's drug detection dog, dundee, sensed a controlled substance, they conducted a probable cause search and found the drugs, estimated to have a $ 336,000 street value, in boxes. The jirons confirmed that they possessed marijuana, which they said \" was for christmas presents, \" says lt. Paul vrbka of the sheriff's department. In an update to the story, york news-times reports that barbara was released after being taken into custody due to medical issues. She has been cited in the case, while husband patrick was booked on felony charges of possession of marijuana with the intent to deliver and having no drug tax stamp. He has since been release after posting 10 % of his $ 100,000 bond. Vrbka says the couple claims \" they didn't know it was illegal to transport marijuana in nebraska. \" ( marijuana activists rolled a 100-pound joint in massachusetts. )",

Well, the only thing even more predictable than response to the iphone 5 was the fact that preorders would sell out quickly.

            "Another day, and another record for apple's stock. Shares of apple ( aapl ) topped their day-old all-time high, hitting $ 696.82 friday amid strong enthusiasm for the iphone 5. Apple unveiled its new faster and thinner iphone earlier this week, and pre-orders for the new device sold out in less than an hour when they began friday at 12: 01 a.m. Pacific ( 3 a.m. Et ). Last year, it took 22 hours for pre-orders to sell out. Analysts on wall street are predicting the new smartphone will be a major success. Related: 4g iphone 5 sounds death knell for 3g",
            "We recently wrote that following all the leaks and rumors leading up to the iphone 5 unveiling, the only thing more predictable than the new iphone itself was people's reactions to it. Well, the only thing even more predictable than response to the iphone 5 was the fact that preorders would sell out quickly. Apple ( aapl ) made preorders of its new iphone available on apple.com at 3: 01 a.m. Edt, 12: 01 a.m. Pdt and in less than one hour, the company's initial stock of new iphones for verizon wireless ( vz ), at&t ( t ) and sprint ( s ) was depleted. Disappointing indeed. Shipping time for new orders placed on apple's website slipped to two weeks just before 4: 00 a.m. Edt, where it remained at the time of this writing. Verizon, at&t and sprint each still quoted launch-day delivery for new iphone 5 preorders placed as of 8: 15 a.m. Edt friday morning. Update: verizon ran out of launch-day stock late friday morning, and at&t sold out of its preliminary iphone 5 inventory just before 1: 00 p.m. Edt on friday. Update 2: sprint is now quoting delivery times of up to 2 weeks for new iphone 5 preorders."

In the study published in pediatrics, researchers looked at 106 kids ages 5 to 18, half of whom had surgery before their fourth birthday, reports medical news today. Generally speaking, the kids who had been under anesthesia scored worse on intelligence tests and in listening comprehension, and they had less gray matter in two areas of the brain ( the cerebellum and occipital cortex ), reports healthday news. All of the kids in the study were still in the normal range for iqs, but the researchers found that the anesthesia kids consistently scored about 5 or 6 points lower. \" the very receptors that anesthetics act on to produce unconsciousness during surgery are also important for stimulating neurons to form proper connections and to survive, \" says study author andreas loepke. \" anesthetic exposure may interfere with normal brain development. \" in a post at eureka alert, the team even puts a societal cost on the problem of $ 540 billion, based on earlier research suggesting that the loss of one iq point translates to a lifetime earnings drop of $ 18,000. So what to do? these are typically unavoidable surgeries, but the study shows the importance of figuring out safer protocols for kids — maybe more regional anesthetics instead of general anesthesia, or methods to limit the damage, for example, reports the columbus dispatch.

The arrest took place thursday, when 24-year-old jogger amanda jo stephen got taken into custody after crossing an intersection at a red light, reports the daily texan. A university of texas student filmed the arrest from across the street, and the posted video quickly went viral, reports kvue-tv. You can hear stephen screaming that she did nothing wrong as officers load her into the police car. She is charged with \"failure to identify \" and \"failure to obey a pedestrian control device. \" the student who shot the video says the woman was jogging by \" when they grabbed her arm from behind, and i think it's perfectly understandable that she was kind of startled and jerked her arm away and was like, ' who's grabbing me? ' \" the common sentiment is that police over-reacted, but chief art acevedo isn't having it. He says the arrest came in the midst of a crackdown for pedestrian safety, and stephen was one of 28 pedestrians stopped. He says she was the one who escalated the situation by doing the \" limp routine \" and refusing to identify herself. \"thank you lord that it's a controversy in austin, texas, that we actually have the audacity to touch somebody by the arm and tell them, ' oh my goodness, austin police, we're trying to get your attention, ' \" said acevedo. \"quite frankly, she wasn't charged with resisting, and she was lucky i wasn't the arresting officer because i wouldn't have been quite as generous. \"",

        "summary": "A washington post article features a giant image of austin powers and a reminder of his \" grotesquely discolored grin. \" it's evidence, of course, of how awful english teeth are, especially as compared with americans ' pearly whites. Except, as a new study published wednesday in the bmj finds, our whites may not be quite so superior. Richard watt ( who is scottish ) partnered with fellow dental professionals on both sides of the pond to figure out how our grins stack up, and the result references powers again. The study, \" austin powers bites back: a cross sectional comparison of us and english national oral health surveys, \" concludes that \" the oral health of us citizens is not better than the english. \" in fact, in one aspect it's worse. The study made use of two nationally representative health surveys, the british adult dental health survey and the us national health and nutrition examination survey. When it comes to missing teeth, americans have more voids, at 7.31 to 6.97. Further, when it comes to missing teeth among the ages 25-64 set, americans still outpaced the english ( who had a higher number of missing teeth among older adults ). In both countries, women were missing more teeth than men. But we do have the edge in one respect: when it comes to oral impacts on daily life ( as determined by six questions that asked about pain, function — like eating and talking — and social impacts ), such impacts \" were more prevalent in england, \" the researchers write. But \" this could be partly a cultural difference, \" watt speculated to the post. \" the english complain more! \" ( no missing teeth here: 232 teeth were removed from this boy's head. )",

More than 50 years later, that priest has been charged with her murder. John feit, the main suspect in the case for years, was arrested in scottsdale, ariz., on tuesday and is now awaiting extradition to texas, reports kfor. Items found near garza's body, including a candelabra, were traced to the church where feit worked about a mile away, while a film-slide viewer belonged to feit himself, reports the dallas morning news. Less than a month before garza was killed, feit had also been arrested for attacking a woman at a church 10 miles from mcallen; he pleaded no contest to aggravated assault and paid a $ 500 fine. During early investigations, feit — then a 27-year-old visiting priest, per nbc news — told police he last saw garza standing outside of the church but failed lie detector tests. Later, two priests came forward claiming feit made incriminating statements to them before he left the priesthood in the 1970s. A grand jury decided not to indict feit in 2004, but a jury in texas heard the case again last week and returned a different verdict, reports ktxs. It isn't clear if any new information was presented. A cousin of garza, who was just 10 years old when she was killed, says accusing a priest of murder was no easy feat 56 years ago. \" it was impossible for a priest to do such a deed.

Following michigan, coverage of romney's campaign grew more favorable, while coverage of his rivals, \" particularly rick santorum, \" decreased and grew more negative. But the most negative coverage was reserved for president obama: he didn't see \" a single week \" in which positive press outweighed the negative, the ap notes. That was thanks in part to republican attacks, a shaky economy, climbing gas prices, and the supreme court battle over obamacare.

And if this translates to humans, it could be a game changer, though the remedy is specific to cocaine addiction. In a new study in nature biomedical engineering, the researchers explain that their work revolves around an enzyme we naturally produce called bche. The enzyme is unique in that it's a cocaine killer — it essentially destroys any cocaine it comes across in the bloodstream — but the body produces too little of it to be of use for addicts. Solution? the scientists say they can take skin cells from people, arm them with a jacked-up version of bche, and then implant them back under the recipient's skin. The process, taking advantage of the gene-editing technique crispr, produced strong results in mice. \" compared to other gene therapies, our approach is minimally invasive, long term, low maintenance, and affordable, \" lead researcher ming xu tells the guardian. \" it's very promising. \" in the study, mice that received the implants eliminated a standard dose of cocaine from their bodies in 20 minutes, versus two hours for the control mice. Crucially, the first group didn't get a \" pleasure hit \" from the drug, either, per new scientist. As the guardian puts it, the treatment essentially made the mice immune to cocaine. What's more, all the mice with the implants survived doses of cocaine that killed the control mice. \" adapting this approach for humans could be a promising way for blocking addiction, \" another researcher writes at the conversation, and she lays out the next steps underway toward that goal.

Officials say 21 people were hospitalized there, one critically, and crews responded to over a dozen houses that contained trapped people, per abc news. At least 30 injuries have been reported, but no fatalities. Illinois averages 47 tornadoes annually, usually peaking in may, but a strong cold front set up \" the perfect conditions \" for saturday's blitz, says cnn meteorologist allison chinchar. Tornadoes have been moving east in recent decades from oklahoma, texas, and kansas to states on and east of the mississippi river — including illinois, the ap reports. Sadly, that means tornadoes are forming more often in more populated areas. Why the change? \" we don't know, \" says victor gensini, who lead a study on the subject. \" this is super consistent with climate change. \" seems the great plains are drying out, providing less moisture to create storms that trigger tornadoes, while a line of dry, tornado-producing air is moving east. \" this is what you would expect in a climate change scenario, we just have no way of confirming it at the moment, \" says gensini.

        "summary": "Ponder the taste of fat for a minute. Is your mouth watering? it shouldn't be. While the closest you've probably come to eating pure fat was on an untrimmed steak, purdue university researchers have isolated the taste of fat for the first time — and folks, it isn't pleasant. They began by plugging the noses of participants who tasted a variety of samples instilled with chemicals representing the five basic tastes — bitter, salty, sour, sweet, and umami ( savory ) — and fatty acids, considered the \" building blocks of fat, \" per forbes. The unique taste of the fatty acids, which researchers dubbed \" oleogustus, \" varied by chemical structure: short-chain fatty acids tasted sour and long-chain fatty acids tasted bitter. But what came as a surprise to researchers — considering how fat, when paired with other tastes and smells, usually enhances food — was that all variations tasted terrible. \" we have a situation where one form of fat is adding to the appeal of food and may encourage intake. While with another, the taste signal is aversive, discouraging consumption, \" a researcher says. What gives? researchers suggest that since fatty acids show up in rotting food, their off-putting taste may serve as a warning that what you're putting in their mouth shouldn't be there. At low levels, though, the acids ' bitterness could enhance food. After all, chocolate and coffee can also be bitter, reports the independent. Others note it may be the thick, creamy texture of fat that we adore so much, rather than the actual taste. The study author tells abc news further study on how humans taste fat and confirmation of a sixth taste could help researchers understand how our bodies digest foods. Meanwhile, the research could lead to better replacements that mimic fat's texture and taste. ( here are 5 low-fat foods you should stop eating now. )",
