        "summary": "Adam lanza apparently planned the sandy hook massacre by himself and left no evidence of why he killed 27 people at a connecticut elementary school last year, according to a report released today. \" why did the shooter murder twenty-seven people, including twenty children? \" wrote danbury state's attorney stephen sedensky in the report, which closed an 11-month police investigation. \" unfortunately, that question may never be answered conclusively. \" the report does say lanza planned all his actions, including his suicide, and even wore ear buds during the assault, the hartford courant reports. Also from the report: a blow-by-blow of lanza's carnage. The 20-year-old fired 154 shots, mostly in the classroom of substitute teacher lauren rousseau, where lanza murdered her and 14 of her 15 students. He killed six more in the classroom of victoria soto, where student jesse lewis told kids to run when lanza's gun jammed. Six safely got past lanza, but lewis was killed. The courant is posting interesting points from the report, including the fact that lanza didn't like holidays and birthdays, communicated with nancy only by email for 3 months before the shooting, and had expressed an interest in serial murders and mass killings. Lanza was very interested in the columbine shootings and posted a blog about them, nbc news reports. His mother nancy stayed home to take care of him, saying he had asperger's syndrome, but lanza refused to take medication or behavioral therapy. He also felt no connection to nancy and wouldn't care if anything happened to her, according to a witness ( lanza killed her with a gunshot to the forehead ). Lanza left his bed made at home and sealed his windows with duct tape. He had carefully taken apart his hard drive and scratched a \" w \" on the disks before trying to destroy them with a dumbbell. He changed the seven magazines he had on him so often that in some cases he fired off only half of a magazine's 30 rounds before removing it; the courant notes investigators see this as a sign he approached the school shooting like a video game, as typical gaming practice is to enter a new room with a full magazine.",

        "summary": "The white house responded to congress'request for a blueprint for the closure of guantanamo bay on tuesday — though npr reports that president obama's proposed plan is \" not expected to go very far. \" it would see 35 of guantanamo's 91 inmates transferred to other countries by this summer, while the remaining detainees would be moved to one or several of 13 possible military and federal prisons in the united states, per the washington post and the ap. At least some of the sites under consideration are in south carolina, kansas, and colorado. The move would require up to $ 475 million in construction costs, though officials say closing guantanamo will save $ 180 million per year. Annual operating costs for the us facilities would range from $ 265 million to $ 305 million. Since a law exists barring guantanamo detainees from us soil, congress would need to alter it to approve the plan. Critics say it would put americans'safety at risk and the mayor of leavenworth, kan. — home to the maximum security army prison under consideration for guantanamo detainees — previously told npr that she's \" absolutely against \" guantanamo prisoners moving there. Many locals in canon city, colo., home to the centennial correctional facility also under consideration, feel similarly. In a live address on tuesday, however, obama argued that \" guantanamo bay does not advance our national security. It undermines it. \" he also called the prison center a propaganda tool for terrorist groups like the islamic state.",

But the 15-member panel declined to slap the regime with new sanctions, at least for now, despite a joint call to do so by south korea and japan. North korea's state-run news agency on wednesday warned the intermediate-range missile launch was a \" first step \" to further operations and a \" meaningful prelude to containing guam. \" the threat level remained high in the us territory, which north korea threatened earlier this month, drawing president trump's counter-threat of \" fire and fury. \" kim jong un was reportedly \" very satisfied \" with tuesday's launch, the first conducted from the capital. Japanese prime minister shinzo abe called the launch \" the most serious and grave threat ever \" against his nation. Meanwhile, north korean reports of the 1,680-mile missile flight over northern japan lacked the typical bluster, per reuters. The hwasong-12 missile flew a shorter distance and at a lower trajectory than earlier launches before plunging into the sea.

Starting next year, he's the senate majority leader. Among the night's other key winners and losers: the national republican senatorial committee finally had a great night after years of trouble against democrats. They managed to knock out sens. Mark pryor, kay hagan, and mark udall, while keeping a struggling pat roberts in the senate. As chair of the republican governors association, another 2016 contender, chris christie, fought hard for important victories in florida, wisconsin, maryland, and illinois, usa today reports. On a more conceptual level, the huffington post saw it as a big night for \" bullies. \" new york rep. Michael grimm beat out domenic recchia, even amid tax fraud charges and after a threat — caught on tv — to break a reporter \" in half. \" his win helped republicans gain what abc news notes is an even larger majority in the house. As for losers last night, president obama was a big one: he earlier said that his \" policies are on the ballot. \" the results, then, were a \" near total repudiation \" of those policies, usa today notes. What's more, chances for a democratic presidential victory in 2016 look weaker, the huffington post adds: the past three presidents have been elected under congresses run by their parties. Wendy davis lost badly in the texas gubernatorial race. She wasn't expected to win, cillizza notes, but she was also an icon for those who hoped to see texas eventually go blue. Instead, republicans swept last night's races for texas state offices, mother jones reports. Harry reid is out as senate majority leader, and he could struggle even to keep his seat during the next election, usa today reports.

The \" countdown has begun \" for the group to kill kenji goto and haruna yukawa unless japan pays $ 200 million in ransom, according to the post, published today. Japan says it's analyzing the message as it attempts to contact the men's captors through local tribes, though isis ' original 72-hour deadline has expired, the ap reports. \" the situation remains severe, but we are doing everything we can to win the release of the two japanese hostages, \" government spokesman yoshihide suga says. Meanwhile, goto's mother, junko ishido, is pleading with the government to save her son, who \" only went to rescue his friend, \" reuters reports. Documents show japan considered a military strike on isis militants but found that one would be outside its legal realm. A japanese journalist who tried to free yukawa in september and an expert on islamic law said yesterday they have an isis contact and were willing to negotiate with the group, the ap reports; it isn't clear if japan was agreeable. Finding the captors would be no easy task: experts reviewing the hostage video — which seems to show goto and yukawa in jumpsuits in the desert — suspect it was actually shot in a studio, the ap notes. Shadows converge, indicating two light sources rather than one bright sun, while noiseless \" wind \" ( perhaps from a fan ) doesn't appear to kick up dust.

            "Tokyo japan said on friday it was still trying to secure the release of two japanese hostages held by islamic state militants after a deadline to pay ransom for their release passed and there was no immediate word on their fate. Prime minister shinzo abe's government considered whether planned legislative changes would give it the legal basis for a military strike on the islamic state militants and concluded it did not, according to a briefing document reviewed by reuters. The capture of two japanese citizens in syria represents an \" unacceptable act of terror, \" the document said. But it concluded the situation would not meet the legal conditions for the dispatch of japanese forces, whose activities abroad are constrained by the pacifist, post-war constitution, even under planned changes to the current interpretation of the charter.

            "Tokyo japan said on friday it was still trying to secure the release of two japanese hostages held by islamic state militants after a deadline to pay ransom for their release passed and there was no immediate word on their fate. Prime minister shinzo abe's government considered whether planned legislative changes would give it the legal basis for a military strike on the islamic state militants and concluded it did not, according to a briefing document reviewed by reuters. The capture of two japanese citizens in syria represents an \" unacceptable act of terror, \" the document said. But it concluded the situation would not meet the legal conditions for the dispatch of japanese forces, whose activities abroad are constrained by the pacifist, post-war constitution, even under planned changes to the current interpretation of the charter.

Mona kirk, 51, and daniel panico, 73, were charged with willful cruelty to a child wednesday after authorities came upon the remote property without running water, electricity, plumbing, or heating, reports the los angeles times. According to officials, the family had been staying at the desert property for four years, with kirk and the children living in the box — about 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 4 feet high — and panico living in the trailer or a vehicle, reports the san bernardino sun. Panico reportedly owned the property and planned to build his dream home there, a neighbor tells the desert sun. But the san bernardino county sheriff's department called it \" an unsuitable and unsafe environment \" for the children, who didn't have an adequate amount of food. Authorities say the area, roamed by 30 to 40 cats, featured several feces-filled holes apparently used as toilets, and a rep for the sheriff's department says the kids weathered nights as cold as 20 or 30 degrees. Kirk and panico are now in jail with bail set at $ 100,000 each. Their children, who weren't enrolled in public school, are in the custody of children and family services and are in \" good spirits, \" per officials.",

Avocados treated by apeel sciences will be sold in the us for the first time this week, and thanks to a tasteless and edible coating, those avocados will stay fresh twice as long as a typical avocado. \" the average avocado might be ripe for 2-3 days. Ours will stay ripe for 4-6 days, \" says the company's ceo, per the guardian. The edible barrier, made from plant materials, creates a \" microclimate, \" controlling the rate at which water leaves the avocado's surface and oxygen enters — the two main things that make produce go bad. Apeel's ceo says it started with avocados because \" everyone has an experience of cutting into an avocado and discovering it's past its prime. It's a visceral reaction when you've spent a few dollars on something that ends up in the garbage. \" but many other types of produce can be treated with the coating, and apeel hopes to ultimately help reduce the 400 pounds of food per person estimated to be thrown away in the us per year. Apeel-treated avocados are first rolling out in costco and harp foods stores in the midwest, but will eventually be available across the us. They will cost the same as any other conventionally grown avocado. Business insider has side-by-side comparison photos of an untreated versus a treated avocado 30 days after harvest.",

        "summary": "Well this gives the phrase \" sleeping like a log \" a whole new meaning. New research shows trees might sleep like any other living organism, the christian science monitor reports. Scientists used lasers to make models of silver birch trees in finland and australia and discovered the trees ' branches \" droop \" up to 10 centimeters at night, according to new scientist. They published their findings earlier this year in frontiers in plant science. Studies on flowers and other small plants undergoing changes between night and day go back centuries, according to a press release. But it was never clear if large plants like trees did the same thing. \"no one has observed this effect before at the scale of whole trees, and i was surprised by the extent of the changes, \" one of the researchers tells new scientist. Researchers used laser technology that allowed them to monitor the trees ' movements without using lights, which would have produced a photosynthetic response in the plants. They found the trees ' branches were at their lowest point a few hours before sunrise. So far, it's unclear if the trees were moving due to their own internal clock or because of reactions to photosynthesis during the day. The drooping could be attributed to the loss of water pressure inside plant cells at night or because it takes energy to hold branches up to the sun during the day. Researchers plan to next study the water use of trees during the day and at night to get a better idea of what's going on. ( if you're a woman, trees could extend your life. )",

In 1992, ronald gilbert — then a medical resident at the veterans hospital in long beach — worked with other doctors to diagnose stanwood elkus, who was dealing with frequent urination, with a narrowing of the urethra. Two other doctors at the va ultimately performed a simple urethra-widening surgery without gilbert; elkus firmly believed the surgery was botched and damaged his prostate, the orange county register reports, causing incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and diminished sex drive, all of which led his longtime girlfriend to leave him. A da on the case told jurors that elkus held a grudge against gilbert over the incident. More than two decades later, elkus — who had often seethed about his medical issues in the ensuing years \" to anyone who would listen, \" per the register — used a fake name to make an appointment with gilbert on jan. 28, 2013, at his newport beach office, where he entered the exam room and shot him 10 times, killing him. The now-79-year-old pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but jurors found that he was sane and convicted him last month of first-degree murder. Per ktla, jurors also affirmed a special-circumstance allegation of lying in wait. That, along with a sentencing enhancement allegation of personal use of a gun, added 10 years to his sentence. \" the world was robbed of a model citizen … our children were robbed of an amazing father, \" said elizabeth gilbert, ronald gilbert's wife, at the sentencing hearing, recalling her husband's death just days before his 53rd birthday.",

Jurors also affirmed a special-circumstance allegation of lying in wait and a sentencing enhancement allegation of personal use of a gun, which added 10 years to elkus ' life sentence. Elkus had pleaded not guilty to the first-degree murder charge by reason of insanity, but jurors determined he was sane at the time of the killing.

A federal jury has awarded each plaintiff $ 5 million in punitive damages and $ 75,000 in compensatory damages, modern farmer reports. The more than $ 50 million in awards is to be paid by smithfield foods — the company for which the north carolina hog operation, kinlaw farms, raises the animals.

        "summary": "India's fourth largest city — along with its approximately 9 million residents — is pretty much completely underwater after a record amount of rainfall in the past month, bloomberg reports. According to the wall street journal, the runway at chennai's international airport was under 7 feet of water thursday, leaving 30 planes and hundreds of passengers stranded. Multiple businesses — including ford and hyundai factories — and the city's main railway station have shut down. Meanwhile, bloomberg adds that water is neck-deep in many neighborhoods, telephone networks are down, roads have been washed away, and many are without power. More than 250 people in chennai and the surrounding state of tamil nadu have been killed in flooding since the start of november, and more than 2,000 people have been evacuated, according to the journal. Chennai received nearly 48 inches of rain in november, more than three times the normal amount for november, bloomberg reports. And with most of the city barely above sea level to start with, even minor flooding can be a big problem, according to the journal. Prime minister narendra modi blamed the fatal flooding on climate change, while others looked toward heavy construction along the city's rivers. The indian government has allocated $ 141 million for flood relief. But bloomberg reports losses to businesses could reach $ 2.2 billion, with the tourism, automobile, and information technology industries being especially hit hard. One indian business association calls the situation \" total chaos. \" rains were expected to continue at least through friday, the journal reports.",

Such was the case as i photographed joshua mitchell at the reynolds high school graduation ceremony thursday night. Mitchell's brother, emilio hoffman, was killed tuesday morning in a shooting at the school by fellow student jared padgett. To honor his brother at the ceremony, mitchell wore emilio's reynolds raiders soccer jersey over his graduation gown. I was one of a few photographers who had floor access during the ceremony. Before mitchell walked the graduation line, i evaluated where i might position myself to best shoot his photo. I noticed that students weren't reacting to the crowd when they received their diplomas, but rather when they walked down a ramp toward assistant principal john dixon. Based on this i opted for the left side of the ramp, but at the diploma exchange i found my view blocked so i quickly moved to the other side as mitchell made his last handshake. It was then that mitchell turned his back to the crowd, revealing emilio's number 29, and raised his arms, a diploma and plaque in one hand and his other hand made into a fist. The discomfort came for me when he turned back and i could see the emotional intensity in his face. There i was, standing, in front of all the students and the friends and families in the audience, feeling a bit like an intruder in the moment. I quickly downloaded my camera cards into my laptop and sent the arms up photo first, feeling like it was the moment and then followed with several pictures from the ramp walk and mitchell's hug with dixon.

Multiple law enforcement sources have identified the shooter as chris harper mercer, a 26-year-old who lived in winchester, ore., a few miles away from umpqua community college, the bbc reports. Douglas county sheriff john hanlin, however, says he will never utter the man's name, the oregonian reports. \" i will not name the shooter, \" the sheriff told reporters at a thursday night briefing in roseburg. \" i will not give him credit for this horrific act of cowardice. \" the sheriff says the shooter is among the nine dead, and although he exchanged fire with deputies, it's not yet clear whether he was killed by police gunfire or took his own life. In other developments: the father of a wounded student tells cnn that the gunman targeted christians. He says his daughter has told him that after the shooter entered the classroom, students dropped to the ground and he told them to stand up if they were christian. \" they would stand up and he said, ' good, because you're a christian, you're going to see god in just about one second, ' \" the father says. \" and then he shot and killed them. \" mercer lists \" organized religion \" as one of his dislikes in a dating site profile where he describes his views as \" conservative, republican, \" reports the daily beast. His online presence also includes a myspace page where he shows support for the ira, and a blog in which he talks about roanoke gunman vester flanagan. \" a man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone, \" he writes. \" his face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day. Seems the more people you kill, the more you're in the limelight. \" mercer has also been linked to an account on a torrent upload site with the username \" lithium love, \" the guardian reports. His final upload, around three days ago, was a documentary on the sandy hook school shooting. A california man who was married to the suspect's aunt tells the daily beast that mercer is biracial, with a black mother and a white father who was \" out of the picture \" before he was born. He says the mother is from a \" very upper middle class \" household in torrance, calif. The apartment complex where mercer lived has been surrounded by police tape",

The latest signal appears to be from a \" man-made source, \" says the head of the australian agency coordinating the search, meaning it could be from the airplane's black box recorders; it will be further analyzed overnight. It was picked up thanks to one of the dozens of \" sonobuoys \" dropped yesterday; they listen underwater and transmit data to aircraft. More reason to hope the plane will be found soon: cnn reports that the signals picked up over the weekend have been analyzed, and authorities say they likely did come from electronic equipment, not marine life, and they seem to be consistent with signals from a flight data recorder. Meanwhile, malaysian sources have given cnn more details about the search and the plane's final moments. They say: police played the recording of the final words spoken from the cockpit to air traffic controllers for five malaysia airlines pilots who knew the pilot and co-pilot of flight 370, and those pilots confirmed it was in fact the captain speaking. \" there were no third-party voices, \" one official source says. Sources add that there was no apparent stress, nor anything else unusual, in his voice. The plane vanished from military radar for about 120 nautical miles after crossing back over the malaysian peninsula, meaning it likely went as low as 4,000 feet.",

        "summary": "The cause of sunday morning's deadly train crash in south carolina appears to be the most basic one imaginable: the amtrak train that plowed into a parked freight train was on the wrong track, say state officials. Now the big question is how that happened. Two people are dead — the conductor and engineer aboard the amtrak train — and more than 110 people injured, per the latest count from the ap. At least three of the injured were in serious or critical condition, and almost everyone else had relatively minor cuts or bruises. The amtrak silver star from new york to miami had been traveling about 50mph when it crashed into the empty csx train, well within the 59mph speed limit for that stretch of tracks in cayce, south carolina, reports the state. The best guess at this point is that a switch in the wrong position sent the amtrak train onto the wrong path. \"part of the preliminary indications are that it would have to be a switching issue, \" says a state transportation official. \" it was no derailment caused by a flaw in the track. The amtrak was on the wrong track. \" he adds that csx owns the track and would be the one responsible for maintaining the switches. Amtrak emphasized that point in its own statement, which also said it was \" saddened \" at the death of its two employees. Nbc news reports that the amtrak train received verbal permission to use the set of tracks because the csx signals were offline for maintenance. The crash might have been avoided if the tracks had a safety system known as the positive train control system, which sends warnings to trains ahead of a possible collision. Ptc is being phased in around the country, but it's not up and running yet on these tracks.",

Authorities were still piecing together the details of the case of veteran border patrol agent juan david ortiz, who allegedly killed four people and attempted to kidnap a fifth before his arrest over the weekend. The woman who escaped, a sex worker, told police that ortiz, 35, picked her up on the street and took her to his home, reports the corpus christi caller times. She said he began acting \" weird \" when she kept talking about the recent murder of two other sex workers, one of them a friend. They left his home, and the woman, by now afraid for her life, made a break for it at a gas station, according to the police affidavit. Ortiz allegedly pulled a gun on her in his pickup truck, and she leaped out of the vehicle as he tried to grab her shirt. She then ran to a trooper at the gas station. Police arrested ortiz hours later, at 2: 30am, in a hotel parking lot, but they say he had killed two more women, also sex workers, in the interim, reports the washington post. One of the latter victims was transgender. Ortiz reportedly told investigators that he shot his first victim by the side of the road on sept. 3 after a sexual encounter and the second after she accused him of being the last person to see the first victim alive. \" this guy is cold, \" says webb county-zapata county district attorney isidro alaniz. Ortiz is a 10-year veteran of the us customs and border protection, and authorities say he committed the murders while off duty. He is being held on $ 2.5 million bond. \" it's not a big city like san antonio, houston, where you see that a lot, \" says one laredo resident of the killing spree.",

Some of the women say they were strip-searched, photographed naked, beaten and forced to undergo \" virginity tests \" on threat of prostitution charges.at least 18 women were captured and held in military detention after army officers violently cleared cairo's tahrir square on march 9, nearly a month after pro-democracy protesters ousted president hosni mubarak from power. After their release days later, several of them complained to amnesty international about their treatment. The human rights group issued a public report on the allegations wednesday, calling on the egyptian government to investigate such claims of torture.one of the women is salwa hosseini, 20, who said she was arrested and taken to a military prison where she and other women were forced to take off all their clothes. They were searched by a female prison guard, she said, but male soldiers were able to look inside through two open doors and a window -- and snap photos of the degraded prisoners. In a different room, she said, a man in a white lab coat subjected them to \" virginity tests \" and threatened that those who didn't \" pass \" would be charged with prostitution.for one of the girls who claimed to be a virgin, the test purportedly declared otherwise -- and she was then tortured with beatings and electric shocks. \" forcing women to have ' virginity tests ' is utterly unacceptable, \" amnesty international said. \" its purpose is to degrade women because they are women.

            "Sponsored links weeks after egypt's vibrant, youth-led revolution, disturbing details are emerging about the treatment of some young female protesters briefly detained by egyptian soldiers. Some of the women say they were strip-searched, photographed naked, beaten and forced to undergo \" virginity tests \" on threat of prostitution charges.at least 18 women were captured and held in military detention after army officers violently cleared cairo's tahrir square on march 9, nearly a month after pro-democracy protesters ousted president hosni mubarak from power. After their release days later, several of them complained to amnesty international about their treatment. The human rights group issued a public report on the allegations wednesday, calling on the egyptian government to investigate such claims of torture.one of the women is salwa hosseini, 20, who said she was arrested and taken to a military prison where she and other women were forced to take off all their clothes. They were searched by a female prison guard, she said, but male soldiers were able to look inside through two open doors and a window -- and snap photos of the degraded prisoners. In a different room, she said, a man in a white lab coat subjected them to \" virginity tests \" and threatened that those who didn't \" pass \" would be charged with prostitution.for one of the girls who claimed to be a virgin, the test purportedly declared otherwise -- and she was then tortured with beatings and electric shocks. \" forcing women to have ' virginity tests ' is utterly unacceptable, \" amnesty international said. \" its purpose is to degrade women because they are women. All members of the medical profession must refuse to take part in such so-called'tests. ' \" amnesty continued: \" women and girls must be able to express their views on the future of egypt and protest against the government without being detained, tortured or subjected to profoundly degrading and discriminatory treatment. \" some of the alleged beatings outlined by amnesty international even took place inside an annex of the famed egyptian museum, where thousands of the country's most precious antiquities are housed. An egyptian journalist detained along with some of the victims, rasha azeb, said she heard the screams of women being tortured and given electric shocks inside the museum. The building was also looted during violent clashes between",

        "summary": "London has seen countless strange sights over the centuries — but a blimp depicting president trump as an angry orange baby rising outside the houses of parliament is a new one. The blimp — part of protests against trump's visit that are planned in dozens of british cities — went up friday morning, held with lead lines by 16 people calling themselves \" babysitters, \" the ap reports. Tens of thousands of people are expected to march in london against trump amid the uk's biggest police mobilization since riots in 2011. But the president will be elsewhere: his plans for the day include meetings with prime minister theresa may at chequers, her country retreat, and tea with queen elizabeth ii at windsor castle. Trump's meeting with may is likely to be an awkward one: in an interview published late thursday, he accused of her wrecking brexit and praised leadership rival boris johnson. Tom newton dunn, the journalist who interviewed him, says trump is \" really quite stung by the criticism he's been getting, \" the bbc reports. \" he knew all about the baby blimp. I think it hurt him, \" newton dunn says. London mayor sadiq khan has hit back against claims trump made in the interview, the guardian reports. Khan slammed trump's \" preposterous \" claims blaming immigration for crime. The mayor, accused by trump of doing a \" bad job, \" said he had authorized the blimp because he didn't want to restrict freedom of speech.",

We can thank canadian grad student yana eglit, who took a dirt sample while hiking and found two microscopic species that have long proved impossible to classify, the cbc reports. \" they represent a major branch... That we didn't know we were missing, \" says alastair simpson, a professor at dalhousie university in halifax. \" there's nothing we know that's closely related to them. \" in analyzing her sample, eglit spotted two kinds of minuscule organism called hemimastigotes — one of which had never been seen before. Scientists already know of roughly 10 hemimastigote species but haven't been able to classify them. And no hemimastigote had ever undergone genetic analysis before. So dalhousie researchers sequenced their genes using a new technique that gathers useful data from just a few cells, per science alert. The upshot: these organisms are as unlike other living things as fungi and animals are from one another. Technically they're eukaryotes ( possessing complex cells, like human beings ) and protists ( not within the fungi, plant, and animal kingdoms ), but don't fit patterns in the eukaryota domain — so the dalhousie team assigned them their own \" supra-kingdom. \" they also named the newly discovered hemimastigote hemimastix kukwesjijk after an ogre from indigenous canadian lore. After all, the tiny being has hairs and ruthlessly grabs its prey. The local mi ' kmaq people \" have an ogre-like creature [ named kukwes ] who is also hairy and terrifying and eats other creatures, \" says eglit.

        "summary": "As the white house continued to deflect accusations from conservatives that a $ 400 million payment to iran was ransom for four american detainees released earlier this year, donald trump twice this week claimed he had seen video of a \" top secret \" transaction in which the huge supposed payout was unloaded from a us airplane in iran, per the washington post. At a rally wednesday in daytona beach, fla., trump claimed the \" military tape \" purportedly showing \" money pouring off a plane \" had been released by iran to \" embarrass \" the us. He again voiced the claim about the video during a thursday rally in portland, maine, adding that iran hoped to personally embarrass an \" incompetent \" president obama with the video, the los angeles times and cnn report. His remarks caused a temporary hubbub, as some speculated that perhaps he had seen a classified video during security briefings afforded to presidential nominees. But what trump had actually seen soon came to light: \" b-roll footage, \" his spokeswoman emailed the post, that had been playing behind news reports. It showed not a money swap but an ap clip of three us prisoners released by iran and arriving in geneva on jan. 17. That led trump to point out his own error on twitter on friday morning ( though cnn notes he did so \" without actually saying he was wrong \" ): \" the plane i saw on television was the hostage plane in geneva, switzerland, not the plane carrying $ 400 million in cash going to iran! \" he tweeted.",

Macfarlane \" has no particular visual knack, little interest in storytelling, and nothing better to do with his naughty bear besides stuff him into a soft, sentimental comedy that seems almost proud of its lack of wit or conviction. \" the globe and mail is more forgiving: \" as unabashedly idiotic movie comedies go, ted goes fairly well, \" the paper notes. \" it's rude, crude, lewd, and often funny. In other words, it's a lot like macfarlane's animated show transferred to the big screen in a live-action story. \" at newsday, rafer guzman sees \" a very real heart \" to the film. \" this may sound silly, but the two humans and one bear make a pretty convincing dramatic triangle. \" heart? david haglund firmly disagrees. \" there's a cruel edge to so much of macfarlane's comedy — the quintessential macfarlane joke may be a punch in the face, \" he writes in slate.",

Her specialname.cn asks parents to pay a small fee, input their baby's gender, and choose five personality traits, out of a dozen options, they hope their child will have. Teen entrepreneur beau jessup has assigned those personality traits to english names, and three are chosen, shared with the family, and printed on a certificate along with their meanings and a famous person who shares the name. Jessup has offered up more than 200,000 names and has made nearly $ 64,000 from the venture so far, the bbc reports. The website also offers a photo gallery where parents can add pictures of their babies, the independent reports. She came up with the idea while on a family vacation in china, when she learned that chinese parents make sure to give their babies english names in case they later study or work in the uk or the us, the telegraph reports. Jessup was asked to pick an english name for the newborn baby of a family friend while on the trip, and after hearing some \" embarrassing \" english names that had been given to other chinese babies, she stepped in and later came up with her website idea. \" being exposed to luxury items and things like harry potter, disney films, and lord of the rings means [ chinese parents ] use those for reference, \" she explains. \" i once heard of someone called gandalf and another called cinderella. \" jessup, who is studying mandarin, is saving the money she earns for college tuition.

Cain will cohost the day the president elect is officially inaugurated and then takes over solo on tuesday, january 22. \"i ' m going to miss everything associated with doing a talk show, \" boortz said on air as his producer belinda skelton teared up. He said he is not doing this for health reasons. \"i am not doing this because i ' m fixing to die, \" he said. \"i have absolutely no health problems period. \" rather, he wants to travel with his wife donna, something he said is difficult to do as a full-time talk-show host. He even purchased a tour bus to rove the country. \"we're going to call this neal '",
            "Allison shelley/getty images. William temple put on the classic militia outfit, grabbed the gadsden flag, and headed to herman cain's sunday night reception. He has 12 different get-ups to re-enact different military eras, but this one — tan sailcloth, black leather gaiters, tricorner hat — goes over the best at tea party events. David weigel david weigel is a reporter for the washington post. Reporters love this. Temple is probably the most-photographed soldier of the tea party movement. Alas, it's sunday night at a hotel in a particularly anonymous quadrant of the washington, d.c. Suburbs. Barely 150 people have shown up. So temple grabs appetizers. There are four nearby tables piled high with grape leaves, various cheeses, pita bread tips, and charcuteries. \"i ' m here to support mr. Cain in whatever he does, \" says temple. \"what the media",

The pizza entrepreneur turned talk-show host turned presidential candidate turned unlikely tax policy advocate is turning back into a talk-show host. Cain is set to replace neal boortz on atlanta's news/talk wsb. Boortz announced monday that after 20 years of hosting \"the neal boortz show, \" he's giving up the microphone in january. The libertarian-leaning host has more than 6 million weekly listeners, according to wsb, and is known as the \" the high priest of the church of the painful truth. \" cain is known to many as the high point of weirdness in the 2012 gop presidential primary season. His bid shot out of nowhere last year, as restless republican voters seemed to be looking for something different. He was that -- a conservative with a boastful style, a catchy tax plan and his own gospel album. Many conservatives"

        "summary": "Conan o ' brien might soon find himself in court over allegations that are nightmarish for any comedian: he's accused of stealing jokes. As usa today reports, a judge has allowed a federal civil suit to go forward in which robert \" alex \" kaseberg accuses o ' brien and his writers of stealing jokes he posted online in 2014 and 2015. It's possible, perhaps even likely, the case will be settled before it goes to trial, given how tricky intellectual property cases can be. \" accusing a comedian of stealing a joke is the worst thing you can accuse them of, in my opinion, short of murder, \" said o ' brien himself in a deposition. Kaseberg makes his case in a blog post here. The judge said three jokes in particular are in question. Here they are, via the washington post: kaseberg: \" tom brady said he wants to give his mvp truck to the man who won the game for the patriots. So enjoy that truck, pete carroll. \" o ' brien: \" tom brady said he wants to give the truck that he was given as super bowl mvp … to the guy who won the super bowl for the patriots. Which is very nice. I think that's nice. I do. Yes. So brady's giving his truck to seahawks coach pete carroll. \" kaseberg: \" three towns, two in texas, one in tennessee, have streets named after bruce jenner and now they have to consider changing them to caitlyn. And one will have to change from a cul-de-sac to a cul-de-sackless. \" o ' brien: \" some cities that have streets named after bruce jenner are trying to change the streets ' names to caitlyn jenner. If you live on bruce jenner cul-de-sac it will now be cul-de-no-sack. \" kaseberg: \" the washington monument is ten inches shorter than previously thought. You know the winter has been cold when a monument suffers from shrinkage. \" o ' brien: \" yesterday surveyors announced that the washington monument is ten inches shorter than what's been previously recorded. Yeah. Of course, the monument is blaming the shrinkage on the cold weather. \"",

City councilor michael buscetto iii tells the day of new london that since the fountain opened, police have responded to calls of people urinating, defecating and showering in the fountain water.

            "Three children pushed mock buttons in front of the whale's tail fountain on parade plaza on saturday, as the city electrician activated the sculpture to send streams of water from the sculpture's fins. The event drew a crowd of onlookers, who had been watching or participating in the hope week parade, to the plaza's steps. The students chosen to push the button were adeliz cordero, a fifth grader at jennings school; malik faulkner, a fourth grader at nathan hale school; lashya lapoint, a first-grader at winthrop school; and tian richardson, a pre-school student at harbor school who was absent. Mayor martin olsen said the plaza opened a year ago, and the custom house maritime museum held a raffle to see who would turn on the fountain. Bruce hyde, who had been closely associated with the parade project, won the raffle but said he wanted to have some students in the city do the honors. \"this is new london at its best, \" olsen said of the gathering. The event was preceded by the hope week parade, which took dozens of organizations and schools on a march down broad street and state street. The honorary grand marshal of the procession was sgt.

            "Abstract recent research has begun to distinguish two aspects of subjective well-being. Emotional well-being refers to the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience — the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant. Life evaluation refers to the thoughts that people have about their life when they think about it. We raise the question of whether money buys happiness, separately for these two aspects of well-being. We report an analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the gallup-healthways well-being index, a daily survey of 1,000 us residents conducted by the gallup organization. We find that emotional well-being ( measured by questions about emotional experiences yesterday ) and life evaluation ( measured by cantril's self-anchoring scale ) have different correlates. Income and education are more closely related to life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against log income, life evaluation rises steadily. Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of ~$ 75,000. Low income exacerbates the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone. We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both",

What's more, the book isn't even available in bookstores yet — only amazon. Oliver joked about those amazing results in a tuesday night interview with seth meyers.

            "Nice, france ( reuters ) - french authorities were trying to determine on friday whether a tunisian who killed at least 84 people by plowing a truck into bastille day crowds had acted alone or with accomplices, but said the attack bore the hallmarks of islamist militants. Thursday night's attack in the riviera city of nice plunged france into new grief and fear just eight months after gunmen killed 130 people in paris. Those attacks, and one in brussels four months ago, shocked western europe, already anxious over security challenges from mass immigration, open borders and pockets of islamist radicalism. The truck zigzagged along the city's seafront promenade des anglais as a fireworks display marking the french national day ended. It careered into families and friends listening to an orchestra or strolling above the mediterranean beach towards the century-old grand hotel negresco. At least 10 children were among the dead.",

        "summary": "Disney's original beauty and the beast was the first animated film nominated for best picture at the oscars. In other words, its live-action remake starring emma watson and dan stevens has a tough act to follow. According to critics, it's good — but doesn't quite measure up to the original. The general reaction: \" if you thought it was a bad idea to mess with a classic, beauty and the beast will persuade you that a tale as old as time is worth retelling, \" writes calvin wilson at the st. Louis post-dispatch. While it's \" not quite as good as its predecessor, \" it's still \" a vastly entertaining film that combines old-school charm with technological wizardry, \" he adds, giving props to both watson and stevens. Colin covert agrees this retelling is \" less magical \" than the 1991 original, \" an underperforming example of more being considerably less, \" he writes at the minneapolis star tribune. But he also finds much to enjoy, from \" the subplot of egotistical gaston \" to the impressive detail in the computer imagery. In short, \" it is a visually sumptuous, highly watchable extravaganza. \" sara stewart actually thinks this new version is better than the original, partly because the beast is \" more engaging. \" but the film as a whole \" has something for everyone, \" she writes at the new york post. \" if you want your old favorite dressed in sumptuous new clothes, that's what you ' ll get. Those who always desired a little more depth from beauty and the beast will be happy, too. \" one who was not happy: joe morgenstern. He argues the film \" betrays the essence of what made the 1991 animated feature a beloved classic \" through \" a succession of disjunctures, missed moments and dubious deviations from the earlier script. \" it feels \" crazily cluttered \" and watson's belle is bland to boot, he writes at the wall street journal. He does, however, praise the \" huge jolts of visual energy. \" the film features disney's first \" exclusively gay moment, \" even if the reference is subtle.",

Half empty: homeownership is down for a fifth straight year to 64.6 %, the ap reports.

Even better: more young adults are moving out of their parents ' homes. Half full: more good news for young adults: many are benefiting from obamacare's provision allowing them to stay on their parents ' health insurance. That provision alone sent the number of insured up 3.5 %. Half empty: this one has nothing to do with the census, but with two half-fulls in a row we thought you might be getting cocky.

        "summary": "Harvey has made landfall again, this time as a tropical storm near the louisiana-texas border on the day after the 12th anniversary of hurricane katrina. Abc news reports the storm came ashore just west of cameron, la., around 5am et, with cnn noting that winds of roughly 40mph and a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet are expected. Noaa's public advisory now predicts another 3 to 6 inches of rain in southwestern louisiana, the eastern texas border area, and western kentucky through friday, with some areas getting as many as 10 inches. But as one national hurricane center meteorologist puts it, it's not the end, but the \" end of the beginning \": per noaa, \" while the threat of heavy rains has ended in the houston/galveston area, catastrophic and life-threatening flooding will continue in and around houston eastward into southwest louisiana for the rest of the week. \" more: the ap describes things as \" dire \" in port arthur, texas, near the louisiana border, on wednesday morning, as rising floodwaters inundated homes. Port arthur mayor derrick freeman said on his facebook page that the \" city is underwater right now but we are coming! \" the ap also suggests some potential relief, at least from the rain, for houston, with expected rainfall for wednesday at less than an inch. People reports on one of harvey's victims: a 41-year-old mother from beaumont, texas, who police say \" absolutely \" saved the life of her 3-year-old daughter; the child was found floating in a canal with her mother after the two became stuck while driving. \" the baby also had a backpack that was helping her float on her back and she was holding on to her mom, \" says an officer. Add this to harvey's toll: two exxonmobil refineries, which sustained storm-related damage that facilitated the release of pollutants. The washington post has the details on the damage at the baytown oil refinery, america's second-biggest, and the beaumont petrochemical refinery. Npr explains that the cleanup bill for harvey could be as much as $ 100 billion, and while congress will likely approve the funding needed, \" it probably won't be easy. \" it explains why, and the waves in which the funding would be issued. The new york times reports that a 12am to 5am curfew is now in place in houston, and came partly in response to reports of \" small-scale looting. \" the times puts the death toll at no less than 30. A longtime houston cop is among the dead.",

After setting the pepsi in front of wheeler, enrique pulled out a second soda for himself, though he didn't have time to take a sip before security officers approached him. \" whoa whoa whoa, not a good move, \" wheeler said. Once it was clear that no one's safety was at risk, wheeler did have a good laugh at the joke. But he also warned others in attendance not to approach the dais \" for your own safety, \" the mercury reports. \" if this were the boston city council that would have ended differently, \" he added. \" turns out pepsi isn't a panacea for everything, \" quips cnn.",

If she sweats, cries or simply takes a hot shower. \" it's torture living like this, it's torture, \" reid said in an interview with abc's tampa bay affiliate wfts. \" i just feel like a monster now. \" she said she developed the immunological condition three years ago when she was working at a gymnastics gym. On a website to draw attention to her case, reid said she has gained significant amount of weight and had to quit her job because the sweat would cause her to break out in",
            "Clearwater, fla - julie reid doesn't recognize her face in the mirror. \" it's torture living like this, torture, \" reid said. The 28-year-old clearwater transplant suffers from cholinergic urticaria, a rare hypersensitive skin condition that causes her to break out in hives all over her body because she is allergic to her own sweat and tears. The hives can last anywhere from an hour to several days. It is a condition that came on suddenly two years ago. \" it itches like crazy, i scratch my skin open, \" reid said. Her condition came on without warning. Now reid, who made a living as a gymnastics and dance instructor, can now longer follow her passion. Being outside is not possible either. The florida heat and sun are just too much for her."
