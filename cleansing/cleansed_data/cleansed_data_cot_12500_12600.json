The subsequent bill defined sexism as a remark or action that is \"intended to express contempt \", suggests someone is inferior due to their gender or is designed to \"reduce someone to his or her sexual dimension \". The crime is prosecutable if there has been a \"violation of someone's",

And what the unmanned x-37b orbital test vehicle was doing for all that time is, as they say, classified. The shuttle-like craft came in without a hitch at vandenberg air force base in california, completing its third — and longest — secret mission. Another is planned for next year. Rumors abound about what the spacecraft is up to, with everything from launching satellites, to spying on china's space lab, to killing satellites being floated, reports cnet and the bbc. But the latter site thinks the most credible explanation is more mundane: the spaceplane might be testing technology that will be used in future space missions. \" if you consider how expensive a satellite mission is — several hundred million dollars — you'd like to be sure that any innovations are going to work straight out of the box. \" testing prototypes aboard the x-37b, then, could save expensive mistakes down the line.

        "summary": "Paul ryan put out a list of demands he'd need met before agreeing to become house speaker, and one is getting its fair share of attention. Ryan — who the new york times notes is a regular at his kids ' basketball and volleyball events, as well as the family's \" designated pancake maker \" — said he wanted to cut down on weekend travel and fundraising so he could spend more time at home with his wife and three kids, making him an \" unlikely spokesman for balancing family life with work, \" as the washington post frames it. \" i cannot and will not give up my family time, \" he said after a house gop meeting tuesday. His daddy declaration is getting ample response: \" three cheers for paul ryan, \" ann marie slaughter, who penned a 2012 article in the atlantic about leaving her high-profile job to tend to her sons, tells the post. \" he ' ll reinvent the job. \" she adds, though, that if a woman had made that demand, it would be a different story: \" if nancy pelosi said that, it would be all over. \" other high-profile women also give ryan a thumbs-up. Facebook's sheryl sandberg gave ryan the \" lean in award, \" noting, \" having leaders who weigh responsibilities as fathers as much as their responsibilities to their jobs shows all of us what is possible. \" meanwhile, arianna huffington tweeted, \" good for paul ryan. \" not everyone was so enthusiastic, calling his demand \" hypocritical, \" per cnn. \" that's why dems are fighting for paid sick time, family leave &amp; schedules that work - bills your party repeatedly blocks, \" tweeted sen. Elizabeth warren, adding: \" @pryan family time should not be a privilege reserved for the speaker of the house. You deserve it – and so does everyone else. \" bernie sanders, who tweets regularly about paid family leave, noted, \" republicans talk about ' family values ' but the us is the only major country that doesn't guarantee paid family leave. \" perhaps the harshest assessment comes courtesy of sam biddle at gawker, who rails on \" enemy of women \" ryan and \" perpetual self-promotion machine \" sandberg for her \" odd choice. \" \" ryan... Has opposed congressional efforts to help women receive fair pay for their work, over and over again, \" biddle writes. One of the three children he wants time with is \" his daughter, whose reproductive health and ability to fight for a paycheck comparable to her brother \" ryan clearly doesn't care about. ( raw",

            "Image copyright florida gun supply george zimmerman, who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager in 2012, is selling his paintings of the confederate battle flag \" in honour \" of a florida gun store owner. The florida gun supply website says he is raising legal funds for himself and the store's owner, who in july declared his business a \" muslim-free zone \". The confederate battle flag is seen as a symbol of slavery to its critics. But its supporters today say it is an important part of southern heritage. Florida gun supply owner andy hallinan said he teamed up with mr zimmerman, who was acquitted in 2013 of killing black teenager trayvon martin, to sell copies of his confederate flag artwork. Mr zimmerman later tweeted about his reason for painting the flag. \" i painted the confederate flag backed by the american flag because i believe that anything can stand with the american flag behind it. \" he added: \" my confederate flag painting also represents the hypocrisy of political correctness that is plaguing this nation. \"'splitting the proceeds ' a post on the store's website said mr zimmerman painted it \" in honour \" of mr hallinan \" for being a true patriot and leading the country into a better, safer america \". Andy hallinan courted controversy last month when he announced in a youtube",

This painting was painted in honor of andy hallinan for being a true patriot and leading the country into a better, safer america. Zimmerman's last painting sold on ebay for over $ 100,000. Zimmerman's confederate flag faqs: all art has a story to tell. What's george's story? george started painting an american flag on this canvas, but heard about andy getting sued by cair ( the counsel for american/islamic relations ) while he was working on the painting. George decided to scrap the original american flag painting and repaint it with a confederate ( battle ) flag. ​george painted the confederate flag backed by the american flag because he believed that anything can stand with the american flag behind it. George's confederate flag painting also represents the hypocrisy of political correctness that is plaguing this nation. Politicians across the nation have demanded it's removal; however, not one leader including, but not limited to barack hussein obama demanded the posters displaying a $ 10,000 bounty on my head, \""

Prosecutors showed jurors clips from the film and discussed them, noting to jurors that one of the defendants even had a shirt made depicting an \" inside joke \" from the movie. \" but how did the techniques line up? they used bleach during their robbery, \" a prosecutor said during the trial. \" what about the police uniforms? yeah, they did that, too. \" defense lawyers appealed, arguing that the clips were prejudicial, but the majority opinion was that the film clips \" helped to show that the defendants ' modus operandi changed because they decided to incorporate ideas from the movie into their method for committing robberies. \" the justices ruled that the clips didn't taint the trial and the convictions would stand, though one judge, in a concurring opinion, wrote that there was a risk jurors \" might conflate fiction and reality. \" ( this would-be robbery also was a bumbling mess. )",

        "summary": "Elsewhere in the world, terrorists threaten art and antiquities, but in taiwan tween boys holding beverages are the threat. A 12-year-old taking a guided tour with his mom at an art exhibit in taipei lived out what was probably his ( and his mother's ) worst nightmare when he tripped next to a painting worth about $ 1.5 million, putting his fist right through it as he tried to break his fall, focus taiwan reports. He left a large gash in the bottom right of paolo porpora's flowers, an oil on canvas said to be about 350 years old, the guardian notes. There were between 200 and 300 visitors at the exhibit when the mishap occurred, per focus taiwan. Video footage from the exhibit at huashan 1914 creative park shows the boy strolling past the ropes that separate the painting from the public, drink in right hand — until he loses his balance and falls over the ropes and into the painting. He appears stunned, looking for reaction from other spectators until he walks away with a woman who appears to be a museum worker. The exhibit organizer, however, isn't going to make the boy's family pay for the damages — the painting, the only one signed by porpora, is insured, the guardian notes. A post on the exhibit's facebook page reads, per the paper: \" all 55 paintings in the venue are authentic pieces and they are very rare and precious. Once these works are damaged, they are permanently damaged. \" another facebook post, however, thanks a restorer for fixing the painting up as best as he could. \" the restoration of the painting … was possible because of the high skills and talent of mr. Leo tsai, \" it read.",

He told reporters in china today that authorities are \" very confident \" pings detected in the indian ocean are from the plane's black boxes and the position has been narrowed to \" within some kilometers, \" the bbc reports. \" still, confidence in the approximate position of the black box is not the same as recovering wreckage from almost 4.5km ( 2.6 miles ) beneath the sea or finally determining all that happened on that flight, \" he added. Search chief angus houston, however, downplayed abbott's remarks, reports the sydney morning herald. He said there had been \" no major breakthrough \" in the search, which now involves 15 aircraft and 13 ships in a greatly reduced but still large area. Signals consistent with those from flight recorders have been picked up four times in the area, but authorities say a fifth ping detected yesterday by a \" sonobuoy \" dropped from an aircraft has been analyzed and does not appear to be linked to the plane. A us navy vessel has arrived to supply ships involved in the search, a sign that \" they're getting ready for the long haul, \" a cnn aviation analyst says. \" even if they do get four or five more pings, once they drop the side-scanning sonar device down, that is going to be painstaking and long.

India landry, a senior at windfern high school, says she was in the principal's office oct. 2 when the pledge began over the pa system. When she didn't stand as requested by the principal — identified in the washington post as martha strother — strother then replied, per india: \" you're kicked out of here, \" khou notes. Now india's mom, kizzy landry, is suing strother and the cypress-fairbanks independent school district, saying her daughter's first amendment rights were violated. \" i don't think that the flag is what it says it's for, for liberty and justice and all that. It's not obviously what's going on in america today, \" says india, who notes to the new york daily news she's been sitting during the pledge since ninth grade without issue. The teen adds that \" police brutality \" and \" donald trump being president \" inspire her to keep her protest going. The supreme court ruled in 1943 that making students stand during the pledge was unconstitutional. Windfern has its own policy, stating that students have to stand, unless they have a note from home saying otherwise. Kizzy landry says she offered to write that note, but she says strother called india's actions \" disrespectful \" and that india must stand to return. Per the post, after media started getting wind of the story, india was invited back to school late last week and told she didn't have to stand, but the landrys had already decided to sue. Meanwhile, a statement since issued by the district notes \" a student will not be removed from campus for refusing to stand for the pledge \" and that it will handle any such matters \" internally. \" ( vp mike pence left an nfl game due to kneeling players. )",

Andrew \" bob \" harris, 32, made history on aug. 18 when he reached the summit, 13,776 feet above jackson hole, wyo., at 5: 15pm local time, climbing reports. \" with bob, limits are arbitrary, \" says his sister, amy harris, who organized the adventure with her husband, max hammer. Their choice of mountain hewed to her brother's preference for exposed slab, and there was certainly plenty of it. A video teasing the 12-hour trek shows harris, called \" ducky \" by his family, making his way across nail-biting rock faces. As outside notes, scaling the spiraling peak — \" like a cardboard cutout of the biggest, most jagged peaks someone could imagine \" — is tough work. It begins with a steep 6.5-mile climb to gain 5,000 feet, and then the hard part starts. Roped together, the group \" practiced team dynamics and movement together in a threesome, \" hammer tells teton gravity research. With hammer leading with the ropes, harris, an accomplished runner, took cues from his sister. There were tense moments when loose rock slowed progress. Harris \" would be the first to tell you he doesn't like that loose stuff, \" his brother-in-law says. But harris \" feeds off the energy of others \" and shared plenty of laughs with his sister. \" when you hang out with bob... There is a constant level of irreverence and goofy joy, \" amy harris tells climbing. The trio spent only a couple minutes at the top. \" andrew was the happiest little guy i've ever seen, \" hammer tells teton gravity.

The bbc reports researchers in australia monitored juvenile crocodiles using infrared cameras and determined they often slept with one eye open and may only sleep with half their brain at a time. According to phys.org, this type of unihemispheric sleep has been observed in birds and aquatic mammals, such as the dolphin. \" these findings are really exciting as they are the first of their kind involving crocodilians and may change the way we consider the evolution of sleep, \" lead researcher michael kelly says in a press release. \" what we think of as ' normal'sleep may be more novel than we think. \" by sleeping with one eye open and half their brain active, crocodiles could respond quickly to threats and prey — including humans, phys.org reports. \" they definitely monitored the human when they were in the room, \" researcher john lesku tells the bbc. \" but even after the human left the room, the animal still kept its open eye … directed towards the location where the human had been. \" researchers are planning more tests to confirm their findings in crocodiles and other reptiles; specifically, more research is needed to determine whether one half of the crocodilian brains is actually awake as the other half sleeps. Depending on what they find, lesku says our version of whole-brain sleep — which we think of as normal — could actually be an \" evolutionary oddity. \" ( a \" tipsy \" australian hunter successfully fought off a very awake crocodile. )",

How sanitary? this sanitary: water bureau administrators are willing to flush 38 million gallons of the stuff and clean the open-air reservoir in order to make sure there's not the most miniscule amount of human urine in it. The oregonian reports that a 19-year-old man peed in mt. Tabor reservoir 5, which supplies the city with drinking water, around 1am yesterday. He was caught on surveillance video leaning against a fence in order to \" get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars, \" said water bureau administrator david shaff; the man then pulled up his pants seconds later. That was apparently enough of a leak for the city to step in. \" even though there is very minimal public health risk, the bottom line is that our commitment is to serve water that's clean, cold, and constant. That doesn't include pee. Not from people, at least, \" said shaff, who acknowledges that animals routinely urinate, or worse, in the water. Also caught on video: the man and his cohorts took selfies at the scene. The group of three was later stopped by officers and given trespassing citations along with, in the case of the pee-er, a public urination citation. The pipes to the reservoir, which holds treated water, were then immediately closed, and the water was tested; the results, due today, aren't expected to show any contamination. The ap notes the water will be drained into the sewage system that eventually dumps into the columbia river. The same thing happened in 2011 at the mt.

        "summary": "The united states, canada, japan, australia, and eight more pacific rim countries on monday came to an agreement on a free-trade pact that would kill upward of 18,000 tariffs currently in place on us exports ranging from cars to avocados, in a deal the washington post hails as the largest \" in a generation. \" the terms of the trans-pacific partnership were hashed out over nine days in atlanta, with an intended sunday announcement falling through amid continuing debate. What you need to know: what makes the deal so large? the counties involved ( also brunei, chile, malaysia, mexico, new zealand, peru, singapore, and vietnam ) represent about 40 % of the world's gdp. How long has the deal been in the works? negotiations have occurred over almost eight years, per the new york times, with the post terming five of those years as seeing \" arduous \" debates. President obama has been pushing the deal as a way to keep china from having an overbearing influence on pacific trade. What were some of the final sticking points? drugs and dairy. Us producers of biologic drugs ( that is, those made from living organisms ) currently have 12 years to keep their data secret so as to ward off cheaper rivals. Australia was the loudest opponent; the compromise provides between five and eight years of data protection. On the dairy front, america will be able to export more dairy to canada and japan; we ' ll also import more such products from new zealand. So is it a go? not yet. Congress now has 90 days to review the agreement, whose full text won't be available for as long as a month. That puts the up-or-down vote in early 2016 ( february at the earliest, per politico. ) the wall street journal reports that support among democrats is tepid; as for republicans, it paints their support as \" unpredictable \" as they eye the 2016 election. Labor unions, environmentalists, and liberal activists see it as a bad deal for american workers and the planet. Candidates ranging from donald trump to bernie sanders aren't fans, either. What would it mean for obama? \" legacy-making \" and \" legacy-defining \" are the phrases being trotted out by the media, with the times summing it up as a potential \" capstone for his foreign policy ' pivot'toward closer relations with fast-growing eastern asia, after years of american preoccupation with the middle east and north africa. \"",

People may have different triggers — whispering, light touches on the face, hair brushing, etc. — but the end goal is to feel a tingling sensation that can be so calming it sometimes initiates sleep. And since the term asmr was coined in 2010, there's a burgeoning sub-genre of asmr videos on youtube, some of which get millions of views and lead to sizable pay checks for the creators, reports cnbc. \" it's a very pleasant, natural high state that you want more and more of, \" says maria, who only uses her first name and whose channel gentle whispering asmr has more than 880,000 subscribers; her top five videos have amassed more than 47 million views. Maria whispers, looks directly into the camera, and touches a range of objects with soft but firm swirling motions — asmr is sometimes called a \" brain orgasm, \" although one study from 2015 suggests that the videos are only sexual for 5 % of viewers and are used by 82 % of viewers for help falling asleep. Eater reports that asmr is even found in the world of food videos, with videos of eating or cooking sounds becoming increasingly popular among the asmr crowd.

The yukon coroner's service says trapper gjermund roesholt was returning to the cabin in the einarson lake area monday afternoon when he was charged by a grizzly bear about 100 yards from the building, the yukon news reports. After shooting the bear dead, he found the bodies of wife valérie théorêt, 37, and their daughter, adele, just outside the cabin. \" it appears they had been out for a walk when the incident occurred \" some time between 10am and 3pm, the coroner says. Théorêt was on maternity leave from her job teaching at whitehorse elementary school. Friends say the couple, who bought a trapline around three years ago, loved the outdoors and saw théorêt's time off as an opportunity to spend an extended period at the cabin. Fellow trappers say the couple knew what they were doing in the wilderness. \" these are competent bush people. It's not from lack of experience, \" neighbor brian melanson tells the cbc. \" it's going to be devastating to the community, because it's going to hit home to everybody. You know, we go out there, all of us, we take our wives and our children, and we live out there, \" he says.

        "summary": "A recent survey of us adults found 68 % weren't comfortable giving delivery drivers access to their homes to leave packages inside, as happens with amazon's new service, the seattle times reports. That number may soon go up even further. A security research firm tells cbs news a \" really simple \" hack could make the service decidedly less secure. With amazon key, launched last month, delivery drivers use an app to unlock the front door, drop a package off, and lock the door behind them all while being monitored via a wireless camera. But rhino security labs says a de-authentication attack on the wi-fi router could take that camera offline. What's worse, wired reports doing so wouldn't suspiciously send the camera to black but just freeze it on the last scene it recorded — such as a harmlessly closed door. This security flaw could be used in two ways. The delivery driver could drop off the package and leave the house but not lock the door, disable the camera using a computer of any kind, then re-enter the home and lock the door. To a user monitoring through the amazon key app, this would make everything appear fine while the driver roams about their home. A hacker following a delivery driver could also disable the digital lock and camera just before the driver locks the home. Amazon says the flaw isn't with its amazon key software but rather one that is inherent in wi-fi routers. It says a de-authentication attack is \" unlikely \" but it will release a software update to \" more quickly provide notification if the camera goes offline during delivery. \"",

            "When amazon launched its amazon key service last month, it also offered a remedy for anyone — realistically, most people — who might be creeped out that the service gives random strangers unfettered access to your home. That security antidote? an internet-enabled camera called cloud cam, designed to sit opposite your door and reassuringly record every amazon key delivery. But now security researchers have demonstrated that with a simple program run from any computer in wi-fi range, that camera can be not only disabled but frozen. A viewer watching its live or recorded stream sees only a closed door, even as their actual door is opened and someone slips inside. That attack would potentially enable rogue delivery people to stealthily steal from amazon customers, or otherwise invade their inner sanctum. And while the threat of a camera-hacking courier seems an unlikely way for your house to be burgled, the researchers argue it potentially strips away a key safeguard in amazon's security system. When wired brought the research to amazon's attention, the company responded that it plans to send out an automatic software update to address the issue later this week. \" the camera is very much something amazon is relying on in pitching the security of this as a safe solution, \" says ben caudill, the founder of the seattle-based security firm rhino security labs, whose researchers",

A seattle-based group of cybersecurity researchers has demonstrated a way to knock amazon's new security camera offline, a capability that could enable malicious delivery drivers for the online retailer's new in-home delivery service to snoop around a house undetected. Amazon key, which became available to customers last week, gives amazon delivery drivers one-time access to a residence to drop off a package. The program, designed to eliminate the theft of packages left outside a home and to open up the potential for remote authorization of other home services, is a test of whether consumers trust amazon enough to give the online retailer access to the front door. It relies on two pieces of hardware: a smart lock, and cloud cam, which communicates with amazon's servers to authorize the driver to unlock the door, and then records the delivery, beaming live or recorded video to a smartphone app to give the homeowner peace of mind. Rhino security labs, a security research outfit based in capitol hill, showed that it could exploit a weakness in the wi-fi protocol that cloud cam and many other devices use to communicate with their router."

When the drone began circling the plane, officials grounded all the aircraft in the area, including five helicopters, three large air tankers, and five heavy air tankers. Because they lacked air cover, ground crews fire were called back as well. Numerous witnesses say they saw carpenter operating a drone in the area throughout the week, and officials arrested him friday after finding drone views of the fire on his website. Carpenter's bond was set at $ 25,000. Arizona passed a law last year making it illegal for drones to impede emergency or law-enforcement activities.

        "summary": "A slight teenage girl who died in a mexican cave 12,000 years ago may help settle a long-simmering debate in archaeological circles, reports usa today: where did the very first americans come from? the answer doesn't seem to be europe, australia, or southeastern asia, but rather a land that no longer exists called beringia — it once connected siberia and alaska but is now submerged beneath the bering sea. Scientists say the nearly intact skeleton of the 15- or 16-year-old girl has the dna of modern native americans, who trace their lineage to beringia, reports livescience. They found her in an underwater cave in mexico's yucatan peninsula and nicknamed her naia, after the water nymphs of greek mythology. \" what this study is presenting for the first time is evidence that palaeoamericans, with those distinctive features, can also be directly tied to the same beringian source population as contemporary native americans, \" says study co-author deborah bolnick of the university of texas, austin. Naia, who stood about 4-10, \" is the oldest nearly complete, genetically intact human skeleton in the new world, \" says the wall street journal. One wrinkle is that she doesn't look like modern native americans, but more like an indigenous australian or pacific islander. Still, scientists say the dna link is definite, and the next step will be a thorough genetic analysis of all her bones. ( a vanderbilt anthropologist cautions against overly wide interpretations: \" it doesn't mean that all early skeletons from the americas represent the same story, \" he tells the guardian. ) the best guess is that naia ventured into the cave looking for drinking water and fell to her death.",

In fact, the presenter goes so far as to call it \" truly terrific stuff. \" among the tidbits: mucus is 95 % water, while crusty boogers are just dehydrated versions. Mucus forms all over our bodies, even in our genitals, to keep delicate body tissue moist and trap invading particles that might do us harm. Our bodies produce more mucus to flush out those pathogens and also send in little immune cell armies to wage battle. And congestion isn't actually from an enormous buildup of snot, but rather nasal inflammation blocking those airways.

No, they didn't just get hungry. As mother jones reports, american poultry farms began breeding the birds for size and speed of growth in the 1950s. As their breasts grew at a ridiculous rate, the turkeys became bowlegged and couldn't stand upright. In fact, male birds grew so big they could no longer transfer semen to their female counterparts, so producers took on artificial insemination. What's more, infections soon arose as operations moved indoors and turkeys were stuffed into close quarters. Producers added antibiotics to the mix to prevent sores on the birds ' feet and breasts and began \" debeaking \" birds to avoid cannibalism, another problem that arose in such small spaces. If you care to avoid factory birds, turkeys are available from humane sources certified through animal welfare programs. Or you could be like supermodel chrissy teigen and ditch the bird altogether. \" on its own, turkey is the worst of the birds by far and one of the worst meats in general, \" she rants on twitter, per gawker. She continues, \" if u said ' eat this one bite of human and u can eat any other meat the rest of your life ' or ' chrissy u eat turkey forever ' i'd eat human. \" that's one thanksgiving dinner we'd rather avoid.

The vote came as part of a session on a highway funding bill that has to pass by friday to prevent bringing a halt to construction projects across the country, reports usa today. While the move to add obamacare repeal to the funding bill was rejected, the senate did approve an amendment to revive the export-import bank, which has been targeted by conservatives like cruz, by a 67-26 vote, the ap reports.

Two other men were stabbed to death in the horrific incident but fletcher survived a serious neck wound and posted a new poem on facebook on saturday, the oregonian reports. \" i am alive, \" it began. \" i spat in the eye of hate and lived. This is what we must do for one another. \" family members say the knife came within millimeters of his jugular and he was in surgery for more than two hours. In other developments: one of the two teenagers targeted, 16-year-old destinee mangum, says she was on the train with a 17-year-old muslim friend when jeremy joseph christian started shouting abuse at them. She tells kptv that after strangers defended them, an argument began and they ran away when christian started stabbing people. She says she wants to thank the people who put their lives on the line for her. \" i just want to say thank you to them and their family and that i appreciate them because without them, we probably would be dead right now, \" she says. Fletcher's girlfriend, miranda helm, tells the oregonian that he wants to meet another good samaritan who saved his life after the attack. She says the unidentified man rushed to fletcher's side and applied a cloth to the wound. She says the man called fletcher's mother to tell her he had been injured and tried to reassure her, telling her he was a veteran and familiar with first aid. A friend has started a gofundme campaign to cover fletcher's medical bills. Christian, a 35-year-old white nationalist, is in custody on suspicion of crimes including the murders of ricky john best, 53, and taliesin myrddin namkai-meche, 23. Kgw reports that police say he was involved in an altercation at a train station the day before the murders. A source tells the station that christian threw a bottle of gatorade at a black woman, who responded by spraying him with mace. He is due to make his first court appearance tuesday. Buzzfeed reports that an open letter from dan rather to president trump about the attack is being widely shared. In the letter, rather urges trump to address the incident and honor those who lost their lives. \" they were brave americans who died at the hands of someone who, when all the facts are collected, we may have every right to call a terrorist,",

Colbert played a clip and wondered why stone didn't ask a followup when putin denies any interference in the us election. \"that doesn't seem like an interview, \" said colbert. \" that seems like an opportunity for him to merely propagandize. \" stone responds that he does press putin on such matters later in the documentary, though he repeatedly avoids saying anything critical about putin even when asked by colbert if he had \" anything negative \" to say at all. \" what's wrong with detente with russia, \" asks stone, seemingly a little irked. He praises putin for his devotion to country, his \" calmness, \" and his courtesy, and he drew some groans from the audience when he said putin had been \" insulted and abused. \" it didn't seem to help when he clarified, \" abused in the press; in the media. \"",

        "summary": "In march toys r us announced it was closing for good and leaving 33,000 people out of work. But the washington post reports on the toy retailer's \" complicated comeback, \" saying it has come \" crawling back \" from what looked to be a certain demise. Geoffrey ( the chain's giraffe mascot ) has \" risen from the grave, \" as business insider puts it, with the chain setting up a presence for holiday shopping via geoffrey's toy box pop-up shops in almost 600 kroger and kroger-owned stores around the country. \" i've never seen something in our stores that our customers are so excited about, \" a kroger rep says. Who isn't so excited: ex-toys r us employees, one of whom says the pop-ups feel like \" a slap in the face. \" \" it's hard to explain how it feels that the people responsible for liquidating the company are the ones that are doing this, \" a california man who was a toys r us employee for years tells the post of the hedge funds that now own the company. An analyst also points out that, even though the crowds seem receptive to the idea of the toys r us pop-ups, \" nostalgia only goes so far \" — geoffrey's toy box offers only limited, private-label brands ( e.g., imaginarium ) that people may only buy in a pinch, not the hot brands people usually want around the holidays. \" it's immaterial in the whole retail landscape, \" she notes. The 35 toys offered in the pop-up displays will cost between $ 20 and $ 50, per usa today. As for what happens after the holidays: sources tell the chicago tribune that the hedge funds may be planning a stand-alone relaunch next year.

So when the 8-year-old child actor and chef ( she's competed on fyi's man vs. Child: chef showdown ) became the center of a controversy swirling around one of the comedian's jokes at the oscars, she shrugged it off, pri reports. But her family isn't quite so understanding. The joke: rock introduced estie and two other asian-american child actors as the \" most dedicated, accurate, and hard-working representatives \" of pricewaterhousecoopers, the firm that safeguards voting for the oscars, per the los angeles times. He followed that with: \" if anybody's upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids. \" the joke caused all kinds of backlash, including from taiwanese-american actress constance wu and nba player jeremy lin, who tweeted, \" seriously though, when is this going to change?!? tired of it being ' cool ' and ' ok'to bash asians. \" estie's mom, laura kung, admits that during estie's audition, \" i did wonder, ' why all asians? ' but i assumed there was a bigger picture, a more complex joke given all the emphasis placed on diversity at the oscars this year. \" when she and estie's dad heard the entire joke at the show's rehearsal, after the contract was signed, they reluctantly let their daughter go ahead with it. \" this was not ok and should never have happened, \" says kung. \" but the angrier people are and [ the ] more people talk about it, the better it will be moving forward. \" as for estie, when asked whether rock's joke was funny, she says, \" kind of, kind of not. \" ( rock's monologue got mixed reviews. )",

That bloke is the late conservationist steve irwin, who died 10 years ago this month. \" with a list a mile long of all the good steve had accomplished in our world let's show our appreciation to a great true blue australian, \" the petition reads. One of the founders also tells the bbc that irwin would be a solid choice because \" the newer generation barely knows \" those whose mugs currently grace the country's currency. A facebook page has been set up to get the word about the push for irwin, the telegraph reports. The royal australian mint usually only permits likenesses of the uk's queen elizabeth and/or other members of the british royal family on its commemorative coins; it's not clear what the ruling is for notes, which are printed by a different organization. The head of the mint, though, doesn't seem opposed to the general idea, telling his fellow citizens to send in a written proposal if they really want to make this happen. Meanwhile, irwin's daughter, bindi, tells news corp australia that it's \" such an honor \" her dad is being considered. Irwin being made a literal national treasure wouldn't be unprecedented: he appeared on a dollar coin as part of a limited-edition set in 2009.",

Without safe harbor, personal data transfers overseas are now forbidden except via costly ( in price and time ) means, per reuters. \" this is extremely bad news for eu-us trade, \" a tech and telecommunications head at the linklaters law firm tells reuters. \" without safe harbor, [ businesses ] will be scrambling to put replacement measures in place. \" schrem was spurred to file his complaint after edward snowden revealed the nsa's prism program gave the us authority to scour user data from tech giants such as facebook, google, and apple, notes reuters.

He blamed \" sick people \" for inventing the story and called it a \" disgrace \" that it was leaked.

( it's not clear yet whether he ' ll get the reward, because no arrests have been made. ) the ap provides a little background on why the car, which is used in the chain's promotions, means so much to schnatter. It seems he sold it decades ago to help support his father's struggling tavern in indiana. That tavern eventually became papa john's, and schnatter tracked down the car and bought it back again.",

The resulting bloom — which only happens every five to 10 years — is truly something to behold. The abc reports this rare occurrence is known as \" desierto florid, \" or the flowering desert. And flower it has, with carpets of brightly colored vegetation covering the desert's hills and plains. Live science reports it's the most rain the area has gotten in two decades, and a chile tourism official says this year's bloom is more impressive than previous ones as a result.

Former minister of state for antiquities zahi hawass tells live science his team is \" sure \" they've found a tomb in egypt's valley of the kings, \" but we do not know for sure to whom it belongs. \" as for why the theory that it belongs to ankhesenamun has emerged, it's a matter of proximity: live science reports ankhesenamun wed the pharaoh ay after tut's death, and the tomb was found near ay's. A post at ancient origins is less unequivocal about the latter marriage, noting artifacts show ankhesenamun and ay together, but don't make clear that a marriage actually took place; it reports her name is not found within ay's tomb. Ankhesenamun was around the age of 13 when she married tut, who was slightly younger. Hawass says he will lead subsequent excavations at the site, where he located four foundation deposits that he says indicate a tomb was constructed there. As for tut and ankhesenamun's supposed children, a 2008 ap report noted their remains had been stored at cairo university's school of medicine following their 1922 discovery.

Ankhesenamun ( \" her life is of amun \" ) was a queen of the eighteenth dynasty of egypt.

The country's high court on thursday ruled that only parliament has the power to formally begin the brexit process. More: the ruling means article 50 can't be triggered without parliamentary approval. The wall street journal does see it as \" theoretically \" possible that lawmakers could slow or halt the process, though it notes may's conservative party is the largest party in parliament. The guardian explains the rub with article 50: it declares that each eu member may exit \" in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. \" it's not defined beyond that, which opened the door for both sides to make their argument. So how to go about making one's case? sky news reports that during the case \" there were colorful references to henry viii, to the 1689 bill of rights, to the 1610 case of proclamations, and to the rights of lobster fisherman in newfoundland after a treaty with france in 1892. \" may had previously announced her plan to trigger brexit by march 31, setting the stage for a summer 2019 exit, with the ap reporting she was relying on a power called the royal prerogative that lets the government withdraw from international treaties. Those who opposed such a move said that the people will sacrifice some of their rights ( like free movement within the bloc ) due to the exit, and as such, parliament's blessing is necessary. The government says it will appeal, per the bbc; the supreme court has made room in its schedule to hear the case in early december.",

Through an iv, madeux, who has a metabolic disease called hunter syndrome, received billions of copies of a corrective gene and a genetic tool to cut his dna in a precise spot. Those with madeux's condition lack a gene that makes an enzyme that breaks down certain carbohydrates, which build up and wreak havoc. Madeux has had 26 operations for hernias, bunions, bones pinching his spinal column, and ear, eye, and gall bladder problems. Scientists have edited genes before by altering cells in the lab. There are also gene therapies that don't edit dna. But these methods can only be used for a few diseases, and some have results that may not last; others can't control where the dna is inserted. This time the gene tinkering, which uses a tool called zinc finger nucleases, is happening in a precise way inside the body. \" it becomes part of your dna and is there for the rest of your life, \" says the head of a company testing the therapy. That also means there's no way to erase editing mistakes. \" you're really toying with mother nature, \" and the risks can't be fully known, but the studies should move forward because these are incurable diseases, says another expert.

        "summary": "Nothing in life is free, but instagram users may not have gotten the memo. In what mediaite sees as a sort of copycat move based on the wendy's chicken nugget boy ( if you've somehow missed that story, it's here ), california-based sunny co clothing on tuesday issued a call asking instagram users to repost this photo within 24 hours and tag the company in the repost. Those who did by 5pm edt wednesday were told they'd get a code entitling them to a free pamela sunny suit, retail value $ 64.99. Somewhat predictably, the photo of the back of a girl in the suit is now everywhere, reports mediaite. If sunny co clothing was hoping for a strictly feel-good story — it did kick off its post with the message \" sharing is caring \" — it somewhat failed, at least on twitter, where people went to vent about the photo's proliferation ( time rounds up some particularly funny responses here ). Even simone biles tweeted to ask for an end to the madness, and her tweet alone has been liked more than 12,500 times. \" scrolling through instagram and 27 pictures in a row are of that red bathing suit i kid you not, \" tweeted @nnikinewtonn. The original instagram post notes the promotion is sponsored by @twazerapp, so perhaps it's not costing sunny co clothing much, but it will cost participants something: shipping and handling isn't included and costs $ 12, cbs local reports. That was clarified in a second instagram post from the company that outlined some other details: deliveries could be delayed ( it suggests a 3- to 6-week ship time ) and \" due to the viral volume of participants, we reserve the right to cap the promotion if deemed necessary. \" ( see why h&m took flak for its swimsuit ad. )",

        "summary": "Looks like female sawfish don't need the guys so much anymore. Scientists have discovered seven examples in florida of virgin-birth offspring by smalltooth sawfish, an endangered species whose members grow up to 25 feet in length and have long snouts studded with teeth, livescience reports. Their offspring may provide the first strong evidence of vertebrates giving birth in the wild by asexual reproduction, or parthenogenesis: \" rare species, like those that are endangered or colonizing a new habitat, may be the ones that are doing it most often, \" says demian chapman, who co-authored a study on the births. \" life finds a way. \" asexual reproduction is common among invertebrates, and is increasingly seen among vertebrates ( animals with backbones ) like the komodo dragon, sharks, snakes, and some birds — but only those surviving in captivity, until now. These sawfish offspring have survived in the wild since 2011, national geographic reports, and they appear to be in good health. Lead study author andrew fields says he stumbled on the \" virgin seven, \" which have genes from just one parent, while combing through a database of 190 tagged smalltooth sawfish. So how does \" virgin birth \" work? first an egg divides, breaking off a sister cell known as a polar body, which has the same set of chromosomes, the guardian reports; then the sister cell reconnects with the egg, fertilizing it like sperm. An expert says this amounts to inbreeding, which can help purge bad mutations but also robs populations of genetic diversity. Now it remains to be seen whether the seven, all female, can reproduce, scientists say — and whether parthenogenesis is more common in the wild than anyone knew. ( meanwhile, scientists have found a clue as to why males exist. )",

But until now so-called \"virgin births \" were assumed to be incredibly rare and had never been observed in vertebrates in the wild.

A police report obtained by mashable says a patrolling officer found zimmerman keeping watch over pompano pat's — which also sells motorcycles and ammo — in the middle of the night on sunday and that zimmerman told the official \"he was watching the business due to a recent burglary \" at the request of the store owner. But zimmerman doesn't appear to actually be on the shop's payroll. Owner pat johnson tells wkmg orlando that, although they do know each other, zimmerman doesn't technically work for him and has been keeping burglars at bay on his own since several thousand dollars ' worth of rifles and two minibikes were stolen earlier this month; a store employee and the deland pd back up this claim to mashable. In other words, it's apparently a volunteer position — much like zimmerman's neighborhood-watch gig the night he was accused of killing trayvon martin. Pompano pat's, incidentally, is the same deland shop that offered zimmerman a free firearm after his acquittal last summer in martin's death, according to wkmg.

But the guest coming up on her june 18 show may be generating even more attention: conspiracy theorist alex jones of infowars. Given that jones has suggested, among other things, that the sandy hook massacre was a hoax and that 9/11 was an \" inside job, \" the choice is generating a ton of criticism already. Coverage: teaser: nbc has released a teaser of the interview, in which kelly challenges jones on sandy hook in particular and accuses him of a \" dodge \" in his response. See it here. Typical sentiment: a post at av club voices a common sentiment among those criticizing the choice. \" she may be calling him out for his claims that the sandy hook shooting was a hoax, but she's still giving him an opportunity to defend that repugnant argument, \" writes sam barsanti. Kelly's defense: she notes that president trump has praised jones and wants to give him white house press credentials. \" many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light, \" she tweets. Mother's response: \"by making this choice, you grieve our hearts and the memory of our child, \" tweets nelba marquez-greene, whose daughter, ana grace, was killed in the school shooting. \"you have a powerful platform. I encourage you to 'shine light ' on affirming the losses suffered here- not on a person who mocks those losses …. Evil doesn't need another platform. \" much more: huffpost rounds up the many critical tweets surfacing about the interview. One in particular catching attention: \" my nephew survived sandy hook. I am not tolerating this. Will never watch @megynkelly or @nbcnews again if they choose to air this. \" jones'reaction: on friday, jones posted a video in which he goes after kelly personally in the wake of their interview, notes mediaite. \" not feminine.

Not only was the mission successful — nearly 190 people have been charged in the sting as of july, per the doj — but the fbi-operated playpen got rave reviews from unaware users, noted motherboard last month.the public defender for steven chase — the man found guilty by a federal court last friday of running the site, per a doj release — argued the site improvements helped lure more people to sign up for playpen, and that should have led to a dismissal of his client's indictment, according to a court filing. Just as the fbi started working on the site, playpen did seem to be rife with complaints. \" i've been having trouble getting in here all day, \" reads one archived message. That tune changed days later, with users noticeably perking up at the site's apparent fixes. \" working fast today, \" one user gushed, with others enthusiastically agreeing. Chase's defender, peter adolf, says that during the fbi's two weeks at the helm, membership rose by more than 30 % and the site's users jumped from a weekly average to 11,000 to 50,000, with hundreds more videos and thousands of images and child porn links posted to the site during the two-week period. In his motion, adolf said the fbi's alleged site improvements spurred mass child-porn distribution \" so outrageous as to shock the conscience of the court. \" motherboard notes, though, that adolf didn't really offer evidence the fbi's tweaks led to the member surge.
