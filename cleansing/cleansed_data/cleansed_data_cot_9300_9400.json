        "summary": "Eleven german submarines from world war i have been found sunk in belgian waters. The latest to be discovered, however, is the \" best preserved \" of all, officials say. The u-boat, 88 feet long by 20 feet wide, has been found in an undisclosed location off the belgian coast near west flanders, some 100 feet beneath the surface of the north sea, report deutsche welle and yahoo news. Believed to have been sunk by a naval mine, the sub is covered in barnacles and seaweed and shows damage to its top and bow, but its conning tower and periscopes remain intact and its hatches shut, reports the bbc. It's \" in such good condition that we reckon all the bodies are still on board, \" says west flanders governor carl decaluwe. The ub-ii submarine would normally have held 22 crew members and a commander, says decaluwe. \" it's quite amazing that we found something like this, \" he adds. \" of the 11 downed u-boats in belgian waters, this one is the best preserved example, \" notes the province of west flanders, per reuters. Though 70 of 93 german u-boats stationed in belgium were lost at sea during the war, deutsche welle notes the sunken sub could be one of 18 german subs stationed in bruges from 1915 to 1918 with the goal of disrupting british trade routes. It's not yet clear if officials plan to search the sub for bodies, but a belgian minister has suggested the wreck could become a heritage site.

Protesters thronged both sides of interstate 80 as well as train tracks in the city, forcing an amtrak train to halt, the ap reports. The protests had started as a peaceful march earlier in the day; the group chanted, \" who do you protect? peaceful protest! \" at the berkeley police department as officers in riot gear kept them from getting near. Then protesters sat outside a bay area rapid transit train station, causing it to be shut down for a few hours, before the group splintered into smaller factions, some of which became disruptive. The california highway patrol says fencing was torn down by some protesters, allowing people to pour onto i-80. Around 11: 30pm, officers started arresting what the san francisco chronicle calls \" scores of protesters \" as they rounded people up and prevented them from getting back on the freeway. The sunday night protests had also gotten violent, with broken glass, fires, vandalism, and looting in the downtown area. As the ap notes, protests in other parts of the country have gone quiet, but activists are still demonstrating in berkeley and oakland, both of which have a long history of protest. \" the people in the bay area are sensitive to worldwide issues, \" says the berkeley mayor. \" unfortunately, there is a small element that uses violence at times to make their point. \" nba stars have also joined the protests.",

State department of transportation officials said monday that the snow slide about 12 miles outside valdez on the richardson highway cannot be cleared until water behind the snow drains. The water in keystone canyon is too deep on the upstream side for crews to approach the snow dam. Officials fear that digging from the downstream side could trigger a dangerous surge of water and harm work crews. \" at this time there is no safe way to approach relieving that water, \" said jason sakalaskas, northern region maintenance engineer, at a news teleconference. The avalanche was in a location prone to avalanches and known locally as snow slide path, said mike coffey, the dot's statewide maintenance engineer. \" this is of a magnitude we probably have never seen before, \" coffey said. The lowe river is a whitewater stream with class 4 and 5 rapids. Rafting companies use it in summer for trips, but usually in winter it's just a trickle, valdez dot superintendent robert dunning said. The rain and melting snowpack have filled the river to about one-third its summer capacity, he said. Coffey estimated snow is piled 100 feet high on the lowe river and up to 50 feet high on the highway. A second avalanche is blocking the highway at mile 39. Up to 10 more avalanches are blocking parts of the highway that stretches north 360 miles to fairbanks. The avalanches have not affected the trans-alaska pipeline, which is buried in the area."

Officials fear that digging from the downstream side could trigger a dangerous surge of water and harm work crews. \" at this time there is no safe way to approach relieving that water, \" said jason sakalaskas, northern region maintenance engineer, at a news teleconference. The avalanche was in a location prone to avalanches and known locally as snow slide path, said mike coffey, the dot's statewide maintenance engineer. \" this is of a magnitude we probably have never seen before, \" coffey said. The lowe river is a whitewater stream with class 4 and 5 rapids. Rafting companies use it in summer for trips, but usually in winter it's just a trickle, valdez dot superintendent robert dunning said. The rain and melting snowpack have filled the river to about one-third its summer capacity, he said. Coffey estimated snow is piled 100 feet high on the lowe river and up to 50 feet high on the highway. A second avalanche is blocking the highway at mile 39. Up to 10 more avalanches are blocking parts of the highway that stretches north 360 miles to fairbanks. The avalanches have not affected the trans-alaska pipeline, which is buried in the area."

        "summary": "Back in the 1890s, somebody spent a lot of time in the london library reading about werewolves and the supernatural. This person also committed a cardinal sin of library goers — he defaced the books with his own notes in the margins and folded down the corners of pages. But as the londonist reports, the library is willing to forgive and forget in this case because they say the offender turns out to be none other than bram stoker, author of dracula. In a nifty bit of sleuthing, the library says it has found 26 volumes in its collection used by stoker for his vampire research — meaning the actual books he used, not just the titles. For example, in one of the books, an account of the principalities of wallachia and moldavia, stoker folded the corner of page 17 and wrote \" dracula \" in the margin. He apparently used the travel book to help describe his character's castle. \" we can establish beyond reasonable doubt that numerous books still on our shelves are the very copies that he was using to help write and research his masterpiece, \" says a library official, per the bookseller. To figure all this out, a professor at exeter university went through stoker's previously published notes and outlines for the book. Then he cross-referenced those notes with old volumes still in the library — the irish stoker lived in london and had been member at the time — and discovered the defaced books. One of them is the book of werewolves, and the scribbles in the margin notes closely gibe with details eventually used by stoker in his own iconic book. \" i am in no doubt that bram stoker used these very copies for dracula, \" says professor nick groom.

Alena, not content to let the highest post in the nation escape her grasp, has now launched a campaign to change the constitution so she can one day vie for the white house. \" we should all have the opportunity to run for president, \" she said in front of a state house committee on wednesday. \" i am an american as much as you are and everyone else. … i don't really remember china that much. All i know is america. \" as it stands now, only natural-born us citizens can run for president. Alena's resolution is asking congress to tweak the 14th amendment so that children born abroad but adopted by americans could fall under the \" natural-born citizens \" umbrella, as long as at least one parent is a us citizen, the child is younger than 16 when adopted, and a few other conditions are met, the patriot ledger. Alena certainly has the drive, and the interest, for the job: the paper notes she has already made her intentions clear to president obama, has been boning up on presidential facts, and even built a white house out of legos after visiting dc in 2011. And if you're already wondering whether alena is a republican or democrat, the answer is … neither: she tells the patriot ledger she'd run as an independent. ( one day, alena just may make this eclectic list. )",

        "summary": "Star wars: the force awakens is continuing to cut through box-office records like a light saber through butter and is now north america's highest-grossing movie ever. Disney says that on wednesday afternoon, just 20 days after its release, the movie passed the $ 760.5 million record set by avatar, which overtook titanic's record in 2010, the wall street journal reports. The next record to beat will be avatar's $ 2.78 billion global gross, the journal notes. The force awakens currently has a global gross of around $ 1.6 billion — and it hasn't opened in china yet. The force awakens has taken in more dollars than any film in american history, but the story is different when inflation is taken into account, nbc news reports. Adjusting for inflation, gone with the wind — released in 1939, when movie tickets cost less than a quarter — is still the highest-grossing movie, with a total take of $ 1.7 billion. The first star wars movie is in second place on the inflation-adjusted chart with a lifetime gross of $ 1.5 billion. The force awakens hasn't cracked the top 20 in that chart yet, though it's rapidly closing in on raiders of the lost ark, which is no. 20, the journal notes. ( the movie has also been playing in space. )",

        "summary": "Kim kardashian and kanye west got married saturday in an italian fortress — and if you were too busy enjoying a three-day weekend to pay much attention, here are the details you missed: e! estimates that the extravagant event cost at least $ 2.8 million — including the fees to have andrea bocelli ( at the ceremony ) and lana del rey ( at the rehearsal dinner ) perform, food and beverages for 200 guests at the reception plus other meals ( the reception was catered by a three-michelin-star restaurateur ), the $ 400,000 forte di belvedere rental fee, private jets to get guests to and from paris and florence, lodging, and the expensive jewelry kim and her family wore. Us has a rundown of the wedding and pre-wedding festivities: kim and baby north met up with kanye in paris on may 18, and they spent the week shopping and going out with kim's family members, who were also in town early. Kim went out on the town in a party van for her bachelorette party on thursday, the couple threw a pre-wedding brunch and rehearsal dinner ( complete with fireworks ) friday, and guests jetted to florence saturday for the big event. Guests left for home sunday, as kim and kanye departed for a secret honeymoon somewhere in europe ( reports are claiming ireland ). Baby north went home with grandma kris. But not all the guests actually attended the ceremony and reception: rob kardashian actually flew home saturday morning, and tmz says it's because he's embarrassed about his recent weight gain and didn't want to appear in photographs, and his family was insisting. As for jay z and beyonce, they ended up spending the weekend in the hamptons instead of attending the wedding. Friday's rehearsal dinner at the palace of versailles sounds almost as fancy as the wedding itself — e! reports that guests were brought there by horses and driven around on horse and carriage rides by guides in 18th-century costumes, all as a full orchestra played. Kim wore a long-sleeved, lacy givenchy haute couture gown with a floor-length veil, designed for her by close friend riccardo tisci, at the ceremony, people reports ( and north wore a matching dress ). She changed into an embellished balmain ivory dress for the reception, and kanye announced it to the guests: \" kim just changed dresses. I just had to stop things for my girl, kim. Changed dresses... Uh oh! \" kim and kanye's first dance? us reports it was a mashup of etta james ' \" at last \" and otis redding's \" these arms of mine \" and \" tenderness.",

The local reports rocio cortes nuñez delivered a child by c-section on sunday at seville's valme hospital and was being wheeled from surgery to a recovery room when she became caught in an elevator. Per local media, staff wheeled cortes onto the elevator, but while the doors opened and shut, the elevator didn't move. They reportedly decided to try another elevator, and as they were moving her out and with the doors open, it started going up. Precise details are unclear, but part of her body was outside the elevator and part was in, and the bbc picks up reports that suggest she was decapitated. Cortes, whose age is variously given as 25 and 26, was also a mother to 4- and 5-year-old daughters. The local reports her newborn was not in the elevator with her during the accident, which a regional health minister describes as \" quick, unusual, and tragic. \" her family is demanding someone be punished over the death; the elevator was reportedly serviced fewer than 10 days ago.

The cakes were invented on april 6, 1930, by a chicago bakery manager named james dewar, who was looking for something cheap to sell to his depression-hit customers and realized he wasn't doing anything with his shortcake pans. Today, hostess sells 500 million of the things a year. Some more fun twinkie facts, courtesy of the orange county register: they were originally filled with banana cream, until bananas were rationed during world war ii. They were named after a billboard dewar saw for twinkle toe shoes. Bill clinton put some in a time capsule in 1999. Note to bill: they only seem indestructible; they actually have a 25-day shelf life. So celebrate, twinkie! \"let other foods claim to be heart of america, \" quips the chicago tribune. \"you are its hips, its thighs, its muffin-top midriff. \"",

You know what i tell them, go to hell. I ' m going to tell my story. I ' m going the tell my story, george, \" the former dnc chair told george stephanopoulos on abc's this week sunday morning. Meanwhile, staffers from clinton's campaign had their own strong words for brazile; more than 100 of them — including campaign chairman john podesta, vice chair huma abedin, and manager robby mook — signed an open letter to brazile that was published saturday night, politico reports. \" we do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book, \" the letter says. The letter takes particular issue with brazile's claim that after clinton's bout with pneumonia in september, brazile considered replacing her and running mate tim kaine with a joe biden-cory booker ticket. Clinton fainted during a sept. 11 commemoration ceremony in new york, an incident now-president donald trump used against her in his own campaign. \" it is particularly troubling and puzzling that [ brazile ] would seemingly buy into false russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the russians and our opponent, about our candidate's health, \" the letter reads. In response to that portion of the letter, brazile said on abc, \" i wasn't a staff person. I did not work for the hillary clinton campaign. I was not on their daily strategy calls. I had nothing to do with their data analytics. I was the chair of democratic national committee. I was concerned about the entire party, not just the presidential, but the senatorial, congressional, and all of the other candidates. \" also sunday, brazile's successor tom perez said brazile never truly had the authority to replace clinton and that any suggestion the candidate was \" incapacitated \" is \" ludicrous, \" the ap reports.",

Phoenix attorney jimmy cool says he decided to start a fundraiser when the restaurant was inundated with bad yelp reviews over its refusal to serve sarah sanders, the arizona republic reports. \" i worried these attacks would cause irreparable harm to the business simply for exercising its owner's first amendment rights, \" says cool, whose friend, fellow arizonan attorney sean carter, helped spread the word about the gofundme fundraiser to reward the owner's \" courage in the face of immoral tyranny. \" the men closed the fundraiser down after it raised $ 900 more than its $ 5,000 target. In a facebook post, carter thanked supporters and provided a link to other red hen fundraisers, one of which has raised $ 8,000. He says they haven't been able to contact red hen owner stephanie wilkinson to arrange a transfer of funds yet. Cool says he has \" received multiple threats of violence and an unrelenting stream of harassment on social media \" since starting the fundraiser — and he isn't surprised. Other restaurants with the name red hen have also been targets for abuse online, including the olde red hen in collingwood, ontario, which is 650 miles and one international border away from the virginia eatery, the cbc reports.

        "summary": "Pennsylvania's no. 1 legal official is in the unique position of being unable to practice law. The state's supreme court suspended the law license of attorney general kathleen kane yesterday as she faces a criminal investigation involving charges of perjury and obstruction, reports the pittsburgh post-gazette. The state's constitution requires that its attorney general be a lawyer, notes the ap, but the court's ruling specified that it was not declaring that kane should be removed from office. \"what she cannot do is in any way act as an attorney, \" says a spokesman for the 49-year-old first-term democrat. In other words, she's an attorney general without the \" attorney \" part. A duquesne law professor is skeptical: \"the truth is you cannot effectively function as attorney general unless you can appear in court, \" he tells the post-gazette. The big accusation against kane is that she leaked information to the media about the grand jury proceedings of a case involving two former state prosecutors with whom she'd been feuding. Then she allegedly lied about the leak. Kane says the charges are a joke, orchestrated by people who want to keep a lid on a different scandal, a cache of pornographic emails received by state officials that she discovered while investigating the handling of the jerry sandusky case at penn state. It's a mess, and a philadelphia inquirer columnist writes that kane's camp is threatening to release yet more scandalous emails involving high-ranking state officials — \" a strategy of mutually assured destruction. \" meanwhile, fellow democrats are joining republicans in calling on kane to resign.",

Once she knew they were safe but ignoring her calls, she got an idea, gainer reported. \"we need to develop an app that just shuts their phone completely down and they can't even use it, \" standifird said. \"and i started — literally just started researching how to develop an app. \" so after months of design and working with developers, \"ignore no more \" was born. With one tap, a list of only parent-selected contacts come up. The child can call, get the",
            "Ignore no more is a simple app. It was developed out of a simple need parents have: to know if their child is safe. Unfortunately, teenagers aren't very cooperative and this prompted one mom to step up and show her children that she won't be ignored. Sharon standifird is just like any other parent. She just wants to know that her children are ok so she checks up on them. But her children won't answer her calls. It was her frustration that pushed her to turn to apps for a solution, not just using one but creating one in the process. Thanks ( or no thanks ) to her children, ignore no more was born. \" ignore no more! is an easy to install app that gives parents control back over their children's phones. If children ignore repeated calls and text messages to reach",

So how hard could it be to get her kids to show a little respect? her teens, you see, tended to do what teens do. So when she called them on their cell phones, their natural instinct was to press \" ignore. \" what's a mom to do? get mad? or get spectacularly, ingeniously even? she chose the latter. She began to consider what sort of app might get her teens to see the light. The result was ignore no more. This charming addition to her kids ' phones does something very simple: if the kids don't pick up mom's calls, the app locks their phones. Her website explains the app in a charming way: \" when you lock your child's phone with ignore"

Britain's parliament relaxed its dress code last week so that male parliamentarians are no longer required to wear neckties in the house of commons, provided they are in \" business-like attire, \" reports the evening standard. The change was reportedly inspired by an mp who has cerebral palsy and can't wear a tie, but not all mps are fans of dressing down. Conservative transport minister john hayes, for instance, announced tuesday that he would refuse questions from a male mp unless he wore a tie. The telegraph reports three mps went tie-free tuesday. Hayes was ready to intercede, though. \" i do have a tie here which i ' m prepared to offer \" to \" anyone that is sartorially challenged or inadequate, \" he announced. Poking fun at hayes, labour mp jess phillips later tweeted she \" won't take interventions from people not wearing a feather boa. \" but other mps side with hayes, believing that eliminating neckties \" reduces the esteem of parliament, \" per the telegraph. They ' ll have to get used to open collars, though. While mps are still \" attended to by men in tights and garters, \" the new dress code is \" in keeping with the long, slow decline of this particular item of men's clothing in the west, \" reports the bbc, adding the necktie has gone from a symbol of authority to one of outdated tradition.",

In a pre-recorded video, the fugitive leaker asked the president about russia's own surveillance policies. \" does russia intercept, store, or analyze, in any way, the communications of millions of individuals? \" he demanded. \" and do you believe that simply increasing the effectiveness of intelligence or law enforcement investigations can justify placing societies, rather than subjects, under surveillance? \" putin laughed. \" you are an ex-agent. I used to have ties to intelligence. So we will speak to each other in the language of professionals, \" the former kgb spy quipped, according to reuters. But he assured snowden that russian police needed a warrant to spy on suspected criminals. \" on a massive scale, on an uncontrolled scale, we certainly do not allow this. \" the segment has, of course, generated some reactions: putin's answer is essentially bullcrap, a russian surveillance expert tells the washington post. Russia has its own equivalent of the prism system snowden exposed, and it has expanded multiple times under putin. And while fsb agents technically need warrants, they never have to show them to anyone, because the telecom companies don't have the security clearance to see them. Snowden's critics jumped to paint the call as a setup. \" snowden celebrates pulitzer by turning into putin's propaganda tool, \" a former nsa general counsel said in a tweet spotted by the post. \" that's not an accident, \" john king argued on cnn, speculating that putin was \" mocking \" the us by allowing the call to happen.

The aug. 2 accident occurred when the tesla hit a car parked partially in the highway, per reuters. Luo zhen said he took his hands off the wheel for \" about 10 seconds, \" according to the journal. Both cars were damaged but there were no injuries. Since then, several references to the chinese terms for \"autopilot \" and \"self-driving \" were deleted from the webpage for the tesla model s sedan, and \"self-assisted driving \" added instead, per reuters. A tesla spokesman called the timing of the language change coincidental. \" we've been in the process of addressing any discrepancies across languages for many weeks, \" she told reuters.

In may, a tesla driver was killed in florida after his model s sedan slammed into a tractor-trailer. Neither the driver nor the car's autopilot sensors noticed a tractor-trailer in its path.

        "summary": "If you missed getting your flu shot, it's not the end of the world. In fact, random treatment times may actually help manage a disease outbreak in the long run. New research suggests that when treatments are given twice a year, six months apart, a disease has time to regain strength. But when random doses fall closer together, the disease can be hit in a weak state, scientific american reports. Not only that, changing things up also increases the likelihood of a random extinction event — a very rare case when an outbreak dies out suddenly due to unpredictable factors. Researchers came to the conclusion using a computer simulation to deliver treatment of infectious diseases among 8,000 people two different ways: in regular intervals, and randomly. When treatment was given two to eight times a year, a disease died out far quicker using the random program. And it's news that may have huge implications for how treatments are given in developing countries where resources are low, scientific american suggests. Rather than treat a few people regularly, irregular doses to a larger group may work best.",

As a result, vaccinations tend to trickle in over many months. Rather than resisting this tendency, some mathematicians now think that public health officials may one day embrace it. A bit of randomness in treatment schedules may actually help manage a disease outbreak. This conclusion comes from an analysis of treatment options in infectious disease outbreaks through the lens of complexity theory, which attempts to make sense of systems that are fundamentally unpredictable. Researchers using complexity theory to study disease outbreaks have identified rare instances when the outbreak will die out suddenly. Say, for instance, health workers administer antibiotics to fight an outbreak of bacterial meningitis, causing infections to decline. A classic disease model would suggest that every infected person must be isolated and treated before the disease can die out.

            "Mathematicians have found that by varying the timing of treatments, doctors may be able to increase the odds that a disease outbreak will die off suddenly herding cats is a cakewalk compared with getting people to take flu vaccine shots in the last weeks of summer — work, school, limited pharmacy hours, beach days and countless other factors conspire to interfere. As a result, vaccinations tend to trickle in over many months. Rather than resisting this tendency, some mathematicians now think that public health officials may one day embrace it. A bit of randomness in treatment schedules may actually help manage a disease outbreak. This conclusion comes from an analysis of treatment options in infectious disease outbreaks through the lens of complexity theory, which attempts to make sense of systems that are fundamentally unpredictable. Researchers using complexity theory to study disease outbreaks have identified rare instances when the outbreak will die out suddenly. Say, for instance, health workers administer antibiotics to fight an outbreak of bacterial meningitis, causing infections to decline. A classic disease model would suggest that every infected person must be isolated and treated before the disease can die out. But complexity theory shows that occasionally, the disease will die out due to random and unpredictable factors. Such a \"random extinction event \" is impossible to predict, but new research shows that judicious timing of treatments can",

Us district court judge mark w. Bennett is one of thousands asking president obama to pardon kavitz, whose \" major mistake was being involved with her boyfriend, who she assisted in the methamphetamine operation, out of a misguided sense of loyalty and love, \" he says. In a post at candoclemency, kavitz writes that her judgment was \" horribly skewed \" by the trauma of her husband's recent suicide and her \" desperation to provide for my sons \" when she started dating a new man. He sold meth out of the couple's home, and when police arrived, they cast kavitz as his accomplice, reports the washington post. She's been in jail about 15 years now. Her boyfriend got 20 years, while kavitz got 24, and son collin says it's because the boyfriend falsely blamed her. It \" was a gross miscarriage of justice \" and \" i was embarrassed and ashamed to be … imposing such an unfair sentence, \" judge bennett writes in a letter to the justice department. He says he had no choice because of sentencing guidelines. While kavitz says she was led \" to choices that i will always regret, \" collin — who lives more than 1,000 miles from the florida prison where his mother resides and hasn't seen her in more than 10 years because the trip is too expensive — notes she was \" a first time nonviolent drug offender. \" now \" she's got children who are grown and grandchildren she's never met, \" a friend adds, per truthout.

        "summary": "Following up its latest captain america flick can't have been easy, but marvel studios has apparently aced the task. With a 90 % approval rating from both critics and audiences on rotten tomatoes, doctor strange is a superhero movie almost universally adored. Here's what critics are saying: sara stewart had \" a heck of a lot more fun than [ she's ] had at a marvel movie lately, \" she writes at the new york post. \" with a mischievous, metaphysical flourish, doctor strange administers some much-needed cpr to the flagging superhero genre \" and is one of only a few movies that truly delivers on its promise of a 3d spectacle. Benedict cumberbatch \" makes a funny, dashing addition to the marvel pantheon, \" and tilda swinton is also \" excellent. \" the film opens with a \" spectacular, slow-motion car accident, \" but \" it's nothing compared to the ocular extravaganza that follows, \" writes michael o'sullivan at the washington post. Viewers are in for \" a fun and trippy excursion to a place where marvel rarely seems to go: that is, to the retinal roots of the comics, \" he writes. Beware of motion sickness, though: the special effects are \" quite literally, out of this world. \" \" doctor strange creates its own world. And it's a badass beauty, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone, though he saves most of his praise for cumberbatch. \" what robert downey jr. Is to iron man... That's what benedict cumberbatch is to doctor strange. By that i mean, he's everything. \" see the flick in 3d imax, he adds. \" you're in for the hallucinatory headtrip of the year. \" in some ways, doctor strange is generic marvel, yet refreshingly, the special effects \" serve beauty and meaning rather than the grimly tedious destruction, \" manohla dargis writes at the new york times. In fact, the film is \" so visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand, \" she writes. Plus \" the space-and-time warping and mirrored realities … are a blast. \"",

The researchers took mris of the study subjects, all healthy adults who were overweight or obese, measuring their reactions to images of unhealthy, high-calorie foods like fruit cereal and french fries, as well as healthier, low-calorie foods like baked salmon and an egg-white omelette. Then, for six months, the participants followed the instinct diet, created by one of the study's authors, susan roberts. ( she also wrote the book the instinct diet and is co-founder of the idiet program. ) the study subjects were responsible for preparing their own food but followed the guideline's menus and recipes, which combine carbohydrates low on the glycemic index with more fiber and protein. Those foods lead to slower digestion and more stable levels of blood glucose — it's the spikes and crashes that drive you to crave and eat unhealthy foods. After six months, the scientists showed the subjects the same images. By then, the subjects had developed more of a preference for the healthy foods than they had",
            "Which is more appealing: cheese pizza or salad? for many, the lure of lettuce hardly matches that of greasy comfort food, but new brain research from tufts university published in the journal nutrition &amp; diabetes suggests that reconditioning can train adults to prefer healthy food and shun the junk. \"we don't start out in life loving french fries and hating, for example, whole wheat pasta, \" said study co-author and tufts university professor susan b. Roberts in a press release. \"this conditioning happens over time in response to eating – repeatedly! – what is out there in the toxic food environment. \" the researchers studied the brain scans of 13 people, then assigned eight of them to a new behavioral intervention geared toward weight loss. The program taught lessons on portion control and distributed menu plans geared around specific dietary targets, encouraging people to get 25 % of their energy from protein and fat and 50 % from low-glycemic carbohydrates, with more than 40 g of fiber per day. After six months either on or off the program, a second round of scans showed the part of the brain associated with addiction and learning had changed in people who participated in the program and stayed the same in the control group. That brain region appeared more active and sensitive to healthier foods and less sensitive to caloric foods among people in"

Malaysia's new transport minister, anthony loke, recently said he wants to give up the search for the plane and seek \" closure, \" though new deputy prime minister anwar ibrahim has said further searches are a possibility if new findings arise from a fresh look at malaysian information on the boeing 777, which vanished on march 8, 2014, with 239 people on board, the guardian reports. Families of the missing passengers and crew members say they feel betrayed by the apparent end of the search — especially since ocean infinity was searching for the aircraft on a \" no-find, no-fee \" basis and had offered to continue the search next year as long as malaysia promised to pay up to $ 70 million if it found the aircraft. Ocean infinity chief executive oliver plunkett says the company has searched more than 43,000 square miles of ocean floor and he hopes they are able to continue someday, the ap reports. \" whilst clearly the outcome so far is extremely disappointing, as a company, we are truly proud of what we have achieved both in terms of the quality of data we've produced and the speed with which we covered such a vast area, \" he says.

The lawsuit claims richard roberts was a civil rights lawyer in 1981 when he \" intimidated, coerced, and manipulated \" 16-year-old terry mitchell into having sex almost daily for weeks, according to the washington post. At the time, roberts was a prosecutor in the trial of joseph paul franklin, a white supremacist serial killer who shot two black men while they were jogging with mitchell and another woman. Mitchell was a witness in the trial. The lawsuit claims roberts told mitchell — vulnerable from her friends'deaths and past sexual assaults — that franklin might not be convicted if she told anyone about their relationship, the ap reports. Roberts cites health concerns as his reason for stepping down as dc's chief us district judge — a position he was appointed to in 1998 by bill clinton — and his lawyers call mitchell's claims \" categorically false. \" they say roberts had a consensual relationship with mitchell only after the trial was over, which they call \" a bad lapse in judgment. \" the utah attorney general's office investigated mitchell's claims and decided not to pursue criminal charges against roberts as the state's age of consent was 16 in 1981. The lawsuit states mitchell repressed all memory of roberts allegedly raping her until an email from him in 2013, after franklin was executed. Roberts ' lawyers say roberts and mitchell have stayed on good terms in the decades since the trial, exchanging calls and emails that have \" always been warm, caring, and friendly, \" making her claims \" puzzling and disappointing. \"",

Things got worse after they arrived, with dina allegedly scratching lindsay on the leg and breaking one of her bracelets. Sources say the 911 call that resulted was a domestic violence one, and that someone on the phone said lindsay was being held by dina and the driver against her will. A police inspector tells the new york post that lindsay called dad michael, and he called the cops. At the scene, lindsay \" was yelling, ' i've had enough of this! ' \" a witness says. The post says the dispute was a verbal one, but michael says \" it was a hell of a lot more than \" just an argument. Sources say dina was \" wasted, \" and some say the whole fight involved how they were getting home — dina apparently didn't want to pay taxi fare — while others tell radar the fight involved $ 40,000 lindsay recently gave her mom and wanted back.

Farmers and environmental activists have been fighting against the destruction of the olive trees — some of which are more than a century old — and italian courts have been ruling in their favor, nature reports. According to phys.org, more than 1,500 trees have been destroyed to fight xylella fastidiosa, which is deadly for more than 200 plant species. Italian prosecutors haven't released any evidence against the accused scientists but claim the disease may have gotten loose during a scientific workshop or during experiments, nature reports. Scientists say it's more likely the disease came from plants imported from costa rica.

        "summary": "At some point this spring, it appears that californians will be asked to sign a petition legalizing the murder of gay people. And it will be perfectly legit. As the sacramento bee reports, a lawyer named matt mclaughlin has filed the proper paperwork, along with his $ 200 fee, to propose a state initiative called the sodomite suppression act. Both the bee and the san francisco chronicle report that attorney general kamala harris has little choice but to allow it to proceed to the signature-gathering phase. Harris hasn't commented on whether she will try to find a legal way out, but previous cases suggest she won't be able to do so on free-speech grounds. Assuming it does make it to the petition phase, the measure would almost certainly die a quick death by failing to get the 365,000 signatures needed to move forward. But in the meantime, it's causing a debate not only about free speech but about whether the state must find a way to weed out crazy, clearly illegal initiative proposals. Mclaughlin, meanwhile, is the subject of a petition himself — launched by critics to have him disbarred. \"it's an interesting discussion about free speech, and i get that, \" says its creator. \"but this is a lawyer, and he's advocating for murder. \" about a decade ago, mclaughlin submitted an unsuccessful initiative proposal to make the king james bible a textbook in public schools, notes the chronicle.

        "summary": "Certain dogs apparently feel like they're perpetually in the doghouse, according to a university of sydney study that says some dogs are pessimists, getting demoralized more easily than other dogs and just giving up on tasks when they've had enough. The research, published this week in the plos one journal, isn't saying that pessimistic dogs are necessarily sad: it's just that they're more risk-averse because they expect the worst after experiencing setbacks and are more likely than their more \" optimistic \" canine counterparts to just accept the way things are rather than try to change them. The 40 dogs in the study had to touch a target upon hearing two tones two octaves apart; one tone would reward them with milk, the other with water, the washington post reports. It's when the researchers sandwiched \" ambiguous \" tones in between the two main ones that some dogs ' moods started going south: certain dogs kept hitting the targets no matter what reward resulted, while \" pessimistic \" dogs stopped touching the target altogether after not receiving the coveted milk. The post notes that perhaps the dogs aren't pessimists at all, but realists — one university of colorado professor says he's curious if they're actually pessimistic or just got tired of waiting. But the results could have useful training applications: dogs that take risks could be used for tasks that require more persistence, such as searching for explosives, while wary pups could serve as more careful guide dogs.

            "New research from the university of sydney shows evidence that dogs can be distinctly optimistic or pessimistic. ( the university of sydney ) does your dog think the water dish is half empty? new research from the university of sydney shows evidence that dogs can be distinctly optimistic or pessimistic. Just like humans, optimistic canines have a distinctly sunnier outlook on life, while pessimistic pups are likely to expect the worst. The dogs were trained to touch a target after hearing one of two tones -- two octaves apart -- to receive a drink. One tone meant they'd receive milk, a reward, while the other just meant they'd get water. Once they'd learned what those tones meant, they were presented with new tones in-between the \" milk \" and \" water \" pitch. If a dog kept happily hitting the target through these ambiguous tones, the researchers claim, it's probably because it was hopeful that one of them would lead to a reward. On the other hand, the researchers report, the \" pessimistic \" dogs grew distressed when ambiguous tones didn't result in milk, and avoided repeating the task. This study is really meant as a proof-of-concept for a sort of doggy personality test -- one that could help determine the best service dogs for particular tasks",
            "Recent advances in animal welfare science used judgement bias, a type of cognitive bias, as a means to objectively measure an animal's affective state. It is postulated that animals showing heightened expectation of positive outcomes may be categorised optimistic, while those showing heightened expectations of negative outcomes may be considered pessimistic. This study pioneers the use of a portable, automated apparatus to train and test the judgement bias of dogs. Dogs were trained in a discrimination task in which they learned to touch a target after a tone associated with a lactose-free milk reward and abstain from touching the target after a tone associated with water. Their judgement bias was then probed by presenting tones between those learned in the discrimination task and measuring their latency to respond by touching the target. A cox's proportional hazards model was used to analyse censored response latency data. Dog and cue both had a highly significant effect on latency and risk of touching a target. This indicates that judgement bias both exists in dogs and differs between dogs. Test number also had a significant effect, indicating that dogs were less likely to touch the target over successive tests. Detailed examination of the response latencies revealed tipping points where average latency increased by 100 % or more, giving an indication of where dogs began to treat ambiguous cues as predicting more"

            "New research from the university of sydney shows evidence that dogs can be distinctly optimistic or pessimistic. ( the university of sydney ) does your dog think the water dish is half empty? new research from the university of sydney shows evidence that dogs can be distinctly optimistic or pessimistic. Just like humans, optimistic canines have a distinctly sunnier outlook on life, while pessimistic pups are likely to expect the worst. The dogs were trained to touch a target after hearing one of two tones -- two octaves apart -- to receive a drink. One tone meant they'd receive milk, a reward, while the other just meant they'd get water. Once they'd learned what those tones meant, they were presented with new tones in-between the \" milk \" and \" water \" pitch. If a dog kept happily hitting the target through these ambiguous tones, the researchers claim, it's probably because it was hopeful that one of them would lead to a reward. On the other hand, the researchers report, the \" pessimistic \" dogs grew distressed when ambiguous tones didn't result in milk, and avoided repeating the task. This study is really meant as a proof-of-concept for a sort of doggy personality test -- one that could help determine the best service dogs for particular tasks",

The new york times sees \" the most promising atmosphere for negotiations \" in a decade, thanks to rouhani's apparent willingness to work with the west; his election points to \" a more moderate course \" for iran, says a top us official. \" we're at a moment of huge magnitude, \" says a us diplomat, per the washington post. The key to the talks is the possibility of lifted sanctions — if iran is willing to significantly cut back its nuclear program. An eu official cites \" cautious optimism \": what does the west want? a bipartisan group of us senators has also proposed delaying further sanctions in exchange for a halt to enriched uranium production, but iran says it has a right to continue the process, calling it a \" red line \" in the post. Thus, the p5+1 group — the us, uk, france, china, russia, and germany — will likely call for far more thorough inspections, the times notes. What is iran expected to do? the country will likely propose some reduction in its uranium production, the times reports. But that doesn't solve the issue of plutonium production — a project which already involves thousands of centrifuges. Is a breakthrough on the horizon? not immediately, suggests the bbc; instead, iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif says he hopes \" we can reach agreement on a roadmap to find a path toward resolution. \" as for the us, it's willing to reduce sanctions in a manner \" proportional to what iran puts on the table, \" says a us official.

        "summary": "Miami beach isn't the only one running low on sand — a new study has found more than half of the sand on new york's fire island was washed away during hurricane sandy, livescience reports. Though 18 % of the barrier island's sand has been replenished, the beach's volume is still 40 % less than it was before the storm, the us geological survey has found. In addition to the damage caused by sandy, subsequent storms rearranged the island's beaches even more, ultimately resulting in its shoreline moving 189 feet inland, reports the wall street journal. Beaches recover reasonably quickly, the study's lead author tells livescience, but sand dunes take much longer to build up again — and they're the island's best defense against wild weather in the future. \" overall, hurricane sandy profoundly impacted the morphology of fire island and resulted in an extremely low elevation, low relief configuration that has left the barrier island vulnerable to future storms, \" the study concluded, and \" although the beach is likely to experience continued recovery in the form of volume gains, the dunes will take years to rebuild. \"",

Wanda barzee could face a life sentence on kidnapping charges, although her lawyer declined to comment on whether her guilty plea is coming as part of a deal. Barzee was ruled competent to stand trial last month after completing 15 months of treatment with anti-psychotic medications, ap reports. Smart told a hearing last month that barzee washed her feet ahead of a ceremony in which she was declared the polygamous wife of barzee's husband, street preacher brian david mitchell. A judge has ruled that mitchell can't be forcibly medicated to make him fit to stand trial. Smart's father says he is aware of the expected guilty plea, but can't reveal specifics. \" we are very much behind the us attorney in what they're doing, \" he told the salt lake tribune.",

That ruling came as part of a pet \" custody \" battle in a divorce case. Cbc news reports the wife wants the couple's two dogs, kenya and willow, to live with her. The husband ( described by the wife as a \" cat person \" ) disagrees. So the matter ended up in the courtroom of judge richard danyliuk, who in a ruling chides the couple for wasting \" scarce judicial resources \" and refuses to make any custody decision, reports the starphoenix of saskatoon. Deciding where kenya and willow should live would be like arbitrating butter knives, he writes. \" am i to make an order that... The other party have limited access to those knives for 1.5 hours per week to butter his or her toast? \" the judge goes on to detail several examples of why fido lacks \" familial rights, \" including these points: \" in canada, we tend not to purchase our children from breeders, \" and \" when our children act improperly … we generally do not muzzle them or even put them to death for repeated transgressions. \" the 15-page ruling notes the couple's detailed history of pet ownership, including the wife's claim the husband was \" improperly attentive \" to his two cats, slimey and oinky. Sighs danyliuk: \" for present purposes, that information is not particularly helpful. \" for now, the dogs are staying with the wife's parents. In a solomon-like move, danyliuk warns that if the couple fails to settle the matter, the dogs might end up being \" sold and the proceeds split. \" ( kicking a puppy cost this ceo $ 100,000. )",

        "summary": "As the story goes, in the small french village of rennes-le-château a priest named françois-bérenger saunière managed to accumulate an unlikely sum of money, giving birth to a legend that he had found buried treasure. It was said that he himself buried what he didn't spend somewhere on the grounds of the church of saint mary magdalene or its graveyard. The telegraph reports that since the priest's 1917 death, that line of thought has largely been dismissed as folly — but it hadn't stopped treasure-seekers from digging holes in the town, as occurred last week. The guardian reports a hole was found under a church wall, in violation of a 1960s ban on digging without permission. The telegraph reports that historians believe saunière obtained his riches through nefarious means, like stealing donations. He would have to have stolen a lot: per ancient origins, saunière's own ledger showed he had about 81 francs to his name ( and a debt of 105 francs ) in 1892; between then and his death, he reportedly recorded spending 660,000 francs, though he was paid just 900 francs annually. The guardian reports hysteria over the supposed treasure peaked in the 1970s, when people came to the town armed with wall-busting explosives. Then came dan brown's the da vinci code, which features a character named after the priest. In 2004 the town's mayor told the sun herald authorities went so far as to exhume saunière and reinter him \" under a 3 tonne sarcophagus surrounded by five cubic meters of concrete \" to safeguard his remains from treasure-seekers.

Activist shaun king says the black couple were handcuffed after they \" refused to pay for a $ 1.50 overcharge on an orange juice that was listed as $ 1 on the menu, \" eater reports. Body-cam footage released by police in fort walton, fla., shows the couple explaining that the restaurant charged them $ 2.50 for the orange juice. Officers, without talking to employees, told them they could be arrested for theft. \" we haven't been served at all. We haven't been served so how is it theft? we asked her to explain the bill to us; she gave us no food or nothing and called you guys, \" the woman says. King says waffle house employees called police after the man asked to talk to management, fox reports. In the video, the couple — who had not received their food and insisted they were going to pay — are handcuffed after arguing with officers. They were eventually released without being arrested after saying they would pay their bill and not return to the outlet. Police say they believe proper protocol was followed, though waffle house says it feels \" both sides could have handled this situation better. \" the company says employees at the restaurant will receive additional training — and the couple were given a full refund the next day. Vox reports that the incident has added to calls to boycott the chain for being too quick to call the police on black customers. ( the naacp called an april arrest \" troubling. \" )",

The child's body was undisturbed until this year, when archaeologists using ground-scanning tools were surprised to find it just inches below the surface at an entryway to the bath house, the local reports. The body of the child, believed to have been seven or eight years old, is the first to be found at pompeii in decades. Researchers believe he or she, like thousands of others who failed to flee the roman city near present-day naples, was suffocated by clouds of ash, which later hardened around the body, reports the telegraph. Massimo osanna, director of the pompeii archaeological park, says the \" extraordinary find \" was made in an area formerly thought to have been fully excavated in the 19th century. \" thanks to new high-tech instruments, the last child of pompeii has emerged from inside a previously unexcavated corner, \" osanna says. The skeleton will be examined to determine whether it was a boy or a girl and whether the child had any diseases, the archaeological park said in a statement, which has an image of the remains. The park notes that unlike many other buildings in pompeii, the roof of the part of the sprawling bath house complex where the body was found did not collapse, but volcanic material flowed through the windows in the final phase of the 79ad eruption.

Spacex previously delayed the satellite launch in mid-november in order to review tests of protective coverings for satellites on rockets, known as fairings, but a webcast of the launch noted the fairing deployed successfully. Though the rocket's first stage returned to earth without issue, the loss of the satellite comes at a poor time for spacex, which has 30 missions planned for this year ( 12 more than last year ) and is facing competition from boeing and lockheed martin's united launch alliance, reports the journal.",

The men, ages 22 to 49, were caught with 970 of the plants and earned the distinction of being the first to face felony charges under the law, reports the daily news of jacksonville, nc. It carries a penalty of up to 29 months in prison for each offense, along with fines. Had they been caught a month earlier, when it was a misdemeanor, they would have faced a $ 50 fine, notes the raleigh news &amp; observer. So why the big penalty? because the poaching of venus flytraps \" threatens the existence of this iconic but endangered carnivorous plant in the wild, \" writes john r. Platt at scientific american. The haul of 970 plants is especially big considering that only 35,000 of them are thought to be growing in the wild — mostly in a 75-mile radius around wilmington, nc. Plenty of venus flytraps exist in greenhouses, and they're relatively easy to cultivate there, \" but the wild plants can't survive many more big poaching events like this one, \" writes platt.

            "A wildlife officer with the n.c. Wildlife resources commission has made the first arrests as a felony offense for removal of venus flytraps from the wild. Prior to dec. 1, 2014, venus flytrap poaching had been a misdemeanor offense. Wildlife officer fred gorchess had been investigating reports of suspicious activity at holly shelter game land in pender county for several weeks. On jan. 3, with assistance from pender county sheriff's deputies, he apprehended four men with 970 venus flytraps in their possession. Venus flytrapsare rare, carnivorous plants that feed on insects and grow in swamps and bogs that can be found on wildlife commission game lands in pender, brunswick, onslow and new hanover counties. The north carolina chapter of the nature conservancy estimates only 35,000 plants remain in the wild, citing poaching as a major threat. State law n.c.g.s. §14-129.3elevated venus flytrap poaching from a misdemeanor to felony status",
            "— a state wildlife officer has made the first arrests under a new north carolina law that makes it a felony to poach venus flytraps from the wild. The officer, along with pender county sheriffs deputies, arrested four men in the holly shelter game land with 970 flytraps, according to the state wildlife resources commission. The arrests took place jan. 3, a little more than a month after the new penalty went into effect, and were announced this week. Venus flytraps live in bogs with nutrient-poor soil, getting their nutrition from the insects they trap between their leaves. Their only natural home is in southeastern north carolina and northeastern south carolina. Digging up flytraps in the wild for resale at flea markets or on the internet had been a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $ 50. Last year, the state legislature passed a bill making it a felony that"

        "summary": "Scientists trying to figure why tens of thousands of bats are killed by wind turbines each year think they've figured out a key piece of the puzzle: the bats think the turbines are trees, reports nature world news. Using thermal and infra-red surveillance cameras, researchers discovered that the bats deliberately flock to the turbines, perhaps confused by the wind currents generated by the devices and unable to tell the difference once they get near because of their lousy vision, says the study in the journal pnas. Notably, the bats tend to stay away if turbine blades are moving at full speed, which likely means that the air turbulence warns them to stay away. But if the blades are turning more slowly — and if the bats have just enough moonlight to make out a tall thing that looks like a tree — the results are lethal. \" they don't have anything in their evolutionary history that would prepare them for something that looks and feels like a tree but isn't a tree, \" lead author paul cryan of the us geological survey tells australia's abc science. So why would the bats be flying toward the tops of tall trees in the first place? researchers assume it's because the bats would expect to find insects or another food source there, but it's only a guess because so little is known about bat behavior, explains the usgs. The next step, then, is to observe bats around treetops in the wild to see what's going on. \" if we can understand why bats approach wind turbines, we may be able to turn them away, \" says cryan.

            "Bats are dying in unprecedented numbers at wind turbines, but causes of their susceptibility are unknown. Fatalities peak during low-wind conditions in late summer and autumn and primarily involve species that evolved to roost in trees. Common behaviors of \"tree bats \" might put them at risk, yet the difficulty of observing high-flying nocturnal animals has limited our understanding of their behaviors around tall structures. We used thermal surveillance cameras for, to our knowledge, the first time to observe behaviors of bats at experimentally manipulated wind turbines over several months. We discovered previously undescribed patterns in the ways bats approach and interact with turbines, suggesting behaviors that evolved at tall trees might be the reason why",
            "News in science bats may mistake wind turbines for trees mistaken identity some species of bats may mistake wind turbines for tall trees, and follow seemingly familiar air flow patterns to their doom. Us researchers used thermal and infra-red surveillance cameras to observe bat behaviour around three wind turbines over three months, and report their results in today's proceedings of the national academy of sciences..

Fatalities peak during low-wind conditions in late summer and autumn and primarily involve species that evolved to roost in trees.

        "summary": "When scientists from the university of illinois and canada's simon fraser university headed to northern canada last august to do some fieldwork along the slims river, they were met by a surprising sight. The yukon river was no longer flowing and instead resembled a \" long, skinny lake, \" researcher daniel shugar says, per phys.org. The reason, as they now explain in a study published in the nature geoscience journal: the waterway had become a victim of \" river piracy, \" in this case caused by the retreat of the kaskawulsh glacier, which in turn caused the meltwater to completely change its northward course toward the bering sea ( via the slims, then kluane lake and the yukon river ) and instead merge with the kaskawulsh river, which flows south to the gulf of alaska — and what the guardian calls the \" abrupt \" vanishing of the slims seems to have happened over just four days last spring. Those four days — may 26 to may 29 — showed a sudden drop in the slims ' flow, with shugar saying comparable river piracy hasn't, to his knowledge, been seen in our lifetimes. The glacier is said to have retreated nearly 2,300 feet in the 50-year period between 1956 and 2007, and in 2016, the rapid pace of the meltwater's movement created an ice channel that directed more water toward the kaskawulsh river, a tributary of the alsek river that dumps into the gulf. The glacier's decline is being blamed with 99.5 % probability on climate change, and scientists say the new development will affect local wildlife, fish populations, and water chemistry, among other things. \" i always point out to climate-change skeptics that earth's glaciers are becoming markedly smaller, and that can only happen in a warming climate, \" co-author john clague says, per phys.org.

        "summary": "A woman with depression might have her mother's brain circuitry at least partly to blame, suggests a new study out of the university of california san francisco. In the small but potentially groundbreaking study led by psychiatry professor fumiko hoeft, researchers discovered that the structure of the part of the brain with a hand in mood disorders is more likely to be passed down from mother to daughter than from mother to son or father to either sex. The study involving 35 healthy families focused on the corticolimbic system, which encompasses key parts of the brain that help regulate mood: the amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, and vertromedical prefrontal cortex. Using mri brain scans, researchers discovered \" positive associations of regional gray matter volume in the corticolimbic circuit... Between biological mothers and daughters. \" \" we're the first one to get the whole family and scan both parents and offspring to look at how similar their brain networks are, \" hoeft tells scientific american. But she cautions that the study, published in the journal of neuroscience, doesn't necessarily mean that moms are to blame if their daughters suffer from depression. All kinds of factors are at play, including social environment, and \" mother-daughter transmission is just one piece of it. \" but the study is the first to show this kind of connection and opens the door to further research about its role not only in depression but in everything from anxiety to dyslexia, she says. A psychologist who wasn't part of the study tells scientific american that she'd like to see whether the results are replicated when \" depressed mothers, \" rather than \" healthy families, \" are studied.

In a memo to cabinet members, white house budget chief mick mulvaney said that in almost all cases, \" the commercial air system used by millions of americans every day is appropriate, even for very senior officials, \" the hill reports. \" every penny we spend comes from the taxpayer, \" he added. \" we thus owe it to the taxpayer to work as hard managing that money wisely as the taxpayer must do to earn it in the first place. \" more: interior secretary ryan zinke rejected suggestions his own taxpayer-funded private flights, including one that took him home to montana after a dinner in nevada, were improper, los angeles times reports. \" every time i travel, i send the travel plan to the ethics department that reviews it line by line to make sure i am above the law and i follow the law, \" he said friday. Mulvaney's memo, however, said: \" just because something is legal doesn't make it right. \" other cabinet officials whose travel is now being scrutinized include epa administrator scott pruitt and treasury secretary steven mnuchin, the washington examiner reports. Mnuchin is being investigated for trips including a visit to kentucky during the eclipse, which he watched from fort knox. Trump lost faith in price long before his expensive travel became a scandal, politico reports. Insiders say trump associated price with the failure to repeal obamacare, feeling that he had promised to get lawmakers on board and then failed to deliver. The sources say that trump was angered by how price's travel made the administration look — and he wasn't pleased when price only offered to repay $ 52,000 for flights believed to have cost more than $ 1 million. Some of trump's core supporters saw price's travel as a sign that the president has failed to \" drain the swamp \" as promised, the new york times reports. \" it's hard to see how a cabinet secretary can drain the swamp from 42,000 feet in the plush interior of a taxpayer-funded gulfstream 4, \" said conservative radio host laura ingraham.

            "The tall ship began to die early monday morning in the hurricane-ravaged waters off the north carolina coast. One of the hms bounty's generators failed. Water flooded everywhere. The 180-foot-long, three-masted tall ship was losing power and propulsion. By about 3 a.m., the bounty's once-optimistic facebook page, which on sunday had posted \"so far so good! \" in its daily updates, had issued a new message for its followers: \"your prayers are needed. \" ninety minutes later, the bounty finally lost its battle with 40 mph winds and 18-foot seas. Its captain ordered all hands to abandon the sinking ship, a shocking demise for a celebrity vessel built for the 1962 film \"mutiny on the bounty. \" the ship, which had been trying to make its way around hurricane sandy, carried a crew of 16. When the rescue operation ended about 10 a.m. Monday, 14 of the crew members had been saved by coast guard helicopters. Two people, capt. Robin walbridge, 63, and claudene christian, 42, were missing. Christian's body was recovered monday night, but walbridge remained unaccounted for.

        "summary": "Italian scientists searching for evidence of water on mars — even signs that it was there billions of years ago — believe they've found a lake filled with the liquid just a mile beneath the red planet's southern polar ice cap. Though outside experts have yet to confirm the finding, the body is thought to be 12 miles wide and potentially saturated with salts like sodium, magnesium, and calcium that would lower the water's melting point and allow it to stay in liquid form despite the cold temperatures, popular mechanics reports via the study published in science. Per cnn, it's based on 29 observations of mars ' planum australe region during a 3.5-year radar survey, completed in 2015 by the european space agency's mars express spacecraft. A mile below the ice-covered surface, variations in radar signals revealed what appeared to be a lake similar to those found beneath earth's ice sheets. The ap notes the researchers weren't able to establish the depth of the lake, which it reports prevents them from specifying \" whether it's an underground pool, an aquifer-like body, or just a layer of sludge. \" still, the scientists say they \" interpret this feature as a stable body of liquid water on mars, \" and they're already imagining a connecting system of waterways. There's a major caveat, though: subsequent radar scans, including by the mars reconnaissance orbiter, have failed to find the same signs. They remained elusive \" even when we recently summed together [ thousands ] of observations to create catscan-like 3d views of both polar caps, \" a scientist tells cnn. That said, the research team claims it, too, had difficulty establishing the lake's presence until it fixed a data processing issue.",

        "summary": "The death of doors frontman jim morrison at the age of 27 back in 1971 still has all kinds of conspiracy theories and weirdness connected to it, thanks to the lack of an autopsy. Doctors cited heart failure, and now former girlfriend marianne faithfull tells british music site mojo that she knows exactly what happened: it was a heroin od caused by her boyfriend at the time, a dealer named jean de breteuil. Faithfull says breteuil went to visit morrison at his paris apartment, but she stayed behind: \" i could intuitively feel trouble, \" she recalls. \" i thought, i ' ll take a few tuinal and i won't be there. And he went to see jim morrison and killed him. I mean i ' m sure it was an accident.... The smack was too strong? yeah. And he died. \" of course, it's not the first time morrison's death has been linked to heroin or even to heroin supplied by breteuil, notes the washington post. But this seems to be the most definitive account offered by faithfull. As she herself notes, \" everybody connected to the death of this poor guy is dead now. Except me. \" ( a nightclub manager says morrison od'd in his bar, then got moved back to his apartment, but faithfull isn't backing that up. )",

The question is whether or not that's a bad thing, and critics seem to fall pretty distinctly into the \" love it \" or \" hate it \" camps ( and pretty evenly too — the film's at 48 % on rotten tomatoes as of this writing ). Here's what they're saying: hated it: \" oh my god, it made me sick, \" says richard roeper, decrying the movie as \" jingoistic, \" \" explosion-riddled \" and \" pandering \" in an \" f \" review. \" just a few months after the release of olympus has fallen we get the same movie only much, much worse. \" the cast, he admits, is talented, \" and with a bloated running time of 137 minutes, there's room for everyone to embarrass themselves. \" loved it: \" there's a lot of expertise behind this film, \" observes mick lasalle at the san francisco chronicle, so much so that it \" makes the whole enterprise of creating big, silly movies seem like a truly dignified calling. \" foxx \" steals the show \" as president obama — er, we mean sawyer — in a performance that doubles as \" a barely disguised message \" to the real obama to \" unleash the hero within. \" hated it: \" i've got nothing against a dumb action movie, \" writes peter travers at rolling stone, but \" there's dumb and then there's idiotic. \" this is the latter. \" white house down, rated pg-13 but as crass and cynical as a michael bay movie, is a depressing experience. \" he was particularly annoyed by the way every bad guy in the movie took turns threatening a 10-year-old girl. \" there's a word for a film that stoops to child endangerment for cheap thrills: vile. \" loved it: \" the movie is something like an msnbc remake of die hard mixed with les misérables ( minus the singing ), \" observes andew o ' hehir at salon. \" this piece of midsummer madness is undeniably silly and delusional, \" yet it feels perfectly of our current moment, a \" gristly, undigested glob of american fear, american hope, and semi-justified american paranoia. \"",

Jennifer cramblett says the midwest sperm bank sent her and her partner, amanda zinkon, sperm from donor no. 330 when they had chosen no. 380, and she didn't discover the mistake until she was pregnant, reports the chicago tribune. The lawsuit says cramblett was raised around people with \" stereotypical attitudes about nonwhites \" and \" acknowledges her limited cultural competency relative to african-americans and steep learning curve, particularly in small, homogenous uniontown, \" a town of around 2,800 people. Cramblett — whose lawsuit says all she received from the sperm bank after the error was a letter of apology and a refund check for the vials of incorrect sperm — says she fears her daughter, now 2 years old, will never be fully accepted by her \" unconsciously insensitive \" family, who apparently find her homosexuality hard enough to deal with. She is suing for \" wrongful birth and breach of warranty \" and says therapists have advised her to move to a more diverse community. According to the lawsuit, the mix-up happened because the sperm bank keeps written records instead of electronic ones and the number 380 looked like 330 to the person who sent the vials out, reports chicago business.
