        "summary": "When secretary of state nominee rex tillerson testified before the foreign relations committee on wednesday, he faced the toughest scrutiny from marco rubio. The pair had a a number of testy exchanges, with rubio skeptical that the exxonmobil chief would be as tough as he needed to be on russia in particular. As quartz explains, this raises a potentially serious problem for donald trump's nominee: the committee has 11 republicans and 10 democrats, meaning if rubio votes against tillerson, that could prevent the committee from sending his name to the full senate for a final vote. ( the gop's lindsey graham also sounded a bit skeptical, notes cnn. ) \" i ' m prepared to do what's right, \" said rubio after the hearing, per real clear politics. \" i ' m not analyzing it from a partisan standpoint. \" all of which sets up three scenarios: the most likely seems to be that rubio will vote yes, content with having made his point about russia. The second is that he ' ll vote no and republicans will find a democrat on the panel to flip. The third scenario is perhaps the least likely, but also \" fascinating, \" writes blogger allahpundit at hot air: in this case, the committee votes against tillerson, but mitch mcconnell, under pressure from trump, sends his name to the full senate anyway. The senate then has a tough decision: \" do they defer to the committee by voting no on tillerson, knowing how angry trump will be? or do they make trump happy by voting to confirm, \" which sets a precedent for ignoring committee judgments and thus makes \" plum committee assignments \" less valuable than they used to be.",

            "Rubio -- who refused to say if he would vote for tillerson after a day of testimony -- pressed the former exxonmobil ceo hard wednesday on a slew of human rights questions, pushing him to denounce the behavior of russia, china, saudi arabia and the philippines and expressing deep disappointment when the texan refused to do so. Rubio's vote could make the difference in tillerson's progress, as republicans have only a one-vote margin on the senate foreign affairs committee and democrats may not support him. But it is possible, should tillerson stall in committee, for the senate to bypass the panel and bring the nomination to the full senate for a vote. \" this is a very important decision and i recognize the partisan split on the committee and what it means, \" rubio told reporters after the hearing. \" i ' m prepared to do what's right. \" the florida senator -- who lost to trump in the gop presidential primary and had heated personal exchanges with him during the campaign -- told tillerson that \" moral clarity \" is crucial to us foreign policy and expressed disbelief that tillerson wouldn't deliver judgments on countries ' alleged human rights abuses when information is widely available. \" the position you've been nominated to is, in my opinion, the second-most important position of the us government",
            "Rex tillerson has closed his share of high-stakes deals as the ceo of exxonmobil, persuading and partnering with unpredictable players across the globe. But on wednesday he fell short of winning over a new, and especially key, contingent: the senate foreign relations committee, gatekeeper to tillerson's confirmation as the next secretary of state. During roughly eight hours of testimony, tillerson faced surprise pushback from a republican questioner, sen. Marco rubio. The onetime rival of president-elect donald trump praised tillerson's personal character but pressed him aggressively on his stance toward russia and president vladimir putin, with whom tillerson cultivated a close relationship as head of exxonmobil, and on human rights violations across the globe. In one telling exchange, tillerson would not, at rubio's urging, characterize putin as a \"war criminal \" for his country's actions in syria, even as rubio named the atrocities. Instead, tillerson said he would wish to review classified information before reaching a conclusion. \"none of this is classified, mr. Tillerson, \" rubio said in one of the hearing's memorable moments. \"people are dead. \" rubio appeared to grow more frustrated with tillerson as he later declined to comment on human rights abuses in china, saudi arabia and the philippines, chiding tillerson that \"in order to have moral clarity, we need clarity."

The tech giant announced tuesday it will start tracking money spent at merchants ' brick-and-mortar stores by people who've clicked on those stores'digital ads. Google has access to about 70 % of credit and debit card sales in the us, it explains, via partnerships with other data tracking companies; its new tool will match up those sales with the ad clicks of users logged into google. Google can then let merchants know how effective their digital ads are at leading not only to online sales, but also to in-person sales, thus possibly convincing companies to increase the money they spend on online ads. Google runs the world's largest digital ad network. The consumerist explains that location services on your phone could also be helpful in tracking offline purchases, giving this example: \" why yes, john smith did see four ads for your coffee drink online yesterday, before spending exactly what one of those drinks costs at a location of yours near his office. \" and, as cnn reports, google will also start making more of an effort to get people into physical stores by offering up local store information on youtube ads. Google says its new tracking tool is not invasive and that the company won't have access to the exact amount spent or the particular items purchased by a user, but one privacy expert says it's possible for aggregated data to be used to identify individuals — and another marketing expert says this type of data could be tempting to hackers. \" the privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so google needs to tread very carefully, \" he says.",

The guardian reports the painting by raphael, famous italian artist and ninja turtle namesake, was discovered by art historian dr. Bendor grosvenor at scotland's haddo house. He was there to look at other works, but the painting of the madonna drew his eye despite being \" obscured by discolored varnish. \" \" i thought, crikey, it looks like a raphael, \" grosvenor says. The 500-year-old painting was purchased in the early 19th century as a legit raphael, but it was later credited to innocenzo da imola, according to the bbc. Restoration and further examination of the painting showed it almost certainly is the work of raphael. Grosvenor tells the guardian it's \" simply too good to be by innocenzo. \" the painting still needs to be verified by raphael scholars, smithsonian reports. But if it's confirmed, it would be scotland's only publicly owned work by the great artist. \" finding a possible raphael is about as exciting as it gets, \" grosvenor tells the bbc. The painting has since been moved to a more prominent dining room location in haddo house, which is owned by the national trust for scotland and open for tours. \"there are not many places where you can experience the work of one of the renaissance's giants in a dining room, \" smithsonian quotes a press release from the national trust.

Ryan's home state of wisconsin, which has not voted for a republican president since 1984, was always \" an uphill fight, \" he said, insisting that \" mitt didn't pick me for wisconsin, \" but rather because of his experience on budget issues. Ryan doesn't think his plan to cut medicare hurt the ticket, particularly because he and romney won seniors 56 % to 44 %. In 2008, john mccain carried older voters 53 % to 45 %. \" we were with the romneys when we knew it was over, \" ryan said, calling the mood in the hotel suite \" pretty sad.

Scientists have found that heterosexual men take greater risks with money — in pursuit of bigger rewards — after seeing pictures of good-looking guys. Researcher eugene chan says it's a matter of competition for sex: \" men want to appear more desirable to women, and having more money is one way to do so, \" chan tells new scientist. \" taking financial risks is one quick way to get more money, even if it might not be a sure thing. \" neither female subjects nor male subjects who saw pictures of attractive women showed the same behavior. Chan's findings came after a series of experiments. One involved showing some men pictures of male abercrombie models, others pictures of female victoria's secret models, and still others images of normal humans. Subjects could take $ 100 or opt for a bet that would give them a 10 % chance of a $ 1,000 prize, and a 90 % chance of getting nothing. The gentlemen who saw the male models showed a higher likelihood of taking the risk than did men who saw the other pictures. Men also took bigger risks when they viewed themselves as less attractive compared to the models, pacific standard reports. But as for non-financial risks, \" it remains unclear whether good-looking men might make other guys sky-dive, for instance, \" chan tells the daily beast.

Sonnenberg's daughter says she and her sisters had long feared for their parents'safety in a dangerous neighborhood — their home, which straddles the camden-mckinley neighborhoods, had been burglarized in 2001, kstp reports. But the couple couldn't move due to an underwater mortgage. Sonnenberg did put keyed deadbolts on the doors, and his daughter says that's what ultimately allowed police to catch parker: sonnenberg made sure to lock the deadbolt after letting parker inside, and the key to it was in his pocket, the st.

        "summary": "An indian woman can divorce her husband because he refused to install a toilet in their home, the bbc reports, with a judge in the northwestern state of rajasthan finding on friday that forced outdoor defecation is a form of torture and that the woman, who is in her 20s, has a right to a toilet. The judgment noted that women in indian villages often \" wait until sunset to answer nature's call. This is not only physical cruelty \" but a violation of \" the modesty of a woman, \" per the times of india. It can also be dangerous after dark. Outdoor defecation in india is a major health threat that has prompted a government campaign to ensure an indoor toilet in every household by 2019. The woman's husband said an indoor toilet was not an issue when the couple married five years ago. But the woman's lawyer said he refused repeated demands, prompting her to file for divorce two years ago. The judge noted that people spend money \" buying tobacco, liquor and mobile phones, but are unwilling to construct toilets to protect the dignity of our family. \" calls to install toilets have been met with resistance in india by people who consider them unnecessary and expensive. One local official made headlines last year when he told men to \" sell their wives \" if they can't afford a toilet, per indian express. About 564 million people, half the population of india, defecate in the open, producing some 100,000 tons of feces daily that can cause disease, per unicef. Diarrhea kills about 400 indian children under 5 each day. ( a tv reporter was charged after pooping on someone's lawn. )",

Francois fillon allegedly misused public funds, specifically by paying his wife more than $ 720,000 over 15 years to be a parliamentary assistant. According to cnn, the former prime minister allegedly did the same for his two children, bringing the total amount of taxpayer money that went to his immediate family to more than $ 1 million. In france, it's legal to employ family members as parliamentary assistants, but allegations against fillon claim these were fake jobs for which no work was done. Fillon, who is currently trailing in third place in the presidential race, claims he's the victim of \" political assassination, \" reuters reports. He says his wife ( who also may or may not have made more than $ 3,700 a month for a fake job at a literary magazine ) did legit work as a parliamentary assistant, keeping track of his schedule and appearing for him at cultural events. Fillon had previously said he would drop out of the presidential race if there was a formal investigation; he now says otherwise.

And this time christie pushed back, opting to \" get in one fan's face \" — while holding tight to an order of nachos. An abc news video on youtube shows the red-faced governor nose-to-nose with an amused-looking fan sporting a cubs jersey. Christie says, \" you're a big shot, \" per the original video on wisn reporter ben hutchison's twitter feed, with the fan replying, \" appreciate that \" as christie storms off to his seat.

In a university of alberta press release, the team says their video reveals that the sound is caused by the formation of a gas-filled bubble created by a drop in pressure when the joints are separated. \" we call it the ' pull my finger study ' — and actually pulled on someone's finger and filmed what happens in the mri, \" the lead researcher says. \" when you do that, you can actually see very clearly what is happening inside the joint. \" the study was published in the journal plos one.

It's similar with joints.

The question has never been the subject of sustained scientific inquiry, but the puzzle crops up in medical literature reaching back more then 50 years. It began, perhaps, with a german physician called nordheim, who in 1938 demonstrated that most joints in healthy people can be made to pop when pulled upon. In a report published today, canadian scientists tackle the problem with 21st century technology. With an mri scanner, a bespoke finger-pulling device, and a gifted and willing knuckle-cracker, they set about recording the first video footage of the innards of a knuckle being cracked. \"it's such a common thing.

            "Cracking sounds emitted from human synovial joints have been attributed historically to the sudden collapse of a cavitation bubble formed as articular surfaces are separated. Unfortunately, bubble collapse as the source of joint cracking is inconsistent with many physical phenomena that define the joint cracking phenomenon. Here we present direct evidence from real-time magnetic resonance imaging that the mechanism of joint cracking is related to cavity formation rather than bubble collapse. In this study, ten metacarpophalangeal joints were studied by inserting the finger of interest into a flexible tube tightened around a length of cable used to provide long-axis traction. Before and after traction, static 3d t1-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired. During traction, rapid cine magnetic resonance images were obtained from the joint midline at a rate of 3.2 frames per second until the cracking event occurred. As traction forces increased, real-time cine magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated rapid cavity inception at the time of joint separation and sound production after which the resulting cavity remained visible. Our results offer direct experimental evidence that joint cracking is associated with cavity inception rather than collapse of a pre-existing bubble. These observations are consistent with tribonucleation, a known process where opposing surfaces resist separation until a critical point where they then separate rapidly creating sustained gas cavities. Observed previously in vitro, this is the first in-vivo macroscopic demonstration of tribonucleation and as such, provides a"

Facebook twitter pinterest a university of alberta team led by greg kawchuk used mri video to work out why joints make a popping sound when they crack. Video: university of alberta kawchuk",
            "Cracking sounds emitted from human synovial joints have been attributed historically to the sudden collapse of a cavitation bubble formed as articular surfaces are separated. Unfortunately, bubble collapse as the source of joint cracking is inconsistent with many physical phenomena that define the joint cracking phenomenon. Here we present direct evidence from real-time magnetic resonance imaging that the mechanism of joint cracking is related to cavity formation rather than bubble collapse. In this study, ten metacarpophalangeal joints were studied by inserting the finger of interest into a flexible tube tightened around a length of cable used to provide long-axis traction. Before and after traction, static 3d t1-weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired. During traction, rapid cine magnetic resonance images were obtained from the joint midline at a rate of 3.2 frames per second until the cracking event occurred. As traction forces increased, real-time cine magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated rapid cavity inception at the time of joint separation and sound production after which the resulting cavity remained visible. Our results offer direct experimental evidence that joint cracking is associated with cavity inception rather than collapse of a pre-existing bubble. These observations are consistent with tribonucleation, a known process where opposing surfaces resist separation until a critical point where they then separate rapidly creating sustained gas cavities. Observed previously in vitro, this is the first in-vivo macroscopic demonstration of tribonucleation and as such, provides a"

The first from the world bank finds rising global temperatures will force 100 million more people into extreme poverty by 2030, and those in the poorest regions — sub-saharan africa and south asia — will be hardest hit. The second from climate central notes as many as 760 million people may be left homeless by rising sea levels caused by a temperature increase of 7.2 degrees fahrenheit from carbon emissions. An increase of only 3.6 degrees could reduce the number of people affected to 130 million over centuries. Asian cities, including shanghai, hong kong, and mumbai, are particularly at risk, though the us is the most threatened nation outside of asia. About 25 million americans could find their homes submerged, reports cnn. Already 702 million people, or 9.6 % of the world's population, are in extreme poverty, per the guardian. Yet in africa, food prices could rise 12 % in the next 15 years as global crop yields could reduce by 5 % by 2030 and 30 % by 2080. Cases of diarrhea and stunting will also rise, while a global temperature increase of 3.6 degrees or more could put another 150 million people at risk of malaria, per reuters. At the same time, those affected by droughts could jump 5 % to 17 % by 2030 and 50 % to 90 % by 2080. The report notes some $ 1 trillion for fast, climate-informed development is needed, along with continued efforts to reduce global emissions, but \" ending poverty and fighting climate change cannot be done in isolation, \" a world bank economist says. \" the two will be much more easily achieved if they are addressed together. \"",

The shooter, who was killed at the scene, has been identified as gavin long of kansas city, mo. The former marine, using the alias \" cosmo setepenra \" made numerous online posting complaining about how black people were treated by police, the guardian reports. He described the july 7 killing of five dallas police officers as \" justice, \" and apparently visited the city a few days after the shooting. The marines have confirmed that long, 29, received an honorable discharge in 2011 after five years in which he rose to the rank of sergeant and served in iraq for a year. In the years after leaving the military, long apparently traveled extensively in africa.

Think that's no big deal? well, researchers are throwing out some numbers that just might scare you into changing your eating habits: some 1.65 million deaths each year, including from heart disease and stroke, can be attributed in part to a high-sodium diet, and excess sodium intake is to blame for one in 10 deaths from cardiovascular causes. In fact, of 187 countries, just six, including kenya, cameroon, and gabon, keep their sodium intake in line with who's recommended 2 grams per day or less, the washington post reports. Two other studies published alongside this one, however, come to a very different conclusion: salt? eat it up. They argue that cutting one's salt intake may actually be harmful and, for most people, 3 to 6 grams of sodium a day is just right. As 95 % of americans fall under the 6-grams-a-day limit, the research argues we may not need to pass on the salt shaker after all, webmd reports.

One woman says she was assaulted in las vegas and the other says the casino mogul assaulted her in chicago. Police in las vegas say they will investigate the allegation there, but the statute of limitations expires in nevada after 20 years. The other allegation has been forwarded to police in chicago, but legal experts say charges in illinois are also extremely unlikely. Metropolitan police department spokesman larry hadfield says they encourage victims to come forward whether it is possible to file charges or not. Wynn resorts spokesman michael weaver says the company has no comment \" because this involved a company before the establishment of wynn resorts, \" the ap reports. The wall street journal reports that the company, days after canceling an outside law firm's investigation of the allegations against wynn, has now hired a law firm with close ties to the company to conduct what it says will be an expanded investigation.

Their lawsuit filed july 7 claims the governments of lyons, lincolnwood, and riverdale don't do enough to stop the \" flood \" of guns into chicago that perpetuates violence in poor, black neighborhoods, the washington post reports. Pam bosley and annette nance-holt know of it first-hand: both lost teenage sons — one was shot while unloading music equipment at a church, the other while shielding a friend on the bus. The mothers, who say their civil rights are being violated, demand employee background checks and better security and training for the suburbs ' gun shops. The lawsuit, citing a 2014 police report, says three gun shops in those towns — plus a fourth in nearby gary, indiana — were the source of nearly 20 % of firearms found at chicago crime scenes between 2009 and 2013, reports the christian science monitor. Police have reportedly recovered a gun sold at one particular riverdale shop every day for the past 10 years, on average. Chicago's superintendent of police, whose city has seen homicides jump 20 % this year, says fewer guns coming into the city would decrease violence and agrees suburban shops need to be more strict. But, opponents, including the nra, say the suit has little merit and is a way for the city to force its gun laws on neighboring jurisdictions.",

A customer inspects a 9mm handgun at rink's gun and sport in the chicago, suburb of lockport, illinois, in june 2008. As gun violence spikes once again in chicago, gun control advocates in the city are pointing fingers at an old enemy: the chicago suburbs. A lawsuit filed on tuesday in cook county circuit court claims that weak oversight of gun shops in the villages of riverdale, lyons, and lincolnwood outside chicago is fueling gun violence in black neighborhoods in the city. Citing a may 2014 report from the chicago police department, the suit says that four local gun dealers – including one in each of those towns, as well as one in gary, ind. – supplied almost 20 percent of the guns recovered at chicago crime scenes between 2009 and 2013. Overall, most \"crime guns \" in chicago were actually first purchased outside illinois – almost 60 percent of them between 2009 and 2013, according to the cpd report, including from states as far away as georgia. But some see an added danger from illegal gun purchases in the chicago suburbs: the speed with which they could be used to commit crimes in the city"

Aereo uses thousands of tv antennas to stream content that's freely broadcast over the airwaves to users, who can also choose to record shows to watch later. The ruling may effectively destroy the company — top investor barry diller has previously said there was \" no plan b \" if it lost, cnn money points out. Conservatives antonin scalia, samuel alito, and clarence thomas cast the dissenting votes. During oral arguments the court had worried that ruling against aereo would harm the fledgling cloud computing industry, but in his majority opinion, stephen breyer said the court did not intend to question cloud computing as a whole, the ap reports. You can read more about the case and its specifics here.

The landsat 8 satellite captured the iceberg's separation late last month in what was believed to be the sheet's biggest loss of ice since 2015, when a massive chunk of ice 20 miles long broke away, live science reports. This loss wasn't on the same scale, but nasa describes it as further evidence of the ice shelf's \" fragility, \" which is especially alarming because of the amount of ice the pine island sheet moves from the west antarctic ice sheet to the ocean. The new iceberg broke off from a floating ice sheet at the end of the glacier, meaning its loss won't contribute to rising sea levels, mashable reports, explaining the floating sheet buttresses huge amounts of land-based ice behind it. Researchers expect more ice to break off from the glacier soon. The latest break was the \" calving equivalent \" of an \" aftershock \" from the 2015 event, ohio state university glaciologist ian howat says in a nasa press release. \" apparently, there are weaknesses in the ice shelf — just inland of the rift that caused the 2015 calving — that are resulting in these smaller breaks. \" ( researchers fear the much larger west antarctic ice sheet has already passed the point of no return. )",

The segment first lays out the case for law enforcement, touching on republican presidential candidate donald trump's proposed apple boycott, before spending a significant amount of time explaining why creating a backdoor for the government would be a bad idea.the last week tonight host explains that many critics of apple's stance on encryption don't seem to understand how modern technology works and that apple creating a key for this one case is a slippery slope, allowing government officials to approach apple for other cases.

David eisenhauer, 18, and natalie keepers, 19, were arrested on saturday — the day nicole lovell's body was found in north carolina and three days after she first disappeared from her bedroom in blacksburg, virginia. Eisenhauer was immediately charged with murder, while keepers was charged with improper disposal of a body and being an accessory to murder after the fact, according to the richmond times-dispatch. On tuesday, authorities upgraded the charges against keepers to include accessory to murder before the fact, which carries a punishment of 20 years to life. Authorities released charging documents and held a press conference tuesday, but still little is known about the murder, the baltimore sun reports. Preliminary indications are that lovell was stabbed to death on the same day she disappeared, but results from an official autopsy won't be available for weeks. Police say eisenhauer used an unspecified relationship with lovell to abduct her. Her mother, tammy weeks, says the two met online. No motive has been given for the crime, and authorities say eisenhauer believes the truth will set him free. Weeks also spoke at tuesday's press conference, remembering the daughter who \" touched many people throughout her short life. \" weeks says lovell survived a liver transplant, lymphoma, and more. She loved pandas, mountain dew, and dr. Pepper and wanted to be on american idol.",

Cops arrived at a randallstown, md., apartment just before 9: 30am to serve arrest warrants on a man living there and on korryn gaines, wanted for being a court no-show for a march traffic stop in which she was charged with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and traffic violations, police chief jim johnson says. The story, per johnson: even though cops could hear people on the other side of the door, no one answered when they knocked and ided themselves, so they used a landlord's key to enter. Inside sat gaines with the 5-year-old on her lap and a long gun pointed at them. After hours of negotiation, tensions rose around 3pm when gaines said she was going to kill the cops, at which point an officer fired a round at her, says johnson. Gaines returned fire, and officers shot again, causing her death. Nbc news reports the 5-year-old was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries; it's not clear whose gunfire wounded him. New york daily news columnist shaun king points out what he says is gaines ' instagram account, showing what he says on twitter is \" a woman deeply bothered and disturbed by police brutality. \" king also posted a video he says is gaines filming the march traffic stop, one in which king says she's instructing her 5-year-old son to film her traffic stop, and a third purportedly taken of a swat team member inside her home monday.",

Citing several sources, politico reports that the special counsel has teamed up with new york attorney general eric schneiderman to investigate paul manafort's financial transactions, including possible money laundering related to real estate deals in new york — a move that could pressure manafort to cooperate in the larger probe into trump's election campaign \" as trump does not have pardon power over state crimes. \" the washington post separately confirmed the report. Though sources say there's no decision yet on whether to file charges, prosecutors reportedly believe manafort's cooperation could rely on his chance at a presidential pardon. Indeed, they may be building a case against him \" in hopes that he would provide information against others in trump's inner circle in exchange for lessening his legal exposure, \" the post previously reported. In related news, a source tells the ap that rinat akhmetshin, the russian-american lobbyist and former soviet military officer who attended the june 2016 meeting between donald trump jr. And a russian lawyer, recently testified in front of mueller's grand jury, showing mueller's interest in the meeting.",

The creature, described by cnn as 1.5 feet in length and no more than 10 pounds, apparently had a bloodied mouth, possibly indicating it was recently caught. Passengers reacted exactly as you might expect: they stuck a cigarette in its mouth, posed it next to a can of red bull and a metrocard, and took a photo. The mta, which removed the shark ( and disposed of it by putting it in a garbage bag and tossing it in the trash, wbac reports ), says it doesn't know how it got there. But one rep tweeted: \" latest on the shark on the n train: unconfirmed reports that the shark was headed home after a night of partying in coney island. \" and, bummer, the mta says it won't be investigating any further. Surprisingly, this isn't the only mystery shark to recently pop up on dry land.

Together with coauthor hilary campbell, he claims the subject of leonardo da vinci's 1503 painting had an underactive thyroid gland, explaining lisa gherardini's yellowed skin, receding hairline, lack of eyebrows, swelled hands, even that enigmatic smile. As mehra tells inverse, \" when you have hypothyroidism you're a little depressed, and your facial muscles are puffy and weak. You can't even bring yourself to a full smile. \" hyperlipidemia can also lead to high levels of fat in the blood, which doctors previously proposed as gherardini's ailment. But mehra and campbell say gherardini wouldn't have lived to 63 with hyperlipidemia, for which there were few treatments at the time. Instead, they suggest she was among the many florentines with thyroid problems from a diet low in iodine, per smithsonian. As an anatomy expert, da vinci \" would have captured every small embellishment, \" including a likely cholesterol deposit near gherardini's inner eye and possible goiter on the neck, mehra says. Further boosting his theory is the fact that gherardini was reportedly painted after childbirth, and pregnancy sometimes precedes hypothyroidism. Still, mehra concedes it's possible gherardini plucked her eyebrows, and da vinci's paintbrush did the rest. ( first came a nude sketch. )",

Mehra was in that endless line, hoping to do the same. During the long wait, he pondered the details of la giaconda's strange looks — her yellowing skin, her thinning hair, and of course, her lopsided smile.

Navalny was reportedly arrested 30 minutes before things were set to kick off in moscow, with wife yulia tweeting, \" alexei has been arrested in the entrance to our block of flats, \" but \" our plans haven't changed, \" per the bbc. That will make for one fewer protester on a day when nbc news suggests numbers count: the \" scale and geographical reach \" will indicate whether navalny was able to successfully grow protests held in march that saw more than 1,000 people arrested. Those protests — spurred by navalny's charges that prime minister dmitry medvedev had enriched himself with $ 1 billion worth of mansions, yachts, and vineyards, reports the washington post — were the largest in roughly five years. Nbc news notes one favorable condition as far as turnout goes: monday is russia day, a public holiday. The post sees the protests as a sort of bellwether for navalny, who wants to take the presidency from vladimir putin in 2018 ( though navalny has technically been disqualified as a candidate ). As for why navalny was arrested, moscow's general prosecutor indicated it was over his \" illegal \" last-minute call to change the protest location in that city from the approved spot, where plans to erect a stage were apparently scuttled, to tverskaya street near the kremlin. After the venue-change announcement, the ap reports moscow police warned \" any provocative actions from the protesters'side will be considered a threat to public order and will be immediately suppressed. \" ( navalny was partially blinded by toxic green dye in april. )",

Alton sterling, a 37-year-old man who sold cds outside the triple s food mart, was shot dead after what cops describe as \" some sort of altercation \" at 12: 35am tuesday with two officers responding to an anonymous call about an armed man, the advocate reports. In graphic bystander video circulating online, the officers can be seen pinning sterling to the ground before apparently shooting him multiple times. The east baton rouge parish coroner says sterling, who is black, died from multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and back. Triple s food mart owner abdullah muflahi tells the new york daily news that sterling bought a gun for protection a few days ago after hearing that other cd sellers had been robbed, but it wasn't in his hand during the confrontation with police, nor was his hand in his pocket. Sterling, who was tasered during the incident, \" was screaming, ' what did i do? what's going on? ' \" muflahi says. Muflahi tells the advocate that after the shooting, the officer who fired the shots cursed and both men appeared to be \" freaking out. \" both officers are now on administrative leave, and us rep.

The state department is out with its annual list of gifts bestowed upon us officials by foreign governments, and the most eye-catching item is the $ 500,000 worth of white gold jewelry that saudi king abdullah gave hillary clinton. Think \" teardrop rubies and diamonds containing a necklace, a bracelet, earrings, and a ring, \" according to the official description. Alas, clinton can't keep it, because rules prohibit us diplomats from hanging on to any gift above $ 350, notes the wall street journal. Which means clinton can't keep a $ 560 bottle of cognac from vladimir putin, either. The full list will be published in the federal register, but the journal, the ap, and the hill pull out highlights: president obama got a 41-inch saber from the president of mongolia worth $ 440. He also got an autographed basketball from chinese president xi jinping appraised for the weird sum of $ 740. Obama's priciest present: a $ 16,500 gold-plated clock from the saudi defense minister. Obama daughters malia and sasha received two brooches valued at $ 4,440 from the president of myanmar. Janet napolitano got a \"clear-glass perfume bottle with purple glass stopper \" from jordan. Pakistan gave mitch mcconnell at $ 480 bottle of scotch. Most of the pricey gifts go to the general services administration, where they usually get donated or resold to the public.",

Ukraine lawmaker serhiy leshchenko has published a contract and invoice supposedly from manafort, a former adviser to pro-russia former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych, detailing a $ 750,000 payment to manafort's consulting company in 2009, the bbc reports. The invoice is for 501 pieces of computer equipment, though leshchenko says it matches a payment to manafort listed in a secret ledger uncovered by anti-corruption investigators in ukraine. Manafort resigned days after reports on the ledger surfaced. \" so, it looks like manafort wasn't a political consultant. He was a trader of computer processors, \" leshchenko quips to cnn. \" but i ' m sure it's a fake contract and a fake invoice just to establish — artificially establish — a legal basis for a transaction. \" he alleges that the payment, which went through offshore accounts in belize and kyrgyzstan, was really for consulting work for yanukovych's party of regions. Manafort has denied receiving cash payments from the leader, and a spokesman says the latest claims are \" baseless. \" at a house hearing monday, fbi chief james comey declined to say whether the us is coordinating with ukraine to investigate the alleged payments, the washington post reports.",

The former vp was not only on the senate judiciary committee at the time, he was actually the chairman, and critics have faulted his handling of the hearing — for not protecting anita hill from attacks during questioning and for not calling witnesses who might have supported her accusations of sexual misconduct. The story focuses on the political ramifications for the possible 2020 candidate, but it also takes note of an interesting interview hill just gave to elle. The interviewer mentions to hill that biden \" sort of apologized \" last year for how he handled things. In her response, hill notes that biden said, \" i owe her an apology \" but that he has never actually apologized. \" people were asking, ' when are you going to apologize to her?, ' \" she says. \" it's become sort of a running joke in the household when someone rings the doorbell and we're not expecting company.

        "summary": "Before bob mcdonnell was even in office, he and his wife were looking to then-star scientific ceo jonnie williams for gifts, according to the 43-page indictment against the couple. The document reveals that the couple had financial anxieties that may have driven their alleged graft, politico reports. Weeks before mcdonnell's inauguration, maureen mcdonnell emailed a senior aide fretting about how she'd afford a dress. \" bob is screaming about the thousands i ' m charging up in credit card debt, \" she wrote. \" we are broke, have an unconscionable amount of credit card debt already, and this inaugural is killing us! \" williams offered to buy maureen an oscar de la renta dress for the occasion. Maureen ultimately said she'd take a \" rain check \" — which she later cashed in with a massive new york city shopping spree. Williams allegedly paid for the entire trip, spending $ 10,999 at oscar de la renta, $ 5,685 at louis vuitton, and $ 2,604 at bergdorf goodman. Other gifts included: a $ 6,500 rolex engraved with the words, \" 71st governor of virginia, \" which maureen wanted to give mcdonnell. A vacation at williams ' lake house, during which they were given use of his ferrari. Maureen allegedly sent williams an email containing nothing but a picture of bob driving the car. Various loans and cash infusions — so far, they've already paid back more than $ 120,000 worth. A trip to a cape cod resort. Tickets for the mcdonnells'daughters to go to a bachelorette party in savannah, ga. Abc has a full list of goods the government wants the pair to return. Maureen generally solicited the gifts, while bob used his influence to peddle williams ' products. He tried to push clinical trials for some, and to connect williams with state health officials, according to the washington examiner, at times spouting infomercial-esque endorsements of anatabloc. Williams even tried to convince mcdonnell to pitch using virginia employees as a test group for the drug, the washington post observes. Mcdonnell has denied all wrongdoing, and his lawyers today filed motions arguing that his behavior wasn't unusual.

His death came when one of those shells misfired, and now his family is seeking almost $ 13 million in a lawsuit from the man who supplied the ammunition, reports the bend bulletin. The supplier, however, says preston, 51, was the negligent one in the blast, which also killed preston's 22-year-old assistant, austin lee. \" i told him, ' if you put one more ounce in there, you're going to blow yourself up, ' \" chuck hegele tells the newspaper. \" he put 8 more ounces in. \" the explosion was actually caught on film, per the oregonian, because preston was having a promotional video made. One reason the amount being sought is so high is that while lee was killed instantly, preston survived for nearly a half-hour, though barely. He suffered \" imminent fear of death \" in that time, says the lawsuit. Lee's family also has sued over the accident, and that lawsuit blames both preston and hegele, along with others. Hegele says he would have typically handled the ammo himself in such demonstrations, but his shoulder was in a sling at the time.

That's the number she's distributed in nearly every us state in the six months since her 22-year-old daughter, chelsea, went missing after leaving a halloween party near her michigan home with an unidentified man. Operating out of what she has dubbed her \" command center \" in monroe county, bruck, with the help of friends and family, is leading a tireless search for chelsea — or answers, reports the detroit free press. Bruck's resolve is fueled by the dramatic rescue of three women held for 10 years in ariel castro's cleveland home. \" those ladies have had freedom for two years, \" says leannda. \" so until somebody tells me otherwise, my daughter is out there waiting for someone to help her. And i will not believe otherwise. \" bruck says her efforts may have turned up a clue. As per the detroit news, police received a tip that in the beginning of april led them to clothing at an empty industrial site now being examined by the state's police crime lab. \" they're hoping to pick up some dna, \" bruck said at an april 8 press conference. The free press reports that bruck framed the development, the first after five months of \" nothing, \" as due to the flyers. As for those flyers, bruck focuses four days each week on her quest, stuffing envelopes that are mailed to out-of-state hotels with requests for assistance; she directs them to highly populated places ( phoenix, during the super bowl ) and not ( south dakota, last week ). \" we don't want people to stop talking about chelsea, \" she says.

Real clear science revisits a bizarre case from 2007 in which a relatively normal 44-year-old man — married, two kids, job — turned out to have been going about his life without most of his brain. In fact, the discovery was only made when the man went to a hospital in france because his leg was feeling weak. According to a new scientist article published when the case was revealed in july 2007, one neurologist estimated the man was missing more than 50 % to 75 % of his brain but — other than a slightly below-average iq of 75, per the study in the lancet — was suffering no ill effects. Real clear science reports the man's condition stemmed from a case of hydrocephalus ( an excessive buildup the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions your brain ) suffered as a baby. At that time, doctors inserted a shunt into the man's skull to drain the fluid. But when the shunt was removed at age 14, fluid again started building up, and this time it had three decades to push his brain matter until that matter only lined the edges of his skull ( pictures here ). According to the new scientist, neurologists could not explain how the man could function while the parts of the brain that control motion, language, vision, emotions, and more were severely compressed. In the end, the case was pointed to as an extreme example of the brain's adaptability. \" if something happens very slowly over quite some time, maybe over decades, the different parts of the brain take up functions that would normally be done by the part that is pushed to the side, \" said a brain defect specialist not involved in the study.

            "Summary hydrocephalus is the buildup of too much cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Normally, this fluid cushions your brain. When you have too much, though, it puts harmful pressure on your brain. Hydrocephalus can be congenital, or present at birth. Causes include genetic problems and problems with how the fetus develops. An unusually large head is the main sign of congenital hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus can also happen after birth. This is called acquired hydrocephalus. It can occur at any age. Causes can include head injuries, strokes, infections, tumors, and bleeding in the brain. Symptoms include headache vomiting and nausea blurry vision balance problems bladder control problems thinking and memory problems hydrocephalus can permanently damage the brain, causing problems with physical and mental development. If untreated, it is usually fatal. With treatment, many people lead normal lives with few limitations. Treatment usually involves surgery to insert a shunt. A shunt is a flexible but sturdy plastic tube. The shunt moves the cerebrospinal fluid to another area of the body where it can be absorbed. Medicine and rehabilitation therapy can also help.

It follows a brutal day yesterday, when security forces killed about 40 people after protests around the country, say opposition groups. Protesters renewed their call for a no-fly zone to be imposed by the international community to protect civilians, notes cnn. The arab league, meanwhile, sent a message to bashar al-assad to condemn the continued killing, and representatives from the league are expected to meet with syrian officials tomorrow. The killing hasn't been completely one-sided, though. Army defectors reportedly killed 17 soldiers during clashes in homs last night.

        "summary": "A protective grandson outraged at what he saw at his workplace spurred the downfall of theranos, and the wall street journal has what vanity fair is calling a \" devastating piece \" on the whole affair. The man in question: tyler shultz, who in 2014 first noticed things were amiss — specifically theranos ' quality control and iffy research — and emailed founder elizabeth holmes to let her know. His grandfather: george shultz, former us secretary of state and then a theranos director ( he's since been relegated to the \" counselors \" category ). After sending his email, the younger shultz was berated by president sunny balwani in an email — balwani called his tone \" arrogant and patronizing \" — and quit that day. Shultz then filed the first reported regulatory complaint against theranos under an alias and started talking confidentially to the journal, which published articles that blew the scandal open. But his involvement has also blown his relationship with his grandfather apart: he tells the journal that while he used to check in with george regularly, he's barely seen or spoken with him since, not even going in december to his grandfather's 95th birthday party ( which, the journal points out, was attended by holmes ). In the meantime, he's been dealing with his concerned parents, what he depicts as a theranos attempt to strong-arm him into admitting he leaked trade secrets, and a possible private investigator on his tail. Perhaps the most distressing part for tyler shultz, who sources say is cooperating with the feds investigating theranos: that his grandfather stayed on with the company after he blew the whistle, even after tyler shultz asked him to \" do the right thing \" at a july meeting that proved to be their last.

            "Last week, as the country was preparing to elect donald trump to its highest office, walgreens was filing a lawsuit against theranos. According to now-available documents, walgreens is suing the blood-testing start-up for $ 140 million, alleging that theranos breached a contract between the two companies when they entered into a partnership that saw theranos open wellness centers at walgreens across the country, where customers could get their blood tested. Walgreens claims that theranos misled them about the safety and accuracy of their proprietary blood-testing equipment and \"failed to meet the most basic quality standards and legal requirements. \" walgreens, which was previously theranos's largest partner, terminated the relationship in june and shuttered 40 more theranos wellness centers after it emerged that theranos's technology did not work as advertised. According to the lawsuit, walgreens claims to have been consistently misled by the once-vaunted biotech start-up and its charismatic founder, elizabeth holmes. Theranos, walgreens claims, didn't tell walgreens until june 11 that 31,000, or 11.3 percent, of its blood test results given to customers were voided. To add insult to injury, walgreens says it found out about the voided tests the same way the rest of the world did: through media reports first published in the wall street journal. The next day, walgreens says, it pulled out of its partnership with theranos. Theranos fired back at walgreens in a statement last week, accusing the drugstore giant of failing to meet its own commitments. \"we are disappointed that walgreens filed this lawsuit, \" a spokesperson told vanity fair. \"through its mishandling of our partnership and now this lawsuit, walgreens has caused theranos and its investors significant harm. We will respond vigorously to walgreens's unfounded allegations, and will seek to hold walgreens responsible for the damage it has caused to theranos and its investors. \" the news is just the latest in a series of unflattering media reports for theranos, which",

But ryan soldiered on in his speech, even telling abc news his wisconsin background prepped him for the hecklers. \" nah. We're used to it. I come from wisconsin, \" ryan said of the hecklers as he weaved through the fair. Surrounded by hay bales lining the stage, ryan spoke at the soapbox, an iowa state fair staple, where ryan's running mate, mitt romney, was heckled last year after making a comment that has stuck with him throughout this campaign. \" corporations are people, my friend, \" romney said last year on the same stage, as protesters shouted him down. Ryan's stop at the fair was his first solo trip as romney's running mate, and he was greeted by a crush of supporters, media and protesters. As he made his way to the famous iowa fair soapbox, he was surrounded by cameras, reporters and those trying to get a look at the gop ticket's no. 2 man. He shook hands and introduced himself to voters with a casual statement: \" hi, i ' m paul. \" ryan"

On sunday, the 50-year-old boy scout troop leader decided to show the cave he first entered some three decades ago to his son and the two other scouts he was hiking with. He began to enter feet-first through the crevasse-type entrance — when a black bear seized his foot. The new york times reports the animal pulled petronino into the cave and began biting him. That was just the start of the ordeal. Nj.com reports that petronino twice struck the bear in the head with a rock hammer then told the boys to call 911. He assumed a fetal position with his back to the bear and put a sweatshirt over his head, reports nbc new york. The boys did call, but were unable to provide their location to the 911 operator; officials began to try to track their coordinates and dispatched a helicopter. Petronino next told the boys to place the food they were carrying just outside the cave. That was enough to get the bear to emerge, and a dog that was with the group then scared the bear off. All told, petronino spent \" a substantial amount of time \" with the \" huffing \" bear in the cave, before emerging and himself calling 911. Help arrived 80 minutes later, and he was airlifted out, says a rep for the state's department of environmental protection. Petronino suffered bites to his scalp and legs; the boys were unharmed. Officials are now trying to trap the bear, which they believe \" was protecting its hibernation location... They do not, at this point, consider the bear to be a category i bear, \" meaning one that must be euthanized.",

        "summary": "Just when you thought things couldn't get worse for bees, a new study suggests we've been inadvertently feeding them birth control. Previous research has shown the world's most widely used pesticides, neonicotinoids, have hurt the lifespan and reproduction of honeybee queens and reduced the number of bumblebee queens, reports the guardian. But new research out of the university of bern in switzerland finds two neonicotinoids, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, also cut live sperm in males by 39 %. Sperm viability was also 8 % to 11 % lower than in bees not exposed to the pesticides, reports national geographic. Here's why that's a big problem: a queen bee collects sperm from up to 20 males to ensure genetic diversity when she reproduces. If that sperm is of poor quality, worker bees will kill the queen to protect the colony, reports deutsche welle. \" as the primary egg layer and an important source of colony cohesion, the queen is intimately connected to colony performance, \" researchers say. There's more bad news: in addition to reducing live sperm, scientists found exposure to thiamethoxam and clothianidin also cut bee lifespans by a third, from 22 days on average for unexposed bees to 15 days. In fact, only 68 % of male bees exposed to neonicotinoids lived to reach sexual maturity at 14 days, compared to 83 % of unexposed bees. These \" important lethal and sub-lethal effects \" could have \" severe consequences for colony fitness, as well as reduce overall genetic variation within honeybee populations, \" scientists say, though they acknowledge that disease, habitat loss, and parasites are also responsible for recent colony losses.

Male honey bees exposed to the neonicotinoids at levels found in fields showed, on average, around 39 per cent less living sperm. In addition, the mortality rate of the drones exposed to the pesticides during the study was almost doubled.

The school says the state department of education is looking into the incident, fox 43 reports.",
