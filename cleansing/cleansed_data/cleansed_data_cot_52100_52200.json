Lemmy, as his legions of fans knew him, discovered he had cancer on saturday — just two days after his 70th birthday — and died on monday, the bbc reports. The british-born rocker, a former jimi hendrix roadie, formed motörhead in 1975 when he was kicked out of hawkwind after a drug bust in canada. \" our mighty, noble friend lemmy passed away today after a short battle with an extremely aggressive cancer, \" the band said on its facebook page. \" we will say more in the coming days, but for now, please... Play motörhead loud, play hawkwind loud, play lemmy's music loud. Have a drink or few. \" lemmy, who made a total of 22 albums with motörhead, including the 1980 classic \" ace of spades, \" rocked — and partied — as hard as anybody in the business, though despite the band's massive influence on thrash metal and other genres, he never cared for the term \" heavy metal, \" feeling more kinship with punk bands like the damned, reports the cbc. Health problems didn't slow him down much in later years: the band completed a north american tour in september and was due to begin a european one in january. In august, he told the guardian that death was the only thing that could stop him. \" as long as i can walk the few yards from the back to the front of the stage without a stick, \" he said. \" or even if i do have to use a stick. \" ( we also lost \" louie louie \" singer jack ely this year. )",

Cnn has bystander video of a man shouting at one officer as another stands nearby; the first starts throwing punches and 10 seconds later both men are on the ground, with the officer on top and blood from the civilian streaked across the sidewalk. The second officer is seen trying to get his hands into the tussle but doesn't appear to try to stop the first officer's punches. Neither officer has been identified, but warren brown, an attorney repping the civilian, identifies his client to the baltimore sun as 26-year-old dashawn mcgrier. Brown says the cops stopped his client without offering a reason; witnesses tell the sun the officer who threw the punches knew mcgrier and may have targeted him. In a statement, the baltimore pd says the cops stopped mcgrier as part of a crime probe; they say mcgrier refused to provide id for a citizen's contact sheet, said to be required when cops talk to a citizen during an investigation. After initially being suspended, the punch-throwing officer resigned, per the baltimore pd; the second officer is still on administrative duties pending an investigation. Mcgrier wasn't charged, police say. Brown says mcgrier suffered jaw, rib, and nose fractures, per the washington post. \" i have zero tolerance for behavior like i witnessed on the video today, \" gary tuggle, the pd's interim commissioner, said. \" officers have a responsibility and duty to control their emotions in the most stressful of situations. \" brown says mcgrier will sue, per wbal.

            "Former presidential candidate marco rubio told a group of minnesota supporters wednesday he is hoping one of the remaining candidates for president will stop donald trump from winning the republican nomination — and that texas sen. Ted cruz could be the best option for conservatives. Rubio, who dropped out of the race tuesday after losing his home state of florida, didn't endorse any of his former rivals in a conference call with dozens of minnesota supporters. In the call, he explained his decision to leave the race and why he felt his presidential campaign didn't do better, and suggested he might run for office again at some point in the future. He said he saw no real path forward for his campaign after losing florida and its 99 winner-take-all delegates. He acknowledged he could have stayed in the race with the intention of seeking the nomination at the convention, but said he would have had to run a shoestring campaign with no money to defend himself on the airwaves. Even if he had won the nomination against the odds, rubio said, the victory could prove pyrrhic. \"winning a general election with a nominee that a significant percentage of the base thinks stole it, even though you did it through the rules of the rnc, would be pretty much fatal for the party, \" rubio said, though he added that many republicans will not vote for trump, either. But he's rooting for someone"

Its report claims jang and his five closest aides were set upon by a pack of hunting dogs that hadn't eaten in days as kim and his brother, flanked by 300 officials, watched; the report hasn't been verified.

Though kim has championed the execution, there's been no official word from pyongyang on how it was carried out. The times sees the publication of the account as an indication that beijing is none too pleased with north korea in the wake of the execution and \" no longer cares about its relations with the kim regime. \" this follows a previous report that claimed that two of jang's top men who were killed prior to his own death were executed using antiaircraft machine guns.",

And, though eater cites wikipedia in pointing out that starbucks may actually have bought the rights to the frappuccino when the chain bought another chain, the coffee connection, in 1994, a starbucks rep tells abc news, \" kenny has been a dear friend of starbucks since the beginning of the company and we are very appreciative of everyone, including kenny, who've been a part of the success of frappuccino. \" ( the rep also says two starbucks partners began working on what would be the frappuccino in 1993; it launched nationally two years later. ) as for how he became a starbucks investor, kenny said his uncle — possibly schultz's first investor, per kenny — suggested he invest and also try to sell his cds there. And in 1994, one of his albums became the first cd starbucks ever sold. \" that was the experiment, to see if they could sell music at the counter, and it worked really well. \" ( here's what a starbucks does to the neighborhood. )",

The pilot ejected safely. Marching on: pro-russian rebels backed by russian soldiers made more gains in the east, reports reuters.

He laid out his plan in methodical detail in a notebook he kept locked inside his guitar case, and police are convinced that john david ladue was poised to strike within weeks, reports the minneapolis star tribune. The 17-year-old had a three-stage plan: he would kill his parents and sister at home with a.22-caliber rifle, go to a rural spot to start a fire and draw first-responders, and finally head to waseco high school to kill as many people as he could with guns and homemade bombs. He planned to be killed himself by police. \"ladue planned on setting off pipe bombs and throwing molotov cocktails down the main wing corridors in the school, and then shooting and killing students as they rushed out of the corridors, \" says the criminal affidavit, reports nbc news. Police found an assault rifle with 400 rounds of ammo, a 9mm handgun, and at least a half-dozen bombs at the teen's storage unit and home. When officers confronted him in the storage unit, they say he basically taunted them by making them guess what he was doing before answering any questions. When an officer guessed he was making bombs, the teen agreed to go to the station. The plot unraveled thanks to a 21-year-old who called police when she saw ladue cut through her yard on his way to the storage unit and then act suspiciously outside it. \" the flowers i received today — they say,'thank you, from a grateful parent, ' \" chelsie schellhas tells nbc.",

        "summary": "Agnes nixon, the woman who helped create the soap opera as we know it, is dead at age 93. Nixon rose to prominence during the ' 60s and ' 70s, and npr describes her as one of the only powerful women in the entertainment industry during that era. Just like nixon herself, two of her more famous creations were well-loved and and long-lived: all my children ran for over four decades, while one life to live aired for 44 seasons. Both ended in 2011. Nixon was well-known for using her shows to draw attention to controversial social issues. Her plots addressed everything from cancer to abortion to homosexuality, issues often elided by many tv shows of the era. As the new york times notes, susan lucci's character on all my children was the first on tv to have a legal abortion — in 1973, just after roe v. Wade. \" i wasn't trying to change the genre, i was just trying to write what i thought, what was interesting to me, \" nixon told npr in 2010. The washington post asserts that she \" quietly made soap operas relevant, \" noting that a story line she wrote about a guiding light character's uterine cancer in 1962 is considered the first health plot in a daytime drama. Alumni of her shows have responded to nixon's death with an outpouring of love, support, and admiration, notes the los angeles times, which rounds up examples of the tributes to the woman known as \" amazing agnes. \" lucci, for instance, writes that she is \" devastated \" but \" forever grateful. \" nixon died of pneumonia, a complication of her parkinson's disease.",

            "Nearly six months after the death of robin williams, the academy award-winning actor and comedian, his widow and his children have become engaged in a contentious legal dispute over his estate. Court documents filed in december and january outline a bitter disagreement over money and property between the widow, susan schneider williams, who was mr. Williams's third wife, and zak, zelda and cody williams, the comedian's children from two previous marriages that ended in divorce. At stake is not only a portion of the wealth that mr. Williams accumulated in a film, television and stage career of some 40 years, but also cherished belongings that include his clothing, collectibles and personal photographs. In their court papers, both sides display keen interest in such memorabilia — everything from mr. Williams's bicycles to his collections of fossils and toys — as tangible, deeply personal reminders of the irrepressible, manic imagination that drove his performances as a comedian and actor."

The revelation means that the nsa's surveillance of americans is broader than was previously known: it's not just direct communication between an american and foreign targets that will be intercepted; it's any email or text about a such a target. As new york puts it, \" if you mention a terrorist's email address or phone number to a friend overseas, the nsa intends to find out. \" the nsa temporarily copies most cross-border communications, the times notes, and scans them. The expanded surveillance was mentioned, but largely overlooked, in information released by edward snowden in june. The aclu calls it \" dragnet surveillance \" that will cause ordinary people to hesitate before discussing sensitive topics or visiting controversial websites for fear they will be monitored. \"individually, these hesitations might appear to be inconsequential, but the accumulation of them over time will change citizens'relationship to one another and to the government. \" a former nsa general counsel cites an example of how it could be useful: say intel officials knew al-qaeda was using a particular phone number for a specific plot. \"if someone is sending that number out, chances are they are on the inside of the plot, and i want to find the people who are on the inside of the plot. \"",

It's a planet much like our own earth — about the same size, with the same mixture of rock and iron, and it orbits a star like our sun — except that kepler 78b is an infernal ball of fire. Located less than a million miles from its host star — that's 1 % of the distance between earth and our sun — its temperature ranges between 3,500 and 5,000 degrees fahrenheit. That's \" well above the temperature where rock melts, \" an astronomer tells the new york times. \" this is probably one of the most hellish planets that have been discovered yet. \" at 400 light-years from earth, the exoplanet was first spotted by the kepler spacecraft but astronomers on earth took a closer look at its light frequency to discover its orbit and mass. The findings, published in two studies in nature, show a planet that tightly orbits its sun — which from the surface would look 80 times larger than our sun — in just eight and a half hours. Adds an expert, per livescience: \" this planet is an enigma. It couldn't have formed in place because you can't form a planet inside a star. \" but while astronomers are baffled as to how the planet got there, they're fairly certain it shows friendlier earthlike planets are still out there.",

Ever since the real-life inspiration for indiana jones discovered a 3,700-year-old clay tablet called p322 in what is now iraq, historians and mathematicians have debated the meaning of the rows and columns of numbers on it, according to science. In 1945, mathematicians realized those numbers contained the pythagorean theorem for deducing the sides of a right triangle a millennium before pythagoras had coined it, abc reports. And in a study published thursday in historia mathematica, australian researchers believe they finally know what those mysterious numbers are: a trigonometric table more accurate than any we have now. \"it took me two years of looking at this and saying, 'i ' m sure it's trig, i ' m sure it's trig, but how? ' \" mathematician daniel mansfield tells science. One breakthrough came when mansfield realized the babylonians had a completely different way of looking at trigonometry than we do, one \" based on ratios, not angles and circles. \" he calls it \" fascinating \" and evidence of \" undoubted genius. \" and fellow researchers norman wildberger says p322 represents a \" simpler, more accurate \" version of trigonometry. While mansfield and wildberger say the babylonians could have used the tablet to build pyramids and palaces, critics say there's no evidence for that and call the study's conclusions \" highly speculative. \" ( those fortune cookie \" lucky numbers \" are definitely not unlucky. )",

View full image european pressphoto agency a handout photograph made available by quadratin shows several vehicles after been set on fire during fighting between mexican armed groups in tierra caliente, michoacán. Hundreds have fled their homes looking for a safer place. On tuesday, a helicopter belonging to the federal police was forced to make a hard landing after being shot at by gunmen from a drug cartel, the federal investigative agency, an arm of the attorney general's office, said tuesday. Three federal police were injured. The police didn't immediately have a number of casualties in the fighting between the gangs. But the lawlessness echoed the scene in tamaulipas state, where mass graves have recently been found. In another western mexican state, nayarit, a gunbattle this week left 28 dead. \" organized crime groups are fighting for control of the area, \" said genaro guizar,"

        "summary": "Investigators carrying out the grim task of recovering wreckage and human remains from the germanwings crash say they have not found an intact body — or the flight data recorder. To aid the search, an access road is being built to the remote site in the french alps, where forensic teams have so far recovered dna belonging to 78 of the 150 people killed, the guardian reports. Investigators say that so far, only the empty protective casing of the black box has been found. In other developments: co-pilot andreas lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the plane, but with the failure to find the flight's second black box, some in the aviation world are saying it is too early to rule out other causes. Airbus chairman tom enders slammed tv coverage of the crash in an interview published yesterday, deutsche welle reports. \" sometimes people there speculate, fantasize, and lie with no basis in fact, \" he said, calling some of the reporting \" outrageous nonsense \" that was a \" mockery of the victims. \" the cockpit voice recorder was recovered soon after the crash, and german newspaper bild has published what it says is a leaked transcript. Capt. Patrick sondenheimer ( also spelled sonderheimer or sondheimer, depending on the source ) can be heard pleading for lubitz to let him back in the cabin, shouting, \" open the goddamn door! \" as passengers scream minutes before impact, according to the transcript. A spokeswoman for france's accident investigation agency tells cnn that investigators are \" dismayed \" by the leak. Over the weekend, there were reports that lubitz suffered from a psychomatic illness that may have been linked to a vision problem. German newspapers, including bild, also reported that lubitz's girlfriend, a teacher, was pregnant and the couple had planned to marry, according to the independent. In lubitz's hometown of montabaur, the local lutheran pastor tells the ap that despite mounting evidence that lubitz caused the crash, he was still part of the community and the church is standing by his family. He says lubitz's mother is a part-time organist for the church and he knew the co-pilot as a teenager. \" this does not make sense. It is incomprehensible for me, for us, for everyone who knew her and the family, \" he says.",

Park's downfall started over ties with choi soon-sil, a close friend for decades embroiled in criminal controversies and secretly advising park — and who got into an argument with the eventual whistleblower over her daughter's pup, the new york times reports. Ko young-tae relayed his story at a parliamentary hearing last week, noting he and choi got into a tiff after she discovered the dog, which he'd been asked to walk, alone in his apartment while he was out golfing. He says that after they exchanged words, he decided to come forward with what he knew about choi and park. Ko, 40, an ex-member of the nation's fencing team and called choi's \" boy toy, \" had worked at a seoul \" host bar, \" where male workers entertain female customers with conversation and sexual services. The korea times says he reportedly met choi at one of those bars in 2006, though he testified last week he'd been introduced to her by a pal in 2012 ( and he denied at last week's hearing they were ever a couple, per the bbc ). Regardless of how they met or their official status, their relationship allowed him to reportedly get his hands on park's clothing choices for a trip overseas, as well as videotape of choi ordering two presidential aides around; he turned that footage over to a korean cable network, which aired it in october. \" she insulted me and acted as if her underlings were subhuman, \" he said in his testimony, adding that after the dog fight, she \" treated me like a slave, swearing at me many times, \" per the bbc.

            "Sen. Scott brown ( r-mass. ) thursday said he was glad that one of his democratic opponents, consumer advocate elizabeth warren, didn't \" take her clothes off \" to pay for college. Brown, who won his seat in a 2009 special election, was speaking on boston radio station wzlx. Brown made his comments when asked about warren's response in a debate tuesday to a question about how she paid for college. The question referenced the fact that brown posed nude for cosmopolitan in 1982 to make money. \" i kept my clothes on, \" warren said, adding that she borrowed money to go to a public university and worked a part-time job. \" have you officially responded to elizabeth warren's comment about how she didn't take her clothes off? \" the host asked brown wednesday. \" thank god! \" brown said, laughing. The host got a kick out it, too. \" that's what i said! i said, ' look, can you blame a good-looking guy for wanting to, you know … \" \" you know what, listen: bottom line is, you know, i didn't go to harvard, you know, i went to the school of hard knocks, and i did whatever i had to do to pay for school",

But those officials have faced a steep cost — $ 3,000 to exhume and rebury each body, as much as $ 21 million total. Now ummc is studying the cheaper alternative of handling those exhumations in-house, at a cost of $ 400,000 a year for at least eight years. It also would create a memorial that would preserve the remains with a visitors ' center and a lab that could be used to study the remains as well as the remnants of clothing and coffins.

But most skin cancers, including melanoma, are curable if caught and treated early, which is why doctors are anxious to id them asap. Researchers at king's college london say they've found a way to simplify counting one of the disease's prime markers — moles on the body — by using a \" proxy site \" that would allow physicians to more quickly pinpoint individuals who might need follow-up. Instead of going through the laborious process of counting moles on the entire body, doctors can count moles on the right arm, then use that figure to extrapolate to the number of moles on the body overall, per a press release. And there's a specific number that could serve as a warning sign: find more than 11 moles on that arm, and your risk of melanoma could be higher. Researchers looked at data from nearly 4,000 female caucasian twins who were studied between 1995 and 2003. They counted the number of moles on 17 body sites and found women who had at least seven moles on their right arm were nine times more likely to have at least 50 moles all over their body, and that when they had more than 11 moles on their right arm, they were likely to have more than 100 moles — signifying \" a drastically increased risk of skin cancer, \" per live science. The scientists then replicated the link between arm mole count and total body mole count using another study that included both males and females. \" the findings could have a significant impact for primary care, allowing gps to more accurately estimate the total number of moles in a patient extremely quickly via an easily accessible body part, \" the study's lead author says.

In a 5-4 decision along partisan lines tuesday, the supreme court granted a request from texas that it keep its congressional map, instituted by texas republicans in 2013, until the supreme court reviews a lower court's decision, reports the washington post. In a 2-1 decision, a three-judge panel ruled in august that two texas congressional districts and state house districts in four counties discriminated against minority voters, who typically vote for democrats, and therefore violated the constitution and voting rights act, per cnn. The supreme court gave no reason for its tuesday decision as is normal in such cases, per politico. Texas attorney general ken paxton had argued a different outcome would've put \" the electoral process in disarray \" since districts must be decided by oct. 1. A voting rights attorney representing the case's challengers says she is disappointed by the decision but hopes the court later \" realizes that texas sought to purposefully minimize the political power of voters of color. \" one law expert tells cnn, however, that \" the 5-4 split indicates that the map's challengers may have a tough time before the justices when the ( supreme ) court eventually hears this case. \" texas must first file an appeal to the august ruling.",

Media outlets were just beginning to assess it. You can read the document here, via the washington post. The white house move came over the fierce objections of the fbi and justice department, which have said the document prepared by republicans on the house intelligence committee is inaccurate and missing critical context, per the ap. The memo alleges that the fbi abused us government surveillance powers in its investigation into russian election interference. Trump, who has called the investigation a \" witch hunt, \" has supported the release of the memo in the apparent hopes that it could help undermine the probe being led by special counsel robert mueller. The president, dogged by the unrelenting investigation into his campaign's ties to russia, lashed out anew friday at the fbi and justice department as politically biased against republicans. \" the top leadership and investigators of the fbi and the justice department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of democrats and against republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.

He asked her to help him out as a friend and a wife, and defend him and the performance. He begged her to speak out for him and be there for him, \" the source says. \" she agreed to be the good wife after he begged and pleaded.

Ceo jamie dimon predicted that the loss could double within a few quarters, but the extra billion in trading losses has come in just four trading days as hedge funds and other investors smell blood and bet against the positions the bank is believed to have held to hedge against defaults. Jpmorgan's \" london whale \" trader was such a big player on the obscure indexes at the heart of the bank's problems that other traders are finding it easy to identify his trading positions, reuters notes. \" when someone is that big in the market, anonymity really goes out the window, \" notes a debt trader. The justice department and federal reserve are probing the losses, which experts say should never have been allowed to happen at a bank with government-backed deposits. But jpmorgan remains relatively healthy, despite the losses. The $ 3 billion loss would need to double to wipe out its profit from the second quarter of this year.",

The biggest u.s. Bank by assets has already disclosed $ 2 billion of paper losses, and chief executive jamie dimon said it could lose another $ 1 billion or more. The losses will grow, some traders say, because it appears jpmorgan has only sold a small portion of its position, leaving it vulnerable to price swings in a thinly traded market. Others are not so sure the bank will suffer much more than it already has. Dimon said the bank won't rashly sell, and any additional losses could arise throughout the year. A jpmorgan spokeswoman declined comment. The source of jpmorgan's problems is an obscure group of indexes that track the performance of corporate bonds. One of the indexes, the markit cdx na ig series 9 maturing in 2017, is essentially a portfolio of credit default swaps - basically contracts that protect against default by a borrower. This particular index is tied to the credit quality of 121 north american investment-grade bond issuers, including such names as kraft foods kft.n and wal-mart stores ( wmt.n ).

            "( cnn ) paul manafort, the former trump campaign chairman indicted on money laundering and other charges, filed a lawsuit challenging the broad authority of special counsel robert mueller and alleging the justice department violated the law in appointing mueller. The suit brought wednesday in us district court in washington, where manafort and another former trump campaign aide are charged, challenges mueller's decision to charge manafort with alleged crimes that they say have nothing to do with the 2016 campaign, but rather relate to lucrative lobbying work manafort and his deputy did for a former russia-friendly government in ukraine. That work ended in 2014, the suit says. Manafort and his deputy rick gates deny the allegations in the charges. The legal action represents a new tack in a broader effort by supporters of the president to push back on the special counsel. Some republicans have begun publicly calling for mueller's probe to be shut down.

The charges against him span from a may-to-july period of 1944 in which some 425,000 hungarian jews were sent to auschwitz. Most were immediately killed. \" someone said that 5,000 people were processed in 24 hours but i didn't verify this, \" he said. \" i didn't know. \" the 93-year-old's testimony came in response to questions from attorneys representing auschwitz survivors who have joined the trial as co-plaintiffs, as allowed under german law.

A newly declassified report discusses a us bomber that broke in half while flying over the state in january of that year, causing the two nuclear bombs it was carrying to plummet to the ground near goldsboro — and reveals that those bombs came much closer to detonation than was previously known. A parachute opened for one of the bombs, which landed intact; the safing pins that conducted power from a generator had been pulled, preventing a blast. Still, it completed five of the six steps to detonation, fox news reports. Had two cockpit wires touched as the plane disintegrated, it could have exploded. As for the second bomb, it landed in a freefall, which caused the switch to flip to the \" armed \" position, rt reports. What kept it from going off? \" the shock also damaged the switch contacts, which had to be intact for the weapon to detonate, \" the national security archive's bill burr explains. The incident was first mentioned in a book by eric schlosser last year, but the report confirms just how close the us came to devastation. As cnn points out, the mk39 bombs had an explosive yield of 3.8 megatons; the bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki were 0.01 and 0.02 megatons, respectively. \" there would have been a 100 % kill zone for 8.5 miles in every direction, \" said the air force weapons specialist tasked with disarming the bombs. \" by the slightest margin of chance, literally the failure of two wires to cross, a nuclear explosion was averted, \" secretary of defense robert mcnamara said at the time.

It has long been known that a pair of 4-megaton hydrogen bombs fell from a stricken b-52 as it broke apart over goldsboro, n.c., on jan 24, 1961, at the height of the cold war. But documents just released by the national security archive show that one bomb's arming mechanism switched from \" safe \" to \" armed \" on impact, while the other bomb fluttered under a parachute and would have exploded in the sky if two cockpit wires had happened to touch as the plane disintegrated. \" this bomb had the potential to make the one used in hiroshima look like the work of a cap gun, \" said eric schlosser, who obtained the documents approximately a year before they were obtained",
            "In a scenario that could've been extremely devastating, the united states narrowly averted a nuclear disaster in 1961 when an atomic bomb nearly detonated after falling out of a b-52 bomber that broke up in the sky. According to the washington post, the incident took place on january 21, 1961 – less than 20 years after nuclear bombs were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki – and is explained further in a recently declassified report published by the national security archives. When the us air force aircraft went into a tailspin and broke up, the two bombs fell towards goldsboro, north carolina. The parachute for one of the weapons failed to deploy, and the plane crash had actually pushed the bomb into \"armed \" mode by the time it hit the ground. Luckily for north carolina, the plane's destruction also damaged the switch necessary to trigger detonation \"the report implied that because",

            "One of two nuclear bombs that fell near raleigh, n.c., during a military accident more than 50 years ago came frighteningly close to detonating, newly-released documents reveal. It has long been known that a pair of 4-megaton hydrogen bombs fell from a stricken b-52 as it broke apart over goldsboro, n.c., on jan 24, 1961, at the height of the cold war. But documents just released by the national security archive show that one bomb's arming mechanism switched from \" safe \" to \" armed \" on impact, while the other bomb fluttered under a parachute and would have exploded in the sky if two cockpit wires had happened to touch as the plane disintegrated. \" this bomb had the potential to make the one used in hiroshima look like the work of a cap gun, \" said eric schlosser, who obtained the documents approximately a year before they were obtained",
            "In a scenario that could've been extremely devastating, the united states narrowly averted a nuclear disaster in 1961 when an atomic bomb nearly detonated after falling out of a b-52 bomber that broke up in the sky. According to the washington post, the incident took place on january 21, 1961 – less than 20 years after nuclear bombs were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki – and is explained further in a recently declassified report published by the national security archives. When the us air force aircraft went into a tailspin and broke up, the two bombs fell towards goldsboro, north carolina. The parachute for one of the weapons failed to deploy, and the plane crash had actually pushed the bomb into \"armed \" mode by the time it hit the ground. Luckily for north carolina, the plane's destruction also damaged the switch necessary to trigger detonation \"the report implied that because",

King- and queen-sized mattresses will be available, and those looking to indulge can expect to pay about $ 2,000, reports krem2. \"i think that some people will have a memory of it and want to revisit it just because they remember waterbeds and want to see how different they are, \" says hall. \"and then there ' ll be a generation, it ' ll be a total novelty for them. \" both stories recount the colorful history and risque marketing that helped make the original waterbeds popular 50 years ago.

Using a computer model, researchers have figured out how different features affect our first impressions, the bbc reports. The system is based on 1,000 pictures of different faces gathered online. In a study, researchers had respondents give opinions of these faces, focusing on approachability, dominance, and attractiveness. Researchers then created a mathematical model that translated those opinions into distinct facial measurements — an effort to \" crack the code of first impressions, \" notes smithsonian. The result was a computer program that generates cartoon faces intended to be dominant or submissive, approachable or off-putting. Another batch of study subjects offered their opinions of the cartoons — and they fit the computer's assessments. Masculine features and a good tan were apparently tied to the perception of dominance, while smiles were associated with approachability, livescience reports. Knowing how first impressions work may be particularly important these days: \" whereas in the past, we got to know people through meeting them in the flesh, increasingly, our first contact is online, and our first impressions are based on the images we provide on social media profiles, \" says the study's lead author.

You may think you can judge a person you just met based on his or her facial expressions. Does a smile indicate a person is easygoing or insincere? does squinting show concentration, or mistrust? first impressions of people — such as whether they are trustworthy, dominant or attractive — can develop from a glimpse as brief as 100 milliseconds or less. Brain scans suggests that such judgments are made automatically, probably outside of people's conscious control. But now, a computer system that mimics the human brain has identified which facial features most influence how others first perceive a person, scientists say.these findings could lead to computer programs that automatically see which photographs would help people give the best first",

You may think you can judge a person you just met based on his or her facial expressions. Does a smile indicate a person is easygoing or insincere? does squinting show concentration, or mistrust? first impressions of people — such as whether they are trustworthy, dominant or attractive — can develop from a glimpse as brief as 100 milliseconds or less. Brain scans suggests that such judgments are made automatically, probably outside of people's conscious control. But now, a computer system that mimics the human brain has identified which facial features most influence how others first perceive a person, scientists say.these findings could lead to computer programs that automatically see which photographs would help people give the best first",

Now scientists have modelled the specific physical attributes that underpin our first impressions. Small changes in the dimensions of a face can make it appear more trustworthy, dominant or attractive. The results, published in the journal pnas, could help film animators or anyone looking to create an instant impression on a social network. Dr tom hartley, a neuroscientist at the university of york and the study's senior author, said the work added mathematical detail to a well-known phenomenon. \" if people are forming these first impressions, just based on looking at somebody's face, what is it about the image of the face",
            "Within moments of meeting someone new, we've make both conscious and subconscious judgments about them — even if we're just looking at a picture of them. First impressions largely hinge on a person's facial features, which we judge on three major axes: dominance, approachability and attractiveness. Now, researchers publishing in proceedings of the national academy of sciences have revealed the underpinnings of our snap judgments. To create a model that could predict first impressions, the team first asked volunteers to record their first impression of more than 1,000 photos of people's faces, taken from the internet, the bbc reports. Then, the researchers built a model based on careful measurements of the faces combined with the respondents ' first impressions. To test how accurate their program was, the researchers used it to generate cartoon faces representing different first impressions of dominance, approachability and"

The stock was selling for about $ 30 a share at the market's open today, way above the $ 20 ipo price the company set last night, reports the wall street journal. Which means that, on paper anyway, the company is valued at about $ 20 billion. Part of the surge: institutional investors who got the stock early are flipping it for profit just as fast as they can, notes henry blodget at business insider. You won't catch him on the bandwagon: \" there is no way i would own groupon's stock for the next few quarters at this price, given the business transition groupon is currently undergoing, \" he writes. Sure, it's possible the stock might double, but from the looks of things, it could easily drop to $ 12 a share in the near future.",

That's a long way down from here. Groupon's near-term upside, meanwhile, appears to be limited, at least based on the company's fundamentals.

The suspect was released, but when he blew off a court hearing for the case, an arrest warrant was issued, with lucky whitehead's name on it. After the news came out, whitehead was released from his employer, with a team exec alluding to past incidents: \" we just decided it was time to go in a different direction. \" at a tuesday presser, cowboys coach jason garrett was asked about the mix-up and release — prince county police now say they \" regret the impact \" of their error, though they add they acted in \" good faith \" based on their information — but garrett simply repeated 10 times, in different variations, per espn: \" we made a decision we felt was in the best interest of the dallas cowboys. \" meanwhile, whitehead tells the dallas morning news he was \" blindsided. \" \" let's not sugarcoat anything.
