        "summary": "It's not every day that a tycoon's feces are tested by the authorities, but such is the case in thailand. Wildlife officials accuse premchai karnasuta — ranked by forbes as the country's 35th richest person, with an estimated net worth of $ 240 million — of poaching a leopard and other animals in the thungyai naresuan wildlife sanctuary in the country's west. Afp reports rangers came up on the camp set up by premchai, 63, and three others and found 10 carcasses of protected species, including a black leopard, a kalij pheasant, and a red muntjac. The group was arrested feb. 4, reports the bangkok post. Human excrement was found there, too, and officials say that its presence near the camp is noteworthy. They don't believe premchai — who made his fortune in construction and heads the italian-thai development company, which erected bangkok's suvarnabhumi airport — would have strayed far from the camp when nature called. It's not the only test being conducted: elephant tusks found in his bangkok home will be analyzed to determine whether they came from africa illegally. The post reports on another potential clue: two pellets identified via x-ray in the pheasant carcass will be tested and compared to the firearms taken from the suspects, who have denied the allegations. Premchai has a march 26 court date; wary of any potential attempt to flee, thailand's immigration checkpoints have been told to keep watch for him. ( this billionaire is involved in his own poop situation. )",

But not the school's students, whose investigation has since led to their new principal's resignation.

Robertson told the students she attended corllins before it lost accreditation, but she also \" presented incomplete answers, conflicting dates, and inconsistencies in her responses, \" the redux reported. Robertson, who has lived in dubai for the last two decades, told the kansas city star last week that she wouldn't comment on her credentials because the students ' \" concerns are not based on facts. \" it was \" red flags \" about her time in dubai that turned up during an electronic search of her name that prompted the students ' full investigation; initially, one of the student journalists was planning to write a standard article introducing the students to their new principal. Ultimately, robertson resigned tuesday after she was unable to verify an undergraduate degree she said she received from the university of tulsa, a redux adviser tells the post.

            "The republican establishment's latest triumph over tea party activists in a senate primary this year — pat roberts ' narrower-than-expected win over challenger milton wolf on tuesday night — came with a big lift from party headquarters in washington. Aided by national republican forces, roberts beat back wolf, a radiologist and distant cousin of president barack obama, effectively thwarting conservatives ' last, best hope to topple an incumbent gop senator in 2014. Assuming sen. Lamar alexander prevails in thursday's primary in tennessee — he's widely expected to defeat challenger joe carr — this will be the first cycle since 2008 when no incumbent republican senator lost renomination. Text size - + reset roberts defeated wolf, 48 percent to 41 percent; a pair of minor candidates combined for the remaining 11 percent of the vote. Largely overlooked in the race was the fact that the national republican senatorial committee is chaired by roberts ' kansas colleague, sen. Jerry moran, whom some far-right activists have threatened with a 2016 primary challenge. That made a win for the incumbent even more personal. ( full primary election results ) the party made a strategic decision to focus on turning out supporters in wolf's home base. Wolf lives and works in johnson county, in the suburbs of kansas city, and he needed a healthy margin there to offset roberts'strength",

            "So, here are some cheerful statistics for you: according to rainn, about 60 % of rapes aren't reported. In those cases, there's about a 51 % chance that the 40 % of reported rapes will have an arrest made. There's an 80 % chance of prosecution. And, given various factors including conviction and sentencing, there's only about a 16.3 % chance that someone who commits rape will serve time for that rape. Meaning: if we factor in the rapes that go unreported, only 6 % of rapists ever serve time. Ever. Gee, it sounds like making sure that rape accusations are taken seriously, and pursued to the full extent of the law, in all cases, is a pretty important issue, for progressives! meanwhile, here are some facts: a man has been accused of rape by two separate women. He fled the country in which he was accused. He is fighting extradition, so that he won't have to go back to that country and face charges — even though there are spectacularly low rates of conviction for accused rapists, he just doesn't think that he should have to go through the system, for whatever reason. And you know who's posting bail for him? fucking progressives. That '",

Fast-forward about three years, when a shocked cichewicz found out she was pregnant with reagan.

        "summary": "The chilean flag is annoyingly similar to texas'state flag, but that doesn't mean lone star staters should appropriate chile's flag emoji when they feel like expressing texas pride. That's the gist of what one state lawmaker is trying to push through via texas house concurrent resolution 75, which takes it upon itself to \" urge \" residents not to use the chilean icon online as a substitute for the non-existent texas flag emoji, the houston chronicle reports. In what the dallas morning news says belongs under the \" yes, it's a real bill \" umbrella, cypress ' conservative rep. Tom oliverson filed the resolution, noting, \" just as our flag could never fully embody the country of chile, neither can the chilean flag inspire feelings of pride and passion in the heart of a true texan. \" he points out that although both flags feature a similar red, white, and blue layout capped by that lone star, which often causes emoji-users to confuse chile's flag for texas ' flag, chile's colors are meant to symbolize \" sky, snow, and blood spilled while fighting for freedom, \" while texas ' hues are meant to represent \" loyalty, purity, and bravery. \" he also notes that the blue in his state's flag extends all the way down to the bottom, while chile's is cut off into a square about halfway down ( he even wants to get the #thebluegoesallthewaydown hashtag to pick up steam ). That said, oliverson concedes this bill isn't \" the most pressing issue \" the legislature has on its plate at the moment, per the morning news.

        "summary": "Houston made headlines first over the weekend, after a swastika was drawn in chalk on rice university's statue of william marsh rice on friday night. As cnn reports, it was the first of three such incidents to occur in different pockets of the country over a roughly 24-hour period. On saturday chicago police shared a video that depicts a man who drove up to the chicago loop synagogue and put two swastika stickers on its door. The sun-times reports police were alerted to the incident just after midnight saturday and found a window smashed. That evening, new york city subway riders came face-to-face with a slew of swastikas. Rider gregory locke describes getting on the no. 1 train and seeing swastikas written in sharpie on the windows. \" the train was silent as everyone stared at each other, uncomfortable and unsure what to do, \" he writes in a facebook post that includes photos of the incident; it has gone viral with more than 500,000 reactions. The new york times reports vile messages were also scrawled in the car, including \" jews belong in the oven. \" upon one rider's suggestion that hand sanitizer would undo the hate, \" i've never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and purel. Within about two minutes, all the nazi symbolism was gone. \" the times notes the nypd and metropolitan transportation authority received no reports of the vandalism, though the paper spoke with locke and another rider who gave their accounts. ( this man found swastikas in his boot prints. )",

The mess started when silicon valley venture capitalist marc andreessen took to twitter to criticize india's decision to block facebook from offering free but limited internet access to poor areas. At one point, when a critic likened andreessen's position to \" internet colonialism, \" he shot back, \" anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the indian people for decades. Why stop now? \" recounts the wall street journal. That sentiment drew widespread condemnation and prompted mark zuckerberg himself to quickly distance himself from it. And in a series of tweets, andreessen apologized for his \" ill-informed and ill-advised comment. \" on his facebook page, zuckerberg used stronger language, describing the tweet as \" deeply unsettling \" and making clear that the company \" strongly \" rejects it. The controversy revolves around a program called free basics. As cnet explains, an indian court declared that the concept violated net neutrality rules because it would have provided free access to the internet but only to a limited number of services. The controversy \" comes at an inopportune time \" for facebook, which wants to establish a bigger presence in the country but now needs a new strategy after the misstep with free basics, notes the new york times. As for andreessen, \" i will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge and experience than me, \" he wrote.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / updated by jessica spitz of the world's 100 highest-paid athletes in 2018, not one was a woman. Forbes released its annual list of top paid athletes on tuesday, highlighting the monster earnings of superstars across all sports, with boxer floyd mayweather topping the list at $ 275 million. Nba players make up a majority of the list, followed by football and baseball players. But 2018 was the first time in eight years that not a single woman has been included on the list — not even serena williams, one of the most accomplished and well-known athletes in history. She, along with fellow tennis players maria sharapova and li na, have made the list in recent years. According to forbes, williams most likely lost her spot on the list because she had a baby last year, and therefore was unable to earn as much prize money as she has in years past. She was the top-earning female athlete in 2018 at $ 18 million, but fell nearly $ 5 million short of the $ 22.9 million cutoff for the top 100. The pay gap in sports has been an especially pressing issue in recent years, as several women's teams have initiated campaigns advocating for gender pay equity. The u.s. Women's national soccer team has largely led the charge on this front, succeeding in securing a new collective bargaining agreement in 2017 after a year of arguing its case publicly. The women had argued that players for the men's national team earned far more than they did despite comparable work. Around the same time, the u.s. Women's national hockey team also reached an agreement with usa hockey to end a wage dispute. But, seeing as no women were able to clear the bar to make the forbes top 100 list this year, the problem is clearly nowhere near solved, female athletes said. Former soccer star abby wambach has devoted her retirement to advocating for equal pay in sports. In a recent speech at the barnard college commencement, she noted that she and her male peers had \"left it all on the field for decades with the same ferocity, talent and commitment. \" \" but our"

Forbes released its annual list of top paid athletes on tuesday, highlighting the monster earnings of superstars across all sports, with boxer floyd mayweather topping the list at $ 275 million. Nba players make up a majority of the list, followed by football and baseball players. But 2018 was the first time in eight years that not a single woman has been included on the list — not even serena williams, one of the most accomplished and well-known athletes in history. She, along with fellow tennis players maria sharapova and li na, have made the list in recent years. According to forbes, williams most likely lost her spot on the list because she had a baby last year, and therefore was unable to earn as much prize money as she has in years past. She was the top-earning female athlete in 2018 at $ 18 million, but fell nearly $ 5 million short of the $ 22.9 million cutoff for the top 100. The pay gap in sports has been an especially pressing issue in recent years, as several women's teams have initiated campaigns advocating for gender pay equity. The u.s. Women's national soccer team has largely led the charge on this front, succeeding in securing a new collective bargaining agreement in 2017 after a year of arguing its case publicly. The women had argued that players for the men's national team earned far more than they did despite comparable work. Around the same time, the u.s. Women's national hockey team also reached an agreement with usa hockey to end a wage dispute. But, seeing as no women were able to clear the bar to make the forbes top 100 list this year, the problem is clearly nowhere near solved, female athletes said. Former soccer star abby wambach has devoted her retirement to advocating for equal pay in sports. In a recent speech at the barnard college commencement, she noted that she and her male peers had \"left it all on the field for decades with the same ferocity, talent and commitment. \" \" but our"

        "summary": "The brock turner controversy rumbles on: a defendant from a very different background than the former stanford student received a much harsher sentence from the same judge in a similar case, the guardian reports. According to court records, santa clara county superior court judge aaron persky oversaw a plea deal earlier this year involving raul ramirez, a 32-year-old man from el salvador who sexually assaulted his female roommate. Ramirez, who needed an interpreter in court, agreed to plead guilty in a deal that will see him spend three years in state prison, while turner will spend just six months in county jail. Critics say that if persky had treated ramirez as leniently as he treated turner, a white 20-year-old, the latino man would have ended up with a much lighter sentence or even have avoided prison. The deal \" shows that turner got consideration not available to other defendants who aren't as privileged, \" says michele landis dauber, a stanford professor leading a campaign to recall persky, who's a former stanford student. Persky's days on the bench may be numbered — a recent poll found that 66 % of people in santa clara county would vote for his recall, palo alto online reports — but a group of stanford law grads is urging dauber to reconsider the recall campaign, the stanford daily reports. In an open letter, they argue that it will be more effective to fight for \" educating future judges and jurors about the realities of sexual assault, or pressing for systemic changes in how these cases are handled. \" ( persky was removed from another sexual assault case earlier this month. )",

And by \" nothing, \" that means not obsessing over the daily fluctuations in oil prices, the elections, or even what janet yellen is up to — an approach that's rare among managers of large pension funds, the new york times noted last year in an article about edmundson. This laissez-faire tactic has served edmundson well: his system's returns over anywhere from one to 10 years are competitive, if not better, than the pension systems of other states, including the largest public one — california's. Even edmundson's desk looks like it's his first day on the job, with just basic office supplies, a few family pics, and a printer — no fancy bloomberg terminal to monitor real-time market info. Edmundson is able to kick back by keeping the system's stocks and bonds in low-cost index funds, though one investment strategy expert ( who held the job before edmundson ) concedes \" doing nothing is harder than it looks \" when it comes to showing such restraint. Edmundson's minimalist philosophy even carries over to lunch: he brings leftovers or a sandwich from home so he doesn't have to spend $ 10 each day. ( a typical steve edmundson day, in the wall street journal. )",

Now, a university of texas professor says the proof may be in the handwriting — and bad handwriting at that. In a paper to be published next month, douglas bruster compares the play's 1602 \" additional passages \" with a three-page handwriting sample believed to be the bard's held at the british library. What he found, per the new york times and ut at austin news: about two dozen similar spelling patterns ( for instance, \" sorow for \" sorrow \"; past-tense words that ended in \" t \", like \" wrapt \"; and one word spelled two ways, like \" allie \" and \" allye \" for \" alley \" ) and nine textual \" corruptions \" that he believes resulted from the printer misreading shakespeare's hand. He also thinks an awkward passage — so seemingly poorly written that it has been cited as evidence the lines couldn't have been crafted by shakespeare — is the result of another bad handwriting/printer error goof. Says bruster, \" this is the clinching evidence we need to admit the additional passages into the shakespeare canon. \" the times notes this would mark the first such addition since passages from edward iii ( also attributed to kyd ) were included in scholarly editions in the mid- ' 90s.

        "summary": "About 1 % of the us population ( around 3.2 million americans ) has a gambling disorder, per the national center for responsible gaming — and the atlantic tells the tragic story of one of those addicts and how a lawsuit took the entire industry to task for his death. Scott stevens was a successful ohio finance exec whose life started unraveling in 2006 after a trade show in vegas. For six years, his gambling habit spiraled out of control: he sneaked off to gamble when his wife thought he was working, embezzled nearly $ 4 million from his firm, and drained his family's savings — until the day in 2012 he decided to end his life. After his suicide, stacy started researching gambling addiction ( she hadn't even known about her husband's problem ) and filed suit against the west virginia casino where he was a regular, as well as the maker of the slot machines there. Experts relay how casinos track and target addicted gamblers, supply ready flows of cash via on-site atms, and offer plenty of perks to keep them coming back. But it's the modern-day slot machines themselves, with deceptive technology called virtual reel mapping, that seem to be designed to lull gamblers into a trance — or what the industry refers to as \" continuous gaming productivity \" — so they don't stop playing. While the casinos and machine manufacturers place the blame for gambling addictions on individuals, terry noffsinger, the lead attorney for the stevens suit, says these addictive machines are not due to \" negligence. It's intentional. \" stacy stevens lost her case in west virginia, but noffsinger believes the movement to hold casinos accountable for addicts will gain momentum, much like how the tobacco industry eventually paid for sickening its own customers. \" the public is learning more about it, \" he says.

Instead, he drove the 22 miles from their home in steubenville, ohio, to the mountaineer casino, just outside new cumberland, west virginia. He used the casino atm to check his bank-account balance: $ 13,400. He walked across the casino floor to his favorite slot machine in the high-limit area: triple stars, a three-reel game that cost $ 10 a spin. Maybe this time it would pay out enough to save him. It didn't. He spent the next four hours burning through $ 13,000 from the account, plugging any winnings back into the machine, until he had only $ 4,000 left. Around noon, he gave up.",

What's more, the academy's executive branch is 98 % white and its public relations branch is 95 % white. Meanwhile, about 87 % of lead actors, 87 % of directors, and 92 % of writers for the top 163 films of 2014 were white, according to a new ucla study, per the washington post. \" what doesn't interest them is the current black experience or black culture, \" filmmaker rod lurie says of the academy, which hands out its annual honors on sunday. \" a movie like straight outta compton doesn't stand a chance. \" the ucla study also found that women directed only 3 % of 2014's major films.

David benoit and shayndi raice have details on the news hub. Photo: reuters. Facebook inc. Took eight years to stage one of the most anticipated initial public offerings ever. The anticlimax came friday, as wall street bankers struggled to prevent the newly minted stock from ending its first day with a loss. The stock had been widely predicted to soar on its first day. Instead, up until the closing moments of the trading session, facebook's underwriters battled to keep the stock from slipping below its offering price of $ 38 a share. Such a stumble would have been a significant embarrassment, particularly for a prominent new issue like facebook, the most heavily traded ipo of all time. In the end"

The paper says it was contacted by a source at panamanian law firm mossack fonseca who felt a \" very strong moral impulse \" to expose the tax evasion and money laundering the firm facilitated with its creation of thousands of offshore shell companies. In other coverage: panama's president juan carlos varela, apparently unhappy with his country's name appearing in headlines about financial crimes all over the world, has promised to boost transparency and clean up the industry, the bbc reports. He says the country will bring in international experts to recommend changes. The guardian looks at how the scandal has exposed china's \" red nobility \" — wealthy families connected to the communist party. Prominent figures named in the papers include the brother-in-law of president xi jinping. Unsurprisingly, the scandal is not being reported in china, and censors have been trying to scrub every mention of it from social media. The cbc looks at how the wealth revealed in the leak is just a fraction of what an analyst calls \" absolutely astonishing, mind-boggling amounts of money \" tied up in offshore funds. Estimates run as high as $ 31 trillion, or 13 % of global wealth, much of which is being kept in offshore funds to cheat governments out of tax revenue — or to hide the plunder of national resources. The new york times looks at the history of the mossack fonseca firm and its role in panama's economy. Co-founder ramon fonseca had been trying to expand his role in the country's government, claiming he wanted to improve the nation's human rights record. At the atlantic, brooke harrington examines the legal issues involved and concludes that the real scandal isn't the law-breaking — it's that so much of what mossack fonseca did was perfectly legal.",

She tells today that the car company sent 25-year-old employee john goodlett to her home to pick up her and the 11-month-old babies and bring them to the office.

Vincent was so touched that she took a photo of him holding the baby and posted it online, where the image quickly went viral ( it's got more than 25,000 shares on her facebook page ). There's a reason goodlett may have felt a special kinship with the little ones: he has a twin sister. \" just like any sibling, one moment we got each other's back, one moment we're yelling at each other's throats, \" he tells today. \" but … it's a natural love. \" vincent, meanwhile, has started a #beajohn hashtag, noting, \" this world would be a better place if we all would just be a john. \" enterprise is doing its part: after getting wind of goodlett's interaction with vincent, it bought the mom a double stroller and made a donation to the boys &amp; girls club where goodlett spent time when he was a kid ( he turned down a gift card for himself ). \" i ' m still blown away, \" he tells today. \" it's kind of shocking to see the world took it as such a big motion.

        "summary": "Goop is getting called out again. Gwyneth paltrow's lifestyle site should be investigated by california regulators, according to the watchdog group truth in advertising. Tina announced on its website this week that it has compiled more than 50 instances of goop claiming, directly or indirectly, that certain products \" treat, cure, prevent, alleviate the symptoms of, or reduce the risk of developing a number of ailments, \" fortune reports. Those products, of course, are either sold by or promoted by goop, but goop doesn't have the scientific evidence legally required to make such claims about the products, per tina. The watchdog group has submitted a complaint letter to two of the california food, drug, and medical device task force's district attorneys requesting enforcement. A goop spokesperson reached out to buzzfeed ( which has helpfully compiled some of the products tina takes issue with, including a crystal said to treat infertility, hair treatments for depression, and a vaginal egg to prevent uterus slipping ) to say that tina's claims are \" misleading... Unsubstantiated and unfounded. \" goop was also recently called out by nasa over body stickers supposedly containing spacesuit material, and soon after, a san francisco ob-gyn made headlines when she called out goop for promoting the aforementioned vaginal eggs, among other things. In fact, dr. Jen gunter's posts about goop spurred the website to issue a defense, with team goop writing: \" as women, we chafe at the idea that we are not intelligent enough to read something and take what serves us, and leave what does not. We simply want information; we want autonomy over our health. \"",

Abc news reports that the transgender soldier released from prison earlier this year posted a photo thursday to her social media accounts that shows her smiling at the beach in a red one-piece swimsuit, with the caption, \" guess this is what freedom looks like. \" the picture was taken by celebrity photographer annie leibovitz, who documented manning for an article appearing in the september issue of vogue. In that interview, manning talks about how she's adjusting to being out of jail, her regrets that she didn't come out as transgender earlier in her life, and her future plans, which may or may not include running for political office. \" my goal is to use these next six months to figure out where i want to go, \" she notes. Online reaction to the vogue coverage has been mixed, cbs news notes, with some offering support and others blasting the magazine for highlighting both a transgender woman and someone who many believe should still be behind bars. \" this ugly whatever should be in prison, forever, \" one non-fan tweeted, to which manning replied, \" and here i am, \" accompanied by her trademark slew of positive emojis. The conservative national review also weighed in, with a column by david french that asks: \" if bradley manning had stayed bradley manning, would he be basking in celebrity, enjoying fawning photo shoots? \" the guardian notes that manning's appearance in vogue isn't the magazine's first transgender presence: models hari nef and andreja pejic have both appeared in its pages, and model valentina sampaio has graced the cover of the publication's french version.",

The chicago tribune reports coleman, whose conviction for a 1994 rape and murder was overturned in november after dna evidence cleared him, would often watch his former groundskeeping colleagues taking care of the rain-delay tarp on tv in prison, and once released, he talked fondly about his old role at the stadium. \" i'd wake up in the morning proud to go to work, \" he tells the tribune. \" i loved it. \" when the white sox got wind of his desire to return, they called him in for an interview, and to coleman's delight he got the gig, which started monday, per cbs news. The head groundskeeper greeted him with: \" i saved your spot for you. I knew you'd be back, \" per the tribune. As for the white sox, they said in a statement, \" we're grateful that after more than two decades, justice has been carried out for nevest. It has been a long time, but we're thrilled that we have the opportunity to welcome him back to the white sox family. \" coleman, who kept his mind occupied in prison by reading the game of thrones and harry potter books, among others, is now looking forward to spending time with his kids ( whom he left on the outside when they were babies ) and grandkids and getting used to all the changes at the park. And he's done looking back at the past, per cbs chicago. \" if i ' m happy, everybody else will be happy, \" he says. \" i don't have time to be miserable, you know? \"",

It took a while to confirm because police were cautious about approaching the vehicle. It also appears that he acted alone, contrary to earlier police reports that up to four people were involved. Police chief david brown said the man identified himself as james boulware and blamed police for \" accusing him of being a terrorist \" and causing him to lose custody of his son. He allegedly opened fire on police headquarters with automatic weapons about 12: 30am and left two explosive devices near the building. One of them, described as a pipe bomb, detonated as an explosives robot moved it, but nobody was injured. Authorities say the gunman led police on a chase to a fast-food parking lot, where he holed up in his van and claimed it was rigged with bombs.

Getting rid of the johnson amendment is part of trump's emerging \" agenda of religious nationalism, \" in which the president is linking being american with being christian, the atlantic reports.

One such reason is that it would allow political parties and candidates to \" funnel campaign donations through tax-exempt churches \" with no oversight. While the johnson amendment is wildly unpopular with the religious right, that's not necessarily the case elsewhere, the independent reports. A survey last year found 79 % of people didn't think pastors should endorse candidates. And some religious leaders believe churches would be hurt by entering the partisan world of politics.

        "summary": "A celebrity chef has spent tens of thousands of dollars to quietly change the name of his manhattan restaurant after he discovered its meaning had racial undertones. Per the new york times, tom colicchio, the lead judge on bravo's top chef, originally called his eatery in the new york city's financial district fowler &amp; wells, named after publishers samuel wells and brothers lorenzo and orson fowler, whose building rested on the same site as colicchio's restaurant in the mid-1800s. However, a little digging by colicchio's team after they'd already named the restaurant revealed \" facts about [ the fowlers ' and wells ' ] beliefs that go against everything we stand for, \" per a statement cited by page six. More specifically, the fowlers and wells were advocates of phrenology, the study of the shape and size of the skull, which many in the 19th century believed to be an indicator of one's mental abilities — and which was often used to \" prove \" african-americans were mentally inferior and to justify slavery ( at least one of the fowler brothers had eyebrow-raising thoughts on this ). Colicchio, who's an outspoken liberal on social media, said that although his team incorporated the concept of phrenology into the restaurant's theme ( including on the bar's menu ), they didn't initially realize quite how bad the practice's roots could be. Once they made this discovery, they went about coming up with a new name and reworking logos, signage, business cards, and menus to match. The restaurant's new name: temple court, named after the building it's housed in.",

A new ucla study suggests a link, though researchers emphasized that more research needs to be done to confirm what's actually happening. Still, the findings \" could raise questions about whether people with acne should take vitamin b12 supplements, \" observes live science. It seems that the vitamin changes the way skin bacteria behaves, which promotes inflammation, which in turn leads to pimples. Some people are more vulnerable than others. \" this study does present some compelling evidence suggesting that supplementation with b12 can cause or exacerbate acne in a subset of individuals, \" says a co-author of the study. She emphasizes that the research shows correlation, not causation. While previous studies have linked the vitamin to acne flareups, this is the first to provide details on how it interacts on a molecular level with bacteria, especially propionibacterium acnes.

Elizabeth warren last week, is going to have to tighten his belt a little this year: he will forfeit his bonus, part of his salary, and $ 41 million in stock awards over the fake-account scandal that saw the sacking of 5,300 employees, cnn reports. In addition, stumpf will work for free while the company conducts an investigation. The bank's board of directors also says carrie tolstedt, who headed the retail division where workers created the phony accounts, will forfeit at least $ 19 million of the $ 125 million she was going to leave the company with at the end of the year, and will not receive severance or a bonus for 2016. The announcement comes as wells fargo is set to go before the house financial services committee on thursday. The board says it is launching an independent investigation into how millions of accounts were created without the permission of customers, the bbc reports. Wells fargo was fined $ 185 million over the scandal and the washington post describes the board's cash clawback as \" by far the most aggressive and public effort \" since the 2008 financial crisis to punish bank chiefs for misconduct — although stumpf still has the estimated $ 161 million he received in bonuses over the five years the scam took place, and tolstedt received $ 60 million over the same period.

Chromodoris reticulata is the first creature known to have what they're calling a \" disposable penis. \" other creatures discard their sex organ post-copulation, but they don't re-grow it.

The studied slugs were seen to mate three times in a row, 24 hours apart each time; it's not clear if the penis could regenerate once again, perhaps months later. The evolutionary purpose? scientists aren't quite sure, but they say the purpose of the first sex act may be to remove any sperm left by a previous partner. The disposable penis is far from the slugs ' only sexual quirk: the penises are equipped with spines that could help with the removal of prior sperm, afp reports.

Knox's memoir is a vivid personal account of the difficulties of prison life in italy, complete with claims about inappropriate behaviour by staff. But knox herself once painted a different picture. Other documents - including writings knox penned in her own hand while incarcerated, case files and state department records - conjure up quite another impression of a very different knox, one who was more sanguine about her experience. \" the prison staff are really nice, \" wrote knox in her personal prison diary, which was eventually published in italy under the title amanda and the others.

In the book, knox according to the daily mail, writes that prison guard raffaele argiro would summon her for \" chitchats \" alone in his office at night. Knox reportedly expands on letters she wrote to friends obtained by british tabloids, saying the guard was fixated on the topic of sex, asking about her partners and if she would have sex with him. \" i was so surprised and scandalized, \" knox was quoted writing in the memoir, according to the daily mail. Her memoir, \" waiting to be heard, \" published by harpercollins, will be released april 30. Argiro has since retired and denies the allegations.

            "Amanda knox and prison life a primetime television interview and a new book have put amanda knox's experience of prison life in italy back under the spotlight. But do these accounts tally with what she said at the time? in the weeks leading up to publication of amanda knox's memoir, waiting to be heard, descriptions of her four years in a perugia women's prison as a \" trauma in an italian hellhole of sex and debauchery \" - as the national enquirer put it - have become increasingly lurid. Knox's memoir is a vivid personal account of the difficulties of prison life in italy, complete with claims about inappropriate behaviour by staff. But knox herself once painted a different picture. Other documents - including writings knox penned in her own hand while incarcerated, case files and state department records - conjure up quite another impression of a very different knox, one who was more sanguine about her experience. \" the prison staff are really nice, \" wrote knox in her personal prison diary, which was eventually published in italy under the title amanda and the others.

            "In her soon-to-be released memoir, amanda knox will reportedly claim that she was sexually harassed by prison guards during her four years at italy's capanne prison. In the book, knox according to the daily mail, writes that prison guard raffaele argiro would summon her for \" chitchats \" alone in his office at night. Knox reportedly expands on letters she wrote to friends obtained by british tabloids, saying the guard was fixated on the topic of sex, asking about her partners and if she would have sex with him. \" i was so surprised and scandalized, \" knox was quoted writing in the memoir, according to the daily mail. Her memoir, \" waiting to be heard, \" published by harpercollins, will be released april 30. Argiro has since retired and denies the allegations.

But today, secondhand narratives and hand gestures may give way to words straight out of the boston marathon bomber's mouth during his sentencing, nbc news reports. Although defense lawyers are mum, the will-he-or-won't-he question has set off a debate over whether it's a smart idea for him to vocalize, say, his motives or apologies to victims ' families, as the los angeles times suggests. The lawyer who defended timothy mcveigh, for one, thinks tsarnaev shouldn't talk. \" i would be very surprised if he speaks, \" he tells nbc. \" generally, i don't advise clients to make a statement unless they are articulate and it... Doesn't sound like it was written by lawyers. \" adds another defense attorney, \" i don't think there's anything to be gained by it at this point, \" he says. \" whatever would be said … would be viewed as too little, too late. \" but a law school prof tells cbs that tsarnaev could take a long view: while an apology won't affect his sentence, it could give him leverage if he seeks to have his death sentence commuted by the president. Conversely, he could use his sentencing as a platform, like zacarias moussaoui, who issued taunts at his 2006 sentencing for conspiring on the 9/11 attacks: \" god curse america. And god save osama bin laden. You will never get him. \" who will likely be speaking today: bombing victims and their families, who will have the chance to give impact statements, the times notes.

Corado as she was exiting the market and was in close proximity to atkins, \" moore said. \"ms. Corado ran back into the store and collapsed behind the manager's desk. \" according to moore, atkins ' car had slammed into a light pole outside the entrance of the trader joe's, located in the 2700 block of hyperion avenue.

The annual canadian ufo survey by winnipeg-based ufology research shows \" the second highest level of sightings that we've recorded since we started doing the survey back in the 1980s, \" with 1,267 across canada in 2015, rep chris rutkowski tells the cbc. Only 2012 had more, with 1,981 sightings. The provinces of alberta, saskatchewan, manitoba, nova scotia, and newfoundland each saw an increase in reports over 2014, but quebec outpaced them all, according to data from 17 sources, including transport canada and youtube. The province, which typically produces 5 % to 15 % of all ufo reports in canada, generated 35 % of reports in 2015, reports the canadian press. Montreal led canadian cities with 97 reports, followed by 78 in toronto, and 69 in vancouver. That doesn't mean there were that many unexplained cases; about 88 % of unidentifiable objects turn out to be stars, planets, airplanes, or helicopters, rutkowski says. Ufology research investigates the remaining cases — by visiting a site and talking to witnesses — to determine if a case is \" high quality. \" about 1 % to 3 % of cases fall into this group, rutkowski says. One of the perhaps not-so-high-quality ones: a resident in sainte-brigitte de laval, quebec, recalled seeing three 4-feet-tall \" humanoids \" with huge heads and \" big, black slanted eyes, \" and hearing a high-pitched hum. \" we're not saying the little grey guys are here, \" rutkowski tells ctv news. \" this is simply what people are reporting. \" ( aliens might also have a thing for florida. )",

        "summary": "The federal communications commission will vote on net neutrality today, after lengthy debate. Though the topic seems destined for the courts, the fcc's decision \" is going to be a benchmark, \" a researcher tells usa today. The board is expected to approve chairman tom wheeler's guidelines to regulate the internet like a utility, as president obama suggested. His proposal also labels broadband providers as \" common carriers \" under title ii of the telecommunications act, which means the fcc could prohibit paid prioritization for \" fast lanes, \" nbc news reports. What does that mean for you? \" all this ruling means is that there will be fcc jurisdiction to examine practices and hear complaints, \" a legal professor explains. He bats down claims that this is \" an all-or-nothing decision that will transform the internet, \" suggesting much is still to be determined. \" your broadband will still cost the same amount as it did before. \" essentially wheeler's rules would mean internet service providers must treat all traffic equally, which is why netflix — which claims almost 35 % of peak traffic in the us — supports the move. It can't be charged more for the bandwidth it uses. Companies like etsy, kickstarter, tumblr, and vimeo support rules similar to wheeler's. In the past, so did google. But nearly a decade after google and facebook first pushed for new rules, the search giant has urged the fcc to draft rules boosting investment in broadband internet networks, as have net neutrality opponents at&t and comcast, the wall street journal reports. An expert predicts the \" public utility-style regulations \" will \" create a tremendous amount of chaos \" for cable and internet companies, particularly when it comes to addressing congestion. They would have to ensure their practices of freeing up bandwidth are \" reasonable, \" npr reports. The rules also include what's called \" zero-rating, \" which is when an app or group of apps — for example t-mobile's music freedom plan — isn't counted against a user's data cap. Sounds like a bonus, right? \" that distorts competition, \" says one expert. Republicans generally consider wheeler's rules a government power grab. Congress could respond with legislation that undercuts wheeler's guidelines, but obama would likely veto.",
