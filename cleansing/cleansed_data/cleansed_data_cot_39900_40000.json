Oz defended himself last week on facebook, stating that his show \" [ provides ] multiple points of view, including mine which is offered without conflict of interest. That doesn't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts. \" one of those \" agendas \" is what the letter to columbia referred to as oz's \" baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops. \" oz clarified his beliefs in the facebook post, explaining, \" i do not claim that gmo foods are dangerous, but believe that they should be labeled like they are in most countries. \" oz is planning to dig into the credibility of some of the letter's authors via their links to a pro-gmo advocacy group, notes the show rep. He may have other explaining to do as well: vox published an article yesterday citing wikileaks-exposed emails between oz, his staff, and sony ( one of his show's producers ) in which oz's desire to promote sony health and fitness products appears to be a business-driven decision, not a health-driven one.

And now everyone from russian oligarchs to billionaires in dubai and china \" want an anglo person that telegraphs to their other equally wealthy friends that they can afford to do this. \" katz runs through a few lessons of butler school — for example, if your kid is sick, your boss, aka your \" principal, \" had better not ever know about it — as well as the cold hard cash involved; butlers can start at between $ 30,000 to $ 60,000, but many earn hundreds of thousands.

There are also archaeologists who have returned and made new discoveries at a key neanderthal site in iraqi kurdistan, one they describe as having \" iconic status in palaeolithic archaeology. \" shanidar cave's status was established following 1950s excavations by ralph solecki, a smithsonian institution archaeologist, live science reports. As modern-day archaeologists write in antiquity, he uncovered several neanderthal burials; the pollen contained in soil samples taken there was in 1975 proposed as evidence of flowers placed at the burials. Some five years ago, the kurdistan regional government suggested archaeologists return to shanidar. Initial fieldwork began in the summer 2014; interrupted by isis, two phases of excavation ultimately occurred in 2015. Those excavations, which \" focused on the location at which the earlier fieldwork discovered most of the neanderthal remains, \" yielded human bones ( probably from those previously unearthed remains ) and other \" ephemeral but persistent evidence for human activity, \" like ash and charcoal, from around 40,000 years ago. \" the emerging picture is of small groups making regular short-term visits for shelter and tool maintenance in extreme conditions, \" the article reads. Live science points to additional research on the cave: a pollen-focused scientific paper published in december that suggests the pollen in the cave may have actually been carried in by bees, disrupting the notion of burial flowers.

            "Neanderthal remains were found, along with a plinth of sediment, in shanidar cave in iraq. As the terrorist group isis is pushed out of northern iraq, archaeologists are resuming work in the region, making new discoveries and figuring out how to conserve archaeological sites and reclaim looted antiquities. Several discoveries, including new neanderthal skeletal remains, have been made at shanidar cave, a site in iraqi kurdistan that was inhabited by neanderthals more than 40,000 years ago. Additionally, though isis did destroy and loot a great number of sites, there are several ways for archaeologists, scientific institutions, governments and law enforcement agencies in north america and europe to help save the region's heritage, said dlshad marf zamua, a kurdish archaeologist and doctoral student at leiden university in the netherlands.

Princeton university professor marie luijendijk discovered a 1,500-year-old book called the \" gospel of the lots of mary \" and figured it would tell jesus ' life story or collect his sayings, livescience reports. Then she read its 37 oracles, a few of which mention jesus, and realized \" gospel \" was used in the original sense of \" good news. \" and like other \" lot books, \" it was designed to predict the future. The book's title \" is very significant, \" says luijendijk. It indicates the importance of predictions \" being [ seen ] as good news. Nobody who wants to know the future wants to hear bad news in a sense. \" she says the book's owner randomly selected oracles and interpreted them to predict the future. The text is inspired by mary, \" the mother of the lord jesus christ, she to whom gabriel the archangel brought the good news, \" the book says. Written in the egyptian language of coptic, the oracles include material from matthew, luke, proverbs, job, and psalms, and are \" christian in nature, \" the daily mail reports. They include advice like, \" if you are patient a little, the matter will prosper through the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob, \" and \" go forward immediately. This is a thing from god. \" remarkably, the book is just 3 inches by 2.7 inches, possibly to conceal it from church leaders who frowned on divination. The book was also inexpensive to produce, new historian notes, and appears much used, with ancient fingerprints still in the margins.

As he and two german researchers explain in a study published in evolution &amp; human behavior, \" evolutionary psychology states that sexual attractiveness has evolved to assess the reproductive qualities of a potential mate \" — and as such, past studies have looked at individual traits that have ties to things like fertility. In their study, the researchers set out with the hypothesis that attractiveness doesn't just stem from those parts but from \" the consistency of the whole appearance. \" a press release explains the set-up: participants viewed \" schematic point-light displays that depict a person using 15 moving dots. \" the dots gave participants a sense of both the person's body shape and their movements; that allowed the researchers to grade both the most attractive shapes and movement styles. They then made super-attractive hybrids by pairing the most attractive in both buckets. But participants found the hybrid walkers to be less attractive than the two individual walkers who made up the hybrid, troje explains in a blog post. \" we found that attractiveness depends on internal consistency — whether the movement and the shape match each other or not. \" if they don't, our visual system will respond negatively. One practical application of the results: \" to formulate advice to people who are working on improving their own appearance, \" says troje, who observes that what makes someone else good-looking may not work for you.

Cave biologist jean krejca stumbled across the creature, a millipede now known as illacme tobini, a decade ago inside lange cave in california's sequoia national park, the washington post reports. A study on the new millipede species was finally published last week in zookeys. According to live science, illacme tobini is only the second species in the genus illacme. Illacme plenipes, whose 750 legs are the most in the world, was discovered in california in 1928. Illacme tobini now has the second most legs. \" i never would have expected that a second species of the leggiest animal on the planet would be discovered in a cave 150 miles away, \" a millipede expert who examined the creature says in a press release. In addition to its 414 legs and four penises ( called gonopods ), illacme tobini features 200 glands that secrete what is likely a defensive poison, hairs that produce silk, and \" peculiar \" mouth parts of undetermined purpose. Despite searching for another illacme tobini for years, researchers have come up empty handed.

And while the data is based largely on subjective parental reports, it turns out that even after accounting for a wide range of variables, including socioeconomic status, obesity, smoking, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol, the higher a child's stress score, the greater his or her risk for hardened arteries down the road, reports the new york times. \" i think that economic conditions are important here, \" lead author dr. Markus juonala tells the times, which notes that the long follow-up time and careful control give the study \" considerable strength. \" while the precise mechanism at play remains unclear, the authors say that stress during childhood just might trigger changes in \" metabolic functioning and inflammation, \" reports reuters, and these in turn might lead to calcium deposits in the arteries. Of course, it's also possible that happier kids simply develop healthier habits from a young age, such as balanced diets and exercise, which are already known to lower one's heart attack risk.

The agent is a friend of jill kelley, the tampa woman who complained about threatening emails from petraeus ' mistress paula broadwell — and who has now been linked to the american commander in afghanistan. Officials say they barred the agent from the investigation amid fears that he had become obsessed with it and had become personally involved. Even before the investigation began, the agent allegedly sent shirtless photos of himself to kelley, who is married. After the agent was sidelined, officials say, he contacted a republican member of congress ( perhaps eric cantor? ) because he feared the fbi was going to sweep the investigation under the rug. Other news in the case that keeps on giving: fbi agents searched broadwell's home in north carolina last night, reuters reports. Agents were seen leaving the house carrying evidence boxes and a computer. Even after the fbi uncovered the affair, petraeus planned to keep his job, hoping it would stay secret, advisers who served with him in iraq tell the washington post. \" but once he knew it was going to go public, he thought that resigning was the right thing to do, \" says peter mansoor, the general's executive officer during the iraq surge. Broadwell's father claims his daughter is the victim of character assassination. \" this is about something else entirely, and the truth will come out, \" he tells the new york daily news. \" there is a lot more that is going to come out.

Other takeaways from last night: but santorum shouldn't gloat just yet, writes james hohmann for politico, because this pesky thing called reality is also in the room. \" he doesn't have the money or infrastructure to keep up with romney in new hampshire, and he hasn't been in south carolina since nov. 12. \" sure, he ' ll grab a ton of headlines this week, but he needs to \" dramatically expand his campaign apparatus virtually overnight. \" the virtual tie between romney and santorum, with a strong third-place finish for ron paul, signals a long and messy fight ahead, meaning president obama is also a winner, notes andrew sullivan at the daily beast. The headline of philip rucker's piece in the washington post sums up his sentiment: \" romney leaves iowa with same problems he had in 2008. \" he has a tough time reeling in more republicans, truly connecting with voters, and calming \" suspicions about his avowed conservatism. \" but romney could get a tiny bit of a break in the conservatism-analysis department, notes the new york times. Last night's entrance polls revealed that voters favored \" a candidate who can beat obama \" slightly over \" a true conservative. \" and iowa itself surprised, writes maggie haberman for politico. Though 57 % of caucusgoers are evangelical, more than half the vote went to mormon or catholic candidates. As for the ames straw poll, writes haberman, ames-winner michele bachmann's dismal showing doesn't \" bode well for the future of the straw poll as a mandatory stop for candidates competing in iowa. \"",

Though it was previously believed the turtle shell began forming 220 million years ago, the study of an older ancestor — a round-bellied south african reptile called eunotosaurus — now dates the shell back another 40 million years, putting it before the jurassic era to the permian period, discovery reports. \" eunotosaurus is a good transitional fossil which bridges the morphological gap between turtles and other reptiles, \" lead author dr. Tyler lyson tells the bbc, adding that it took millions of years for the modern shell — a fusion of ribs, vertebrae and shoulder bones — to evolve. It was previously thought that eunotosaurus could help explain the evolution, but the theory was thrown out in the 1960s, reports the los angeles times.

Another theory, however, argues that the shell is the result of a different transformation. Instead of forming from so-called osteoderms, the shell actually formed when the ribs of certain reptiles began to grow ever broader and straighter, losing their barrel-like curvature. ( watch a video animation of this transformation theory here and here. ) photos: 10 shocking facts about turtles now, in a paper published thursday in the journal current biology, researchers added fuel to that second theory by reexaming the fossil remains of a peculiar-looking south african reptile that existed 260 million years ago in the permian period.

Video: millions of turtles killed due to bycatch the shells began their transformation more than 260 million years ago in the permian period, said tyler lyson, of yale university and the smithsonian, in a press release. \"like other complex structures, the shell evolved over millions of years and was gradually modified into its present-day shape. \" the shell looks like just one solid shield, but because it's made up of multiple bones, it is formed through the fusion of the turtle's ribs and vertebrae. \"the reason, i think, that more animals don't form a shell via the broadening and eventually suturing together of the ribs is that the ribs of mammals and lizards are used to help ventilate the lungs, \" lyson said. \"if you incorporate your ribs into a protective shell, then you have to find a new way to breathe! \" he explained that turtles have done just that, with the help of a muscular sling"

Instead of forming from so-called osteoderms, the shell actually formed when the ribs of certain reptiles began to grow ever broader and straighter, losing their barrel-like curvature. ( watch a video animation of this transformation theory here and here. ) photos: 10 shocking facts about turtles now, in a paper published thursday in the journal current biology, researchers added fuel to that second theory by reexaming the fossil remains of a peculiar-looking south african reptile that existed 260 million years ago in the permian period. That creature -- eunotosaurus africanus -- had a lizard-like body with a broad, round midsection that looked as if it had swallowed a large frying pan. It also had short arms and legs. For many years eunotosaurus was considered to be an early ancestor to turtles, but was essentially stripped of that honor in the late 1960s and largely forgotten. Proponents of the dermal ossification theory had insisted the",
            "Turtle shells, which turn out to be complex structures made up of 50 bones, evolved long before dinosaurs roamed the earth, according to new research. Turtles and their shells now predate the jurassic period, according to a study in the latest issue of current biology. It's a body design that was built to last, representing millions of years of fine-tuning. Video: millions of turtles killed due to bycatch the shells began their transformation more than 260 million years ago in the permian period, said tyler lyson, of yale university and the smithsonian, in a press release. \"like other complex structures, the shell evolved over millions of years and was gradually modified into its present-day shape. \" the shell looks like just one solid shield, but because it's made up of multiple bones, it is formed through the fusion of the turtle's ribs and vertebrae. \"the reason, i think, that more animals don't form a shell via the broadening and eventually suturing together of the ribs is that the ribs of mammals and lizards are used to help ventilate the lungs, \" lyson said. \"if you incorporate your ribs into a protective shell, then you have to find a new way to breathe! \" he explained that turtles have done just that, with the help of a muscular sling"

        "summary": "The al-shabab militants who attacked a mall in nairobi last weekend didn't just kill their victims, they tortured them and mutilated their bodies, according to accounts in kenya's media rounded up by usa today. It makes for rough reading. The stories quote doctors and investigators who describe gouged eyes and dismembered bodies hanging from hooks. One doctor says every body suffered some kind of abuse. By the current count, the militants killed at least 67 people, and another 61 remain missing, reports ap. The missing are presumably still buried in the rubble that resulted when three floors of the mall collapsed during the army's counter-attack. Meanwhile, the bbc reports that the militants were able to launch such a well-armed assault because they had previously rented a shop in the mall and posed as business owners. In the weeks leading up to the attack, they were able to bring in hidden weapons via service elevators and stockpile them in the shop.",

        "summary": "Reddit is feeling generous: after raking in nearly $ 8.3 million in advertising revenue in 2014, the site has decided to \" support the goals and causes of the entire community \" by donating 10 % of that amount to 10 charities. The company made the announcement in a blog post, noting the $ 827,659.49 will be split evenly, so each charity will receive $ 82,765.95. Now here's the fun part: reddit users will help choose which charities get a check. The rules are designed to \" reduce any potential shenanigans \": anyone with a reddit account before 10am pst yesterday ( the announcement came at 10: 01 ) can vote a single time per charity, but for as many charities as he or she would like. Redditors can look up charities via the charity navigator database then vote on reddit's donate page. Voting wraps up wednesday. Mashable points out reddit's $ 8.3 million in ad revenue is rather measly compared to buzzfeed's earnings; that site passed the $ 100 million mark in 2014. ( per similarwb.com, reddit gets more traffic than buzzfeed. ) the discrepancy is probably due, at least in part, to reddit's tiny banner ads. Electronic frontier foundation, doctors without borders, npr, the wikimedia foundation, and internet archive were the most discussed charities on reddit yesterday, cnnmoney reported, and they remain that way today.

Project head dr. Andrew conrad is a molecular biologist known for developing a cheap hiv test, reports the bbc. \" what we are trying to do is change medicine from reactive and transactional to proactive and preventative, \" he said. The suite of nanoparticles could be programmed to, say, hunt down fatty plaques suggestive of an impending heart attack or stroke, or change color when in contact with potassium, high levels of which could suggest kidney disease. A wristband would take readings every day. For those worried about privacy, google went public because it is now seeking partnerships for what it calls \" prescriptive medical devices \" that will be subject to doctor-patient privileges.

In the nypd's telling, officers were responding to a complaint about a woman acting irrationally when they entered 66-year-old deborah danner's apartment around 6pm and found her naked and wielding scissors, per nbc new york. After sgt. Hugh barry convinced danner to drop the scissors, she picked up a wooden bat and \" attempted to strike \" him, leading the eight-year veteran to fire two shots, authorities say, per the new york daily news. Danner — whom police had encountered before — was hit twice in the torso and died at a nearby hospital. The nypd says it's investigating why barry — now on modified duty — didn't use the taser he was carrying. \" to me, it is very difficult to understand how a woman who is [ 66 ] years old and has emotional problems should have to die like this, \" says democratic state sen. Ruben diaz. The president of the nypd sergeants benevolent association, however, says the shooting was justified and that barry was only placed on modified duty as a \" political \" move. According to the new york post, danner — a black woman — spoke out about gun violence and racism on twitter and expressed support for black lives matter. \" how'd u like to move about w/a target on you because of the color of your skin? \" she wrote in july.",

            "Italy quake destroys £ 200m worth of cheese oriano caretti, the owner of parmigiano factory in san giovanni, inspects some ruined cheese an earthquake in northern italy has destroyed more than 300,000 wheels of cheese worth an estimated 250 million euros ( £ 200m ). The magnitude-6.0 earthquake killed at least six people, injured dozens and damaged historic buildings including a famed medieval castle early on sunday, waking terrified citizens and sending thousands running into the streets. The tremor has also devastated the region's cheese industry, destroying tonnes of parmesan and grana padano. The quake was italy's strongest in three years \" the earthquake was very strong and heavily damaged the structures of many warehouses as well as thousands of tonnes [ of the two cheeses ] \", said stefano berni, head of a consortium that protects the grana padano designation. \" it's a very heavy loss, but there have been no casualties, which is a great relief at this worrying time, \" he told the ansa news agency. The initial estimate of 250 million euros is \" very conservative \", mr berni said, adding that he hoped no further tremors would \" further aggravate the state of the already highly damaged and fragile structures \". A wheel of the cheese can weigh up to 40kgs ( 90lbs ), meaning up to thousands of tonnes",

Nabra's body was found in a pond near torres ' home, and the chief says police are awaiting the results of tests to determine whether she was sexually assaulted. \" we're doing a thorough investigation and that's something of concern to us, \" he says.",

In the new class-action suit, joyce kuhl is demanding her money back for a 2013 visit to seaworld in orlando. She also wants all other visitors reimbursed over the past four years, florida's statute of limitations for bringing a lawsuit. She alleges that the killer whales, or orcas, are drugged and kept in confining tanks that amount to \" chemical bathtubs. \" filed in federal court thursday by a gainesville-based attorney, her suit says those tubs give the intelligent mammals sunburn and kill them at an early age. What's more, the orcas are sometimes deprived of food, forced into incestuous inbreeding, and stored in ways that make them angry and violent, the suit says. Her attorney says kuhl is \" an ordinary animal lover \" who learned of the confinement after her visit: \" she would not have purchased her ticket had she known then what she subsequently found out, \" he says. Seaworld responded by saying it is committed to \" the health and well-being \" of its animals, and considered the suit a likely \" attempt by animal right extremists to use the courts to advance an anti-zoo agenda. \" indeed, kuhl is not alone: a similar lawsuit was filed in california last month, the sentinel reports, and alleged mistreatment of seaworld whales was detailed in the cnn documentary blackfish.

The 29-year-old suspect did not have any known links to the islamic state group and appeared to have acted alone, said queensland police deputy commissioner steve gollschewski, per the ap. Police were trying to determine whether the man had been motivated by extremism, or something else. \" we are not ruling out any motivations at this early stage, whether they be political or criminal, \" said gollschewski, adding that investigators are also looking into the suspect's mental health and history of drug use. The attack took place tuesday night at a hostel in the town of home hill. A 21-year-old british woman was found dead at the scene and a 30-year-old british man was hospitalized in critical condition. The third victim was treated and released. The assailant, a french national visiting australia, shouted \" allahu akbar \" — the arabic phrase meaning \" god is great \" — both during the attack and while being arrested by police, gollschewski said. He has not yet been charged. In the us, the fbi is investigating the double stabbing of a couple in roanoke, va., over the weekend in which the suspect yelled the same phrase, reports cbs news. Both victims were seriously wounded, and wasil farooqui, 20, is in custody. Police say he told them he was hearing voices before he attacked.",

Sources tell bloomberg that samsung rushed the galaxy note 7 to market to take advantage of what the company had discovered would be an unexciting iphone 7 from apple. The sources say suppliers were under pressure to quickly deliver new features for the note 7 — including a more powerful battery — which resulted in a production error at one supplier that caused faulty batteries, which were not uncovered during the rushed testing process. Reports of battery fires and explosions after the note 7 went on sale led to a global recall, which experts say was bungled by samsung. \" clearly, they missed something, \" says bloomberg analyst anthea lai. \" they were rushing to beat apple and they made a mistake. \" the debacle is believed to have wiped around $ 14 billion off samsung's market value, while apple's stock price is soaring despite what brian solomon at forbes calls a \" boring \" new iphone that offers slight refinements instead of eye-catching new features. \" it appears that more of the same, rather than top-of-the-line innovation, was the way to win this year, \" he writes.",

( see video here. ) \" but what is racist? \" kelly said. \" you truly do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface at halloween or a black person who puts on whiteface. That was ok when i was a kid, as long as you were dressing like a character. \" the albany times-union, which notes kelly moved to upstate new york when she was 9, reports kelly's guests included melissa rivers, nbc's jacob soboroff, and jenna bush hager — all white. Yahoo characterizes the three guests as chiming in to essentially say there are some lines you don't cross. Kelly then brought up a costume worn by real housewife of new york city luann de lesseps last year; she dressed as diana ross, and many felt her darkened makeup qualified as blackface. Said kelly, \" people said that was racist and i don't know, i felt like, who doesn't love diana ross? she wanted to look like diana ross for one day. I don't know how that got racist on halloween. \" she later added, \" i can't keep up with the number of people we're offending just by being normal people. \" padma lakshmi was among the offended, tweeting, \" i cannot believe the ignorance on this in 2018. You are on national television. You have a responsibility to educate yourself on social issues @megynkelly. This is so damaging. \" kelly later apologized to colleagues in an internal email, per the hollywood reporter; she said she's \" never been a ' pc ' kind of person \" but that she now realizes blackface \" is indeed wrong. \" ( this celeb once wore blackface for halloween. )",

The key line: \" while passengers may generally decline [ advanced imaging technology ] screening in favor of physical screening, tsa may direct mandatory ait screening for some passengers. \" as a tsa rep tells time, you can still make the request to opt out, but \" some passengers will still be required to undergo ait screenings as warranted by security considerations in order to safeguard transportation security. \" the update gives no specifics regarding what would warrant such a forced screening.

He observes that the policy update seems tied to the rollout of automatic target recognition ( atr ) software, which \" replaces the individual's image with that of a generic figure \" rather than an essentially naked one. The institution of the software isn't exactly new, however: congress ordered it in 2012, and npr reported that effective may 16, 2013, all ait scanners had atr capability.

        "summary": "So how much juice does it take for google to power all its searches and servers, not to mention email and youtube? lots, as in 2.3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2010, reports the san jose mercury news. That's enough for about 200,000 houses. The company released its energy figures for the first time today, and one exec tells the new york times that while the number sounds enormous, critics should consider that google helps the world save energy, too. People can search by computer, for example, rather than driving to the library. Google also notes that each user only consumes about 180 watt-hours a month — which is equivalent to running a 60-watt light bulb for three hours. The company also says it emitted 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide last year, which the mercury news equates to the emissions of 70,000 americans. Google says about a quarter of its energy comes from renewable fuels, and it plans to raise that to 30 % this year. \" the disclosure marks an important turning point for the high-tech industry, \" writes heather clancy at zdnet. \" as many companies aspire to win out in the cloud services movement — cisco, ibm, dell, microsoft and hewlett-packard are just a few of the companies drooling after google's marketshare — the ability to manage electricity consumption and energy-efficiency will be a critical operational measure. \"",

            "There's a long tradition of films treating scrappy and lively older characters as a punchline, as if it's inherently hilarious to see anyone above 65 swear, drink, fight, acknowledge sex with positivity or enthusiasm, or otherwise indicate they're still alive below the neck. It's taken the aging of the american population and the splintering of the film industry into specialty audiences to move cinema away from that trend. Old folks behaving badly are still a go-to stereotype, but they're being offset by films like paul weitz's grandma, which touches on the sentiment and scorn of big, prestige-like family dramas like august: osage county, but only in the lightest way possible. On paper, grandma may sound like a drama, given how it revolves around lost loves, life lessons, and unwanted pregnancy. In practice, it finds the human side of the cussin ' granny character, and turns serious issues and sappy plot developments into a playful, only mildly melancholy romp. A good chunk of the credit goes to lily tomlin, in her first starring film role since 1988's big business. Tomlin plays aging poet and \"unemployed academic \" elle reid, a septuagenarian who's snappish and so ruled by defensive pride that she's alienated many of the people in her life, including her estranged daughter judy ( marcia gay harden ) and her current lover olivia ( judy greer ). When her teenage granddaughter sage ( julia garner ) turns up on her doorstep, looking for the money for an abortion she scheduled for the end of the day, elle doesn't have the cash, and has just cut up her credit cards to make yet another reckless statement about her independence and freedom. So the two of them go on a road trip, hitting up elle's old acquaintances for the money. Along the way, tomlin makes it abundantly, entertainingly clear that elle has never taken shit from anyone in her life. And she wants sage to follow suit, especially when dealing with her sneering, immature baby daddy ( nat wolff ). But the same attitude that's brought elle freedom and some artistic respect has also left a trail of broken relationships behind her, and grandma is more about revealing the limits and regrets of complete independence than about sage's situation, or even the evolving relationship between grandmother and granddaughter.

            "There's a long tradition of films treating scrappy and lively older characters as a punchline, as if it's inherently hilarious to see anyone above 65 swear, drink, fight, acknowledge sex with positivity or enthusiasm, or otherwise indicate they're still alive below the neck. It's taken the aging of the american population and the splintering of the film industry into specialty audiences to move cinema away from that trend. Old folks behaving badly are still a go-to stereotype, but they're being offset by films like paul weitz's grandma, which touches on the sentiment and scorn of big, prestige-like family dramas like august: osage county, but only in the lightest way possible. On paper, grandma may sound like a drama, given how it revolves around lost loves, life lessons, and unwanted pregnancy. In practice, it finds the human side of the cussin ' granny character, and turns serious issues and sappy plot developments into a playful, only mildly melancholy romp.

The couple say they're going to look into how to handle the caterer, but that right now they're more concerned about looking after their family. ( worried about salmonella? stop kissing chickens. )",

        "summary": "California is embroiled in a water crisis that's right out of chinatown. In the midst of a devastating drought, state officials cut off water to thousands of acres of central valley farmland — in part to protect smelt fish from swimming into pumps and going extinct. Not surprisingly, farmers and conservatives have been stewing since water supplied by the sacramento-san joaquin river delta was reduced in 2007. \" this is a classic tale of activist government run amok — and, too, of the peculiarly suicidal instincts that rich and educated societies exhibit when they reach maturity, \" writes charles cooke in a biting national review piece that calls environmentalism a \" religion. \" governor jerry brown took action last month by declaring a drought emergency, giving himself the option of sending water to farmers and endangering the smelt, kcet reports. But it's not all about fish: the delta also needs to pump fresh water into the pacific ( and not to farmers ) to keep seawater from intruding and ruining the delta's water supply, says the la times editorial board. Seeking a workaround, brown wants to spend $ 15 billion on two 30-mile water tunnels that would run under the delta and supply farmland, reports bloomberg. Left-wing critics ( see indybay ) are slamming him for that plan as well — which leaves things where, exactly? \" we're looking at just a huge amount of land going unplanted, \" a water-district rep tells the san francisco chronicle. \" and i don't think we've seen the full effect of it yet. \"",

        "summary": "If you think preschool is all about playing with dolls and blocks, think again. There's a growing trend toward more rigorous, scholarly preschools — and a new study supports the idea, finding that children who attended a year at an \" academic-oriented \" preschool were performing better academically by the end of kindergarten. Specifically, the study out of uc berkeley found that children whose preschool experiences were more focused on academics were performing as if they had, on average, at least two and a half more months of learning in literacy and math than their peers by the end of their kindergarten year, the new york times reports. The biggest gains were seen in black children from low-income families, who saw the equivalent of a four-month gain over children who stayed home through age 4, medical xpress reports. While many advocates for the importance of free play and socialization — not to mention parents — are concerned about the idea of preschools eschewing child-directed activities, the study found that children who attended preschools that were more focused on kindergarten readiness did not suffer socially or emotionally. And such preschools do still offer playtime: new york city's taxpayer-funded preschools, for example, must offer two hours a day of play. \" if you can combine creative play with rich language, formal conversations, and math concepts, that's more likely to yield the cognitive gains we observed, \" lead author bruce fuller notes. The times points out that the study did not follow children past kindergarten; other research has found that similar academic gains \" fade out \" over time, making it hard to close the achievement gap between poor and middle-class students.",

Educators and scholars have long agreed that quality preschool yields sustained benefits for poor children, while earlier studies revealed disappointing results from average pre-k programs for middle-class peers. Today's results, reported in the journal of applied developmental psychology, tracked 6,150 youngsters from birth to 5 years of age. Researchers discovered marked gains when middle-class kids attend preschool classrooms where teachers spend considerably more time on oral language, pre-literacy skills and knowledge of mathematical concepts. The early surge powered by pre-k continues to lift children from both middle-class and low-income homes during the kindergarten year, researchers said. These facets of cognitive development accelerate by at least three months for the average child nationwide after attending an academic-oriented preschool for one year, compared with children who remain at home during these early years. \" many parents worry about undue pressure on young children when instantly pressed by teachers to tackle academic skills, \" fuller said. \" but preschool teachers who purposefully advance these proficiencies yield stronger gains for middle-class youngsters. \" black students in pre-k the study finds that academic preschool packs the strongest punch for black children from low-income families, accelerating their pre-literacy and math skills by over four months in knowledge of math concepts, relative to peers who remain at home through age 4.

This time around, the big sticking point is how long such a resolution would last: conservatives want a six-month deal that would push the larger money fight into 2017, under a new president and congress. Democrats, however, are pushing for a shorter resolution that would require a lame-duck congress to return after the election to hammer out a spending package. Beyond that, a slew of other issues are on the agenda, most notably funding to curb the spread of zika, reports politico. Before the summer recess, a bill stalled in the senate as democrats objected to gop demands that money come out of ebola research and obamacare. Since then, zika has begun to spread locally in florida, ramping up pressure to act, notes usa today.

She says she was very close to her brother, who told her he was battling depression before he died; indeed, the names of three psychiatrists she suggested to him were in his wallet when his body was found in a park outside washington dc. \" i did not see a suicide coming, yet when i was told that vince was dead i knew that he had killed himself. Never for a minute have i doubted that, \" and \" these outrageous suggestions have caused our family untold pain, \" she adds. \" this is scurrilous enough coming from right-wing political operatives who have peddled conspiracy theories about vince's death for more than two decades.

Then @fansince09, who tells nbc 10 he wishes to remain anonymous, picked up the trail, retweeting bennett's photo and receiving responses identifying both the restaurant and some of the suspects shown in the picture.
