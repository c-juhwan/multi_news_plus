On his show yesterday morning, daly noted how lucky it was that many of the passengers on the flight were \" well-trained dudes \" on their way to a security conference. Unfortunately, he went on: \" with my luck, it would be like,'this is the flight going to [ the gay pride parade ] in san francisco. I mean, that would be my colleagues. \" then, making his voice sound — as tmz puts it — \" like a gay stereotype, \" daly continued, \" uh, we're headed down to vegas for the floral convention. \" he later apologized on twitter, posting, \" this morning on my radio show i attempted to make fun of myself &amp; offended others by mistake. I sincerely apologize. \" he also gave a statement to glaad, reiterating that he is \" an ally of the lgbt community \" and that that community is full of courageous individuals. The huffington post notes that mark bingham, one of the united 93 passengers who stormed the cockpit on 9/11, was openly gay; bingham's mother responded to the controversy, telling tmz in no uncertain terms that her son was a tough rugby player who ran with the bulls in pamplona.

The woman was assisted by the flight crew and a doctor and nurse who were aboard, airline spokeswoman emily samuels said. She said hopefully the airline has a new customer for life. Paramedics boarded the aircraft and the mother and newborn, whose names have not been released, were taken to a hospital in good condition, los angeles fire department spokesman erik scott said. The aircraft was taken out of service for cleaning and the other passengers went on to phoenix aboard another plane, arriving more than two hours behind schedule. Passenger julie dafoe said she and kurt reed were sitting next to the woman. \" one of the nurses that helped she said she was like walking around pacing in the airport so they were thinking she was having contractions, \" dafoe told phoenix tv station ktvk. \" all of a sudden i heard a baby cry like a gurgling sound, like a baby that had too much milk or whatever and i ' m like'there's no babies on this flight, ' \" reed said.

        "summary": "Guards at rikers island don't just neglect the mentally ill or let them bake to death, they also routinely brutally beat them, often without suffering any repercussions, a new york times investigation has discovered. The times uncovered a secret report compiled by a city department this year that found that 129 rikers inmates suffered \" serious injuries \" in altercations with staff members over an 11-month span last year; 77 % of those inmates had a mental health diagnosis. In most cases, the inmates were beaten while handcuffed. The times investigated the incidents individually, and offer some disturbing details: when guards found jose bautista trying to hang himself, they saved him, but then allegedly threw him to the ground and punched him with such force that they perforated his bowel. It was one of five beatings noted in the report that followed a suicide attempt. Bautista needed emergency surgery, but guards took nine hours to drive him to the hospital — which is only 15 minutes away. When andre lane threw water or urine at guards, they allegedly handcuffed him to a gurney, wheeled him to a clinic that wasn't monitored by security cameras, and beat him so violently that the walls and cabinets were covered with his blood. After brian mack complained that guards were stealing inmates ' food, a guard captain allegedly hit him in the eye with his radio, while another officer punched him in the jaw. He came away with a broken eye socket and jaw. Correction officials said he'd been in a fight with another inmate, but investigators noted no such fight was logged in prison records. None of the guards involved in any of the cases have faced criminal charges — or even administrative ones. Rikers has been under pressure to reform its treatment of mentally ill inmates — in january, for example, it announced it would stop putting the \" seriously mentally ill \" in solitary, though the times notes that classification applies to a small segment of the population. Last week an oversight board said the newly-appointed city jail commissioner had in june illegally sent as many as 47 mentally ill rikers inmates to solitary without consulting clinicians, the ap reports.",

She says the company is cooperating with the order to stop accepting medical waste while new procedures are put in place, the ap reports.

Catholic newspaper, published by the roman archdiocese of vancouver, reported that \"aborted and miscarried children \" are \"ending up in an oregon waste-to-energy plant, likely mixed with everyday trash \" and \"incinerated to provide electricity to the people of marion county. \" the account was picked up by media outlets in oregon, where it spread like wildfire. It caught marion county's two elected commissioners off guard; both expressed disgust and said steps are being taken to end the alleged practice. \"we are outraged and appalled that this material could be included in medical waste received at our facility, \" councillor janet carlson said in a statement wednesday. \"we did not know this practice was occurring until today. \" the two councillors held an emergency meeting thursday morning and agreed that the county would temporarily stop all biomedical waste shipments to its waste-to-energy incinerator, and would amend local ordinances to bar any future shipments that could contain fetal tissue.

Yahoo blames \" state-sponsored actors \" for the personal data that was stolen in 2014 but only recently discovered to have been stolen, the ap reports. Yahoo had previously been expected to confirm an estimated 200 million users were affected. Motherboard spoke in august to a hacker known as \" peace \" who claimed to be hawking data from 200 million yahoo accounts on the dark web, per business insider. The hacker said the data — which includes usernames, passwords, security questions and answers, birth dates, phone numbers, and email addresses — was likely stolen in 2012. No such breach was ever made public. However, yahoo said at the time that it was \" aware of the claim \" and was investigating. Confirmation of such a breach — which hacked.com says could be \" the largest data breach on record \" — could now affect yahoo's $ 4.8 billion sale to verizon. Not only is it a pain for verizon, but yahoo shareholders will be concerned about a possible drop in the company's sale price. The sources tell recode that government investigations and legal action in regards to breach are expected. In its confirmation of the breach, yahoo suggested users change their passwords, assuming they haven't already done so since 2014.",

        "summary": "Lane-splitting — where motorcycles pass other cars in traffic by cruising in between — might soon be legal in at least one state: california. The state's assembly unanimously passed a bill thursday giving the california highway patrol authority to create guidelines for the practice, reports the los angeles times. The bill, which would make california the first state to give the official ok to lane-splitting, has kept things vague, simply defining what a \" lane \" is and directing the chp to fill in the blanks. The bill's original wording would've allowed the practice only if a motorcycle was going less than 50mph and not more than 15mph faster than traffic, but the specifics were later removed before passage. While critics say lane-splitting is dangerous for all involved, advocates cite several reasons for why zipping between cars is desirable: it saves fuel for bikers, cuts down on traffic congestion, and even keeps motorcycles from overheating, as the bikes aren't designed to sit in traffic, one biker tells kcra. \" it definitely makes a motorized two-wheeler the second fastest way around the city in rush hour by a long shot, \" andrew collins writes for jalopnik. And it could even spare motorcyclists from injury: nj.com says motorcycle groups and a university of california at berkeley study point out that stop-and-go traffic can be dangerous for bikers because drivers in big cars may not spot them.",

        "summary": "Under a pending merger, vca animal hospitals will come under the ownership of mars, inc. Not only is it a bit strange for a chain of veterinary care facilities to be owned by a candy and packaged foods company — it's more than a bit concerning for pet owners, the consumerist reports. Mars already bought the banfield pet hospital chain back in 2007, and big problems have been reported with those veterinary offices, which are connected to petsmart stores. Most troubling is banfield's practice of selling pet owners pricey \" pet wellness plans, \" which sound like pet health insurance but aren't. Owners are charged a monthly fee in exchange for receiving discounts on veterinary services, and are often told by banfield representatives that they can cancel at any time after the first year without incurring a fee. The problem? that's not exactly true. Once the plan renews, members are on the hook for another full year of monthly payments — or, yes, a fee if they cancel, as one angry plan owner once explained to the consumerist. Other pet owners have been distressed to learn that, should their pet die mid-plan year, they're also still on the hook for the rest of that year's monthly payments. There's also the fact that, as bloomberg businessweek recently revealed, those same wellness plans include services that not all animals need — and even some that could put them at risk, like annual teeth cleanings under general anesthesia. Mars will be adding 800 vca hospitals to its 900 or so banfield locations, and will also be merging with another large veterinary chain, bluepearl veterinary partners, meaning a huge number of veterinary facilities could soon be adopting similar practices. As for why mars is getting into the vet care industry? it's becoming a huge moneymaker, with pet owners willing to put out big bucks for their animals.",

        "summary": "The friend in the car with walter scott right before scott's police-shooting death on april 4 says he ' ll \" never know why he ran. \" but scott's family says it's because he was afraid of being thrown in jail again for not paying child support, according to the new york times — and based on the times'report, he may have had ample reason for that fear. The paper notes challenges faced by supposed \" deadbeat \" dads who are actually living in poverty, running up their support tabs because they couldn't afford them in the first place, then getting thrown in jail and losing their jobs — all while the debt builds. \" parents who are truly destitute go to jail over and over again for child support debt simply because they're poor, \" a lawyer for the southern center for human rights tells the times. Part of the problem right from the start: support orders are often crafted using not a parent's actual income, but what's called \" imputed \" income, which gauges how much the parent would earn at a full-time job that made minimum wage. Indeed, a 2007 urban institute study cited by the times notes that 70 % of child support debt in nine states was owed by individuals who reported $ 10,000 or less in income ( some didn't report any income ). The commissioner of the federal office of child support enforcement tells the times that jail time was originally intended for people purposely hiding funds — not parents who couldn't afford the payments. Even a supreme court ruling from 2011 meant to prevent this from happening can prove futile, because some defendants can't afford lawyers to help them out, advocates say. In scott's case, it was a cycle he apparently couldn't break. In a 2003 article on a new program in the post and courier, scott noted he had enrolled in the program, meant to help dads catch up on payments, and voluntarily turned himself in for more jail time. \" this whole time in jail, my child support is still going up, \" he said at the time. \" i said, ' man, you got four kids depending on you. … you got to get it together. \"",

The 37-year-old native of indonesia duped scores of millionaires — including bill koch, brother of the political koch brothers — and other wine aficionados over the years until his scheme unraveled. He now faces up to 40 years in prison on fraud convictions, including one for using his fake wine as collateral to get a $ 3 million loan, reports the wall street journal. Kurniawan, who has lived in los angeles for several years, knew his stuff. He didn't pour two-buck-chuck into fancy bottles and try to pass it off.

The bottles were from the years 1945 and 1949, except \" it is an appellation we started in 1982, \" ponsot explained to the jury, per the afp. \" i feel no pity for him, \" said ponsot after the verdict in manhattan. \" it's good justice. \" ( click for the story of an elaborate wine heist that fell apart. )",

Kaepernick was one of the nfl's biggest stories in 2016 after he decided to kneel during the national anthem to protest and raise awareness against racial injustice in america. Players throughout the league have continued protesting during this nfl season. As explained by sports illustrated's michael mccann in march, \" collusion occurs when two or more teams, or the league and at least one team, join to deprive a player of a contractually earned right.

As first reported by bleacher report's mike freeman, the former san francisco 49ers quarterback has filed a grievance against the owners for collusion under the latest collective bargaining agreement. Mike florio of pro football talk reported on what kaepernick is looking to accomplish with the grievance: \" per a source with knowledge of the situation, kaepernick wants to trigger termination of the current collective bargaining agreement. \" article 69, section 2 of the cba allows for the agreement to be terminated prematurely in the event of proof of collusion. Under article 17, section 16( c ) of the cba, termination can arise from only one incident of collusion involving only one player if there is clear and convincing evidence of a violation. \" kaepernick's attorney,"

        "summary": "Saudi arabia's 30-year-old deputy crown prince is looking toward the future with his new \" vision 2030 \" plan — a plan that includes pulling the kingdom out of its overreliance on oil and leaning more on non-oil investment to transform it into a global power, reuters reports. \" we will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of commodity price volatility or external markets, \" prince mohammed bin salman told reporters gathered at a riyadh palace monday. Per gulf news, he had earlier appeared in a televised al-arabiya interview, noting, \" we have developed a case of oil addiction in saudi arabia. … i think by 2020, if oil stops we can survive. \" also part of his new blueprint: including women more in the economy and appealing to young people who face the prospect of not finding jobs. The bbc notes that more than 70 % of the kingdom's revenue came from oil in 2015, but oil prices continue to plummet and saudi arabia's economy is suffering, per al jazeera. In broad terms, the prince would like to bring up its public investment fund ( pif ) capital to $ 2 trillion from $ 160 billion. Prince mohammed says 5 % of shares in the aramco oil company would be sold to fund this $ 2 trillion nest ( which he thinks could even rise to $ 3 trillion ). Also part of the prince's game plan: setting up a \" green card \" system in five years'time to expedite muslim and arab expatriates ' long-term residency, as well as boosting affordable housing and getting more women into the workforce. The founder of the dc-based saudi american public relations affairs committee tells al jazeera this a \" visionary move, \" but another saudi expert says he's seen similar changes proposed before. \" to implement some of these, you need the collaboration of society, \" he notes. \" for example, if you want to increase the empowerment of women, you need to liberalize your society. \" ( what the prince didn't bring up: the kingdom's possible ties to 9/11. )",

In fact, experts today balk at naming any point-like object \" the smallest \" because of a theoretical conundrum: when you're infinitely near any point, the forces that act on it turn infinitely huge. Hoping to duck the whole \" infinite \" thing, scientists have invented novel theories around it, physicist andy parker tells space.com. Among the work-arounds: superstring theory, which posits that particles are like loopy strings rather than points. This would enable scientists to get infinitely close to something but always remain further from another part of it. \" space-time foam, \" the theory that space is made of pixels or grains. This would keeps particles from being infinitely close to each other, because the grain create a natural distance. One candidate for \" smallest \" that parker discounts is black hole singularities, although he concedes that \" they are maybe a million million times or even more than that smaller than the distances we've seen so far. \" see excerpts of parker's bbc show on the subject.",

No elaboration was given. But that hasn't kept a religious bent out of discussion of and reactions to nabra hassanen's killing. As the washington post puts it, \" the issue was on the minds of many muslims on sunday. \" the latest: a police press release on the arrest of darwin martinez torres, 22, says that as nabra and her friends were walking \" they got into a dispute with a man in a car. \" torres allegedly exited his car and assaulted nabra. \" her friends could not find her and police were called to help. \" the washington post talks to nabra's mother, who says a detective said her daughter was beaten with a metal bat. \" i lost my daughter, my first reason for happiness, \" she said sunday night. Wusa9 reports police did recover a bat. \" what investigators told the father and the mother, he hit her in the head and put her in the car and he threw her in the water, \" the richmond times-dispatch quotes a rep for the family as saying. It reports martinez torres directed officers to the pond, which it says is near the apartment he lives in. The post fills in some details on the girls ' movements, reporting that during the final 10 days of the holy month of ramadan, the all dulles area muslim society ( adams ) in sterling, va., holds extra prayers at midnight and 2am. The mosque is one of the largest in the us, and adams ' co-chair says it is commonplace for members to have a meal at mcdonald's or ihop in advance of the day's fast, which runs from sunrise to sunset. Nabra, a rising high school junior, was not particularly religious and did not usually wear muslim dress, according to her mother, who lent nabra an abaya to wear to the mosque saturday night. She tells the post a detective told her that during the fateful encounter, nabra tripped over the long garment and fell.

        "summary": "It's been 43 years since gilbert hyatt applied for a patent on a machinery-control system, and 35 years since he sought a patent related to liquid crystal displays. It takes an average of about two years to get patent approval — but hyatt hasn't received it on either invention, bloomberg reports, meaning his could be the oldest pending applications in existence. The 76-year-old inventor filed a lawsuit in january to push for official action. The problem, according to an outside patent lawyer: the patent office fears embarrassment. Officials worry they \" might issue a broad patent that would have a sweeping impact on the technology sector. Rather than be embarrassed, they're just bottling it up. \" it's unclear how much such patents could cost technology companies. A previous patent hyatt received — which took a mere 20 years to be granted — shocked the tech industry by initially offering him a claim on most microprocessors. The patent was later partially revoked, but hyatt still made a likely $ 150 million after a deal with dutch firm royal philips nv to license that and other patents, bloomberg notes. Now he says he's getting the \" runaround \" from the patent office. At the huffington post, an economist puts him among \" the fathers of the microcomputer \" and calls him a prime example of the challenges faced by independent inventors. But a tech historian notes that \" innovations are more than ideas... If gilbert hyatt had never existed, i believe the microprocessor would have developed in the same way that it did. \"",

            "Washington has always loved a good war. Ronald reagan revived the nation's war on drugs, george w. Bush declared a war on terror, and, more recently, some of the conservatives in congress have even accused liberals of waging a war on christmas. But there is one war that has failed to grab the headlines it deserves. I ' m speaking of the ongoing war on inventors. Our founding fathers understood that american innovation would lead to american jobs, so they created the u.s. Patent system to nurture and protect small inventors. Their strategy paid off, and our nation's economy grew into an international juggernaut because of independent innovators like alexander graham bell, thomas edison, eli whitney, and the wright brothers. Their modern-day counterparts are in danger. For the last few years, a small handful of global high-tech corporations and their allies on capitol hill have been doing everything they can to put small inventors out of business. Ironically, many of these companies -- google, apple, microsoft, and others -- were themselves started in inventors ' garages, but now they live in constant fear that their business models will be disrupted by unpredictable technologies developed by little guys. Since the late 1990s, these high-tech multinationals have been stripping garage inventors of their rights under the guise of \" patent reform, \""

But as bad as things are, could murdoch himself end up in jail? one analyst, writing in the independent, thinks so. Andreas whittam smith explains that phone hackers were convicted under britain's regulation of investigatory powers act 2000, and he points readers to section 79 of the act, which states that when a corporate body commits \" an offense under any provision of this act... With the consent or connivance of... A director, manager, secretary or other similar officer, he ( as well as the body corporate ) shall be guilty of that offense and liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. \" perhaps murdoch is a stretch, but observers think rebekah brooks, the chief executive of news international and former editor at news of the world, could be in danger of criminal charges.

        "summary": "The fight for the alabama senate seat previously vacated by attorney general jeff sessions looks poised to go to a sept. 26 runoff election. But the path there officially kicks off tuesday with a special election primary in which three candidates will be weeded down to two. President trump and mitch mcconnell are backing former alabama attorney general luther strange, who was temporarily appointed to the seat after sessions left it. But it's former alabama chief justice roy moore who's the apparent front-runner, with strange and us rep. Mo brooks trailing behind, reports politico. More: a candidate needs 50 % of the vote to take the seat, which most news outlets agree is unlikely to happen. Moore leads in some polls at around 35 % support, with strange and brooks in a close race for second. Should trump's favorite be eliminated, it \" will call into question the influence of trump's support in a reliably republican state, \" per politico. Not that trump should be too disappointed with brooks or moore. Both are \" trumpian candidates, \" reports axios. Mcconnell has a huge interest in the race, though. He and his allies have invested millions in strange's campaign. Also key: brooks has said he wants mcconnell \" fired. \" not helping brooks, however, is a controversial campaign ad he aired that included audio from the shooting of steve scalise, reports nbc news. Strange is likewise plagued by his appointment by former gov. Robert bentley in what some suspect was \" a corrupt bargain to end the state's criminal investigation of bentley, \" the new republic previously reported. Reuters mentions the candidates'stances on issues like gay marriage and illegal immigration. The winner of the runoff election is likely to face one of two democrats in december: either former us attorney doug jones, backed by joe biden, or robert kennedy jr., a navy veteran with no relation to the famous kennedy family, per politico. Either way, the republican winner will be sitting pretty. Alabama hasn't elected a democrat to the senate since 1992, per the new york times. Polls close at 8pm edt.",

Parkland student david hogg has circulated a petition that urges pence to cancel the appearance, calling it a \" slap in the face \" to americans hurting from gun violence. A similar gun ban was in place when president trump spoke at the nra's convention in atlanta last year. The hill reports that white house officials have confirmed that trump also plans to speak at this year's convention, which is being held from thursday to sunday and will feature more than 20 acres of firearms exhibits, according to organizers.

Looking at 1,580 reports of people in 22 countries, including the us, who'd experienced these abnormal behaviors after taking meds between 2003 and 2012, they identified 710 cases that involve dopamine receptor agonists, drugs often used to treat parkinson's disease.

One of the writers says three of his patients have lost their homes because they went bankrupt after taking the drugs, reports npr. The link was strongest for pramipexole ( brand name mirapex ) and ropinirole ( requip ). Because people taking this type of drug were 277 times more likely to report these impulsive behaviors than those taking other drugs, the researchers are calling for black-box warnings — reserved for the most extreme cautions — detailing the risks involved.

Accompanied by a photographic team, she snapped shots of the dying bear last year while colleague paul nicklen shot video — all part of their \" mission to capture images that communicate the urgency of climate change, \" she writes. \" when paul posted the video on instagram, he wrote,'this is what starvation looks like. ' \" he also wondered if all 25,000 polar bears would die like this and urged people to reduce their carbon footprint. But he didn't say climate change had killed this bear. That nuance vanished when national geographic posted the video with the subtitles \" this is what climate change looks like \" and the washington post ran a dramatic headline about \" gut-wrenching \" images. People also responded dramatically, expressing gratitude for validation of climate science, anger the crew hadn't fed the bear, or a stubborn refusal to acknowledge global warming. \" perhaps we made a mistake in not telling the full story — that we were looking for a picture that foretold the future and that we didn't know what had happened to this particular polar bear, \" she writes. Yet a fast-warming arctic means bears will be stranded on land, unable to pursue prey, so the photo makes sense. The trick for next time? make sure \" our intentions are clear and the narrative remains our own. \"",

Before it was removed, one annotation said: \" my guess: his sister is smokin hot \" before the resignation, moghadam told valleywag: i was fascinated by the fact that a text was associated with such a heartbreaking crime, especially since elliot is talking about my neighborhood growing up i got carried away with making the annotations and making any comment about his sister was in horrible taste, thankfully the rap genius community edits out my poor judgement, i am very sorry for writing it re/code has the full statement from ceo and cofounder tom lehman. Moghadam, lehman, and a third cofounder, ilan zechory, were all classmates at yale university. They raised $ 16 million from andreessen horowitz, the storied silicon valley venture capital firm, to expand their website annotating hip hop lyrics into the \" internet talmud \" by crowd-sourcing explanations"

        "summary": "Senate republicans on thursday finally unveiled their answer to the house bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act, and vox has an explainer of what's in it. Some major sticking points: the better care reconciliation act will ask poor and middle-class americans to pay more for less coverage, and medicaid would be cut after expansions are rolled back. Medicaid patients would be unable to get treatment at planned parenthood, which would be defunded for a year. The bill also includes a tax break for the wealthy. Here's what else you need to know: first, politico has the full text of the 142-page document republicans are calling a \" discussion draft. \" three republican senators can defeat the bill by joining democrats to vote against it. Fivethirtyeight reports the most likely candidates are rand paul and mike lee ( who don't believe it goes far enough; paul recently said he doesn't want \" obamacare lite \" ) and susan collins and lisa murkowski ( who want more protections for medicaid and pre-existing conditions ). Abc news reports four republican senators have already said they won't vote for the bill without more information and negotiation: paul, lee, ron johnson, and ted cruz. They released a joint statement saying the bill doesn't do enough to repeal obamacare. The bill's writing was cloaked in such secrecy that the week reports as of thursday morning quite a few republican senators still had not seen it; murkowski, for example, told a reporter, \" i am not a reporter, and i am not a lobbyist, so i've seen nothing. \" president trump had called the house bill \" mean \" and in need of \" more heart. \" so scientific american takes a look to see if the senate version fulfills that requirement. When asked by a reporter if the senate bill had enough heart, trump called it \" very good \" but in need of \" a little negotiation, \" cnn reports. According to people, police dragged protesters — some of them in wheelchairs or wearing medical devices — away from mitch mcconnell's office and arrested them. The protesters, members of a national disability rights group, say people with disabilities are threatened by the bill. Finally, usa today reports senate democrats plan to fight the bill through procedural requests to slow down the process. They called for any changes to the house's bill to be made public for at least 72 hours and be subject to cbo analysis.",

But court documents note that once some of the recovered mail was shown to him, block said: \" looks like i ' m going to jail. \" he then admitted he'd fallen behind on his shifts and started taking undelivered mail home. One la porte resident tells wsbt 22 it was a \" crapshoot \" on whether he'd get his mail or not during the six-month period in question — late 2016 to the time of block's resignation in february 2017 — and that he finally just got a po box. A statement from a usps office of inspector general spokesman notes that \" the vast majority of us postal service personnel are... Hardworking public servants dedicated to moving mail to its proper destination who would never consider engaging in any form of criminal behavior. \" meanwhile, a la porte post office rep says they're trying to figure out which customers would have been affected, per wls.",

The eu requires airlines to reimburse travelers for delays depending on their length. A german woman's flight from austria to the caribbean was delayed 22 hours for mechanical issues, earning her a $ 680 payout. But four years later, thomas cook airlines still hadn't paid up. So the woman went to a claims company called flightright and took the airline to court. On friday, an official armed with a court order warned salzburg airport that thomas cook was about to have one of its jets impounded, affecting flights, unless it ponied up the woman's money. The $ 680 was immediately paid by condor, a thomas cook-affiliated airline. \" we are very sorry that it took this long, \" a condor spokesperson says. Flightright says airlines will sometimes drag their feet when paying out compensation in the hopes travelers will give up, but this was probably an honest mistake. \" the claim probably just got lost on somebody's desk, \" a flightright spokesperson says. The regulations behind this \" ultimate revenge \" exacted by the customer require that passengers be compensated when flights are three hours late or more, notes news.com.au.

Researchers at san diego state university report in the journal psychological science that when people want to portray themselves as powerful or authoritative, their voices go up in pitch, become more monotone, and exhibit more variation in loudness. What's more, listeners hear and identify these differences as powerful, reports medical news today. The researchers were inspired to study vocal volume and inflection because of the oft-told story of margaret thatcher's vocal coaching when she became prime minister of the uk, reports the association for psychological science. \" it was quite well known that thatcher had gone through extensive voice coaching to exude a more authoritative, powerful persona, \" one researcher says. \" amazingly, power affected our participants ' voices in almost the exact same way that thatcher's voice changed after her vocal training, \" another says.

Airasia, a regional low-cost carrier based in malaysia, said the missing airbus a320 was on its submitted flight plan route. However, it had requested permission to deviate because of weather. \" we don't dare to presume what has happened except that it has lost contact, \" said indonesia's acting director general of transportation. He said the last contact between the pilot and air traffic control was at 6: 13am local time when the pilot asked to go up to 34,000 feet, apparently to avoid stormy weather. It was last seen on radar at 6: 16am, and a minute later was no longer there, he said. Darkness has fallen in the region, reports the bbc, and the search has been called off for the night. It will resume in the morning. He said there was no distress signal from flight qz8501. The contact was lost about 42 minutes after the single-aisle jetliner took off from indonesia's surabaya airport. It still had about an hour to go before arriving in singapore. The plane had seven crew and 155 passengers, including 16 children and one infant, said the general manager of surabaya's juanda airport. There were six foreigners — three south koreans, including the infant, and one each from singapore, britain, and malaysia. The rest were indonesians.

In this case, the 47-year-old woman said that aside from mood issues she was healthy when she upped her fluids and use of herbal remedies, including milk thistle, molkosan, l-theanine, glutamine, vitamin b compound, vervain, sage tea, green tea, and valerian root. Doctors in september reported in the british medical journal case reports that she suffered from acute severe \" hyponatremia, \" which occurs when there is abnormally low sodium in one's blood. She had gone to the er after suffering a seizure. Most cases of hyponatremia occur after someone consumes a ton of water — more than 2.5 gallons in a day — but this woman's fluid intake wasn't that high. Then, a possible clue: doctors found a similar case of a man with the same condition who also hadn't hit that intake level but had ingested valerian root. The doctors note that two case studies are insufficient evidence, but suggest it's possible the root \" altered this threshold [ of fluid intake ], allowing severe hyponatremia to develop at an earlier stage. \" the british dietetic association tells the bbc that the whole notion of detoxing is without merit, as many of our organs ( even our skin ) regularly detoxify the body. It may sound less sexy, but they add that for most people \" a sensible diet and regular physical activity \" is best. ( experts are also rolling their eyes at the souping trend. )",

Shepherd and her ex, lamar sally, had the baby — conceived using sally's sperm and a donor egg — via a surrogate who delivered in august 2014, after the couple had separated. Sally is raising the boy. Shepherd, 48, has said that she and sally were already having marital problems when the baby was conceived, and she only agreed to the surrogacy because she was afraid sally would leave her if she didn't. \" i was scared to say,'that's not going to work for me. I don't want that, ' \" she told people in august. But in november, sally said shepherd \" lies \" and added, \" if she won't be there for lj emotionally, i ' ll be parent enough for the both of us. \" he says he's filming a reality show about the surrogacy drama, radar reports.

Political pundits have paid special attention to this swing state after its unique role in determining the winner of the 2000 election, and the story isn't any different this cycle. Polling and statistics site fivethirtyeight — which correctly predicted the entire electoral college map in 2012 — estimates florida is the most likely \" tipping point \" state for the 2016 election. Currently, hillary clinton holds a 1-point lead in florida. Florida's large allotment of 29 electoral votes means clinton could afford to lose several other states if she was able to hold on to florida. Trump, data shows, does not have that luxury. The businessman needs florida to put together any sort of plausible electoral win — at least according to current polls. Trump has made no secret that he doesn't trust the polls, and according to the ap, neither do his supporters. So at least in trump-land, there may be more paths to victory that don't include florida. But for now, experts say trump and his campaign should be spending a lot of time down south in the sun. Read fivethirtyeight's full post here.",

        "summary": "India has earned a reputation as a place that's dangerous for women and girls, underscored by the story of a 10-year-old rape victim now in the news for trying to get permission to get an abortion. Another shocking story from 2012 set off a series of protests across the country after a young woman was fatally gang-raped on a public bus, and — along with many other high-profile sexual assaults — has prompted countries like the us to caution women not to travel alone in india. Now the indian airline vistara has taken matters into its own hands, offering a free service called woman flyer, which it describes to bloomberg as a \" sincere effort to ensure peace of mind of our women customers. \" the free service, which launched in march, is used by between 75 and 100 women every day, according to vistara. Women who sign up for the service will get help with their bags, be guaranteed a window or aisle seat, and be escorted to a pickup point by airline staff, reports emirates woman. While this is thought to be the first airline anywhere to offer this kind of service, air india began providing female-only rows earlier this year in response to assaults in the air. In 2015, researchers in the uk noted that in places with gender equality, separating women \" reinforces a message that women must be contained and segregated in order to protect them, \" but many who are hailing vistara's new service says safety comes first. ( that 10-year-old mentioned earlier is being made to deliver her baby. )",

            "The timing was so perfect it felt like a comedy skit. Jason rudge, an editor with the weather channel, set up on monday to film the planned destruction of the georgia dome, the former home of the atlanta falcons and where two super bowls were once played. Atlanta now has a new, modern center for its sports: the $ 1.6 billion mercedes-benz stadium erected next door to the old dome. After finding what seemed like the perfect spot across the street from the stadium, he live-streamed the crowd gathering for the big moment for 40 minutes. The dome's destruction promised to be a powerful sight. The explosives wired inside would go off for 12 seconds. Three seconds after that, the entire entire 71,250-seat stadium would be on the ground as a pile of smoking rubble, according to the associated press. A man counted down to the implosion on a loud speaker to prepare the crowds. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. The moment finally arrived. A small explosion ripped through the dome's roof and began felling the 25-year-old stadium. Rudge filmed a puff of black smoke shooting out of the building, as a tiny bit of rubble cascaded down its side. That's when things when south for the weather channel.

            "The timing was so perfect it felt like a comedy skit. Jason rudge, an editor with the weather channel, set up on monday to film the planned destruction of the georgia dome, the former home of the atlanta falcons and where two super bowls were once played. Atlanta now has a new, modern center for its sports: the $ 1.6 billion mercedes-benz stadium erected next door to the old dome. After finding what seemed like the perfect spot across the street from the stadium, he live-streamed the crowd gathering for the big moment for 40 minutes. The dome's destruction promised to be a powerful sight. The explosives wired inside would go off for 12 seconds. Three seconds after that, the entire entire 71,250-seat stadium would be on the ground as a pile of smoking rubble, according to the associated press. A man counted down to the implosion on a loud speaker to prepare the crowds. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. The moment finally arrived. A small explosion ripped through the dome's roof and began felling the 25-year-old stadium. Rudge filmed a puff of black smoke shooting out of the building, as a tiny bit of rubble cascaded down its side. That's when things when south for the weather channel. A public bus glided in front of the camera, while a symphony of explosions filled the air. \"no bus, get out of the way, \" rudge shouted in an exasperated tone. \"bus! \" the bus did not acquiesce. Instead, it stopped right in front of the camera, blocking most of the view.

        "summary": "German police searched for a syrian terror suspect for almost two days — and found him sunday night tied up in another syrian national's apartment. Jaber albakr, 22, came to germany last year as an asylum seeker. After german officials got a tip from the country's intelligence service, they zeroed in on his apartment in chemnitz saturday morning. Albakr escaped, but authorities found several hundred grams of explosives and started a manhunt, nbc news reports. Albakr reportedly approached another syrian national at a train station sunday night and asked to stay overnight at the man's home. But the man recognized albakr from news of the manhunt and called police, who found the suspect tied up at the man's apartment and arrested him. The good samaritan told police that he, with the help of two flatmates, \" overpowered albakr and tied him up, \" an investigator says, per the local. Indeed, one of the flatmates was reportedly kneeling on albakr to keep him on the ground when police arrived. No less than chancellor angela merkel thanked the men who caught albakr via her spokesperson. Investigators say they found the same homemade explosives that were used in the paris and brussels attacks last year in albakr's apartment, and that they were \" almost ready, or even ready for usage. \" he is accused of working with isis, and his own flatmate, another syrian refugee, was also arrested as a suspected co-conspirator. Police are also questioning a third man.",

But an observant coral springs fire department lieutenant asked the teen an important question as they prepared to whisk her away, and it was one that ended up saving her life. Per cnn, maddy was in such bad shape when she was brought to lt. Laz ojeda and his rescue team that they initially thought she'd already died. \" signs of life, \" however, soon emerged, and after a broward county sheriff's office swat team member sealed up a chest wound, they readied her to go to a children's hospital 30 miles away, where they'd been instructed to take the 15-year-old. Except ojeda wasn't convinced she was only 15. And so, as ojeda tearfully relayed at a monday presser, he asked the girl twice how old she was; she finally answered she was 17. Based on that info, ojeda, who thought she'd die before they got her to the children's facility, made the call to take her to a hospital just 10 miles from marjory stoneman douglas high school. There, operating surgeon dr. Igor nichiporenko quickly did \" damage control \" on the badly injured teen, who'd been shot in the abdomen, chest, and upper sternum, with tendons \" shattered from gunshot wounds. \" astonishingly, wilford was out of the hospital in less than a week. \" young people have a tendency to heal very fast, \" nichiporenko says, per the new york times. \" she's very, very lucky. \" he adds that ojeda's decision saved maddy's life. Ojeda is just glad he was there to make the call. \" i thank god for allowing us to be an instrument in this miracle, \" he told cnn tuesday. As for maddy? \" i ' m so grateful to be here, \" she said at the news conference, per cnn.",

Lrg, which the designer founded when he was barely out of his teens, branched out from clothing into music and other items, which supported up-and-coming recording artists. Bevacqua, who grew up in a multi-racial california family, said he founded lrg because no other company was creating clothing that reflected his and co-founder robert wright's interest in surfing, skateboarding, and hip-hop. \" i grew up in a pretty unique environment and was exposed to a lot of different things, \" bevacqua told the orange county register in 2009. \" i didn't feel there was a clothing company to bridge the gap among all these different things that we were into — that spoke for that melting pot of what was going on.

According to the ap, the quaids were detained by us customs and border protection agents because they're still wanted on felony charges from 2010 in california. The couple had been hiding up north since then, but the canadian government recently gave them until next wednesday to get out of the country. This isn't randy's first arrest this week. He was detained last tuesday by canadian officials, who thought he might try to flee rather than leave canada, the cbc reports. The quaids first fled to canada in 2010 after being accused of vandalizing and squatting in the guesthouse of a home they once owned in california, the ap reports. They also claimed they were being targeted by the \" hollywood star-whackers, \" who they say killed their friends david carradine and heath ledger. According to the cbc, randy was denied permanent resident status in canada in 2013 because of the california charges. Following his detention last tuesday, he told the ap he was finally ready to return to the us to settle the vandalism charges and move on with his life.

        "summary": "Angry streaming customers in chicago are fighting back against the so-called \" netflix tax, \" filing a lawsuit against the city last wednesday that could have national implications, the daily dot reports. The plaintiffs — including netflix, hulu, and spotify customers — allege the 9 % tax on streaming services ( an extension of chicago's amusement tax ) announced in june violates the internet tax freedom act, which outlaws discrimination against internet businesses. According to fortune, the lawsuit claims streaming customers now face a higher tax rate than if they were watching a dvd, going to the theater, or attending a concert. If the suit succeeds, it could hamper local governments ' ability to tax internet services at a time when increased online commerce is shrinking tax revenues around the country. The lawsuit also alleges the streaming tax is essentially a new one, not an extension of the amusement tax as chicago's city comptroller claimed. New taxes, unlike changes to existing taxes, require a vote of city officials. \" if the city wants to tax internet-based streaming media services, then it should put the measure through the political process and let chicagoans have their voices heard through the democratic process, \" an attorney for the plaintiffs says in a press release. The chicago tribune reports the city has vowed to fight the lawsuit. The \" netflix tax, \" part of mayor rahm emanuel's plan to make up the city's budget gap through new fees, is set to go into effect in january.",

The metropolitan museum of art says it will not take down the 1938 painting \" thérèse dreaming \" by the french artist balthus, though 7,000 people have asked that it do so via the petition site care2. The petition started by mia merrill describes the work as \" an evocative portrait of a prepubescent girl relaxing on a chair with her legs up and underwear exposed, \" and calls it \" disturbing \" that the museum would knowingly display such a sexualized image in our \" current climate. \" as for the knowingly part, she notes that the met paired a 2013 exhibit of balthus ' work with a sign explaining some of the pieces could be \" disturbing \" to viewers. A 2013 guardian article indicates \" thérèse dreaming \" was part of that exhibit. Merrill writes that \" if the met had the wherewithal to reference the disturbing nature of balthus, they understand the implications of displaying his art. \" the new york post reports the museum on sunday said the painting would remain hanging, with a rep saying, \" moments such as this provide an opportunity for conversation. \" the museum's description of the piece notes that thérèse blanchard, balthus ' neighbor in paris, was 12 or 13 when she was painted. The paris review reports the late balthus was asked about the \" provocative poses \" he painted young girls in, and replied, \" it is how they sit. \" in his review of the 2013 exhibition for the new yorker, peter schjeldahl had this to say: \" i kept thinking of a line by oscar wilde: ' a bad man is the sort of man who admires innocence.

Now another california couple, bekah and danny bowman of orange county, have learned that not just their 5-year-old son titus but also their 2-year-old son ely have the disease, reports people. \" the amount of publicity from the grays has been a silver lining in the midst of tragedy, \" says bekah, noting that they decided to share their story after watching the grays, who are trying to raise $ 10 million to $ 12 million in a race to help find a cure, go public with their own struggle. Worries about speech and mobility issues and seizures led to titus'diagnosis in april. Because the disease is genetic, there was a 25 % chance his little brother would have it. Ely took a test in june, and the family's worst fears were confirmed. Both boys have late-infantile cln2 and will face dramatic declines before dying young. Titus is already suffering the effects. \" when we got the diagnosis, [ titus ] was still talking, walking and eating, \" bekah says. \" within a month... He lost all of those abilities. He's blind, he cannot walk anymore, he's in a wheelchair, he's eating through a gj tube and he doesn't talk anymore. \" still, the bowmans are finding a way to be thankful for every day they have with their boys. Bekah had this to say in an april blog post: \" this week i've become broken. More broken than i knew i could be. So broken that i can't fix it and i ' m overcome by it. But... Out of the broken comes love. An authentic, new eye-opening kind of love. \" a gofundme campaign has been started for the family. ( this rare disease could turn this boy into a mannequin. )",
